Niche User,5,"Amazing, the school accommodated very well to the given circumstances of covid19. i really enjoyed how the school approached online vs in person courses."
Niche User,5,"Amazing, loved it. the atmosphere is amazing. best dorms ever! highly recommend. A little expensive but it pays off. Amazing value."
Sophomore,5,"Professors and administration did a great job when we were forced to go online to complete our Spring 2020 semester.

I am grateful that HPU invested money and monumental to enable us to return to full in-person classes in the Fall of 2020."
Sophomore,5,I am a Biology major in the honors college program at HPU.  The curriculum is rigorous and the professors are top-notch.  The beautiful campus and amazing food is an added bonus!
Senior,5,I've truly experienced and matured a lot during my 4 years here and I will always be grateful to High Point for that.
Senior,5,I took online classes during the start of the pandemic. High Point and the professors were extremely diligent to create a smooth transition into online learning and they did exactly that!
Senior,5,"I absolutely love going to this campus. Not only is the campus absolutely beautiful, but our President can be seen around campus."
Graduate Student,5,My professors were really supportive during the transition. The school was very activeincomunicatinf with us.
Niche User,5,During COVID-19 pandemic the transition to e-learning was seamless.  Professors engaged our student and created a dynamic experience.
Niche User,5,"High Point University has exceeded every expectation.  They raise the bar for full circle development of the individual, incorporating life skills education and exposure from the very first campus tour.  I encourage an IN PERSON experience of this institution in order to see why it is head and shoulders above the rest.

On a specific note, the manner in which HPU leadership showed sincere care and compassion for each student as well as their faculty/staff and surrounding community testifies to the decency and moral compass that is the foundation of this school.  Their outreach and support especially during the COVID-19 pandemic was unscripted, unselfish, and unrestricted.  They engaged the student remotely--through videos of students favorite walks on campus, cooking classes online by their top campus chefs, updates on PPE supplies locally, regular heart-felt video messages from President Qubein--and created every way for the student to stay connected to their ""Home Away from Home."""
Sophomore,5,"The online experience at HPU was an adjustment for everyone, although all of the professors that I had were very organized, flexible, and patient. Some classes were in video format, while some were led by written instructions. Regardless, both clearly laid out the directions and expectations for students."
Sophomore,5,The professors are amazing and the dorms incredible. This was my first semester there and I loved it
Sophomore,5,I have not done an online class with them yet.  I look forward to possibly taking one and see how they do
Freshman,5,"This University is the best thing that's ever come into my life. I have been very blessed to attend this college and work with the trained professionals assisting me to educate myself for my career. The buildings and campus overall are STUNNING.

Freshman,5,"High Point University is a beautiful and academically rigorous college located in North Carolina. My family went for a tour last weekend, and the tour guide was amazing. We got so much information on the university including its programs, clubs, and the outside environment. They also shuttled us around on long golf cart-like vehicles. It was overall an amazing experience. I have heard nothing but good things."

Freshman,5,I love High Point University. Walking on campus the first time made me fall in love. But I also admire all the professors that work there who are willing to help the students when need. There are also countless resources to ensure success at the school.
Sophomore,5,"High Point University supplies students with only the best professors and strives to create the most professional environment possible to learn in. Professors are extremely engaging with their students and teach rigorous courses that are designed to place you in real situations. Student life here is also really good. However, like ANY college, you have to put in just a little effort to make friends that last a lifetime. You definitely will not leave HPU without receiving a great education and gaining key connections too!"
Niche User,5,"High Point University is a life-skills university. I chose High Point University to attend after graduating high school because the professors are top-notch and environment is caring. Students have to the chance to engage in undergraduate research in their Freshman year. Overall, it is a beautiful campus."
Niche User,5,I love the campus! Everything there is so beautiful and it all has a purpose for learning. It would be wonderful to attend!
Sophomore,5,"I love attending High Point University. This university has truly given me all of the tools I need to be successful in my future career path. However, the one minor detail that the university can improve on is making more housing available for upperclassmen that does not cost extra on top of tuition. Overall, I am confident that High Point University was the right choice for me, and I cannot wait to see how it will help me to excel in the future!"
Junior,5,"As nontraditional transfer student, I can't express how much appreciation and gratitude I have for HPU's support for its students. I'm a junior and have yet to experience any negativity from faculty or staff. Everyone is encouraging and has gone above and beyond to make sure I'm aware of the resources and networking opportunities I have at the tips of my fingers."
Freshman,5,"High Point University is a wonderful school for academics, learning how to be a leader, and creating a successful life for yourself."
Niche User,5,"I am verbally committed to High Point University to play lacrosse and I am so pumped. I have visited  the campus many times, when there was no one on campus, a busy school day and also what summer days look like on High Point University's campus. Overtime I had visited I fall more in love with the school. The people I have talked to are very nice, welcoming, and are just so happy with their decision to attend High Point University. Also the faculty members are so proud to say that they have the opportunity to work at such an amazing school."
Alum,5,"As a past student of High Point University, both graduate and undergraduate, I can confidently say that High Point University set me up for an incredibly successful future. The hands on approach to learning, caring and passionate professors and academic/non-academic clubs and organizations allow each student to find their passions and explore them. HPU's environment is inspiring and provided me with a home-away from home feel and friends that have turned into family."
Niche User,5,High point University looks to be a great college I toured the school twice and the atmosphere is very good and I like it
Junior,5,"It is truly an extraordinary college, caring people help you every step of the way to make sure you leave college ready to succeed in the real world."
Sophomore,5,"I love the environment at HPU everyone is so positive and wants you to be successful. The campus is beautiful and the food and dorms are great, you never need to leave campus for what you need. High Point University is my home away from home and I am already ready to go back this August."
Alum,5,"What I most loved about High Point University was the focus on students as individuals rather than numbers. It's a smaller university, which many times means fewer opportunities, but at HPU this meant more individual attention from professors who in turn shared research and career-oriented opportunities with their students.

""At High Point University, every student receives an extraordinary education in an inspiring environment with caring people."" HPU accomplishes all of these. My education gave me a leg up on other students just from the number of opportunities I was given. The campus is gorgeous: walking on the promenade is enough to unwind and de-stress. And the people truly care.

Campus enhancement because not only makes campus look beautiful and clean, they also enhance it with their presence. You can walk up to any staff or faculty member, and they will chat with you about anything. I have so many ""moms"" who have taken care of me."
Graduate Student,5,"Very kind and welcoming community. From professors to security guards, everyone is so nice and helpful and willing to do whatever to make sure you have everything you need."
Freshman,5,I really love this university. Its foundation and beliefs are exactly what I wanted in a college. It is a small -medium size school where the professors really get to know you and you feel like you have a family in the High Point community.
Niche User,5,"The campus was amazing, with beautiful buildings and welcoming students. The classes are hands on and the professors help you reach your goals!"
Niche User,5,Our daughter attends HPU for their 3+2 Athletic Training major.  She was offered similar programs at other colleges but when visiting she had a one on one meeting with the dean of her department and felt she had found her home.  She has been thrilled with her decision since.
Freshman,5,"By the looks of it,It would be a great college.High point University will help me get where I need to go in order to succed in life.At high point university I am given the chance to meet many cool people and recive help from them as well.High point university would be a great college for anyone."
Freshman,5,"Amazing school with wonderful resources. Couldn't be happier that i picked such a wonderful university to learn and grow, social life is great but not in your face. Teachers are amazing and will help if you ask, sports are all good. And theres plenty of clubs, frats, sororities, or social spaces to find yourself in."
Freshman,5,I love High Point University. I love the Diversity and I love the fact that the class sizes are small which gives  me an opportunity to have a one on one learning session with my professors.
Niche User,5,"I have visited High Point University multiple times, each time the experience was extraordinary. Not only is the campus beautiful, but the education is excellent. I was able to get help while applying, and the admissions counselors were very friendly during the process. When I sat in on a class, all the students were paying attention and the professor was proficient."
Niche User,5,High point offers extraordinary life and education opportunities for everyone that enters their campus by tending to each student.
Junior,5,"Overall, my experience at High Point University has been extraordinary. The school was a perfect fit for me and I have loved every single minute I have been on campus. The balance of academics, athletics, the arts, and extracurricular activities has been fantastic, and I feel as if I have really gotten to explore and find myself in all of these areas. I love the continued challenges and growth that I find here at HPU and I look forward to continuing that in the future."
Sophomore,5,"Almost all of my professors during both semesters have went the extra step to help me be successsful in my classes. The academics have been somewhat challenging and have helped me realize the level of work and studying it takes to be successful in college. The campus life is very welcoming and offers many opportunities to get involved. Joining clubs and sports helped to make friends. The food is also very good and there’s enough options across campus so I never got tired of it. Besides classes, sports and clubs the party scene is good and a fun way to spend times with friends on the weekends."
Freshman,5,"Very beautiful, kinda makes you want to learn and be a better person. The environment is so peaceful and studious it's hard to slack off because everyone as is on their A game. Over all it's a great school great people a great place to be for 4 years"
Senior,5,"So many opportunities available, the professors care, the campus is BEAUTIFUL.  I love being a student here. Have made life long relationships with so many people. I just wish the school was more diverse but it has improved since I came as a freshman."
Sophomore,5,"love hpu! my love for it continues to grow with each and everyday. love the food, dorms, staff. i have a feeling of belonging on campus and there are so many ways to get involved."
Freshman,5,"My freshman year was absolutely amazing. I met some of the most amazing friends thanks to living in the women’s complex. People have lots of money, but I have yet to come across someone who brags about it. Professors and staff really care about their students. Parties aren’t crazy but are definitely fun if you go with the right people. Although there isn’t much to do outside the bubble, everything you basically need is right on campus."
Junior,4,"Overall, my experience so far at HPU has been very positive. I have met many wonderful people. My favorite thing about the university is the committed professors and staff. They are all willing to help every student succeed, as long as the student is willing to put in the work. My only issue is the lack of diversity, but I believe the university is active in improving this."
Junior,4,"The only classes I took online were during the COVID pandemic. That being said, the turn around time for my professors to get acclimated to online training was very quick. Thanks to their training, it was very easy to have ""normal"" class. However, online classes were still stressful because of the overall set-up."
Junior,4,"Unfortunately, during the pandemic, I had to convert to online classes. At first, this was a massive struggle for me due to being a science major, and in one of my most challenging years. I had to learn organic chemistry and anatomy online. This was incredibly difficult because I couldn't talk to my professors daily. But after one week everything started to feel normal. I adapted quickly. My professors were extremely kind and understanding, and they would make time on the weekends so that every student could be on the same page even if you were struggling. This was my best semester that I had, and I ended up with a 3.48. I missed Dean's list by a hair, but I'm still going to count it anyway. These professors are willing to go above and beyond in and out of the classroom."
Junior,4,"I think that High Point is a great community. Is it perfect? No, some things that I would change about high points campus is how clicky the rich are. On-campus we have families called V.I.F. (very important family).  V.I.F.'s are people that donate to the University; unfortunately, I know that this is a common theme amongst universities and in life in general. Money talks. I feel that the University is excellent in preparing us for life exposure in which we will have to deal with specific tasks in daily situations. I think the University is excellent at preparing us for life exposure in which we will have to deal with particular tasks in a day-to-day situation. I'm heavily involved on campus. I work on campus as a University ambassador; I give tours to incoming families who want to attend the University. I get to see High Point from many angles, which helps keep me grounded on what is realistic in the world and what is fantasy."
Graduate Student,4,High Point is focused on a well-rounded education. In my time at High Point a lot of the focus was on the skills you can learn outside the classroom. All the professors I had cared a lot for my education and were very supportive.
Sophomore,4,"Beautiful campus but not in the best area! Faculty is wonderful and with the school being so small, you see a lot of people you know walking around campus."
Sophomore,4,"I have met the most kind people in my first year at HPU. This university is exceptionally friendly from the students, staff, and professors. It is a place where small acts of kindness matter. At HPU doors are held open for the person behind you, students are happy and sociable, and it is the best place to foster growth as a college student. 
Like all schools there’s drawbacks, like the location for HPU and, for me, the size. Although, these factors are truly outweighed by the friendly, clean, and caring environment in which HPU has made.
In terms of the staff, I have yet to meet anyone that has shown hostility or a lack of accommodations. As someone with many food allergies, the kitchen staff is unmatched with their dedication. There’s not only many places to eat on campus, but they will help you find/make food for people with food limitations. This is something not many other colleges offer for their students, and just one example of what makes HPU so unique and well run."
Sophomore,4,"I love how this school makes me feel very independent while also receiving extra information that will develop me into a better person socially, professionally, and academically. The campus is beautiful and there are always spots you can find around campus to study. The community is very engaging and the school encourages students to get involved more with activities and service events. The only thing that I would want for High Point University to change is giving other departments more attention and chances for development and growth as it seems like the university is more biased towards the more popular and more focused departments such as science and business and giving less attention and budgeting towards the smaller majors. I believe that the school should be more equal and fair in terms of each department’s budget and chances of change and maintenance of buildings."
Sophomore,4,High Point is an encouraging community that gives opportunities to advance students' education and career.  Students are given many opportunities including a guaranteed internship.
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my time at High Point University very much. As a whole, HPU is very accommodating to it's students whether it has to do with academics, finding internship opportunities, or adjusting campus living situations based on the needs of certain individuals. The quality of education offered at High Point is top notch. Personally, I have greatly benefitted from the small class sizes the University offers. It is easy to get in contact with your professors when seeking clarification or extra help. Nearly all professors have generous walk-in office hours, and by the end of the semester I found that I have built professional relationships with almost all of my instructors because of this. The on campus dining selection is unreal. There is almost too much to chose from. A handful of the restaurants on campus are even open until the wee-hours of the morning for students who are up late at night studying."
Junior,4,"High Point University is a great place to be, you can see as you walk in the front gates that you are in a great environment that will inspire hard work and excellence. The few drawbacks that High Point does have include often caring too much about new students and therefore has a falling retention rate."
Graduate Student,4,"High Point University has an extremely beautiful campus and is very student friendly. The campus is so peaceful and I often find myself just walking around take in the scenery. In my time at HPU, I have never had a bad experience. I feel welcome every time I step on campus and I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at HPU. Everyone on campus is always friendly and always willing to lend a helping hand."
Sophomore,4,"Overall I had a great first year at High Point. With my second year quickly approaching, I find that this schools tuition is simply too expensive for someone like me who comes from a rural community with parents working minimum wage jobs. I will have to transfer if I can not afford it any longer."
Sophomore,4,"Overall it is a great community. I wish the student body was more involved in supporting athletics. We have a lot of magic meal options, I wish we had more regular food options beyond the cafe and market. The professors are great and personable. They are knowledgeable and willing to help."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love High Point University. There are so many great opportunities to get involved in activities and groups around campus. My experiences with my professors have been great. At HPU, you really have the opportunity to make connections with the faculty and staff which makes your time at HPU even better."
Freshman,4,Great opportunities to get involved. Amazing greek scene and athletics for all. Very easy for transition from high school to college life.
Freshman,4,My favorite part about High Point University is the diversity you see around campus. Another one of my favorite parts is the staff. Everyone is very friendly and it is very easy to say that I can call this place home.
Freshman,4,I like how you can have a personal conversation about grades with your teachers and have a small class environment.
Junior,4,I enjoy the community I have found at High Point and the support I have from my professors and mentors.
Junior,4,All of the faculty and staff of High Point University are kind and welcoming and willing to help any and all students with whatever they need.
Sophomore,4,"Great university, excellent professors, likely will have a job lined up when I graduate because of the career services. Lacks diversity and a meh party scene Parties are mostly done thru the frats, where its a pain to get into if your a guy."
Senior,4,HPU's campus is gorgeous with many different amenities to choose from. The class size is smaller and the campus is easy to navigate. Professors care about you and know your name. The administration can use improvements and they care more about running a business than the students but overall this school is great.
Senior,4,"School is absolutely beautiful, looks like something out of a dream. However the students are awful, a bunch of trust fund babies who compete for who can spend daddies money the best. The teachers are amazing and the academic aspect of the university is incredible."
Sophomore,4,"I came down here from New Jersey to attend HPU. I was drawn in by their 3+2 Athletic Training Program as it was one of the very few in the country. I love what I'm learning, I love my campus, I love North Carolina."
Sophomore,4,My first year at High Point University was great- many ways to get involved and a lot of activities to do on campus.
Alum,4,Beautiful albeit expensive university. Regret not taking advantage of great career services department
Sophomore,4,"The campus is one of the most beautiful, not only in North Carolina but in the South and everybody is there to help you out when and wherever you need it."
Sophomore,4,"The professors are very professional and helpful; they genuinely want you to understand the course material and are willing to give help outside of class to help you learn.  The campus is beautiful, security gets an A+ (I always walked around the campus around 2am and never felt unsafe), and there are plenty of things to do.  There are also a lot of activities to do on campus; a lot of sponsored events, a movie theatre, etc.  The environment is not always welcoming, which is one thing I'd like to change.  A lot of the students at High Point I found to be a little stuck-up, but that doesn't mean there aren't other students who are not.  If you look hard enough you'll find a great set of friends who are sweet and down to Earth."
Junior,4,I like the welcome received from administration and staff during my campus visits. I love the campus.  It is very beautiful and well maintained.
Freshman,4,I love how involved the President is in his university. For everything they have on campus they have a reason they do it on campus. For example classical music plays alone the sidewalks because it stimulates brain activity.
Junior,4,"A very fun school with lots to offer. Facilities are incredible, and the faculty truely care about your success."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed my time at High Point University. The campus is by far one of the nicest campuses in the country, and the amenities are outstanding. The class size is small which gives you an opportunity to have a closer relationship with your professors. The only thing I didn't like was that besides the university, the city of High Point does not have much to offer."
Freshman,4,"This is a great school, but it is not for everyone. Lots of new money kids that like to show off their wealth."
Niche User,4,"It is like exploring Disney World with all the things to do, the environment, landscaping, and music that plays while you walk around from class to class."
Sophomore,4,"I'm a graduating sophomore at High Point and I want ti give an honest review of this school.  HPU isn't your traditional college experience as I have seen two older siblings go through different colleges already. It is difficult to adjust to for many people for a few reasons. One, security is more strict than most people would like. Also, the people are very preppy generally, but there's no pressure to change yourself to fit in. Lastly, not many people attend the sporting events. I enjoy them, but it never gets very rowdy.  It may take a couple semesters or even a couple years, but once you get involved on campus and meet a bunch of people, it's a very rewarding school to attend. Depending on your major, classes are generally fairly easy (especially business). You can get a strong sense of community especially on nice days when everyone is hanging out by the pools. Like I said, the attendance of sporting events is pretty love, but intramural sports are HUGE."
Junior,4,"I really love this school. It has its flaws, like too much politics and not a very diverse student body, but I've had some incredible professors and some incredible opportunities that I wouldn't trade for the world."
Sophomore,4,"High Point is definitely a unique place. There are an abundance of resources to take advantage of, and the majority of professors here are incredible."
Senior,4,"It is a great school. But it is really expensive. The professors are great as long as you get to know them. The student body isn't diverse. There are many white faces and a few brown faces The party scene is a bore because there are a few local bars and no clubs. If you aren't involved in sports or clubs it's difficult to make friends. Housing freshmen year is nice because you live on campus. You can have a car freshmen year. Getting the housing you want after freshmen year is difficult because priority is giving to upper classmen. Campus is really safe as long as you don't leave the ""bubble"". There are trolleys to use to get to main campus and off campus housing. All of the staff and professors are friendly."
Sophomore,4,"High Point University is filled with breathtaking views and scenery. It's gardens bring color to the campus. All day classical music is played, which is soothing and good for the brain."
Freshman,4,"If you're looking at HPU, i would definitely visit, by seeing a campus you're able to better decide if its for you. I think reading reviews to determine a school isn't going to help you, especially the negative ones. HPU has been a great fit for me so far, if you have any troubles someone is there to accommodate you. and i mean for EVERYTHING. from moving dorm rooms, to fixing your resume, to finding someone to cry to when you're home sick."
Freshman,4,"High Point University is an amazing university.  Its not the beautiful campus, the impeccable dorms or the 14+ eateries.  Its the rigorous academics.  You have to be willing to put in the work.  Professors are always available to help a student. "
College Junior,4,All of my professors were extremely qualified. Classes are small which is nice.
College Junior,4,All my professors really cared about me as an individual. They are also for the most part extremely qualified.
College Sophomore,4,The off campus bars are fun on thursday nights and there is always something to do on the weekends
College Sophomore,4,Greek life runs High Point so must of the social events are through that. GDI's have parties sometimes too but there kinda wack
College Senior,4,some professors and advisors don't care as much as others
College Senior,4,need more alumni to speak to students
College Senior,4,Great for meeting new people
College Senior,4,"a lot of people transfer, you have to try hard to make the best of it"
College Sophomore,4,"I like the newness of the campus, but it has little tradition and costs too much."
College Sophomore,4,I've loved how engaged the faculty tries to get the students--today I presented at a summer research presentation at my university.
College Senior,4,"Student Life housing sucks. They are such a hassle to work with. Contrary, the housing options are all great and easily accessible to main campus."
College Freshman,4,Don't do drugs or drink!
College Freshman,4,Be safe! Have a friend to walk with.
College Freshman,4,Would have liked a single room.
College Freshman,4,Go Greeks!  Go sisters of Phi Mu!
College Freshman,4,It's great!  It's purple!
Recent Alumnus,4,"HPU is just like many colleges, in that not everything can be controlled or limited. HPU does not have drug/alcohol problems although there are students who participate. 

Students are largely respectful of those who do not wish to partake in drugs/alcohol"
Recent Alumnus,4,"About 35% of students are involved in Greek Life on campus. The Greek organizations housing is great, their campus involvement is fantastic and the relationships between Greeks and non-Greeks is strong and positive."
College Junior,4,"Right from the first year til your fourth, the career  center is there to guide you through the interviewing process, the resume writing, the job search.  There are tons of internships available to us across the United States."
Junior,2,"Horrid online experience.  Professors literally ""phoned it in"".  We may have well just watched Youtube videos or gotten a free public library card.  Actually, I would have learned more had I just gotten the library card and read a bunch of books."
Niche User,2,"HPU's  focus is on flash and cash, not on quality education.  The education offered is no better than that of my local community college.  When you go to HPU, you are buying a bubble experience where you are not taught how to think.  You are buying manicured lawns & nice dorm rooms.  A lot of people call it the Disneyworld of Colleges.  My folks call it the Trump Taj Mahal casino because it borders on ridiculous.  HPU does not prepare you for the real world. The students here are so bubble wrapped and the professors give inflated grades to everyone. Another issue is the drug problem on and off campus.  HPU looks the other way, unless they find a way to get a fine out of you.  I'm transferring to a large state school that is half the tuition (even though I am out of state) and a much, much better education."
Graduate Student,2,didnt learn anything and half the staff didnt know how to work online. if you wanted a gpa boost keep the classes online
Niche User,2,"There is a culture of cover up at this school.  They do a great job of marketing the facilities but in our family's experience, the professors and the resources at the University are sub par.   If you try and transfer to another college, not all of your credits will transfer because some of the classes are not worthy of credit at other institutions.  Money talks at HPU.  You can buy your way into better housing by donating to the school.  Drugs are rampant and easily accessible.  There is an extreme sense of entitlement in many of the students.  The President is a master at offering benefits that many parents find appealing for the safety and well-being of their children but in the end, the students are spoiled and do not learn to become independent and contributing members of society."
Alum,2,"Academics are pretty good and worth the education. Would not change my time at the university with the friends I made and the people I met. Would not recommend this school. All for show and attraction. A lot of smoke and mirrors. The schools administration with in Student Life are terrible to deal with, do not look out for the best interest of your child, and the school uses excessive fines as a means of punishment. Security will look for reasons to get you or your children in trouble and assess fines."
Freshman,2,"offered way to much than they really did, beautiful campus but if you don't fit in with the crowd you will not like the school."
Niche User,2,"With an acceptance rate of 72% you don't really expect your classmates to be geniuses, and they aren't.  Granted, there are more women at HPU than men, so that helps a bit, especially since a lot of the guys are here because their parents wanted them somewhere safe, and with an attractive campus.  In some ways it reminds me of a sketch on SNL years ago, where the premise was ""come to our college, you can travel the world for four years, and we'll tell your parents you're still in school.""  HPU puts up a big front-- but it has a long, long way to go before it is a good school.  Maybe that's why only 65% graduate; the other 35% decide to go elsewhere; or work on their golf game.
  Oh, if this matters to you, it is almost all white.  Less than 6% minority.  Just like the country club."
Freshman,2,"Many people are not genuine and if you aren’t rich, you will have some problem. Wanted to transfer after first semester and now I’m transferring after second semester. It’s not worth the money you pay. You pay for the campus, not the experience"
Sophomore,2,"The school itself is beautiful and I try to love it but the people here honestly have ruined my whole college experience. Everyone is rich stuck up kids. People who don't carry designer handbags as backpacks to class get judged. Everyone talks about others behind each others backs. Greek life runs campus but it's not that great. The only thing to do on weekends is get blacked out and you want to get blacked out because if you don't you realize how horrible of a time you actually are having. Guys take advantage of girls a lot and only seem to want hook ups. Everyone has an attitude that they are better than everyone else. Honestly, very disappointed I ended up coming to college here I feel like I'm missing out on so much of a real college experience. Lots of people end up transferring."
College Junior,2,Good parties are few and far in between. Most of them are at frat houses and they're usually lame.
College Junior,2,"Not many opportunities to get a job off campus, and there are not that many available on campus."
College Junior,2,"Nobody really cares about the sports teams because they're all average. The basketball games are the only games that students regularly attend, and even those aren't that special."
College Junior,2,The students are preppy and for the most part extremely stuck up.
College Freshman,2,"While the housing itself is very high quality, the whole system is biased. My school offers dorms on different levels called tiers, so tier one is just your basic housing, tier two you get a bigger room or your own room depending on where you live, tier three is your own room and is even bigger, and then tier four is obviously the biggest and the best rooms. However for every tier you move up it costs extra money, and a lot of it. Moving up to tier two would cost me about an extra $3000 a year. As someone who is not trying to pay off student loans my whole life I am choosing to stay tier one. The worst part is for sophomore there is no available housing on the main campus for tier 1 students, forcing me to move into dorm down the street from main campus. While technically I will still be living ""on campus"" I will either have to drive or take a trolley to the main campus for all my classes, most of the food options, the library and its a hassle. My only tier 1 option on campus would be to move into a freshman dorm and live with freshman, which obviously I don't want to do. The whole process of actually selecting my dorm for next year was frustrating beyond belief. The actually signing up for my dorm too was also stressful and difficult because of the way some people get priority housing and get to choose before everyone else so you have to wait and pray that the place you want to live hasn't already been filled. Most of my friends and old roommates could not get into the dorm they wanted."
College Freshman,2,Not much diversity on campus which creates many minorities to form different cliques and isolate themselves. Or they have two different group of friends; one with different races and one with all the same race
College Sophomore,2,89% caucasian speaks for itself. It sucks being one of the few Blacks.
College Sophomore,2,First time seeing so many drugs in one place.
College Freshman,2,"Not very diverse when it comes to socio-economic backgrounds, I feel like an outsider for coming from a poor family. Most political beliefs are very conservative. Most people are deeply religious. Not a whole lot of open mindedness. A lot of bio majors here don't even believe in evolution."
College Freshman,2,People here love their cocaine and alcohol.
College Sophomore,2,"I do not like the school. I think it is overpriced, not enough student diversity, the academics are not challenging, the campus is very small and it is in a very bad location that makes it difficult to go anywhere if you do not have a vehicle. The positives are that the campus is beautiful and the dorms are larger and nicer than most schools and HPU has multiple pools."
College Freshman,2,High Point is not the greatest or safest of towns so most people chose to live within the gates of campus.
College Freshman,2,"I received a Presidential Scholarship which was great but it was not enough. I tried to go into the financial aid office on many occasions and spoke to multiple different people and it was horrible. They were all disrespectful, rude, and made it seem like I was a bother to them just by being in their presence. I experienced this twice by myself and then when my dad came to visit he experienced it as well."
College Freshman,2,"Impossible without a car, but dominoes delivers."
College Freshman,2,"Because the surrounding area of High Point University is of lower socioeconomic status, the local atmosphere is lacking because there is not much for students to do off campus"
College Junior,2,"I personally haven't lived off campus, but i have heard horror stories from other people. Most of everyone who really enjoys their housing section lives on campus, to live off campus you're really ostracized from the university and most people try and transfer back on campus or transfer."
College Freshman,2,I am transferring because this school is not all it is cracked up to be.
College Freshman,2,It is not a great area and doesn't have many options
College Freshman,2,everyone lives on campus or in campus owned housing
College Freshman,2,"Its a very poor area, and it is sort of scary to go off campus"
College Sophomore,2,This school doesn't have any school spirit and a lot of students here tend to wish we had a lot more
College Sophomore,2,high point the town is a poor area and do not go walking around anywhere off campus by yourself or even ever
College Freshman,2,I have feared for my safety or that of a friend
College Freshman,2,It's not adequate. I've done a lot to deserve more
College Junior,2,"As a science major, I'm baffled at the lack of technology. We just got new chemistry professors to help renovate the department but it's still mediocre. We're missing essential equipment.. HPU is too cheap to buy test tube racks for goodness sake! If you're a science major, reconsider your options because it's nothing that HPU hypes it up to be. They exclude Congdon (the science building) from the tours for a reason.. it's outdated and has cockroaches. Swear to God. So ready to transfer."
College Junior,2,I got half of my financial aid taken from me because they want to tax my scholarship.
College Junior,2,There is no school spirit and no one pays attention to sports. The gym is so awkward to work in because the cafeteria and all other eateries share the same area as the gym without any walls to separate. Slane has a lot of traffic with kids going between classes and it's so awkward to not have ANY privacy while working my ass off.
College Junior,2,school tends to brush aside any accusiations of assult
College Junior,2,"I honestly think I did not receive merit scholarship because I was admitted early decision. Although my family has been fortunate enough to put me through school, financial aid in the form of scholarships would have been extremely helpful! Now I am going to have the burden of student loans after graduation."
College Junior,2,"As a non-Greek, I see a lot of judgement toward to Greek community. I like how they have their own Village to hold social events. I do not feel obligated to join a Greek organization to feel involved in social life."
College Freshman,2,It's a very small part of campus. The rec center for students is smaller than my high school weight room
College Freshman,2,"Party scene on campus is just so-so. Centennial Square and Greek village are always busy over the weekends, but the parties are very exclusive sometimes. Parties in other dorms can't get very big before security comes and breaks them up."
College Sophomore,2,"Ethnicity- Not diverse. If someone wants to say it is, know that that is simply a lie.

Religion- NO. Everyone is Christian, and some very dedicated Christians. Have not met any Jewish people.

Social- Everyone wants to look the same. Like robots. They all love Lily, Jack Rodgers, Greek Shirts, and anything else preppy. Conservative is everyone's middle name."
College Sophomore,2,They do not love giving money.
College Freshman,2,"As far as drugs like marijuana, scenes aren't very noticeable, but alcohol is fairly prominent on weekends.  Many students can legally drink though. I would say peer pressure, like anywhere, is pretty high.  Security is always watching parties though and stops them frequently."
College Freshman,2,There really isn't very much diversity
College Freshman,2,"The diversity present on campus is not quite as high as I was hoping for, though there is a good deal of diversity in specific topics."
College Sophomore,2,"The city of High Point is known as the Furniture Capital of the World, so all of the buildings downtown are just furniture galleries.  some areas of high point are pretty sketchy and there isn't much nightlife or great jobs.  Greensboro and Winston Salem would be the best places to go but they are within a 30 minute drive."
College Sophomore,2,"The school seems to try to keep people on campus rather than let them live off campus.  We have to live in campus housing until we are seniors, which can be expensive."
College Sophomore,2,There are very few scholarships available to students except full scholarships to Presidential Scholars or athletes.
College Senior,2,Most people do not receive scholarships or financial aid - that being said most students here are extremely well off - some have never worked before
College Freshman,2,Directly off campus is not a great area to be.
College Freshman,2,"The school I am attending is my dream school but it is a financial burden for my family that we are trying to handle. I received some academic scholarship money, but I am still in need of more financial help. "
College Freshman,2,"The town of High Point and surrounding towns are 'depressed' and you do not normally go off campus to do anything other than go to the 1 or 2 bars or to get some fast food. If you do leave campus you should use a car, nothing is walking distance."
College Sophomore,2,Spots can be difficult to find. You will not always get to park by your dorm.
College Junior,2,"Parking is bad on campus during busy hours because everyone and their mother has a car. There is no off-campus parking really, and the places there are to park off-campus people don't usually use or know about. You will get fined if you are parked somewhere you aren't supposed to be, but generally people don't get ticketed a lot. You really don't need a car on campus because you can walk everywhere. If you need to go off campus though, it's really better to have a car."
College Freshman,2,not really a nightlife around.
College Sophomore,2,"Frats throw parties all the time, but if you're not in the frat, don't expect to talk to anyone in it. They only associate with themselves and look down on you if you're not a brother. The parties are awesome though."
College Senior,2,At HPU you will find some attractive girls but their snobbishness takes their looks way down thats why I gave them a C-.
Recent Alumnus,2,High Point is mostly covered with the campus. The attractions outside of the school are minimal and are not often visited by the students.
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is a large part of campus life, but there is still plenty to do if you are not a greek life member."
Junior,1,"the onlines aren’t bad but they’re definitely overpriced. they won’t let you take onlines somewhere else, and if you take classes elsewhere they don’t count. scam"
Junior,1,"in my freshman year, HALF of my student body left because of how miserable it was. they had to accept double my original class size for the incoming class to make up for the large amount of withdrawals. it’s depressing. they value the “VIF”s (very important family) the most, rich kids don’t even have to go to the floor safety meetings."
Junior,1,"If you are looking for a high quality education, run from HPU.  Lots of flash on campus.  Manicured lawns, double beds, artsy statues, water fountains a plenty, fancy pianos in lobbies and an undeniable cult like vibe.  The dorms are nice and the food is better than most colleges, but the academics are dreadful.  Professors are lacking, and classes are super easy.  Lots of cheating and drugs.  Diversity is a joke, unless you consider having brunettes on campus to be diverse.  Rich kids, fancy cars, tons of fines for everything.  The entire campus begins to feel claustrophobic after a few months but the surrounding area offers no relief because it's a pit of poverty.  Lastly, tuition is extremely high!  By sophomore year, dorms are hard to come by unless you pay $$$$ for the higher tier buildings.  Ultimately, HPU is like a pricey summer camp where you learn almost nothing."
Niche User,1,"Beyond horrible.  Basically watching you tube videos of professors who were ""phoning it in"".  I could have learned much more by getting a public library card and checking out books.  Online was a disorganized joke.....and it cost us $$$$$"
Junior,1,"literally the worst choice ive ever made in my life. Not at all worth the nearly 65k a year. Problems range from racist students, elitist greek life, out of touch professors and unprofessional administration"
Junior,1,horrible transition to online learning. Little to no flexibility from staff as well as little care for students well being
Graduate Student,1,"unless you donate $20k a year to be a VIF, you mean nothing to the school. They do not take assaults on campus seriously. the only positive thing I have to say about the university are the professors. they care more about your wellbeing than the other administration. dont waste your money."
Sophomore,1,"This school is the most toxic place I have ever been to. Went here for just my freshman year and it was terrible. The school hides so much, they only care if your parents have money or not. HPU security hides things as well, I can't really explain it but there is something odd about this place. The people at that school are all arrogant and toxic, and only interested in drugs. Please don't come here, I was lucky to be able to leave . . . ."
Freshman,1,La Universidad de High Point es no bueno. Simplemente. HPU le faltan diversidad y una educación de calidad. La mayoría de los estudiantes son poco profundos y extremadamente ricos y sienten la necesidad de conducir en sus lujosos automóviles todo el día. También carecen de personalidad y aceptación de otros que son diferentes. Básicamente es una burbuja. No vayas aquí. Espero que esto ayude.
Niche User,1,"Student life specifically Gail Tuttle sells the parents a narrative that is not true. They tell you this is your child’s home away from home. We will take care of them. This is a lie. They out right lied to our family about what they did to our child. This school is full of rich entitled students doing drugs whose parents pay huge fines to keep them in school. The extra help learning excellence program means well and the professors are kind. Beyond that most of students superficial, immature, spoiled and dorm life a disaster. Transferred out thank goodness. No matter how lovely all looks lying underneath deceit"
Sophomore,1,"Doesn’t even deserve 1 star. There is nothing more fake than this school. The students believe they’re all entitled princes and princesses and will use that to their advantage to bring you down.   The one plus about this school, is how amazing and understanding the professors are. They really care about the student and their progress, unlike the rest of HPU’s faculty. The faculty is rude and as a student, all this school has done for me has giving me negative affects on my mental health. My years at HPU have thoroughly been the worst years of my life. This school only cares about money and not one’s well-being. You should consider another school before going to this school.  They do a damn good job while recruiting freshman, covering up all the BS that’s really going on at the school."
Junior,1,"Aesthetics are top priority at HPU, but Nido's marketing techniques are nothing more than smoke and mirrors.  This is a horrible place to get an education.  Administration is doing nothing to combat the rampant drug problem on campus.  Students are lining the toilets with cocaine, while crushing pills that don't belong to them and mixing them with alcohol.  Its just a matter of time before another incident like Nido's son was involved in happens again.  It is easier to buy cocaine, Xanax, and Vyvanse than it is to get candy bar on this campus.  Yes, all college campuses have drug issues, but this one is especially bad.   Lives are changed here and not for the better. We did report these issues multiple times, but they left  these decisions up to the students to say whether or not there was a problem for which they needed help...  After spending more than $108,000, the education our family has received in 2.5 years is devastating to say the least."
Works Here,1,"In reading all these reviews sent in by ""students"", I may as well just read HPU's advertisements. It appears as if admissions is using their time to write fluff reviews. Every other review is extroidinary, awesome, fantastic, great dining, pristine grounds, country club dorms. I guess the director of WOW is proud of his efforts. Five percent African Americans? If Nido could swing it, the number might be zero. He doesn't even want the staff to associate or be seen out on campus. Security is a joke. Sure they're seen, but are powerless to enforce any rules over the rich entitled customers called students. One phone call from moma and everything is forgotten. Students at HPU are NOT prepared to enter the real world. If they think everywhere they go, they will have their butt wiped the way Nido's koolaid drinking minions do while they're in school, no way. Go somewhere else and get a degree worth your time."
College Junior,1,"There's only 1 good bar in the entire area, otherwise you have to drive to Greensboro."
College Junior,1,"No diversity whatsoever. Most of the minority students are on scholarship, and the non-scholarship kids can be huge assholes."
College Junior,1,"A girl in my class was sexually assaulted and because the rapists family was rich, they paid the girl to keep quiet and the rapist faced 0 punishment. Enough said."
College Sophomore,1,I can't find it in my to take greek life seriously. They have control over our campus and statistically are only 30% of the student body. On our campus non-greeks take a very cynical approach to how they view greek life.
College Sophomore,1,"Diversity is a huge issue on campus, including less than 10% of students coming from diverse background groups, and only 1% of faculty being of black descent. My African studies classes are taught by white professors. There is a large gay population on campus, and an even larger in the closet population. The majority of campus is very conservative and the majority of campus is Christian."
College Freshman,1,Dangerous and nothing going on.
College Freshman,1,Impossible to find genuine people to have fun with
College Junior,1,"I'm a transfer student so I feel that I have an excellent insight to the true nature of this school. This campus generates so much negative energy. Students are ALWAYS complaining, getting into fights, discriminating against others, gossiping, etc. It's cause my generally positive attitude to be drained. HPU has caused me to lose a lot of hope in today's society. I transferred as a junior and before this fall 2015 is even half way over, I've decided to transfer back. This place is highly deceitful. It may look great and have great amenities, but that's all it has. If you want something more than a country club experience, enroll elsewhere. I hate to be so harsh, but I'm watching out for others as it was an expensive move."
College Junior,1,"There was a scandal with voter suppression that was (of course) covered up by the university. A professor who was discussing racism told the class how security is told to be stricter and check black people more than the white people and to not allow blacks through the gates as easily. There are so many racist, sexist and homophobic attitudes floating about campus. I can't wait to transfer back home where I feel that every human is respected."
College Junior,1,"They're all from Jersey, Boston and Long Island so therefore have the rudest personalities in the nation (at least where I'm from, that's the stereotype of their region) If you don't have money, you're looked down upon. Some even discriminate against new money(!) Even though the students here are BEAUTIFUL, there is not much beyond the looks. Many girls have fake boobs, nose jobs and carry designer purses as backpacks ..what's your priority there, cause it certainly isn't your books or notes. I've even heard sorority girls make fun of one of their sisters when she was wore a backpack to class. Yeah, it's that ridiculous. Unless you are flawless and wealthy, have fun fitting in."
College Junior,1,"They love to get paid off, so even if you break a rule, if daddy (or mommy) has money, you're in the clear. Harbors an unsafe and unfair environment."
College Junior,1,"It's high crime and it's known that the area outside of ""the bubble"" is highly dangerous. We thankfully have security monitoring all incoming/outgoing traffic. If you live off campus, be EXTREMELY careful. You never want to be alone at night here. Even during the day, there have been shootings near campus. If you live on campus, get a meal plan and avoid the bad parts of the area."
College Junior,1,HPU screwed me over with housing. I waited 4 months for HPU to send me the documents so I could reserve a place for on-campus housing. I called them repeatedly because I knew housing was first come first serve. They promised I would be on campus. Got a call that there was no more room but promised me excellent transportation by the shuttle. The shuttle only ran 3 times during the whole weekend and the shuttle ride is AN HOUR LONG even though I only live 1.5 miles from campus. Transportation would be upset if I called when the shuttle never appeared and I've had to miss class numerous times because of my off-campus situation.
College Freshman,1,No one really comes to athletic events...at all. Unless it is men's basketball from what I have heard. And I am a cheerleader...
College Freshman,1,We don't really go outside the gates of High Point.
College Freshman,1,"Usually, when you go to parties you can get alcohol, but at High Point you can't. You have to program before the party. By 6pm on Friday the campus is dead and everyone is KO'd by 9 or 10 because they pre gamed to hard. When once you get to the parties in Greek Village people are usually just standing on the sidewalk. When you walk in the parties--no one is dancing they are all on the patio. But Centennial's parties are better. The parties are over by 1 am."
College Freshman,1,"If you have long hair with a tan and wear Lilly, Jack Rogers, or something along those lines...THEN YOU'RE SET...if you don't then...GOOD LUCK"
College Junior,1,School has no diversity and I have seen instances of racism and discrimination
College Sophomore,1,"Everyone at HPU who is Greek, joined because they felt they couldn't make it on their own. So they called mommy and daddy up and said, ""Hey, can you send over some money so I can buy some friends?"""
College Senior,1,Boarding School. Most parties are broken up by midnight people caught underage drinking must pay a large fine and take alcohol education classes for a year. They are also put on probation if they are caught again the severity increases. Attendance is taken in every class you are only allowed to skip 3 classes without being dropped from the class 
College Junior,1,"The financial aid at this school is appalling, since this is a private university. I understand that most of the kids who go here don't need scholarships or financial aid, but it is extremely frustrating to me that my academic scholarship is only 9000 dollars a year when the cost of tuition is 42,000 dollars. I am and always have been an excellent student academically, so I feel that I deserved more aid than I received. There are scholarships that you can apply for every year (private scholarships) but they are not very substantial. AND, you don't get them every year. I received a few scholarships my freshman year when I applied, but when I applied in my sophomore year for my junior year, I didn't receive any scholarships. I see no reason why, because I have improved as a student and I am very worthy of merit-based scholarship. I just don't understand how I went from receiving a few scholarships to none. Also, my academic 9000 dollar scholarship was not a free scholarship, I along with all of the other students who receive this scholarship to participating in the ""Presidential Scholar Weekend"" where we have to interview potential scholarship students, pick up trash at the dinner, serve at the dinner, or a whole array of other choices. Regardless, it is time-consuming and a little silly that they use us in this way."
College Senior,1,Not much to do at HPU besides go to the frat houses. After that the city of High Point doesn't have activities outside of that.
College Junior,1,"I couldn't take the curriculum here seriously.. The classes were beyond easy and weren't even challenging.. I remember being put into this English class which was legit déjà vu. All the stuff we were learning were things that I've already learnt in eleventh grade English. How can you expect to grow as a student and expand your knowledge if you're forcing me to take a class with nothing new to learn? They could of at least allowed me to take a more advanced class or an alternative. I also remember asking my math teacher a question and she couldn't even provide an answer or even some help.. I'm pretty sure my question wasn't even that difficult, so there's no excuse. However, my science classes were helpful and slightly challenging."
Recent Alumnus,1,I found my housing on my own because the school doesn't have any off-campus housing not funded by the school.
College Sophomore,1,"Bottom line: There is very little diversity at High Point. What makes this issue even worse is that there is very little interest or effort to improve diversity. HPU has no office of Multicultural Affairs. Almost every major university (private and public) has some type of office that focuses on diversity and inclusion. Yet High Point can't seem to establish one? Don't get me wrong, High Point is a great institution; but it would be even even better if there was more focus on diversity. Diversity is not just about race/ethnicity; it also concerns sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, religion, etc. While there are a few clubs and organizations that focus on these categories (Pride/LGBT, International Club), there could be more awareness of them among the student population. In general, I feel like most of the students here have no interest in learning about different cultures and backgrounds. Given that the majority of students are Caucasian and from affluent backgrounds, diversity is just one of those areas that gets little to no attention. However, the school is making a poor effort to improve diversity and make it a core principle in their admissions and programs. It is the hope that with the founding of the new Diversity Club, efforts from the Diversity Council, and support from faculty, that High Point will feel compelled to work towards improving diversity in the coming years."
College Freshman,1,"Both guys and girls here are very very shallow. They are materialistic and very self-centered. I have tried to branch out in many aspects of the school such as the Equestrian Team, my sorority, clubs, etc and they all have disappointed me in some way. I have to admit there are some good looking guys as well as girls here but thats as far as it goes. I feel that people here we're attracted to this school because of the looks and nothing further and that reflects them as a person. Many people just go to frats and party during the weekend because there is nothing else to do. They often have a lot of hook ups. There are very very few relationships and if there are, many will/have not last(ed) long. All the genuine people I knew transferred. The school is basically a mesh of rich kids whose parents sent them here because the security was good and knew their kids would be safe from the outside world"
College Sophomore,1,"Surprise, Surprise – I have been extremely surprised at the number of drunks and underage drunks on this campus.  It's as if everybody drinks."
College Sophomore,1,"Off-campus housing that is not considered a school owned property is almost nonexistent. the school doesnt allow you to live off campus until you are at least a junior, and even then, there is a credit requirement."
College Freshman,1,"This school is really strict. The school pretty much shuts down the entire party scene around 1am. You'll be able to find parties off campus that go on later than that, but for the most part, you're getting ready for bed around 1 in the morning. Security does a good job not letting intruders onto campus, but they are a real hassle if they see you walking with a back pack on late at night, or if they suspect you have been drinking."
College Freshman,1,"The career services department at High Point doesn't really help you in anyway that you couldn't help yourself. The economy around High Point is really boring, and frankly dead so getting an internship close to school is nearly impossible. You would have to go about 2 hours to Charlotte or about 1.5 hours to Raleigh to find a interesting and fulfilling internship that could help you get where you want to be."
College Freshman,1,I would never want to live off campus. The area seems unsafe to me.
College Freshman,1,"Majority of the girls are snobby and the majority of the guys are jerks. The only people that are actually friendly are students that came here solely for sports since they are laid back and often came with a scholarship so they don't have a lot of money. These people are also hard to be around all the time since they are often busy with their sports and their teams. The people drawn to this school are preppy, snobby, materialistic kids who just came here because it is 'picture perfect'"
College Freshman,1,There is absolutely no diversity here. Sure they're are the occasional minorities but they're all here because of one thing: they have money.
College Freshman,1,"If you don't get the Presidential Scholarship in some form, then the university gives you very little financial aid, if any."
College Junior,1,There is not much of a night life or places to go off campus. There are some nice places but not like most public schools have.
College Junior,1,"There is not much compared to a public school. High Point is mostly Caucasians, then African-Americans and very few other. The University says that we are very diverse but being a minority I am usually the only non white person in the class."
College Senior,1,"Need a Time Machine – Although there is somewhat of a diversity this college is mostly for rich white individuals. The minorities are VERY SMALL. The academics are not that great. The main focus of this institution at the moment seems to be expanding the student population, although it is a good thing, classrooms are getting quite crowded and some buildings need to expand according to the number of majors in it. The money that goes into decorating campus could be invested in more scholarships and a bigger library!"
College Sophomore,1,"Always tornado warnings, scary as s***.  Ruins my day."
College Freshman,1,Virtually None – If you're a presidential scholar you'll do ok but otherwise your best bet is to apply for scholarships outside of the university
College Freshman,1,"If you're looking to come to here but require a lot of scholarships/aid : THINK TWICE!! The school is not worth the loans you are going to need. Even the President says ""we dont give discounts at this school"""
College Freshman,1,"Go greek or go home. If you're looking for a campus where you will meet a lot of genuine, friendly, or kind-hearted people HPU is not the place. The greek system has such a strong presence on campus that you might as well transfer if you don't get in. Even if you do get into a sorority you're screwed if it's not one of the ""top tier"" ones and will be constantly mocked by the rest of the school. And don't forget what happens to the girls in the good ones. They are essentially told that their sisters highly recommend they do not associate with people lower than them on the totem pole. High Point has the exact same f-ed up high school hierarchy that most people expect to escape in college except it's like hs on crack...well actually cocaine that is. Which a huge portion of the student body, including almost the entire ""brotherhood"" of an extremely important faculty member's son, regularly use during their greek events."
College Freshman,1,"Not Spectacular – Fraternities overrun High Point nightlife. Options are limited on campus for the weekends--the school usually keeps any school-sanctioned events for the week; it is generally assumed attendance would be low on the weekends because of the Fraternity parties. Fraternity parties can be fun if you are in the mood for them, but mainly they are more like sleazy clubs and can get uncomfortable and gross. The Sixth Street apartments generally have a more relaxed, college-like atmosphere. There are a couple sketchy clubs off-campus but generally they are avoided. Mainly people only go off-campus for the movie theater or to go to Hanes mall, which is about 20 minutes away."
College Freshman,1,Many students have been attacked after being forced by the university to smoke cigarettes off campus. Some students have also been left in the dangerous city of high point left to their own device to get back to campus after being dropped off by university transportation and left in dangerous and unsafe areas. Highpoint U is more concerned with its image to prospective students than the actual well being of its current ones.
College Freshman,1,Do not go to High point university if you are looking for good academics. I recommend this school for students who need to be constantly babysat and are not yet very mature. This school focuses more on unnecessary garnishes like a free ice cream truck and waterfalls instead of focusing on academics. The student life is very close minded and if you are not a perfect straight edge student then they will quickly find a way to remove you. The surrounding area is also very bad many kids have been mugged after being forced by the university to travel off campus to smoke cigarettes 
College Sophomore,1,Cars on campus is free and open to freshman and parking lots are ugly so the campus has very few.
College Freshman,1,So Terrible – I got a drinking warning for being in the presence of alcohol when I was in a room that happened to get searched and they had beer in their cabinet.  What am I supposed to do? Go through people's stuff before I hang out with them.  No. That is not okay.  I am a good person.  I should not get warned for something I had nothing to do with at all.
College Senior,1,The school makes it almost impossible to move off campus

Freshman,5,"During COVID 19, WLU has stayed in contact with me throughout the pandemic to assure me & my family that they are taking all precautions for their students to come back to a safe environment and if needed to begin semester online I will be well prepared for that. I have been able to speak to people and have been involved in their  online orientations."
Freshman,5,"I love the Campus as a whole and all that it has to offer. I am going to be studying in the Exercise Physiology Program, towards being a Dr. of Physical Therapy - pediatrics"
Niche User,5,"I really like West Liberty. The atmosphere of the campus is great, the students seem to like it and are very welcoming to all new students. The staff for student services has been great to offer assistance when needed. I love the personal feel that the school has overall. You are not treated as a number at West Liberty. You are an individual and are treated as such from the staff and the faculty is very helpful. I have been in contact with the soccer coaches and they have been great helping me with information for playing.  The financial aid department has been great! They have been helpful with the entire process of finding aid to help me make my college dream come true. I am looking forward to being a Hilltopper and representing West Liberty on and off the Soccer field."
Freshman,5,It is a very small college which I like. It makes it easier to get a good education because the classes are small.
Freshman,5,I love West Liberty University because it is a relatively small school so everyone knows each other. Being such a small school I really got to connect with my professors and learn from them on a different level. Everyone is super sweet. I also had a job on campus so I got to meet all of the very kind faculty and staff members.
Junior,5,West Liberty has a great environment and the people here are great to be around. The sporting events are always a fun time.
Niche User,5,"They have an amazing growing zoology program with great internships, while also having wonderful onsite animal enclosures and feeding areas. They also include a masters in zoology which is perfect for what I want to accomplish!! Their dorms are great for people who prefer to be alone or partnered with someone else. They also have the option to switch roommates if something goes wrong between the interactions with your roommate, at anytime during the year. One of my favorite parts about West Liberty is that I can park my car on campus as a freshman; many campuses won’t allow that for freshman. Since I live a couple hours away from home it is perfect for my freshman experience having a car with me during all of my college years. West Liberty is a small school but VERY affordable and not to far away from any cities or towns."
Sophomore,5,"After my first year at West Liberty, I can say that it is a wonderful school. I am a student athlete and all of the professors I have had in the past have worked really well with my athletics and with my other classes."
Freshman,5,I am just entering WLU and so far the staff has been fantastic.  The campus is beautiful and not too big.
Niche User,5,Beautiful campus and wonderful instructors. There are many programs offered with a large variety of classes.
Niche User,5,very welcoming and  has an energy to overall make you want to be apart of the activities that go on around campus. The food there and the people are amazing. And the dorms and classrooms are very nice.
Sophomore,5,"The students and professors at West Lib are some of the best people I have ever met! So thankful for the opportunity to meet amazing people, earn my degree, and live in beautiful West Virginia!"
Senior,5,"West Liberty is such an amazing school tucked up in the hills in West Virginia. There are so many unique places to explore in downtown Wheeling. Because West Liberty is up on a hill, it tends to be a very quiet school. Everyone knows everyone else here on campus and it is truly wonderful to be surrounded by friends all of the time."
Freshman,5,West Liberty University's College campus is beautiful. The students and professors at West Liberty are amazing. They truly want there students to succeed.
Freshman,5,West liberty has a beautiful campus and many activities that have allowed me to meet a diverse amount of people. The only downside is if you don't have a car there isn't much to do because the closest form of civilization is half an hour off campus.
Sophomore,5,I love this school. It is not to big and you can get one on one attention. I love the sports here. The forms dorms are okay. The campus is very clean.
Freshman,5,I am a first year student at West Liberty University.  I have really enjoyed being part of a small community.  Faculty are readily available when I need them.  I have been able to find study groups.  I have even become part of several groups.  I love the friendly atmosphere.  I feel like I am home.
Freshman,5,"West Liberty has a great atmosphere, the campus is nice and peaceful. The classes are beneficial. The only thing that would be nice is if there were more activities since it is in the middle of nowhere and most students don't have transportation. Transportation opportunities would be amazing!"
Freshman,5,"So far, so good. Professors are good at what they teach and want to help students. The food is surprisingly really good, but there’s also a dominos down the hill."
Niche User,5,"I love the location. I have only visited a couple times, but from those times everyone has been so nice and welcoming. I absolutely love the college."
Freshman,5,"Choosing to attend West Liberty University was the greatest decision I've ever made. Not only are the people and staff amazing, but the classes push you to be better."
Sophomore,5,I love the small sized classes. It is really helpful when it comes to teacher-student interaction. The professors do take the time to spend with each student when needed.
Niche User,5,"A well kept school with great teachers and beautiful campus. I like the teachers better at west liberty because instead of just writing notes on a board they teach in ways many people can understand, the guide I get from many of my teachers direct me in the right path for my future. I highly recommend this school to anyone that asks."
Freshman,5,I come from a small town so being at West Liberty University helps me relate to being back at home. There is so much to do on campus although it is a small campus. EverythIng is in walking distance so there isn't any trouble with that. The only thing is that there isn't a gas station on the hill which makes it hard for people to travel sometimes. There are bars and restaurants as well accessible.
Sophomore,5,"I love West Liberty, great school spirit and the professors are very helpful! Many different majors to choose from. You can commute or live on campus. The campus is great! "
College Junior,5,"This school is known for having a great education program, so i am very happy to get my education degree from this school. I want to be a teacher and I am learning so much from my professor presented in this education program. I know I will be able to get a job in my field following graduation."
College Junior,5,"The school offers great courses along with great professors. I think we shouldn't have to take general edu. because they classes are not relevant to these majors. Also, I feel that it is a waste of time to take these classes for no reason. Class sizes are small and perfect. Depending on the class the most you may have is 10-15 per class."
College Junior,5,"We have some of the best security on campus. They are on duty 24/7 and they are always helpful/ nice. Campus is pretty safe, and not much crime happens within the campus. I feel very safe to walk across campus alone."
College Junior,5,"Living in the dorms has it perks and not so good things. The rooms could be a little bigger and be in better condition. Being one of the oldest schools not everything is new. Everyone who lives on the floor is very nice and friendly. The cost to live in the dorm is kind of outrageous. I understand they have to pay for electricity and water, but we pay for our own laundry and also pay a fortune for food."
College Junior,5,"I absolutely love Greek life. As a sorority girl, its the best decision I made in college. Some non-Greeks use us to party which is honestly not the only thing we do. We give a lot back to the community. We have two national sorority on campus therefore they are the only ones who have houses. Greek life is very close and we are just one big family."
College Junior,5,"Our school has some of the best spirit that I know of. No matter the sport student is always there to support our teams. People from the community, staff, and teachers are always out to supports our teams. Our President is at most of the sporting events. Cheering on the teams, but also connecting with fellow students. Any athletic facility are open to non athletic students when a team isn't practicing or playing."
College Junior,5,"My school is unique because its a small liberal school on a mountain. Its very small and the relationships not only between staff, but also the student life is amazing. The professor there want you to succeed and they will do everything they can to help you. I would definitely choose this school  over again, because no matter what department you are in you will succeed. I wish college was cheaper because I struggle to pay for school, but that's life and I have to deal with they road blocks head on."
College Sophomore,5,I was part of Greek Life and would reccommend it to anyone.
College Sophomore,5,"I love the size of my school, both the campus and the classes."
College Freshman,5,Campus feels very safe. WLU has on campus police office. Police officers often drive around campus to make sure that everything is ok. Outside of every dorm there is a special phone for contacting local police office.
College Freshman,5,"Professors are ready to help students, they explain material in a clear manner. WLU has big education department which is very popular choice for accepted students. Workload depends on the class and professor. Most of the classes require a lot of reading. registration is easy and can be done online very quickly."
College Freshman,5,Application is very clear and precise. The main factor is SAT and school GPA. Admissions doesn't require any essays or resumes. It's good to have a contact with student adviser or admissions officer prior applying.
College Junior,5,"Although there are difficulties in my program and I have personal challenges, I would do it again. I plan to be either a high school or middle school band or orchestra director. I have a lot of concerns about finding a job in my field, but I am willing to travel."
College Junior,5,My program accepts a lot of students to build it. The students get weened out the first year based on the work load and difficulty. An audition is expected of every music program.
College Junior,5,"My favorite college experience so far is meeting life-long friends through the campus in both events in my department and in my classes, and move-in day."
College Freshman,5,We learn so many different things from people all around the world
College Freshman,5,Love it! So glad I joined Chi Omega
College Freshman,5,"The architecture of the buildings is truly stunning and modern.  There are flat screens everywhere, along with ping pong tables, pool tables, vending machines, racket ball courts, fitness centers, and many other things."
College Freshman,5,"Dominio's is a 45 second drive away.  There are also restaurants on campus such as Subway, Pizza Hut, The Sky Ranch, Jazz-man's, and Taco Bell.  They are extremely convenient since I can walk to all of these places from my dorm in under a minute.  You can even use your meal plan with these place, excluding subway."
College Sophomore,5,"Food I's great however you will pay a little higher for the restaurants in the union. Subway, pizza hut, taco bell, skyranch grille and jazzman's gives you such a big verity to choose from. The cafeteria has gread reasonable prices and good food too. Much more food for you money there."
College Student,5,"As an incoming freshman to West Liberty University, I am very please with the way they are able to connect to each of their students. I am very excited to continue my education at West Liberty University and I can not wait to attend the school in the fall."
College Junior,5,"West Liberty is very one-on-one with professors to students. The professors are very knowledgeable with topics, and are always conducting experiments to further their knowledge-base. The curriculum for CLS majors is comprehensive, with lots of classes based in the actual field and little general education requirements. They registration process is quick and easy, and the workload is great for my schedule as a full time student and mother. The offer work study money, and many chances to further your career and build up your resume while going to college."
College Junior,5,"West Liberty is the second college that I've been to, and it's major is exactly in tune with what I want to do in life. I am a Clinical Lab Science major, and so far, everything has been taught in a professional, enthusiastic, and encouraging manner. When I used to go to a top-rated college, I found that the teachings weren't one-on-one with the students, and that the number of students were too many per class to concentrate easily with what the professor had to say (too many distractions during class). Coming from a small high school, I needed smaller classrooms, and more contactable situations with the professors. This university offers all of that, and more. These professors do many varied studies outside of the curriculum, and keep up with current events when picking their topic of exploration. Also, many of these professors have extensive experience with the collegiate know-how, so advising in professional matters is easy to come by. The campus is smaller than what I used to go to, which is very convenient."
College Sophomore,5,"We don't get much snow this year, it's mostly pleasant. And besides, we got air conditioner and heater in every building, including our dorm. It feels like spring now already."
College Freshman,5,"Due to the many on campus restaurants and the cafeteria, students are provided with a very wide variety of dining options."
College Freshman,5,"All of the art professors that I have met have all seemed to be very passionate about their careers. I have seen some of their work, and they all appear to be very professional. I can't imagine having better instructors to lead me toward success in my future."
College Freshman,5,"The mac lab is full of 15 iMacs that are equipped with adobe editing software, as well as other highly needed tools. Also, our school provides free laptops to first time students, which has helped so many people to achieve success on classwork that would have been very inconvenient for them in the past."
College Freshman,5,"All five professors that I have had the privilege to have in class have all shown excellent interest in their field. In addition to this, they are much friendlier than teachers I had in high school, and go out of their way to make sure students do successful work."
College Freshman,5,There are a lot of diversity here. It's awesome! Everyone has a place here.
College Sophomore,5,this is the best place to go with your friends its not super pricey $$. its so much fun the food is always fresh and it reminds me of : the cheesecake factory.
College Sophomore,5,J.R is the worlds best campus cop. he takes his job seriously. we all love him. he makes us feel safer.
College Sophomore,5,"Athletic Department – West Liberty is located on top of a hill, there isn't much to do but go watch the other sports. Our football field, gym, and softball field are all roughly new and in very wonderful shape. My school has a lot of school spirit and all the athletes are friends and get along with each other. We all support one another, and the rest of the University supports us. This includes both staff and students. We have a great athletic atmosphere."
College Junior,5,Best Education Program – West Liberty University is known for its great education program. All of the teachers in the program are wonderful and very enthusiastic about teaching. They get you out in the field right away to make sure that this is what you want to do for the rest of your life. They do not just sugar coat everything. They tell you the truth and help you prepare for the real world.
College Junior,5,"Highlands Center – I attend an off the main campus section of West Liberty University, and it is nestled in a shopping center. There are many restraunts to chose from as well as great prices, but there are no discounts for studnets."
College Freshman,5,No Problems – I automatically got into my program with no problems. I easily made the 2.0 gpa required
Sophomore,4,"West Liberty is a great college to attend to. At first, I wasn't at awe at it so I decided to attend a different school instead. I ended switching to West Liberty for my major and I slowly really started to like it. I commute to school so I don't live on campus. The drive is not the best, especially in winter. If you plan to commute, definitely get something that's going to be reliable."
Freshman,4,"I liked the kindness of every student and professor on campus.  Everyone was really close to one another as there were not many students compared to a big D1 school.  This allowed me to get to know my professor and was easier to ask for help.  I think the food quality needs to change. Although the food tastes alright, the quality is not good."
Sophomore,4,"I like the fact that you are away from the city, yet close enough to run and explore!! the school is in a natural setting with old buildings that are a beautiful sight. The parking of this campus is not well designed as the parking fills up quick with no alternative parking spots."
Freshman,4,While my experiences with this university are limited I believe it to be a very solid university.  It has a very nice campus and the professors seem to be very approachable.
Sophomore,4,Great professors willing to help with anything. Dorm maintenance is poor but the dorms that are well kept are nice.
Freshman,4,I believe West Liberty University is a great school for people who live in the area and want an inexpensive school to attend.  I believe their class sizes are helpful in perspective of the teacher and student.
Junior,4,"West Liberty is a great college if you want a small school. The great thing about WLU is your teachers get to know you, and you can always ask for help. The sights on campus are stunning, and seeing the school in the winter can be gorgeous, however, if you’re one who likes to be in the city, the closest small town to us is 20 minutes down the road. There is one store off campus, but besides that you have to do a lot of driving on windy roads."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy West Liberty in the sense that it's a relatively small campus, and very beautiful. The zoo science major is great and the professors really care. It's a quiet and nice place to go, especially for first year students, just now becoming adults."
Sophomore,4,"The advisors to a great job to get students prepared for after school. There are oftentimes many activities that are going on that anyone can go to. Sodexo, our meal plan is usually pretty good at changing things up so that we are not bored with the selections."
Junior,4,"West liberty is a great college with a beautiful campus. It is a small college and I love that, you feel more connected to staff and other students. Classes are usually only 10 minutes at most from each other. I would like the school to decrease its tuition though, it seems every year that it increases a noticeable amount."
Sophomore,4,"Plus side: the professors and people around you care.

Downside: some of the buildings are a little rundown."
Junior,4,West Liberty is a great school especially if you aren't a fan of the larger universities. There aren't a lot of places to go off campus wise but the school tries to provide lots of activities for its students. The professors are great and will really work with you if you are having trouble. The student to teacher ratio is so small that you really feel cared for and it gives every student the opportunity to have a one on one relationship with their professors.
Freshman,4,"My experience with West Liberty has been, overall, a great one. I love the people here, and I've met some amazing friends here as well. The professors are very helpful. The only thing that could be more helpful is transportation. If you don't have a car up here, you aren't getting off of the hill without someone else driving you. That would be my only complaint, but other than that it's great."
Freshman,4,Overall I really do like going to West Liberty. However they could have better food. I find myself eating a lot of Taco Bell. 
College Junior,4,Most courses and professors are great. Some courses I think are a waste of time.
College Junior,4,I feel safe on campus. There is a police station on campus.
College Junior,4,"Football is not that good, but basketball is amazing."
College Junior,4,I love my school. The classes are great and so are the professors.
Junior,4,I have been extremely impressed with the changes to the university since it became a university as opposed to a state college. The additional buildings and amenities I feel are well worth the initial expenses.
College Junior,4,The best parties probably take place at the fraternity houses or wrestling house. Great way to meet new people
College Junior,4,Homecoming would be the biggest party scene but also nice small party scenes
College Junior,4,Small classes and great student professor relationships
College Junior,4,Everyone is accepting of diversity
College Sophomore,4,Would reccomend this school to anyone.
College Sophomore,4,Campus police is always around. Some times the officers are not the most approachable. You feel like they are trying to get you in trouble at times rather than actually help you.
College Sophomore,4,Afforable. Small class sizes and have great relationships with teachers. A large group of students commute.
College Sophomore,4,A few of the sporting events are very fun to attend and have a strong student outcome. Others are very poorly attended. Thoroguly enjoy attending them.
College Sophomore,4,There is a great amount of fan support for football and basketball at the school.
College Sophomore,4,"So far, I find that my school is great.  I love the people that I work with and everyone is extremely helpful and supportive."
College Junior,4,"West Liberty is so unique because of the community-like campus. The biology program is especially rigorous for me, preparing me for graduate school."
College Freshman,4,Gave me a lot of new activities
College Senior,4,"Small class sizes, affordable, and personal"
College Freshman,4,It is great the only downfall is that it does not have a graduate program
College Freshman,4,I love the program I am in it is the best.
College Freshman,4,I feel like faculty cares of me and they really want me to succeed. I would definitely choose this school again because of the personal touch it has.
College Freshman,4,WLU has lots of different students from various backgrounds. There are international full time and exchange students of different races and religions. students openly say about their religious preferences. A lot of students study here on a discount rate or some sort of scholarship. I haven't seen anyone bragging about his wealth. Most of the students have part time jobs.
College Freshman,4,Professors are usually very nice and respectful. Majority of the faculty has PhDs. Classes are small and every student gets a lot of attention. Professors tend to know your name by the end of the first week of classes. WLU doesn't offer a lot of courses but all offered courses are good. The weakest spot is the lack of foreign language courses.
College Freshman,4,"WLU has variety of scholarships for both domestic and international students with different levels of SAT. It also provides sport scholarships. The good thing is that scholarship process is very clear and easy. Student needs to submit his application and SAT scores, no additional materials (essays, portfolios, etc) required."
College Junior,4,"There are various physical descriptions of guys and girls that are too difficult to classify. There isn't just one ""typical college student"" appearance. Their interests are very diverse."
College Junior,4,"You get the same education as you would anywhere else. The professors are very helpful and want you to succeed. You wouldn't guess their qualifications. The curriculum is fair. The registration process for classes is pretty fair too. You always want to schedule for the gen eds first to ensure you get in those classes. Sometimes the workload for each class is difficult, but a lot of my classes give projects or tests and.There are tutors that are very helpful. The popular study areas on campus include: the union, Jazzman's, the library, dorm lobbies, the quad, the English major lounge, the Media arts center, and the ""table"" in the music department."
College Junior,4,The campus security is very strict in comparison to the student body which are mainly decent citizens. Sometimes they inconvenience students that actually care about their development in academics by treating them like criminals.
College Junior,4,"A lot of the student body attends the football games, however sometimes they aren't the greatest. My school gets more support for the basketball team because of their success each year."
College Freshman,4,Basketball is real good and highly ranked . Football needs some work
College Senior,4,The Basketball team here is the most popular athletic team. They have been in the final 4 for championships and were #1 in the state.
College Freshman,4,"It is remote, the university is like a thriving town set apart from the rest of the world with its own society.  Everybody respects one another, even if they have never met you.  People go out of their way to make things easier for you."
College Freshman,4,West Virginia is known for it's natural scenery and national parks.  Everyone's friendly and its only a short drive away to get to the highlands.
College Sophomore,4,I love the food and the people that serve you. The people that serve you are kind and know how to keep the place clean.
College Freshman,4,"Drugs are never really a problem. Some people partake and if you don't, that's fine, too."
College Junior,4,There is ample parking at the university. I drive to school every day and I never had a problem with finding a spot
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus. Nothing dangerous has happened, to my knowledge, during my time at the university. My one complaint is that Campus PD spends as much time writing petty parking tickets as they do ""protecting"" the students."
College Sophomore,4,"Exceptional staff that are well versed and happy to do their jobs.

Some of the best staff and people I have encountered in college."
College Freshman,4,We have a pretty good supporters for our sporting events. We have really nice training facilities.
College Junior,4,"I live in an apartment about 15 minutes from campus, so it's not regulated by the campus. As far as these apartments go, the neighborhood is great, it's quiet at night most of the time, and the price is pretty good."
College Sophomore,4,"Pretty safe except that the fire alarm went off now and then, people are pretty interest in making their own food but not so sure of how to."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a variety of dining options on the campus including a pizza hut and subway, however some of the places are a bit pricey like the coffee shop."
College Sophomore,4,West Liberty is a great start. It gives you the college experience but is small enough to not be overwhelming.
College Sophomore,4,"I'm just now starting the program but from what I've heard it's an amazing program, that sets you up for a great future."
College Sophomore,4,"Good Professors – The college has great professors, also, the staff is very friendly, and helpful."
College Sophomore,4,it has campus police that are pretty good at securing the campus
College Junior,4,Crappy Parking – The biggest problem with the campus is there is not enough parking. If you live in one of the freshmen dorms there is no parking near your dorm at all. During the day it is almost impossible to find a parking spot with everyone there. The dorms itself are not bad though. There just needs to be more parking.
College Junior,2,I haven't heard of any job fairs or employers recruiting on campus.
College Junior,2,"The Greeks control SGA, which means they control funding for other clubs."
College Junior,2,"This school is the epitome of a suitcase school and the University does not provide any entertainment for students who choose to stay on campus on the weekends.  The school is very small so only people from the surrounding area know of this college.  The police officers on campus behave in a very unprofessional manner and are constantly looking for a reason to harass the students.  While there are some good teachers that care about their students, many do not. If I could do it again, I would go to a large, well known university."
College Freshman,2,It is not very good. I do not plan on living off campus at West Liberty.
College Freshman,2,"There are almost no houses near the campus. College stands on top of the hill, so it is hard to find apartment in the area."
College Freshman,2,The only place nearby is Dominos pizza. They do delivery to the campus. Campus is far from the city so there is no way to go for a dinner outside of the campus without loosing time.
College Freshman,2,It takes forever to get here no matter where you are
College Freshman,2,Everything is 30 mins. Away 
College Freshman,2,Being to far away from my child. And overcoming a bad football season
College Freshman,2,Just the cars you bring to school
College Junior,2,"It's a small semi-rural area so there isn't a huge variety in people, but I wouldn't say that everyone is the same"
College Sophomore,2,"There is Greek Life, but it is not as big at WL as it is other places. There are some events and parties and such. No one really views a Greek or non-Greek too differently. There's not much Greek housing either."
College Freshman,2,"I received enough financial aid to cover cost of tuition, but part was in the form a student loan, which I did not accept."
College Junior,2,"There is very limited off-campus housing. It is more expensive than dorming and a farther walk to classes than living in a dorm, which is why most people simply stay on campus."
College Sophomore,2,greek life is well known but it isnt for everyone.
College Sophomore,2,"its not too bad it can get really cold at random times. since we are at the top of the mountain. it can be 80 degrees all week long , friday comes and its pouring down."
College Junior,2,"weather is normal in the summer, hot. In the winter the snow gets really bad beacause it is on a hill, which makes it horrible getting to class."
College Junior,2,Classroom Strictness – Since the classes or so small there they are so strict on cell phones and attendence
College Junior,2,parking pass cost 75$ which is not bad but it is too far away from the classes or down a hill so it makes it horrible walking to and from in bad weather.
College Junior,2,"There are rules in place such as no drinking/drug use in the dorm rooms, however some resident assistants don't really report the problem until they have to. Often times, the students never get caught with it even though it's pretty well known. If they are caught, they are issued a warning and have to meet with a student counselor. Repeated offenses result in academic probation in which the student is not allowed access to the school for up to one year. We also have a non-smoking policy recently put in place that outlaws smoking not only near the resident halls, but campus wide. Although it's been in effect for a year, there has been little to nothing done about smokers."
Freshman,1,School is trash. Not really diverse except for the athletes. Majority of the people at the school are all from the area so they already have friends and don't make it a thing to interact with you. They all give you that idk you look if you ever try to approach and act scared. Nothing to do at the school on weekends or free time and the school is broken down old trash. Dorms are hard floors and everything is outdated and rusted. If you come from a big city or far away this school is not for you if you are a minority. Friends even experienced unfair treatment in an  incident and was forced to leave. And the food is TRASH and so bad it wasn't even worth 1 star. The meal equivalency is only 5 bucks so you end spending your flex all the time and run out quickly and the cafe is trash and dirty and looks like prison food. Stay away unless you are from wheeling. The people from wheeling are jokes I got out of there with the the quickness.
College Freshman,1,"It is annoying and all they do is party, and get on everyone's nerves."
College Freshman,1,Snow makes it very hard to get up the hills
College Junior,1,There aren't any campus transportation programs that I know of nor do I think that there are any nearby taxi's or buses
College Freshman,1,"The road (Route 88) gets VERY dangerous with snow. Classes rarely get delayed and almost never get cancelled. It isn't bad for those who live on campus, but it is pretty bad for commuters."
College Freshman,1,"School was not once cancelled the entire year of Fall 2012-2013 even with inches of snow, multiple car wrecks on the 30 minute drive into west liberty as well as a lot of wrecks on campus as well, very unsafe."
College Sophomore,1,The TV Crew is great. Good opportunities for advancement.
College Sophomore,1,Considering that I do not drink I don't know where many party spots are. I do know that this college is literally on top of a hill and there is never much going on at any given time.
College Junior,1,Very few options for meals on campus. Same food is offered all the time and bad quality. Long drive to get any other food off-campus. All food is priced higher.
College Freshman,1,There are supposed to be busses that take you to walmart and places off the hill and I have never seen any
College Sophomore,1,"CAMPUS BITES – this campus isnt near much. so when the weekend comes you better prepare for a warm blanket , coffee and movies. the campus is small there isnt much for us to do. there isnt anywhere to hang out everything closes except for jazzmans which is the coffee place in the union.

still sucks though."
College Sophomore,1,"the students weren't very inviting like the website says. there isnt much student body activity. we live on a rock! lol

it took me almost a month to get comfortable
diversity isnt too bad."
College Junior,1,"No Night Life at All! There is one bar at west liberty and it is run down and old looking, no night clubs or anything interesting to do except house parties"
College Senior,1,"This school is located on top of a mountain and there are only curvy roads to travel on, so when you have to commute daily, like I do, it takes a long time to get to and from school.  I wish there was a bus I could catch down at the bottom of the mountain that would save me some wear and tear on my vehicle, but there isn""t."
College Freshman,1,"There is a 5:1 girl to boy ratio here at West Liberty. This is in part because of the dental hygiene and nursing programs offered. Most students who major in dental hygiene or nursing are female. This means, all of the boys on campus are either taken, or don't want to be taken because of the high opportunity to ""get laid"". 

I feel that there are lots of different looks on campus. One time in the student union there was sword fighting lessons going on. (With fake swords of course.)There are certain groups of people and there is a little of every click from ""Mean Girls"" you can think of."
Recent Alumnus,1,"It is nearly impossible for students to get financial aid when they need it.  It seems like everyone makes ""too much money.""  I received no financial aid.  I am an independent with a part time job and my parents are teachers,  but they provide me with no help."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not Worth the Expense! The off campus housing is old and run down.  Most apartments close to campus are dirty, or they are a considerable distance from campus.  If you live farther from campus, in the winter it is almost impossible to get there."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Driving; Non-Optional – The off campus dining options are little to none.  None are in walking distance of the school.  The only options available are a 20 minute drive to the Highlands or a 8 minute drive to the bottom of Route 88 for Sheetz.  There are no student discounts accept for Quaker Steak and Lube, which offers 10% off with a student ID.  That restaurant is the only one I would recommend in the area."
College Student,1,There are only a few parking lots but none of them are close to Main Hall which is where most of everyones classes take place. Also the parking spots pay Main Hall are Vistor Parking spots and if you park there you will get a ticket about 98% of the time.
College Student,1,The only diversity there is at West Liberty University is the Foreign Exchange students and the Football players.

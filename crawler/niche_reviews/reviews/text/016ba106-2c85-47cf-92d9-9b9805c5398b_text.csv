Freshman,5,"I really love being here at Duquesne. I especially am grateful that I got the opportunity to come to campus, in a very safe way, which allowed me to get a somewhat normal college experience and meet new people here."
Graduate Student,5,"As an MBA student, the professors and academic/financial advisors at the school have really helped me and am happy so far.  They want you to succeed and for the price of the tuition, you really get a personalized education, tailored to your needs.  The campus is gorgeous, sitting on the bluffs, and it has great views of the city.  

The Hyflex model that Duquesne has been top notch in regards to the ongoing pandemic.  I have yet to check out the library but will do so when things clear up.  Everyone on campus has been wearing masks and distancing.

Overall, I like how the campus is situated in the heart of the city and it is close to all the big companies.  It also has great opportunities for undergraduate/graduate students for internships/rotational programs at the companies nearby.  

I chose this school as it is highly regarded in the city and I think it is a great regional school in the North East.  As the saying goes ""you only get out what you put in.""  So make the most of it."
Graduate Student,5,"Taking classes online and professors are fast to respond to any questions you may have.  The graduate level material seems level as what you might get at some top ranked MBA programs, like NYU or other Ivy League schools."
Sophomore,5,The professors and staff did everything they could to ensure an easy learning environment for us on zoom. They were kind and understanding and have been great to us during this pandemic.
Junior,5,i love the small and family based campus. your professors are able to get to know you 1 on 1 and care about your future and well being
Freshman,5,"it has a very small and warm environment, it makes students feel belonged since the first day they go there."
Freshman,5,"I did not take any online classes yet. However, I heard from some students who are taking online classes, they are saying it was a great experiance, and the professors are very helpful."
Sophomore,5,"Duquesne is a wonderful university with lots of educational opportunities and a very supportive teaching faculty. Every single professor I had was concerned with my progress in their class and encouraged us to speak up if we were falling behind. The residence halls are well kept with a large variety of living options, including single rooms, doubles, triples, suites, and group housing. The professors truly care about their students and it only makes the experience better. There are also plenty of opportunities to join sports and music programs, and there is also a large gym that is open to any student. There are also multiple smaller gyms located in the residence halls. The dining hall is small but offers a huge variety of healthy and tasty foods, and there are plenty of other locations to dine on campus. On top of all this, the campus is beautiful and set in the heart of Pittsburgh on a quiet bluff."
Freshman,5,Duquesne University has a really great Physical Therapy Program. The academics is great and the teachers are generally really nice. There are a lot of resources for help with academics.
Sophomore,5,As a first year Freshman I was really nervous to start college considering how small my highschool was I knew it would be a big change. I’m also in a wheelchair because i’m paralyzed and with the hills I was worried about if it would be a challenge but there are so many great people on the campus that offered to push me everyday including some staff members. I also joined a sorority specifically ZTA and I was worried because you hear that sororities have reputations and honestly it completely changed my look on them. The girls are so sweet and so welcoming which made the rest of my Spring semester so fun because I made so many new friends. Overall Duquesne was my best choice and i’m glad I made the choice to go there because it is definitely going to be where I make all my favorite memories and lifetime friends.
Junior,5,The transfer to virtual learning following COVID-19 were very smooth and weren't much different than the physical experience. Duquesne University did an amazing job with this transition.
Sophomore,5,It has been everything I hoped and dreamed of in a school. They have helped me in every way and provided all things I needed for my first year of college.
Senior,5,"Duquesne has changed my life! The career services center helped guide me to learn what I wanted to be, and then they found a job for me in that field at the school! My teachers are amazing and caring, and they really put forth more than what I've heard from other students about their professors at other schools."
Freshman,5,"I love being right in downtown pittsburgh but still being on a completely self contained campus. As soon as you step off campus you're in the city, but the campus itself isn't intermixed with other buildings like you see with other city schools."
Alum,5,"Graduated in undergrad in May 2019. I had the best time making lifelong friends at Duq. Something that’s very unique is their study abroad programs. I did a Spring Break away course you take in spring then over spring break you do the study abroad portion. I have also did a May semester in Rome. It was awesome, a experience I’ll never forget!"
Freshman,5,My experience at Duquesne has been incredible. I enjoy the atmosphere of the campus and each of the classes I am taking.
Senior,5,"Duquesne University is an excellent school. I have enjoyed every minute of my time here. As a senior, I feel I am well prepared for a career in the area of accounting and finance."
Alum,5,"i really liked the college feel of the campus and how the class size was smaller. it's a private school, but still really fun. there were numerous activities to do all the time and i was in the heart of the the city which was cool."
Sophomore,5,"I personally loved Duquesne University; it is a small, secluded campus on Bluff Street. It is a beautiful campus that makes you feel like you’re in the city. It feels like home, especially in the Fall. The faculty here is wonderful; they truly care about your well-being and education."
Sophomore,5,The professors really care to see you succeed. They’re very friendly and always available to answer questions or for extra help.
Sophomore,5,"I chose correctly when I decided to attend Duquesne. The school is rather small in size, which is nice because you feel connected to everyone there. The campus sits on its own little hill and makes you feel as if you're in your own little town, completely separated by the city of Pittsburgh. Most professors are very helpful and care about their students. Most class sizes are small which allows for nice one-on-one communication with your professor in class."
Alum,5,beautiful and quaint campus perfectly located in the center of the city but tucked away from the hustle and bustle. wonderful professors and small class sizes allow for optimal learning.
Sophomore,5,"I just completed my freshman year at Duquesne University and I loved it. The week prior to classes starting they host a freshman orientation week. This week helped me to learn campus, make a group a friends, and even feel comfortable in  the Greater City of Pittsburgh. Every professor I have encountered so far is very dedicated to their students' well being both inside and outside of the classroom; which helped to relieve some of my anxiety as I made the transition from high school to college. Also, every week Duquesne sends out an email of a list of things to do throughout each day on campus; so there is always FREE events and gatherings to attend to help each student feel involved on campus. Also my academic advisor was amazing throughout the whole process and hosted a day for us to walk through how we register for classes and gave insight on classes to take. I truly found my home."
Niche User,5,"On my first visit, everyone was so welcoming and I new this was the college for me. They have very skilled and knowledgeable professors and staff that are easily approachable. I am not a city person, but even though Duquesne is in the heart of Pittsburgh, you don’t feel like you are in the city."
Alum,5,I had a great time at Duq.  I got a really good scholarship to go there.  I was in several clubs and learned a lot.  The campus is very compact and very conveniently in a urban area.  The only thing I wish is that I had been more educated or helped with choosing a major and program before attending - I would have chosen a better major.
Sophomore,5,All around Duquesne is a really nice school. The meal plans and the food are probably the worst part. It would be nice if meal swipes covered more things because the places you can use them just arent up to par.
Sophomore,5,I really like that Duquesne University challenges you academically.  I really like the friends I've made there. What needs to change at Duquesne is lack of diversity.
Senior,5,"Duquesne ended up being my dream school. I transferred here after a year at another 4 year private school, but this had all the advantages I dreamed of. The campus is remarkably beautiful and clean. The views are incredible and even more incredible is how one is literally in the city of Pittsburgh, the most livable in the U.S., without being in the city. The campus is tucked away and safe, but within a short walking distance to Uptown, Downtown and Southside alike. At Duquesne, one has all the advantages of an urban and suburban campus. The campus's physical advantages should not overshadow its educational and cultural advantages. There are a wide range of activities on campus and off campus to be involved in. Additionally, being within a few short minutes to various parts of Pittsburgh, students can experience everything a big city has to offer, like an exciting food scene or musicals at the Benedum Center."
Niche User,5,"I was immediately captivated by a community feel, especially  with the setting of the campus apart from but overlooking the city of Pittsburgh.  It felt personal and intimate, both within the vibrant life of the student body and on an educational level as well. I appreciated the specialized physical therapy program provided where I can get started right away in pursuing my career within six years."
Freshman,5,"Duquesne University is a wonderful institution that is very academically strong and has rigorous coursework for all majors.  School spirit is prevalent all over campus and professors are actively interested in the students' success, as well as the university and participate with professional clubs and activities regularly.    You will make some the greatest friends you have ever met here, and it will help you to step out of your comfort zone and help you to prepare for the workforce.  Duquesne cares about its students' wellbeing and safety, which is why they don't allow alcohol and drugs on campus.  Even though the party scene is not very good,  there are definitely a lot of other activities and events to do, such as activities on and off campus, guest speakers, student-run events, and off-campus trips.  Duquesne is amazing and there is nowhere else I would rather be."
Niche User,5,"I am impressed with their programs and facilities. They have lots of city life around them, so there is always something to do."
Freshman,5,I love Duquesne University. It is a great school with amazing professors who care about the students. They push you because they want to see you succeed.
Sophomore,5,"I love Duquesne, I am a sophomore studying Political Science and I have learned so much already after the first two years being here. Class sizes are small and your professors genuinely care about your education. They want to see you succeed in all aspects of the course and your knowledge moving though."
Freshman,5,My professors this past fall semester were very excellent and always willing to help us students succeed. My academic advisor has been very helpful and informative regarding my class schedule and curriculum. There are so many student organizations. I had a hard time trying to decide which ones I wanted to join and participate in. This included club sports and intermural sports. There are always activities going on (on and off campus). I even got to attend a Pirates baseball game in the beginning of the semester.
Freshman,5,Duquesne University is a great school offering its students a plethora of various experiences and opportunities ensuring their future success.
Sophomore,5,"The teachers expect a lot from the students, but they also treat the students  like equals in the classroom.  The sport programs also create a community that allows us to grow in a positive atmosphere.  Duquesne is far from perfect but the pros out weigh the cons when looking at surround schools."
Sophomore,5,"I very much enjoy going to Duquesne. It is in a great location and I can walk to most places I need to go. I wish that bus passes were linked to our student ID like they are at CMU and Pitt to make it easier/less expensive to get to Oakland. The loop bus is great but I wish it ran a little more often than just Friday and Saturday. The food isn't bad, there is always plenty of options but the dining hours kinda suck, there really aren't any late night food options. Academically I feel engaged and challenged, the professors thus far have been very competent and knowledgable. I have had several opportunities to study abroad with Duquesne and I thought the programs were well planned and unique. The diversity of the university is lacking and overall enthusiasm for sports is also underwhelming."
Freshman,5,"The school has a high national ranking with many diverse programs and majors. Being located in downtown Pittsburgh, there are not only opportunities on campus, but also off campus. The campus is generally very safe and there are many things to do either at the university itself or a short walk or drive away."
Junior,5,"Deciding to attend Duquesne University was a great choice for me. This school has been the perfect fit. I am a part of the Rangos School of Health Sciences. Although it is extremely challenging, as long as you apply yourself and figure out the best way to study, you'll be fine! The location is PERFECT. Walkable distance to very many locations."
Junior,5,Duquesne is an extremely close knit community. You see the same faces every day which can lead to great relationships. Class size allow you to become friends with your professors and they really want you to succeed. The south side is the place to go. Nothing but love for my school.
Sophomore,5,"I am a transfer student at Duquesne University from Penn State Greater Allegheny. I have recently taken a 3 week summer course in order to catch up on my classes. In my time in the 3 week summer course, I have made new friends, learned my ethical framework for teaching, and had an amazing relationship with my caring professors. I hope to one day be like my professors when I go into the teaching career. In my short start to my academic career at Duquesne University, I enjoyed every moment and I am very excited for my next 3 years at Duquesne University."
Graduate Student,5,Duquesne University has a warm campus where everyone can feel included. The staff and fellow students help you to feel welcome and the professors are always willing to help you with understanding the information. They want to help you succeed through your studies.
Freshman,5,The atmosphere of Duquesne is inspiring and it feels so homey since everyone is accepting of everyone.
Sophomore,5,The online courses and instructors are excellent. I learned a lot and I'm grateful for the opportunity to continue my education.
Senior,5,"What I liked most about Duquesne is the city and its people. Pittsburgh is the most livable city in the United States, it has many activities every single day. The people at Duquesne are very personable, especially professors."
Sophomore,5,"I love Duquesne, excellent and friendly professors who actually care about your learning. Campus is beautiful all four seasons long.  And love the fact that it is in the heart off the city, which is easy to go any part of the Pittsburgh. Local area is safe and excellent."
Niche User,5,I like the overall atmosphere of the university along with its sport teams and reputation for going/graduating from there.
Freshman,5,I love the campus and the people are so nice the course for occupational therapy is a very good academic course
Freshman,5,"Duquesne is a great school, no lie! The campus is stunning and not too large so you don't have to leave super early for classes. Duquesne is very diverse and always has so many fun activities for all of the students. The only part I don't like all too well is the walk to Market Square- a place full of food fun and good food. Since Duquesne is an urban school (the green campus doesn't make it seem urban), the walk to Market Square is full of weird guys that ask for money, whistle at you, or just look at you the wrong way. Lucky for the students though, Pizza Milano, China Wok, TGI Friday's, etc is all within a short (and safe) walk. At first, Duquesne wasn't even on my list. However, my sister is an undergrad and grad school alumni and I am extremely happy that I chose to follow in her footsteps. I would truly reccommend this place to anyone."
Freshman,5,Best school ever. Great programs and great atmosphere. I am learning so much. I could not be happier here.
Freshman,5,I love the family feel that it has. Everyone is welcome at Duquesne. I would like to see the price of attendance be lowered.
Junior,5,I have loved my time so far at Duquesne University. The campus is beautiful and set in the city of Pittsburgh which allows for many different off campus opportunities. The professors seem to genuinely care about your experience and the course load is challenging but manageable.
Sophomore,5,"Duquesne University has a fantastic campus, comfortable dorms, and easy access to the local destinations.  The faculty is helpful and easily accessible."
Sophomore,5,"Duquesne creates the perfect atmosphere to further my education, because of the strong sense of community and support from staff."
Freshman,5,"For me this is really the right fit. It's big a enough that it doesn't feel like an ultra private boarding school, but it is also small enough that professors know you, and who you are. If you interested in forensics like me they're one of the few accredited schools with a program. Also the sciencescort in general are big on undergraduate research which I love. You could be a freshman, and be doing research in a lab. Overall it's a pretty great school honestly."
Alum,5,"It was a great place to study! It was not too big of a student population that I felt like a number,  however,  it was large enough  to not be known by every staff member on campus."
Freshman,5,"My experience has been great at Duquesne so far. I love having a small campus and close family of professors, students, and advisors. Everyone is so friendly and helpful towards everyone. While no matter where you go to college, you WILL get tired of the food. QUICK. But my biggest complaint is that there are rarely healthy options like fruit and vegetables available at EVERY meal. Having all the classes connected to the dorms by A-Walk helps when you are late and you have to get somewhere, you can always get across campus in about 15/20 minutes tops. Some events on campus are extremely fun to go to since it is a small campus there is always something going on for everyone to take part in."
College Freshman,5,"I've been told Duquesne is a great school over and over again by many people, I have grown to appreciate that u go here and I enjoy knowing that I for sure have a job when I graduate."
College Freshman,5,"So far I have started Duquesne University and love it, I can't even explain how much I enjoyed being there and meeting new people. It felt just like home but better. I was not lonely at all I saw people just like me who love to learn and have fun. The school is perfect for me and I can definitely see myself there for 4 years."
College Sophomore,5,Duquesne is a great place for am education! I had an awesome first year there and am looking forward to going back in the fall.
Freshman,4,"I think that considering everything that is going on, Duquesne is doing everything they can to allow each student to get as normal of an experience as possible. Professors are usually pretty good with giving breaks for Zoom classes so you're not on your computer all day every day, but it definitely is a lot better that we can be on campus and take our classes wherever we want to."
Freshman,4,"I am a Music Education Student at Duquesne and it provides unique opportunities compared to other schools. Because of the location, you have a lot at your fingertips and you begin going into classrooms your freshman year."
Freshman,4,It's about half and half for me. They're doing better than most on covid numbers. They've been doing good given the circumstances on COVID restrictions and testing
Freshman,4,So far my experience has been as good as it can be in theses times. The university is trying very hard to be proactive and keep the students on campus for the whole semester. They are providing in person classes as much as possible and trying to keep everyone safe by enforcing mask wearing.
Freshman,4,The university is trying very hard to provide a quality education in these trying times. They. Are trying to keep us on campus by being proactive.
Sophomore,4,Really nice campus and great education. Only bad thing about it is that it gets really cold in the winters in the city!
Junior,4,with everything going on in the world my professors made online school so much less stressful. they are always looking out for their students to be the best version of themselves
Senior,4,"I didn’t mind it. Although it was sudden, Duquesne was able to use Zoom to the best of its ability. I honestly would rather have an in person education, but with COVID-19, that was not an option"
Senior,4,I enjoyed my time at Duquesne. Most of the professors were easy to talk to if you had any troubles in class.
Junior,4,I like how there are many opportunities to explore and the support that they show I would like to see the dorm rooms a bit improved because many things are broken but other than that it’s a great experience!
Senior,4,The campus itself is beautiful and very well secured. Most of the professors are very enthusiastic about their subjects and the departments are very receptive to feedback. The sign-in policies are super strict. The food is average. But there is an infamous pizza place called Milano's that is just a five minute walk from campus.
Senior,4,For the most part the online experience is excellent. All but a few of the professors I've encountered are very organized and always available to help.
Sophomore,4,"Of course, learning online is more difficult than in-person classes. I much preferred classes in-person, but Duquesne and its professors did as much as they could to make the transition as easy as possible. Online learning was more difficult, especially when some professors did not utilize the live zoom calls since questions could not be asked in real-time. However, they were still open to communicating through private zoom calls or emails. I'm happy to say that I was still able to finish my semester on time and with perfect grades, but it took a lot of hard work and adjusting to a new way of learning."
Freshman,4,My professors worked very hard to make online classes work. They were very understanding to how difficult it was to go from in class to online.
Junior,4,"What I like most about Duquesne are the class sizes and student to teacher ratio. I also love how the campus feels like it is seperated from the city but still remains almost directly at the heart of Pittsburgh. There are great networking opportunities here and all of the professors have excellent experience in their fields. 
If there were anything I would like to change about Duquesne it would be the cost of parking on campus and the dorm situations. While the dorms are decent, I feel like we should be receiving more for the cost of what we pay. Besides those two things, there isn't much to complain about."
Sophomore,4,"The professors did the best they could do with the amount of time they were given to quickly change settings for this semester. I would much rather have un-person instruction, but the online classes sufficed for what needed to be done. The university also switched to Pass/No-Pass for classes which tremendously helped."
Sophomore,4,"It  is a great school academic wise, but the the rooming and dorm life there needs to be improved greatly."
Alum,4,"My overall experience at Duquesne University was amazing. The campus is beautiful and the faculty are truly there to help you succeed. As a minority student, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion helped me tremendously as well. The office was an irreplaceable resource that connected me with many great professionals in the Pittsburgh area, helped in my development as a leader, and introduced me to many of my lifelong friends."
Sophomore,4,"I wish there were more parties and groups for Indians to collaborate. Also, it would be great if they can have more food options on campus. Except the dining hall, there is incline, chick-a-fila, cinco cantina, incline and red ring bar and grill. That is all."
Alum,4,"Duquesne provided me with a rich educational and social experience. In addition, one of the main highlights for me was the location of the campus. It's nestled in a small pocket of the city, so it feels like you are in a different world, but the proximity to downtown and the different neighborhoods allowed me to not lose touch with the excitement of an urban environment. If there was a  downside for me, it was and still is the price."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, the level of education for the money is accurate. All the teachers are very knowledgeable on their subjects and lots of important research goes on here. The dining hall is decent, but the hours for everything food are weird. Most colleges have better hours for getting food, but the open times for food places on campus are odd."
Sophomore,4,"I like how the campus is secluded on the bluff, it allows students to feel as if it is separated from the city in a way. The view of the river and bridges from some of the dorm windows gives that stereotypical Pittsburgh vibe and it is beautiful in the changing seasons."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a Duquesne student. There are several things I like about Duquesne. First, it is not a large campus. I like the smaller atmosphere because, from a psychological standpoint, it is much less daunting. Additionally, I enjoy the fact that teachers attempt to learn students' names. This creates a very positive atmosphere in which students feel welcomed and comfortable."
Graduate Student,4,"Studying at Duquesne has been a great experience. I love all of my classes and the professors are extremely supportive. Each class and the assignments in the class are purposeful and meaningful. The only things I would change about this university is the extremely high cost and the communication between departments. I couldn't pass up such a great program, however, the cost is a big hit to my future plans. The communication between departments need to be more fluid and clear so as to not create unnecessary difficulties for students that are paying so much to attend the university."
Junior,4,"Duquesne University was the perfect fit for me. I come from a very small town, graduating with only 63 kids. At Duquesne, I have had the opportunity to experience small classroom sizes and personal connections with all my peers and professors. Above all, the academics here at top notch. I have learned so much in just my 3 years here."
Senior,4,"I like Duquesne University for it's park-like campus but it is in the middle of a city. It is very safe with its police force right on campus. The community at Duquesne is very warm and accepting. The one thing I would like for it to change is the way we are only allowed to sign people in before midnight if they want to sleep over, or before 2 am if they are not staying the night. Overall, my 4 years on this campus have been unforgettable."
Graduate Student,4,"Duquesne is located in a nice area of Pittsburgh. Short walks to Market Square, the Cultural District, South Side, and is located right next to the T station which can be ridden free to North Shore. All of the Professors, especially in the science department, are very personable and willing to work with all of their students."
Senior,4,"I have had an overall good experience at Duquesne University.  The academics at Duquesne are rigorous, but attainable with hard work.  The professors, advisors, and staff are always willing to help students out so they can reach their goals.  While tuition is more expensive than most schools, the small class sizes help students receive individual attention.  I have always felt valued at Duquesne and genuinely enjoy studying at this university.  The campus is incredibly safe and welcoming, and being located in the city allows for many opportunities, both professionally and socially."
Junior,4,"Duquesne is a great school without many major downfalls. I would like to see more diversity in the student body, and the quality of food could be improved, especially in Hogan Dining Center. Overall, Duquesne feels like home and is very welcoming to all of its students. Faculty, staff, and the student body are all very friendly, and there are a lot of opportunities for student involvement on campus. I also love how Duquesne is situated so close to downtown Pittsburgh while still being geographically separate by its location on the bluff."
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus feel while still being right in the city of Pittsburgh! It doesn't feel like you're living in the city because of Duquesne's college-atmosphere campus, but all the city living is less than five minutes away so there's so much to do."
Senior,4,"Ideal location, feels like a secluded college campus in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh. Faculty in the chemistry department are fantastic and take the time to work with students one on one. Professors care about the success of their students, and the smaller size creates a more personalized experience for students to learn."
Senior,4,"I love the environment. The people and the professors care so much about education and the wellbeing of the world. Personally I come from a smaller knit major and every professor of mine knows me personally and is always pushing me towards success. The same cannot be said about the higher up administration. It’s really sad how much they only care about money. My professors and colleagues deserve more the for the work they put in. The work and heart they put in is what makes Duquesne a wonderful place to learn, not the administration."
Junior,4,"I like the school being in the city but still kind of private. The professors are generally nice and really push you in academics. The people and the atmosphere here is still very clique-y like in high school, which is what I wanted to get away from personally."
Junior,4,"Education wise, I can't think of a more enriching school to be in. That being said, diversity and individuality at the university is extremely lacking. The cost of attendance is also through the roof. I would like to see more diversity on campus and a smaller price tag."
Junior,4,"Duquesne has quickly become my second home! It’s academics are amazing, the dorms are good, and the location is perfect. There are definitely cliques, which can be frustrating and it can be hard to make new friends, especially out of your major. Overall, I would not go anywhere other than Duquesne and I love everything it has brought me!"
Senior,4,"Duquesne has been a great place to call home for 4 years. I am staying for graduate school. My decision was based off the area, academics, and overall experience."
Freshman,4,Duquesne is a great school to attend if you love an urban atmosphere and great community. The entire school is very friendly and eager to help get where you want to go in life. The staff is very friendly and very helpful and the professors are great to work with and want you to actually learn the information. Being a smaller school they teach in a high school like environment which is really nice.
Junior,4,"I love that each program at Duquesne focuses specifically on making sure students are as prepared an competent, both professionally and academically, for their profession. Duquesne has a wonderful community feel and a place for everyone to find a community within the larger community. I do wish that as a student body we had more school spirit and that sporting events were more of an event to attend."
Freshman,4,Duquesne University challenges you to manage your time and get all of your assignments done. The workload is a lot and sometimes you have to stay up extremely late every night.
Freshman,4,"I like the atmosphere and the city/location that it is in. One thing I do not like is how small it is, and that the athletics are not bigger (football games)."
Sophomore,4,"I love Duquesne as it is the perfect platform to learn and grow. Your degree means more than just a piece of paper when it comes from Duquesne, and the lessons you learn while attending the university both academically and environmentally couldn’t better prepare you for the “real world” one must face after graduating. It is an easy place to succeed both extracurricularly and academically, with various opportunities in both spectrums. Duquesne also hires impeccable staff, who go above and beyond not only to attend to the personal needs of each student but to make it his or her personal goal to watch their students succeed, and to play a major role in that success."
Sophomore,4,"Duquesne has a great small college feel, right in the heart of Pittsburgh.  The staff is all very helpful and care about the students at the school."
Junior,4,"I think Duquesne is wonderful, especially for the city it’s in. The professors have mostly been dedicated and the smaller size really makes it known that I’m valued as a person and that they want the best for me. The only drawback is typically everyone knows each other from previous schools already so distance students can feel a little left out at first. However, as long as you become social and go to some of the many extracurricular programs Duq offers, you will do great!"
Sophomore,4,"I am a pre-med student majoring in Biology/Physics.  The program, advisors, professors, and atmosphere for learning and obtaining your goals is conducive to sucess!!"
Graduate Student,4,"This university is among the top ranked in Pennsylvania and in the nation due to its very high quality and focused education in a variety of concentrations. The most noticeable highlights are the business and nursing schools. Apart from consistently being top ranked, Pittsburgh is among the top most livable cities and is a business/technology and health care giant. This school is very-well connected and is extremely generous with tuition value."
Sophomore,4,Duquesne is a diverse school in the heart of Pittsburgh which makes the off campus life very fascinating. It has great academics and sports
Sophomore,4,"One change that I would like to see on campus is the school push for an acceptance of non-religious students.  The school promotes its association with the Spiritan faith almost more than some of the academic programs, and someone like me who isn't religious feels out of place sometimes.  So if the school can focus on more inclusion, than it would improve drastically."
Sophomore,4,Very fun and inclusive and safe campus most teachers are very willing to help and flexible. as long as you take initiative you will have a great experience.
Graduate Student,4,"It's a fairly good University, it fit what I went to school for as a graduate student. I was really looking for a place where I could focus on practicing as I aspire to be a performing musician, without too much course work that would get in the way."
Sophomore,4,"There are readily available tutors which is nice, academically there are high expectations but teachers are always willing to help. Aside from academics I have made many friends and living in a city is very enjoyable."
Senior,4,Duquesne has a great SLP program and allows me the opportunity to achieve my educational and career goals. I have made great friends and have had opportunities to grow in many aspects of my life.
Sophomore,4,"I feel as though the education I am receiving currently at Duquesne University is of great quality.  The class sizes allow me to get to know most of my professors and feel comfortable asking for help when I need it.  Duquesne's campus is the perfect size for me and I feel comfortable and safe here.  Overall, my experience at Duquesne has been great so far."
Alum,4,"I love how Duquesne University is in the heart of the city of downtown Pittsburgh. There is always something to do whether it be a sporting event or going out to eat. You can reach other parts of the city such as South Side or Mt Washington in minutes. The campus is safe with police at all times. Even though the campus is in the heart of the city, it is closed off on its own, which gives it a private school charm."
Junior,4,"Duquesne is a decent school, with a well known reputation.  My biggest complaint would be that for the high price we pay towards on campus housing, there should be nicer dorms and more options for suite style living.  It would be nice if the current food locations on campus were larger because the liens can get so long that you are left with only five minutes to scarf down your food before your next class."
Senior,4,"I have loved attending Duquesne.  However, I feel that sophomore and junior years are the only times your social life is real.  Freshmen year it is hard to find your friends since it is such a small school and you associate with everyone.  By the time senior year comes, you are tired of seeing all the same people."
Freshman,4,Duquesne is a very nice school in one of the nicest cities I've ever lived in. The campus provides a great way to commune with peers and professors alike while providing every amenity needed on campus.
Niche User,4,"Very lively, beautiful campus. Easy to meet new people and get to class on time with a small campus. Academics are great, some professors are very enthusiastic. All science professors are very qualified. Surrounding city and neighborhoods make exploring options endless. School is very expensive"
Senior,4,"I think Duquesne has a great environment, great student life, and a lot of great opportunities. The chances to network, being right in the city, are outstanding. I have had a few questionable teachers that I am not to fond of but a few great teachers that have inspired me to be what I am today."
Freshman,4,It's a great school that provides many opportunities to students and staff. It is a beautiful urban campus that gives their students a feel of the city in their backyard.
Freshman,4,"The classrooms/academics are great. The school is very diverse and welcoming. However, the buildings could use some renovations. The bathrooms in the residence halls aren’t the best and the actual dorms have a few problems as well."
Sophomore,2,This school is not diverse. It's super cliquey and just like high school all over again. It does not build character but instead tries to mold you to be like the majority of the students. Diversity and creativity is not embraced but instead makes you feel like an outlier.
Sophomore,2,Residence Life needs to be less controlling. Dorms feel like prisons and they treat you like high schoolers.
Freshman,2,"Diversity is a joke, my room mate was reacially profiled by the front desk because he forgot his card in his room, even though I vouched for him the campus police still ended up being called. They would not let him file a complaint either because they refused to give out anyones information involved in the situation. The people here are a bunch of rich kids spending riding in mom and dads car who they visit on the weekend because there is nothing to do here. Partying is greek oriented entirely and it is clique oriented. The food is alright but many say it is awful. The professors are often good but they do not offer help you have to get help if you want it. Overpriced for the experience it provides, the rules are incredibly outdated and religiously oriented. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE IT SUCKS"
Sophomore,2,"If your parents aren't paying for it, don't go here. Overall the professors are pretty good, however the administration is unhelpful and unkind, I haven't gone to one office here and got a result, they are all useless; unless your dad comes in and complains for you, nothing will be done. After they get you in the door, they could care less if you leave or if you have a problem. The area is good for later when you get internships, but by then most people live off campus anyway. Downtown is dead after 8, and any parties are at Pitt or CMU. ROI is not worth it if you are going in to debt going here, Pitt's tuition is 1/2 the cost of Duquesne."
Junior,2,Bad food. Bad people. Bad dorms. NO diversity. Good location. Good campus. Good professors. Way too expensive for what you actually get. It's just overall been a terrible experience. I've been trying to get out since day one and I know so many people who have felt same.
Freshman,2,"This was my safe school, but I ended up coming here due to the substantial financial aid that was offered and its proximity to home. This school isn't horrible, but if you are truly not in love with it in the first place, you never will be. In classes you will feel like you aren't progressing to the level you should be, like you're still in high school. If you're looking to be entertained during the week or the weekend do not bother to come here! This place turns into a ghost town since most students are from Pittsburgh they go home on weekends so they don't have to sit around in their dorms. No parties happen unless you're involved in Greek Life and occasionally go to mixers, but Greek Life here isn't the way it is at bigger schools. Also there is absolutely NO school pride. Overall Duquesne is the school you choose if you're not ready to leave home yet or have real life experiences."
Sophomore,2,Classes are hard but Dookaners rlly no how to party I was at a really big dorm party the other day and I was having fun!
Junior,2,Duquesne has some good things to offer and also really bad things but I'm sure every college is like that. Id say the worst thing about Duquesne is the dorms.
Sophomore,2,To any kids who didn't have friends In high school and didn't get invited to any parties I have the school for you. Duquesne University I home to the regents of every highschool and is filled with annoying friend groups of freshman who cannot hold their drinks. Wanna use the bathroom? nope they have throwup  all over the seats because of some kid who thought he could finish 5 drinks in an hour (I know for most people thats not a lot but for the kids at this school 5 drinks can last them a semester)
Freshman,2,This was my safety school I got a big scholarship so I felt I had got come and I really regret my decision I m really not a fan of this school. Some of the people are great and I made a couple off friends but honestly there iS nothing to do even though you're in the city this city is kinda the worst city ever to exist
Sophomore,2,Overall this school is nice I like some of the teachers and my friends but theres not much it has to offer. My brother is still trying to get a job after graduating and he's 26. now I'm scared
Freshman,2,This isn't really the school you go to if you expect to get a good education or have a great social life. More of the school for the creepy high school kids who could never make friends.
Freshman,2,I transferred out of this college two years ago and I'm really shocked with the grades they get. Do not be deceived this is not an A party school it should rated as a C- for parties (if your a senior). Teachers are nice and school is clean but dorms are small and not fun to live in.
Sophomore,2,"Overall this school is pretty boring me and my friend usually go to Pitt to find parties which are somewhat fun, but a lot of the time get busted or don't let us in. Also the teachers here kinda suck its hard to get a good teacher. Woukldnt reccomened this school for any fun people who need to party or anyone who wants to work outside of pgh when they're older"
Freshman,2,"I would get why someone would love to go to Duq. Its campus is in downtown Pitt, class sizes are small, and the professors are cool. However everything else sucks. If your not trendy or a part of greek life you may have a hard time finding your place. I have met some of the best people here but I have mainly found some of the worst. The party scene is a lot different from other colleges. You can tell the difference from the type of people that attend Duq from those who attend a school like Pitt. You will have more fun at parties in Oakland and the people are nicer. Good luck finding a move if you or your friends don't know people. The guest policies are out of date and irritating. When theres campus events no one knows about them or no one cares. If you are looking for a college big on sports DONT come here. If this school wasn't in the middle of downtown, I would have left awhile ago. It's not worth the cost. I could go to a better college for half the price and better social scene."
College Junior,2,No one cares about sports. No school spirit.
College Freshman,2,"Dorms kind of stink... no kitchens on the floors, small bathrooms, overpriced, old fashioned, etc."
College Junior,2,"Campus housing isn't too bad. Most of the buildings are recently built or renovated so on campus housing is pretty nice. However, the freshman buildings are a little old and run down, but still decent compared to most places. The really bad part of on campus living is the rules. Duquesne has hundreds of rules to make the lives of their students miserable. They make it nearly impossible for high school friends to come visit and stay over (especially if they are of the opposite sex)."
College Junior,2,They have a lot of rules that are frustrating to deal with as a grown adult.
College Junior,2,No one really pays attention to sports.  The only sport that is attended is basketball and it's still not popular.
College Sophomore,2,Very expensive and poor overall quality
College Sophomore,2,"Strict rules, but decent room quality"
College Senior,2,There are not many food options.  I only could ever find certain foods that I enjoyed eating and had to resort to eating the same thing sometimes several nights in a row.  When at school I never ate a very balanced diet.
College Sophomore,2,The administration can't seem to get out of its own way. What they value as important and what a majority of the student body and increasing number of people in the country find important or needs to be changed or on very different ends of the spectrum.
College Freshman,2,"If you live on campus, prepare for an extremely hard time when it comes to strict authorities. Although campus police normally don't get involved, the RA's and RD's are terrible when it comes to alcohol, noise complaints, and visitation. I wouldn't recommend having more than four or five people in the dorm while drinking because the RA's WILL catch you while doing rounds. As for visitation in freshman dorms, especially St. Ann's, getting anybody of the opposite sex into your dorm is such a hassle. And they are unable to stay the night, which is a pretty ridiculous rule."
College Junior,2,"I am graduate student, no scholarship for any of us."
College Freshman,2,"There are many options, but it is easy to get tired of the food quickly.  There are not many healthy options, unless you like eating salad breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  The meal plans cost a lot.  If you're going to choose one, I suggest one with the highest Flex and lowest amount of meals.  Flex can be used on way more than meals, and even if you eat 2x a day on the meal plan you are likely to have some left over at the end of the semester.  Good luck if you're vegan, there is a station but it is very limited.  Red Ring is a good restaurant to eat at when you get tired of eating at the dining hall, but it uses a lot of Flex.  Your options are the Incline, Options, and Towers Dining Hall for day-to-day eating."
College Senior,2,"Duquesne isn't known for its sports. Basketball is the biggest thing, but the size of the football field is a joke."
College Senior,2,"As they are accepting more students throughout the years, the amount of parking has not changed, making it difficult to find a spot. Parking passes are the best way to go if you have the money, there is always a spot in locust (locus is for permit holders only). Forbes garage is what the commuters usually purchase, but it can fill up fast because Forbes garage is open to the public. Surface parking is a gamble, not guaranteed, and not much cheaper than the garage, so just buy a garage pass. If you live in South Side, there is a shuttle that runs Monday - Friday from 7 am to 10 pm."
College Senior,2,I personally do not like Greek life but if it is for you then it is def something to get involved with
College Sophomore,2,rooms wouldn't be half bad if forced triples weren't a thing. no room to expand and build/buy a new building for residencies. but lots of options for living off campus
College Senior,2,"The Duquesne History Department is very focused on American history - which is great for all the secondary education majors but it's horrible for the few history majors at the school. The History Department offers a very limited selection of classes on European history and only about two classes per semester on non-European history. This is a very backwards, unhelpful attitude and education for the current world. I thought college was supposed to broaden your horizons. How is learning about American Decorative Arts broadening my horizons? (Yes, that is a class being offered this semester, and as far as I know, students are taking it.) If you ignore the limited course offerings, then Duquesne does offer a decent history program with good professors and training for further education or entering the work force. The classes are small enough that you can have a good relationship with the professors and get help if you need. My advice would be come to Duquesne if you like American history, but don't bother for other interests."
College Freshman,2,No parties on campus. People go to Pitt and have fun
College Freshman,2,I got no financial aid
College Sophomore,2,"All rich white kids. On the rare occasion of having a black person in class, the first question asked os ""Which sports team are you on?"""
College Sophomore,2,"Most people take more pride in their home teams and attend games for the Steelers, Pirates, and Pens since we are downtown and they are easily accessible. However, some people do attend Duquesne sporting events, but usually for the sole reason that they have a friend on the team."
College Freshman,2,"It's expensive not to eat in the dining hall and the dining hall options and hours are not friendly to students hectic schedule. Additionally, finding healthy options at times was very challenging. Besides salad at off-ramp, the choices were really few and far between. Lastly, I'm a pescatarian and was very turned off to the seafood offered on campus. Unfortunately for me, there were also a very limited number of vegetarian options available, especially on the weekends."
College Senior,2,Parking is expensive in garages near to campus.  I park at meters on the street and walk quickly to and from my car at night.
College Sophomore,2,The housing lottery has gotten worse over the years since the amount of students in each class is increasing. This year it was honestly a nightmare but in the end it all worked out for everyone.
Recent Alumnus,2,Students are more concerned with studying and working out than they are with the sports on campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,The school has little diversity.
College Freshman,2,"Don't come here if you are looking for a lot of school spirit and varsity sports.  It is a small school with very average sports teams, games are not heavily attended."
College Junior,2,This school cost a lot.
College Freshman,2,"The athletic teams themselves are good, but the student body does not attend many of their games. Athletic attendance is not a big part of student involvement. At times, it seems like more people from the surrounding area, public, and alumni attend more games then current students. If there is an important game, then students will come out and show their spirit, but not for every game."
College Freshman,2,"The shuttles are always convenient to use, but they are only available on Friday and Saturday nights. Unlike, the University of Pittsburgh, we do not have free public transportation. This causes some hassle when trying to leave campus and get to different locations around Pittsburgh. Market Square is within walking distance, but there is only so much that one can do there. The availability to get around Pittsburgh is not there. For me, paying for taxi and bus fares is not ideal, and I am stuck on campus for the most part."
College Junior,2,Too cold for my liking. Good amount of snow.
College Freshman,2,"Most people must go to University Of Pitt or far off campus to find parties, the transportation provided to other places on the weekends are unreliable and lacking."
College Sophomore,2,Student involvement in athletics is lacking.  Nobody really attends games because we are not very good.  
College Freshman,2,"Definitely bring your own computer.  There are plenty of labs available but they get filled quickly.  The labs are also the only places you can print unless you bring your own printer so make sure to have a USB or ability to email documents to yourself. The wireless is spotty and cuts out a lot.  When it doesn't work, it is among one of the largest complaints on campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The network was constantly slow and having problems and there is hardly any wifi. Connecting to the network was always fun, since you never knew if you would be able to submit any online homework or not."
College Freshman,2,Drugs and alcohol are used frequently and extremely obviously but no authority figures seem to care.
College Freshman,2,"The walk ways are lit, but very poorly and walking at night can be very scary."
College Freshman,2,I chose this college randomly because I did not know where to go to college. I regret that.
College Freshman,2,Not very much school spirt.
College Sophomore,2,I do not have a car on campus because it is very expensive
College Sophomore,2,They are not too strict in the dorms if you hide the containers and act normal.  The police will breathalyze obnoxious drunk people so just don't act stupid.
College Sophomore,2,"Some dorms are ok, some are far from updated. The process is obnoxious and often not fair to the upper classmen."
College Junior,2,"Being a catholic school, there actually isn't much diversity on campus. Most the students are white with other ethnicities only comprising a small percentage. Furthermore, religion is mainstreamed into class teachings but is probably not the populated view among the students."
College Sophomore,2,"It rains and snows a lot in Pittsburgh so that tends to keep people indoors. The weather also changes multiple times throughout the day so don't be surprised if you get caught in a storm on what seemed to be a beautiful day. I find that the sky is never really clear and i'm convinced that the city has abnormally high amounts of pollution,"
College Sophomore,2,"There are lot of options around campus, but none of them are necessarily in walking distance. Duquense provides some shuttle transportation, but it would be hard to live off campus without a car or a bus pass."
Freshman,1,this place is disgusting and so are all the weird freaks at it dont come here if you want your sanity
Freshman,1,This school sucks. Nobody normal goes here and everyone just decides to urinate wherever they please and I'm not even kidding this is actually the weirdest school ever worst year of my life by far.
Junior,1,Just to be honest nobody deserves to go through this hell of a college this place is horribly boring and will only make you depressed and angry.
Freshman,1,"Only fun if you have connections , but still if you have connections its not even that fun just goes you an excuse to drink with a couple of people in a house at Southside no parties really happen in this school but sexual harassment still somehow occurs almost every weekend on. campus... people drink in for rooms and then get fined."
Freshman,1,If you're thinking of going to Duquesne  make sure you Read this... the on y reason this school is rated an A for party scene is because of how many bars there are(it says so on the website). But its important you know that you will not get into nay of these bars unless you have a real ID WITH A PICTURE OF YOUR FACE..youll be embarrassed if you use someone else...ive tried.... there are frats but a party happens once a month other than the first week of class... this school is rated way too high but if you are a senior it is fun (why go through three miserable years of school for one fun year though????)
Freshman,1,"doesn't really have anything to offer except a degree, but I love being close to home so I can't really complain I go home most weekends cause nothing happens here"
Junior,1,we had 2 sexual harassment emails within the first 4 weeks of school so I feel this is the perfect school for anyone to go to if you liked to be grabbed unwillingly
Freshman,1,Go to Pitt. this school is not worth going to because youll be spending money on Ubers to go to Oakland every weekend anyway might as well save your money because nothing happens at Duquesne
Freshman,1,The worst part about this school is the teachers who barely show up on time to class and don't care about students... I guess Duquesne makes up for their horrible curriculum by having one frat party maybe once a month! also don't think youll get into any bars until you're 21...being a freshman sophomore or junior here is like be a high school freshman
Freshman,1,I HATE THIS SCHOOL MORE THAN I HATE ANYTHING ELSE......... ANYTHING...... EVEN CATS...... AND WHO DONT HATE CATS
Freshman,1,gross parties no freshmen or sophomores know how to handle myself and everyone was clearly a freak in hs...people at Pitt are normal though
Freshman,1,I got foot fungus the first week and I walks wore shower shoes this place es mad gross. Id rather lick a dirty public stairwell railing than go back here.
Sophomore,1,The teachers all suck here. but you know who suck more the students..... do not go random roommate I cannot stress that enough.
Freshman,1,"If youre looking for a bunch of people who hated high school because they were creepy and not invited anywhere this is the school for you. The party scene is pretty pathetic I used to go out and now I cannot stand it so I just stay back and hang out with friends. This school seems pretty fun is your above 21, otherwise its really not at all. Also the people who go here didn't really didn't go out or just were not invited anywhere in highschool because nobody knows their limit.....yea a bunch of overly drunk freshmen in a party is not the party you wanna go to... trust me....also the dining situation has made me feel like I'm starving myself. what kind of dining hall closes for 4 hours in the middle of the day? A lot pf people do like this college, but honestly the people who do like it make me regret my college decision."
Freshman,1,I wish I could rate this horrible school worse than this!!! THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE DO NOT COME HERE I BEG YOU!!!! no parties dining hall is always closed and sucks!
Freshman,1,"If you are considering Duquesne don't. If you want to eat the same food every single day then sure come here. If you hate parties and like to sit in your dorm all day surrounded by materialistic students, then this is the place for you. Not worth it unless you're a pharmacy student or health science major. Most of the majors don't help you further your career because teachers like to do the bare minimum. I am a nursing major and all my professors just like to put on movies and call it a day while my parents are paying thousands of dollars for me to learn material. Don't consider this school if you're actually looking to succeed in a career."
Junior,1,Ive been at this horrible school now for 3 years and heres my experience. All my friends go to other schools because I made a huge mistake coming here and a bigger mistake not transferring. The teachers suck other than Mrs. Stanger and the people all have something wrong with them. This s school is so cliquey so you will NOT make new friends so if your planning on going to this school the better option would be to pull the trigger.
Freshman,1,"EVERYTHING about this school is terrible. If you dopnt have at least 20 friends going here already, then good luck going out cause I have about 8 here and we never go out. It. Is. Horrible. The teachers are insanely stupid and the classes are insanely difficult and don't help you earn anything important for your future career. I have wasted almost half a year of my life at Duquesne already and felt I needed to share. DO NOT COME TO THIS SCHOOL!!!!!"
Niche User,1,"Duquesne is a great school
if you are white, straight and Catholic. The student body is mostly middle class- not wealthy. Wealthy students attend Old prestigious universities, not Duquesne. ""Other"" students can fit in if they're willing to laugh at offensive jokes, be stereotyped by professors and peers  and don't mind being the token friend. Greek life is present but most sororities are back biting, two-faced organizations. The food is awful and the sports teams are losers. Run away fast, it's not worth the money."
College Junior,1,"Duquesne is a school for a very specific type of person and if you don't fit into that category, your chances of enjoying your time at Duquesne are not good. It's a pretty boring school until you are 21 and can go to South Side. The academics are decent, but not prestigious. The students don't have any school spirit at all. The type of people I would recommend to Duquesne are wealthy and materialistic people who are interested in greek life and can afford the overwhelming tuition cost."
College Junior,1,The greek life is typical cliquey behavior. Sororities are big but fraternities are not as much.
College Sophomore,1,"Most Greeks are hypocritical, have little respect for themselves, other people, and especially non-Greeks, and too many of them are self-entitled, snobby brats"
College Sophomore,1,Financial aid comes mostly in the form of loans. Few or no grants are given by the school and scholarships are based on academics.
College Sophomore,1,"It's a complete rip off. The food sucks, and everyone runs out of FLEX dollars a few weeks in. The campus doesn't allow you to transfer meal swipes, and from then on you are limited by meal times and portion sizes. If you want to buy a box of cereal to keep in your room from campus market, expect to pay $8 for a small box. It's just bad all around."
College Senior,1,"I think frats should be banned.  They are usually nothing more than a group of people whose lives are fueled on alcohol abuse, tormenting others and raping innocent women."
College Freshman,1,Do not come here. This place is the absolute worse. Your peers are judgmental rich kids. Your teachers are the stingy old variety. Your dorms are covered in asbestos and have not been renovated in 50 years. Your prospects after graduation are limited to the pittsburgh area.
College Freshman,1,"The campus buildings are primarily built from old parking garages, no joke. That's a little something they don't tell you on the college visits."
College Freshman,1,Its a very cliquish school so people try to avoid public spaces where they might see someone different from themselves.
College Freshman,1,"The professors are a reflection of the university, old , stingy, white men"
College Freshman,1,No variety and a good reflection of american obesity culture.
College Freshman,1,If you want to get a job outside of the city of pittsburgh this is not the place for you. Be ready to spend the rest of your life here if you do not pursue grad school at another location.
College Freshman,1,Pathetic classes that could be taught in a local middle school
College Freshman,1,"Well lets see since having fun is a sin its a bit difficult to get a buzz, especially without being judged by every condescending mama's boy on campus."
College Freshman,1,The university spends everyone's tuition on these pathetic teams that cannot even garner national recognition. Thanks again Duquesne for spending my money well
College Freshman,1,"Pittsburgh, the Cleveland of Pennsylvania"
College Freshman,1,Its very difficult to keep a car on campus and the public transit in the city is appalling.
College Freshman,1,No where to turn up. Mainly because duquesne hates fun
College Freshman,1,"It was a rather confusing and irritating process. It's almost like they don't want to give you any discounts. Oh wait, they don't because they are a bunch of greedy administrators getting high on the hog."
College Freshman,1,"An absolute ripoff. Antiquated dorms that have not been renovated in years, yet still cost north of $10,000 a year to live in."
College Freshman,1,A ridiculous amount of core classes makes life a living hell
College Freshman,1,"If you are not a white, rich, catholic chances are you will be ostracized."
College Freshman,1,"No drugs whatsoever because expanding your mind isn't allowed on campus. Drinking is also strongly discouraged. If one is caught drinking they are forced to attend D.U. cares, a pathetic attempt at alcoholics anonymous, because drinking is a cardinal sin for these religious buffs."
College Freshman,1,"Very expensive, really no point in bringing a car to campus unless you want to shell out hundreds of dollars. Of course that's not a big problem for most of the rich, judgmental, and sheltered kids who go here, they simply ask their parents for more money."
College Freshman,1,Unreliable internet speed and connection.
College Freshman,1,Don't go here if you ever intend to switch fields. Changing from liberal arts to pharmacy for example would be next to impossible and would mean at least another year of college.
College Freshman,1,"Many of the students at Duquesne University come from affluent upper-middle/lower-upper class families.  Since this is a Catholic Institution, there is also a large majority of students who come from Catholic High Schools which tends to make the student population seem a tad bit conceited.  The school itself is 97% Caucasian and the only minority students are those with large scholarships."
College Sophomore,1,The campus market is so overpriced and a complete rip off to students using their flex dollars.  The new dining hall is nice but the options are generally the same everyday.
College Sophomore,1,Duquesne doesn't give out a lot of money...especially to the more popular majors.
College Senior,1,This school is strict especially living on campus. From having people come over to alcohol sign in. Everythingggg
College Senior,1,They're strict about visitation in the regular dorms people of the opposite sex can't stay the night.  In the on-campus apartments anyone can stay over but visitation is limited to two nights per week
College Freshman,1,Do not eat at towers. They don't even let you double swipe anymore at options and offramp. Either stock up on ramen or prepare to be eating a lot of milanos or POD food.
College Freshman,1,"There is a good amount of mixture of students but it scattered across campus. Majority of the students here are white and at least three percent are black, but they are mostly athletes."
College Freshman,1,There is a majority of caucasian at Duquesne. There are very little other raaces and many of them come from a catholic background
College Freshman,1,"There is a loop bus on the weekends but it is always crowded and almost impossible to catch. Sometimes it comes, sometimes it does not. Public transportation is always available but it is expensive to take."
College Senior,1,"Get There Early! Forbes is public parking and Locust, attached, is private for Duquesne only. It's expensive but comparable to other parking garages. However, when Forbes is full, the overflow goes into Locust and Locust is already oversold. If you get past 9 am, you're not going to get a spot lower than the 9th level!"
College Freshman,1,"Kind of  Miserable Here – I came to Duquesne because it was between this school, which was close to me and offered me a hefty scholarship, or and expensive school that was far away. So...it was obvious that I had to choose Duquesne. I hate it here for the most part. People are very rude and cliquey; if you aren't exactly like them, they aren't nice to you. There are some exceptions to that, of course, but for the most part it holds true. The dining plan is kind of messed up. Most importantly, they don't have a good program for my major. The only thing that keeps me sane are the student groups and activities, although that is a bit of a source of my upset sometimes. I also like the local atmosphere, and being so close to so many great places to visit/eat/shop.

Don't let my experience scare you, though; almost everyone else I know adores Duquesne. You'll probably like Duquesne if you love to party, are studying Business or anything involving Medicine, and find it easy to fit into groups/molds. I don't, so obviously I'm unhappy here. Just know that most students love it."
College Freshman,1,"Loop Bus – The school is the only school in the city that does not have city (Port Authority) bus passes for their students. The school offers a Loop Bus but it only runs on Friday and Saturday from 5:00 pm - 2:00 am and it has limited locations and only runs every hour. The first few weeks, catching the loop bus is not too difficult, but good luck after that. If you are lucky enough to catch it, then good luck getting on it, because chances are there are already 50 people packed into the tiny bus. They give phone numbers to contact the bus, but after the first few weeks they stop answering and the phones are always off, or if they do answer they always give an inaccurate answer. Usually we wind up giving up on the loop bus and take a cab or the city bus if it is snowing or raining (as it often is in Pittsburgh) or walk if it is nice out/if we don't have to walk through the hill district."

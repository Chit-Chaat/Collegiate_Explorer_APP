Niche User,5,Bethel University seems like a great place and I'm looking forward to enrolling there. I love the location and the scenery.
Alum,5,"I did not take any courses online while I attended Bethel. However, being a student-athlete made class attendance difficult at times. The resources to get work done while I was traveling or on the road made the learning experience much better for me."
Sophomore,5,"I love the community and deep discussions; they pull no punches in holding conversations that are both meaningful and practical. Furthermore, the professors are encouraging and extremely insightful. I've made so many amazing friends and learned so many things about life and myself! I can't recommend my wonderful school highly enough. Pick up a copy of our newspaper if you stop by. :)"
Alum,5,"I loved my Bethel experience. The professors and staff all care about you as a person, and I felt academically challenged in my field. The school makes an effort to have student activities every weekend, but also leaves room for students to take leadership roles and grow themselves."
Niche User,5,"Bethel University is really great places to attend, because most of professional and advisor are really nice.  Also, students are really friendly and if you need help you can ask them too and they will help you without hesitating."
Freshman,5,Bethel University is a college were you find life longs friends. The teachers are amazing and they care about you and they want to know who you are and they want to help you me successful in your career and they want the best for you.
Freshman,5,It’s a really great school here. I love the environment that the faculty members create for students here. Classes also don’t have many students so it’s easy to get one-on-one with the teachers and receive better help with our studies.
Freshman,5,"I adore the atmosphere at BU--the professors, the students, and life on campus all support me in my pursuit of education to a degree I did not expect. I thought I would feel pressured by my peers to let academics take a backseat compared to social life, but all of my classmates have really pushed me to do my best in each class and supported my love of learning. I also thought I wouldn't feel seen by my professors on a personal level but I have been overwhelmed with how my professors have taken the time to personally invest in me. Overall, I've loved my experience at BU so far and am looking forward to finishing my degree there."
Sophomore,5,Bethel has one of the most beautiful campuses and most caring staff of any college campus that I've attended or visited. They have a wide array of available majors and great opportunities for undergrads and grad students alike.
Senior,5,"Bethel University is a nice, little university that all the professors know your name and you feel so invited and welcomed here."
Niche User,5,"For the bad reviews.. All were about the ""sexuality"" policies, the weather, or the nightlife.. Let's use common sense here. This is a PRIVATE CHRISTIAN COLLEGE in Indiana. You agree to live a Christian lifestyle before attending classes, and really?.. Indiana is cold.. and Christian schools are not for partying/homosexuality.

As a student, Bethel has been great! Everyone I have dealt with, from professors to administration, have been great. The work is manageable, and I have yet to feel overwhelmed, outside of waiting last second for a few assignments. For us less-strict Christians, Bethel only requires 2-3 Christian courses, and they can often transfer as literature courses (the Bible is a book), but are still reasonable. 

Bethel has one of the best transfer policies in the country, and will take most classes/experience out there. It's not the cheapest school around, but is still a non-profit evangelical school, and does missions, etc.,  still competitive to most private schools."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman in college at the moment. Overall I have had a great experience at Bethel College, because of the amazing hands on professors. They will work with you one on one when you are struggling in the class. Not only are the professors great, but I love how I am able to express my faith while attending Bethel. Not only do we have chapel three times a week, but we always do devotions at the beginning of every class. I love the supportive atmosphere and never feel judged being myself."

Junior,5,"The facility is an extremely nice facility. There is high diversity on campus. The community is full of love and focusing on others rather than yourself. The professors encourage their students to take learning to a new level, to step out on their own in their field. They give many resources to encourage students to a new level of academia. The campus is gorgeous and there are so many opportunities to get connected with people, especially at the beginning of the year. Your teachers will meet with you 1 on 1 and do their best to help you pass every class with the highest grade possible. Not a place where there is parties that include drinking."
Junior,5,"Small town feel campus, liberal arts college. The people are excellent. The professors are great. It’s kind of pricy!"
Alum,5,"This college changed my life for the better.  I was in a very dark place before moving to Indiana for Bethel College, and while attending the school I found my place in the world.  I made a lot of lifelong friends and my education was probably some of the best in the Nation.  I would definitely attend Bethel again if I could time travel."
Junior,5,How our class time is schedule for the adults and all of the professor take their time to teach.Also it's Christain base which is what I mainly love about Bethel College.
Freshman,5,The facility is nice and friendly and mist professors work with you and and also if you ever get lost just ask any facility or student there and they will direct you in the right direction also my biggest problem was size it was a bit too big for me but that's fine
Freshman,5,"Great school, great people, awesome area, good life ethics building school all around!!The experience of going to this Christain college is life changing now."
Freshman,5,"Bethel has wonderful professors everyone is very pleasant it’s like being in another place. The administration team is very welcoming. I’ve heard great things from many former students as well as the staff, this college is worth the expensive tuition. I am looking forward to every moment."
Freshman,5,"I liked how small Bethel College is, everything is all right there nice and close together! Bethel College made me feel like I was right at home! Most colleges have an atmosphere and community that tends be overwhelming; however, at Bethel I had no problem with communicating with the students and faculty. It's just such a beautiful school, and I couldn't imagine going anywhere else."

Niche User,5,"The campus is very nice, as well as the classes. The class sizes are medium to small sizes, and the teachers are very accommodating."
Freshman,5,"Bethel College provided the best college experience I have had thus far, out of four schools that I've attended. I loved every minute of my time there. The campus is lovely, the people are kind and wonderful, the professors are extremely helpful, and weekly chapel is incredible. There is not a thing I would change about this school, aside from the cost, but overall, the cost is worth it."
Niche User,5,Bethel is a small Christian college that offers great support and academic possibilities. The advisors and professors are helpful and understanding. I am happy to be enrolled in the adult and continuing education program.  This program allows me to take accelerated classes that work well with my busy schedule and my family life.
Freshman,5,I am a current Bethel College student. My experience there so far has been wonderful. I would recemmend it to anyone who comes from a small school and does not do well with many people. They are wonderful with the transition of high school to college.
Sophomore,5,"I have had my life changed by thus school. Not only has it been a fulfilling experience thus far, but it has also been life altering as well. Bethel College helped me grown academically, socially, and spiritually."
Freshman,5,I really enjoy it here. The community is very friendly and the campus has a strong Christian foundation. I definitely recommend it. 
College Senior,5,It was a very easy process
College Senior,5,I love goung to Bethel College. Theirvadult program is wonderful for the working adult
College Junior,5,"They are very helping, kind and caring. They truly care about you as a person and your education. The campus is beautiful and calming. It is a relaxing and easy to learn at campus!"
College Sophomore,5,"We have a great admissions team who works hard to bring in students, and make them feel at home."
College Sophomore,5,Living on campus has been so great!
College Sophomore,5,I've made great friends and had an awesome time so far.
College Freshman,5,"Safety on campus is very good. You can always see campus safety driving around. The beginning of the year they did make us aware that things like that happen on campus, but it is just something that we have to be aware of. It does not happen all the time. Campus is very safety oriented and I feel very safe on campus."
College Freshman,5,"The professors at Bethel are very approachable. They are very focused on helping the students learn and they show the students that they care about them. The classes are small, which is nice because then you get to know the other students better and the professors take the time to help you if you need it."
College Freshman,5,Bethel has one of the highest ratings for job placements. They have a job fair which you can attend to look for internships or jobs. They will help you find jobs and internships and offer many opportunities to help you prepare for the future.
College Freshman,5,"I really enjoyed living on campus. The dorm rooms are very spacious. The dorms social atmosphere is great, most people leave their doors open so if you want to you can just go in and talk to someone. It is definitely very community centered and there are many dorm activities you can participate in."
College Freshman,5,"My overall experience at school so far has been great. The campus is very community centered and the professors really focus on helping you succeed. You can tell that people really care about you at Bethel. Before I had even visited Bethel, I knew that I had wanted to go there. Everyone on campus is so friendly, they make you feel like family. If I had to do it all over again, I would still choose Bethel."
College Student,5,I seem to love my college. It teach me great things. I will continue move on because of the college that has put me in confidence of who I am
College Sophomore,5,"I have always been a huge fan of my school since sixth grade, but to actually attend my college is an extremely different feeling! I love the Christian community of Bethel College and I would choose it over any college, any day!"
College Sophomore,5,The dorm life is wonderful! The residential assistants (RA's) are very involved with my everyday life and are always encouraging me to do my best and grow closer to God. The dorms are cleanly and have a decent amount of space considering how small the campus is. It is am easy walk to all my classes and the atmosphere is not only beautiful but invigorating.
College Sophomore,5,"Bethel is really great for me because I transferred from a school where it was hard for me to agree with what was happening on campus, mainly the partying, drinking and drug use on campus. I was very unhappy where I was and needed more structure. So for someone who needs structure I would really recommend Bethel. Yeah the rules can get a bit annoying but it really keeps things centered on getting your education. Class sizes are great because your teachers really get a chance to get to know you and build genuine relationships. They really care about your overall wellbeing and make an effort to support you."
College Junior,5,I love the 2-year Grace/Bethel RN program. I can be closer to home.
College Junior,5,Clubs and bars are over rated.
College Junior,5,"Winona Lake is a beautiful, friendly, small, tight-knit community."
College Junior,5,"Registration is fairly simple. Professors are knowledgeable in their areas and are good at transferring their knowledge. Workload are generally reasonable and professors, advisers and deans are very good at helping you make your schedule work."
College Junior,5,I thoroughly enjoy my majors. The programs allow for student success and learning. The professors are extremely supportive.
College Junior,5,"The theatre and music departments are great. The professors are phenomenal and truly invest in your education. They are small which allowed for unique opportunities and attention, even as underclassmen. The community is fantastic. The students enjoy being around each other and work together well. The students want to succeed and the faculty is willing to sacrifice of themselves to help the students."
College Sophomore,5,"I am so happy with my choice of Bethel! It has been an amazing first year, and I have learned and grown so much! I can't wait for the summer to be over so I can go back!"
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely love my school! The campus is the perfect size and is just gorgeous! Everything is fairly close together so you don't have to walk far to get from building to building. The academic program is wonderful. The teachers really care about their students and want to see them succeed.
College Sophomore,5,Campus life is so much fun! There is always something to do and someone to hang out with. they do a great job of arranging a variety of activities that will interest a wide number of people.
College Junior,5,The local atmosphere around my school is incredible. Locals are extremely friendly toward people from my school.
College Junior,5,"The professors are caring, knowledge, and very approachable. The information we cover is reasonable, interesting, and in-depth."
College Sophomore,5,"Campus strictness is very important!  Directors are great about keeping noise levels to a minimum, and only allowing boys in girls dorms at certain hours!  It definitely helps keep the atmosphere healthy, comfortable, and controlled."
College Sophomore,5,"I am extremely happy with my major.  My advisor is super helpful, and I love my classes!  I plan to work with juvenile delinquents or foster children with my Sociology degree.  I would do it all over again if I could!  I have concerns with finding a decent job."
College Sophomore,5,"I have never had any safety or security issues.  Campus safety is always readily available and willing to help.  Furthermore, I don't worry about my safety while I'm on campus.  The only time I ever had to go to the wellness center, the people were very helpful!"
College Sophomore,5,There is a wide variety of restaurants with a great selection of choices and prices!
College Sophomore,5,"I literally don't hear of it, see it, or partake in it"
College Freshman,5,"i have never experienced such loving, knowledgeable and caring professors ever."
Junior,4,"I have had a few online classes in the 2 years that I have been there and they are definitely not blow off classes! You definitely have to work for it to get the grade you want but it is also so nice because the professors, although challenging, are also there to help and guide you and want you to be in touch with them about how you are retaining the information."
Junior,4,"I love how small it is because you get to know almost everyone but it is also big enough that you do see new faces here and there. I am on the track and field team and I can honestly say that they are the reason I love Bethel so much! If you get the opportunity to be in a sport in college, I 100% recommend it!"
Alum,4,"Bethel is a very unique community. Minutes from the wonderful University of Notre Dame, you get some of the perks of a college town, while still having a small community to call home. Finding a community of people is a high priority at Bethel, and that is what makes it unique."
Sophomore,4,The staff at Bethel University have been very helpful in adjusting to college. The friendships made and the connections I have with professors will be something I will have for a long time. The classes are manageable for the most part and the professors are always there if I have questions or need extra help.  One thing I would like to see is more activities on the weekends for students to be involved in.
Senior,4,"Amazing campus right in the middle of the city, but nicely hidden and away from all the city noise. Everything is in walking distance or easy bus ride."
Freshman,4,Bethel is a very good place where you have people from all over the country. It's a small campus but its a very safe place and is located in a local area. The professors will go above and beyond to help you succeed. There are also so many different opportunities at Bethel.
Niche User,4,"When I visited Bethel College I instantly felt welcomed. I am afraid to go off to college by myself not knowing many people who will be there, but I am confident that I will be safe and build many new friends at Bethel."
Freshman,4,"Well I started my first year not knowing anyone, which was a challenge. But Bethel was so welcoming, trying to get me involved in activities and meeting new people."
Niche User,4,"When touring the campus, I had a nice time learning about all Bethel has to offer. I saw the classrooms, gyms, and dorms. I also learned about my intended major and how to excel in it."
Freshman,4,"Bethel is a very safe campus! If you're looking for a college that does nothing but party, then Bethel is not for you.  If you want to get closer to God and have great friends then Bethel is for you!"
Junior,4,"Bethel College is a very good school, a bit pricey but I would say you get what you pay for. They can be very hands on with their students, and truly make you feel like they care about your success. I am in the nursing program and although it is very tough, they try to work with you the best they can! I give it four stars because of the price, it seems to be very hard to afford especially with buying new text books and school supplies all of the time."
Junior,4,A great Christian atmosphere. Professors are willing to get to know you and work with you to success. Classes make you think about things in new and fascinating ways.
Senior,4,I loved Bethel College. The surrounding area/town life always gives you something to do. Professors are helpful and willing to work with you.
Freshman,4,I really love the size of the school. It's small so there's a community aspect that isn't usually there with most larger colleges. And it's Christian based so that was a plus for me when I applied.
Freshman,4,"Bethel College is a nice size college it lets you interact with other easily. The professors are ready to help you to grow in your studies and relationship with God. Having a smaller campus lets you meet more people and when you are on your way to classes people will greet you. I would like Bethel College to try to expand on their sports side and make a track field. Also, the squirrels on campus are nice because they are so friendly."
Junior,4,"Bethel College is a great place to make connections and grow. It has a great faculty that genuinely care about students. Some of the rules, though understandable, are a but much though."
Freshman,4,I like the college very much. Though I wish for more activities for commuter students. There really isnt alot of a commuter student.
Junior,4,"Great school overall. However not very commuter-friendly. Parking is far from your classes. No lounging space for commuters to wait for their next class. The teachers are the best part of the campus. They really do care for you. And the Christian atmosphere is definitely a plus. However, this school basically just caters to students who live there."
Sophomore,4,"Academics and professors are amazing, the class size is not very big so they have time to help you and make sure that your questions are answered. Campus is absolutely beautiful, we have multiple ponds and a lot of trees that make it beautiful in all seasons.  The Dining Commons has fairly good food although it gets very repetitive it is nice though because there is a sub shop on campus that you can use meal swipes for. Also, you get ""Bethel bucks"" that can be used at three different restaurants just across the street. Bethel is located in the perfect part of Mishawaka with stores and restaurants within walking distance. Perfect college for those who like the college feel without the big university stress."
College Senior,4,"The education offered at Bethel is excellent. The classes are of reasonable size, the professors are very kind and approachable. The people there are very accepting and friendly. I have made many great friends and memories at Bethel over these past few years."
College Sophomore,4,Life in the dorms is great and the community is strong and lot of fun to be around.
College Senior,4,I very safevon campuscand securuty is very tight
College Sophomore,4,My major is small and the classes are fantastic. I loved my year based on the classes and the social environment. The rules were killer and I don't think they need to stay that strict especially in this ever changing modern world.
College Sophomore,4,There are so many opportunities to get involved in the community with your major. I know I have contact to the deaf community several times a month. I am an ASL-Interpreting major so that is extremely helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"Bethel has a great texting and emailing system for when there is trouble out and about near campus. I see campus safety around all the time, even throughout the night. I don't feel threatened at all."
College Sophomore,4,The sports teams do a wonderful job and the school spirit for them are incredible. People are mostly either involved in sport or attend the games with great enthusiasm.
College Freshman,4,Security patrols often. We get alerts on our phones if there is a threat in the area of the college.
College Freshman,4,It's close to all my classes
College Freshman,4,The Coaches and staff really care about the person I am and show an interest in what I will be doing in my life now and the future.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus safety is always near by when you need them, and they do their best to keep the students out of harm's way."
College Sophomore,4,It's a great school with a diverse connected community.
College Sophomore,4,We have a large variety of successful teams.
College Freshman,4,"The students are very involved in athletics, whether they are playing or not. There are always a lot of people attending the games and cheering our players on. There is also a large portion of people that participate in intramurals. Everybody is very involved and people get really excited about the athletics."
College Junior,4,"Considering how big the school is, varsity sports play an role on campus, offering an environment that brings the students, athletes or not, together. The performance is usually average on most of the sports, but if the size and the investment of the school are taken in consideration, it goes beyond what should be expected."
College Junior,4,"I was a transfer student, so this was my second school. I love the small atmosphere and the family feel. Bethel is focused on service and caring for others as well as yourself."
College Sophomore,4,My school is unique because it is the top school in Indiana for Teachers. I love going to Chapel and meeting new people. There are events going on all of the time which are fun and exciting. My school offers many opportunities like sports and clubs.
College Senior,4,"Bethel College offers a Christian atmosphere that has been spiritually rewarding to my college experience. The college offers various extracurricular activities that have equipped me with leadership skills and resources that I have been able to apply in many areas of my life. A negative that comes with going to a private school is the cost. It has been difficult to find the finances to attend this school. It is understandable why some students are not able to finish due to the rising tuition costs, but it has been worth it for me so far."
College Sophomore,4,"I personally havnt stayed off campus but from what I have heard from my friends that live off campus, it is a wonderful experience"
College Sophomore,4,A lot of the off campus dining is fast food except for the couple sit down restaurants which provides plenty of late night eating
College Sophomore,4,Drug use and alcohol is not tolerated. All students signed a pledge to not take drugs for drink alcohol at the beginning of their freshman year. Campus safety is a little slow but effective.
College Sophomore,4,"It is simple to get scholarships at bethel if your involved in many things. My main scholrships are from being involved with the music department. You can get scholarships for being in sports, the church match, or even having a sibling attend"
College Student,4,I like that we can use our meal plans at off-campus locations.
College Student,4,"Most of my scholarship money is simply based on my GPA, so it was easy to get."
College Student,4,I like the Acorn and Sufficient Grounds. The DC can get a bit boring.
College Student,4,It's great to live with my friends and have a community around me in the same building.
College Freshman,4,I personally enjoy living on campus at Bethel. The atmosphere is great on campus you get to know a lot of people that you would never talk to normally. Most of the dorms are rather well clean and up to date. The cost is a little too much for its location and the size of the school. But getting to classes are super easy and quick because everything is pretty close to eachother.
College Sophomore,4,The school makes a really big effort to benefit your future career path. Professors help to find you great internship and the academic office really tries to give students the opportunity to find great jobs right out of college. They see that importance in getting an education and make that one of their top priorities.
College Sophomore,4,"On campus we have very stereotypical types of Christian boys and girls. While this is not a bad thing, it does take away from individuality or creativity on campus. Many of the guys travel in packs and feel that need to ""bro"" a lot. Which isn't a bad thing, but when it comes to building relationships with the opposite sex it can be a bit annoying or even when trying to pursue dating relationships. Marriage is actually a big thing on campus, which can be encouraging and also obnoxious. Many girls come into Bethel looking to get their ""M R S (Mrs.) degree"" a.k.a finding a husband. This can be discouraging to other females and maybe males because there is that pressure to get married. And it gets annoying a lot. Since we have stereotypical christian boys and girls, there isn't much variety when it comes to meeting different people. Or at least you have to try and find people who are different and are creative."
College Sophomore,4,"We live on a small campus in the middle of a busy town area, so not many people know we are even there. Since we are a smaller campus we don't have a big security team. There is no crime or unsafe things that happen on campus. While this doesn't happen it is still possible for anyone to walk onto campus and commit a crime."
College Sophomore,4,"For a small school we do have a lot of involvement in sports. Our track team is really big and very predominant on campus. We are actually getting four new sports to the school including men's rugby, men's lacrosse, women's lacrosse, and a drum line. A lot of students attend sporting events, but could be a bit better when it comes to school spirit."
College Senior,4,its a good place to stay
College Freshman,4,The Counseling availability is good. There are a number of events throughout the year to promote health. If sexual assault is an issue no one talks about it.
College Freshman,4,This school is pricey. But if you deserve merit aid you get it.
College Sophomore,4,"The strictness is sometimes nice. Transferring from a school where there were no enforcement of rules and not much care for the students well-being, the strictness is nice. I don't have to worry about drunk tirades on my floor or pot smelling up the halls. The only downside is the no dancing rule. Its dumb."
College Freshman,4,"They are very strict about the dorm visits, drugs, and alcohol."
College Freshman,4,"Over all, the housing at Bethel College is pretty great. The dorms even in the freshman buildings seem to be more spacious than that of other colleges I've visited or heard stories of, and the community is excellent. All of the dorms are pretty very close to everything you need to get to, granted it's a small campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Administration isn't perfect since they won't let us dance, but they do their jobs well and with grace."
College Sophomore,4,"Whatever kind of food you're in the mood for, whether fancy or fast food, there are many options."
College Sophomore,4,Nice dorms that have a good mix of both hall style and apartment style. There's something for everyone.
College Sophomore,4,"This college is in a nice, average size town that has enough to do off campus that you won't be stuck on campus."
Alum,2,"Good professors - they care about you, and it made me stick with Bethel. The students are some of the most inward looking individuals. Bethel does not prepare you for real life. The emphasis on Jesus and ignoring how the world really functions ails graduates once they enter the real world. Graduates of Bethel College will be disappointed that you can't just pray for everything in life when life pushes you down. The number of my fellow graduates who land serious roles after graduation or a few years afterwards is low. I still see graduates working as servers or are totally clueless on how they can take advantage of their bible majors. God's calling I suppose."
Freshman,2,The care more about grades then the religious aspect. The teachers don’t know how to teach and the advisors are rude and make you feel bad about yourself. They ask for a lot of money but yet the campus looks like trash
College Freshman,2,We are not allowed to have parties.
College Freshman,2,Academics are easy. I was at the top of a large class and this school did not satisfy my academic needs.
College Freshman,2,I was basically silenced at this school because I am lgbt.
College Junior,2,I hate snow and cold weather and it ruins socializing and commuting
College Junior,2,Tuition is high and it is difficult receive enough aid esp. if you do not have really high grades
College Junior,2,It is not always reliable esp. if you are a commuter and do not drive.
College Junior,2,Most people are homogeneous. There is not much diversity here.
College Freshman,2,"self transpo, I wish there was transpo to clinicals etc."
College Freshman,2,"Sexual orientation is discouraged as it goes against the beliefs of the college's stated religion as the college is a private religious school. We strive towards acceptance, and there is a lot of diversity for such a small campus however I know of other colleges that have a larger diversity."
College Freshman,2,Being in the midwest the winter months can make it miserable.
College Junior,2,looks of cold and snow
Recent Alumnus,2,"School Seems Desperate – Bethel is so quick to offer just anyone a scholarship for the field they are entering, whether they are actually qualified for it or not. I have seen so many students getting into certain departments and they should not have been. It seems that Bethel is so desperate to grow their programs that they will not turn people away, and they will give scholarships to anyone who applies for them, even if they shouldn't be receiving one. This is what made me question my music scholarship, because at first I was so excited to receive one and it made me feel so much more confident in my skills as a singer. But then I saw other people coming through our music department with scholarships who did NOT have the musical talent that was deserving of them. They only got one because the music department was so desperate to grow. I don't like that."
College Sophomore,2,"When PM classes start, or when there is an on campus event parking gets filled up rather quickly. you may end up walking quite a distance from your class"
College Senior,2,"The town and surrounding area has good shopping and food options, bt there just isn't a lot to do in Mishawaka."
College Student,2,Bethel Is Small Sharing Rides Is Often the Best and Sometimes Only Option – South Bend Airport is only a few miles away from Bethel but not many students need to use it. Most students that go to Bethel live close by or less than a day away from the campus. As a result many students find that bringing their car and simply driving to school is the best option.
College Junior,2,Unless you go to the dinning commons there isn't much variety.
College Junior,2,"During the winter seasons, the snow can get ridiculous as the campus receives lake effect weather from Lake Michigan. Since the campus is small, the snow doesn't affect travel to classes, but transportation outside of campus can get rather hectic at times."
College Senior,2,"There are all types of people in the adult program of all different races, sizes and shapes."
College Freshman,1,We don't have any of these things so I wouldn't know.
College Freshman,1,If you thought your parents were bad.... Administration is super strict and there are rules regarding things like sexuality that are totally unnecessary.
College Freshman,1,Bethel kids think a party is dancing in a barn to outdated pop music and drinking water. Also being terrified of someone brining alcohol even when no one here drinks. This happens like once the whol time you are at school. If people party no one knows.
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have any Greek Life, and I wish we did have some kind of option."
College Junior,1,This past winter was the worst. It was so cold. We never saw the sun.
College Freshman,1,There is never anyone on campus so it's kind of scary at night
College Junior,1,do not have I am an online student
College Student,1,"Northern Indiana is right next to Lake Superior as a result Bethel has sometimes very odd weather due to the lake effect. the weather can be very drastic and fluid, it'll be freezing one day and hot the next. sometimes its hard to know what season we're actually in."
College Freshman,1,Small Christian College – Bethel is a small christian college so the students who choose to attend fit the same basic mold. BC is mainly white with a slight diversity in religious preference.
College Freshman,1,There are no transportation options unless you have your own car or can ride with a friend that has a car.
College Freshman,1,What to Do – Night life/social life is weak here. Wish there were most options.
College Freshman,1,This Is a Christian College – Drug and alcohol use is forbiden and can be penalised because Bethel is a christian college but people don't complain because most students are christians who prefer to stay away from that kind of behaviour
College Senior,1,No Restaurants – The campus has a dining hall but there are no restaurants on the campus. It is a fairly small campus.

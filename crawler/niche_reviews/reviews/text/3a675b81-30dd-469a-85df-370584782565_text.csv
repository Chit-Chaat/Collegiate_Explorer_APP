Freshman,5,"My experience at New Jersey City University has been amazing, as I am part of the Honors Program I have received the help that I need. Lots of people just offer to help without you even asking."

Senior,5,Teachers are very engaging and professors are always around whenever you need help or have questions.
Graduate Student,5,Online learning offers a rewarding and knowledgeable  experience at New Jersey City University. The teachers make sure to keep all students on track with the current coursework and provide helpful office hours to students who need assistance. The amount of resources online to help with the courses are great aswell.
Alum,5,Online classes were exceptional and offered great flexibility for working students. Would highly recommended signing up for at least one online class per semester.
Senior,5,"The professors have been themselves more available for students, especially during this pandemic. They tried their past to give us enough time to complete the assignment because there are a lot of students who are sharing computers with other siblings. They made everything simple enough to understand."
Senior,5,"Very affordable, great professors, and classrooms aren’t too large so you really get to connect with the professor and other classmates."
Niche User,5,I loved how close it is to home. I have family in the area so I don't feel completely alone. The area is pretty peaceful. Campus is huge yet inviting.
Niche User,5,"The application process was very easy; I received a prompt response as well!  Because I will be playing 2 sports at the university, the coaches helped me every step of the way.  They were able to get me certain scholarships and also helped me figure out the dorm situation.  Because I live in South Jersey, I will need on campus housing."
Niche User,5,I think this is a great university to go to for a criminal justice degree. I fell in love with their program and hope to attend.

Senior,5,I love how student government cares for us on campus by providing us with fun activities throughout the semester
Freshman,5,I like the fact that they actually care about new students coming in and not abandoning them after admission.
Freshman,5,"I was in general really worried about whether I was going to get in or not. However, it was a great (and stressful) experience to really get the application out there especially in fear of rejection. However, I am now my second semester and couldn't be happier."
Sophomore,5,The campus is really clean. There is always something fun and entertaining going on. You will always meet new people and will make new friends.
Freshman,5,"Being a Freshman at NJCU is pretty unique. The diversity the school has adds to its character. Ive met other great people including professors who have made my first semester enjoyable.

Freshman,5,"During the summer,  I was in the OSP Summer Bridge Program, and I can honestly say that I had learned so much from everyone.  I made a lot of friends, learned new things and had my mentality grow even bigger.  It has made me stronger in some subjects, and I thank NJCU for giving me this opportunity to be in the program. It has prepared me for the school year and has made me excited for this fall and spring semesters!"
Junior,5,"A truly Educational effort Professors are very knowledgeable and are always there to help. Library hours are flexible, transportation is easily accessible classes at geared at both adult and teenagers level. it wonderful"
Sophomore,5,I am in my second year here at NJCU and I don't see why this isn't someone first pick for college. I have had an amazing year in the school and have had to meet amazing people. The teachers are there to help you every step of the way. Students are friendly on and off campus. You will love the campus so much that you would want to be in school forever.
Senior,5,I’ve had a very good experience as a student at NJCU. I’m about to start senior year soon and I hope I end up having a great experience for my last year of undergrad.

Senior,5,"Very diverse campus, renovations going on, and help is here for you for all of your needs. All of the options for a major study are backed by educators who are willing to extend a helping hand."
Freshman,5,"This will be my first semester at New Jersey City University. I know a few people that went through the same program as I did and they loved it. I will be attending class at the wall campus so being that the university has a wide range of class there, makes it very confident for someone like me who will be commuting. I am very excited about furthering my education at this institution!"
Freshman,5,The help and guidance you receive as a freshman. The way the orientation for parents to inform them how this new experience will be. The only thing I will like to see change how all classes aren't on the direct campus some classes are located in another part of that city.
Alum,5,I would have to say that my years spent at NJCU were great! NJCU was very diverse and quite affordable. They have many different opportunities to make their students succeed. Go Gothic Knights!
Junior,5,The school is very accommodating and works with the students very closely to help them achieve their goals!
Senior,5,"I love the fact that Art professor at the Visual Arts Building are very talented and social awared becuase many of them are not just teaching us graphic design or Ats,  but also to apply our design skills to help to bombat social issues. I just love it because in actuality we are facing many polical and social changes, and we have to be available to help in some way."
Freshman,5,"Great School! Very Friendly staff and students! Very easy to navigate, Some class are tough becuase of the professor but they teach very good."
Freshman,5,When I was in New Jersey city university I learned all these great ways to interact with people.i enjoyed learning different cultures but also enjoyed meeting many peopl of the same culture as me it was very exciting. I also learned how to balance school life and campus life I learned how to prioritize what's is more important and what's not.
Junior,5,"What I most like and adore of New Jersey City University is the diversity and friendliness of the students on campus. Often times, when I am inundated with work and home responsibilities, I am distracted positively because of the students and faculty who always without fail, provide a conducive atmosphere of learning and social interaction. 
       What I think could be improved at New Jersey City University, is the Music/Dance and Theatre department. I am a violinist who plays 1st and 2nd violin for the NJCU orchestra and would like the department to stage more opera productions or larger productions for that matter. I hear stories from faculty about how NJCU used to stage large opera productions encompassing so many musicians, singers, actors and tech crew alike.  Operas such as Don Giovanni, The Magic Flute, and the Marriage of Figaro to name a few."
Graduate Student,5,I had a great experience on my first semester . Professional staff and couserlors. My class was very intended and the Profesor made it easy to understand and flexible to archive a high Score.
College Freshman,5,I believe that the Greek system is great people are nice and especially Greek system they are very diligent about making sure that everyone feels a big part of the school
Alum,5,"I got to travel to two countries with NJCU. Became a founder and president of an organization, and of course graduate with honors. I am back again for my second degree!"
Sophomore,5,"From the day I started I new it was a great choice. Even though I was starting late into the fall semester, all the staff were determined to try to make my entry there possible. I have never dealt with a staff member that didn't love their job here at NJCU. The classrooms are great because they very interpersonal. Not only do the professors know your name but they also will try to work with your situation if need be. Though I've had a few tough professors I've never had one that wanted any of their students to fail. Also, I love that, for the most part, the professors are passionate about what they're teaching about and they aim to make their students just as passionate about a subject as them. Overall, NJCU is a great school, I feel like I have become apart of a family. "
College Sophomore,5,"I do not dorm in this university, but I hear it's pretty neat to dorm. The campus itself is a nice place to hangout in, it is decorative with a fountain and plants, trees, bushes and benches. The atmosphere is lovely. A lot of students are seen hanging out around campus socializing and getting to know each other. The buildings are clean as well so there isn't a hassle over litter."
College Freshman,5,Looking forward to the classes.
College Freshman,5,Music business is one of the reasons NJCU is good.
College Junior,5,"The classes, professors and class sizes at NJCU are excellent. I love them!"
College Junior,5,"From my professors to my class mates, I absolutely love my university. The courses I am enrolled in offer great opportunities for increased growth and knowledge. I find that my professors are very much involved in helping and guiding students to be successful. My classmates are just as eager and thirsty for knowledge as I. They are supportive and we all work well with one another."
College Junior,5,"Jersey City University provides quality and effective teaching. Professors are very supportive and encouraging. They are involved in student's success and truly want the student to succeed. I enjoy attending class, gaining knowledge and meeting with other student's that share my passion for nursing."
College Junior,5,I like the fact that almost every student has the same goal in mind which is to graduate from the university. However it is not an easy thing to do being that some students are learning to speak the English language.
College Junior,5,I am a senior student and i would like to recommend NJCU to all student with deferents majors
College Junior,5,I am a work study at the NJCU and is amazing to work with all members.
College Junior,5,I am a senior student and i never had problem and always have a great professor in a professional way.
College Junior,5,I had one semester in as housing and it was perfect
College Junior,5,yes I will choose the NJCU again
College Junior,5,Athletics is a big place and has a variety sports and I really like it.
College Freshman,5,NJCU is ranked as one of the safest schools in NJ. The public safety department does a great job on protectING the school and ensures everyone's safety.
College Freshman,5,NJCU cares about students success. Not only does the school focus on students to earn a degree but also to be in good academic shape.
College Senior,5,AMAZING!! I LOVE IT!! I DO NOT REGRET IT AT ALL
Recent Alumnus,5,"its the best, very flexible and faculty are extremely helpful"
Freshman,4,"In the beginning, I wanted to try online classes, I wanted to experience online classes but as time passes trough my freshman year this whole pandemic happened, so taking face-to-face classes wasn't an option. We had to take online classes, and there were some classes that I did not know what was going on because the class was just really bad. I did not like the online learning technic it was the worst. However, there were more professors that they were really good at teaching that."
Junior,4,I’ve taken online courses and I’ve had an average to good experience doing so. It depends on the professor. Personally I am better when I do classes in person but the professors worked with me very well online. They’re very accommodating!
Graduate Student,4,New Jersey City University offers a great experience for all students. It provides affordable education and wonderful faculty members that care about student success. The faculty go above and beyond to ensure students feel safe and a priority at the university.
Niche User,4,"I took some classes online and I enjoyed doing so. For me taking classes online did me good rather than bad. The professor that I had online made things simple and easy to understand. However, not all are like that. I heard stories that online professors didn't do much to help their students, but I didn't have that problem."
Niche User,4,"My experience at NJCU was pretty good. The campus is beautiful during the spring and there is always something to do on campus.  Whether you're into sports, music, fashion, art, etc. they have something for you.  During my time attending NJCU, I learned a lot. There are professors who will actually work with you as long as you talk to them. They understand that life happens and find ways to help you succeed in their class. However, there are professors who expect you to be on top of things at all times."
Senior,4,"My experience as this University has been great. Most of the professors try their best to ensure that their students understand a pass their classes. There were a few bad experiences with 2 professors, but overall the past few years has been great for me."
Senior,4,Online learning has been amazing with New Jersey City University. The school uses a very simple and easy to use platform which allows students to easily look at assignment due dates and when the professor makes an important announcement. I really love the school.
Niche User,4,"I have studied in NJCU for 4 years. In these four years, I got my Master's degree in Education and 30 required credits for my certification. Studying in NJCU is a worthy experience because it is a very welcoming environment especially for immigrants and international students. 
What I hope to be changed in NJCU is some of the expired links on the official website. Some hyperlinks don't work and you have to call the university to get assistance which is a waste of time and effort. Also, some of the financial aid department assistants have this attitude that makes you feel uncomfortable when you seek help."
Freshman,4,I love New Jersey City University because it is very diverse and they have a great art and education program and they have a lot of bonding activities all year around . But the one thing I don’t like is the environment that the school is in.
Junior,4,"In the two years of attendance, I find NJCU is a very good school. They have new and excelling Business School Programs that are the future of business. The campus is beautiful and not to far from NYC. Opportunities are everywhere around the campus if you look for them. Overall a great learning environment."
Junior,4,"So far this school is not bad, just need additional clubs available for students. Food quality is okay, should be more healthy options and students shouldnt have to pay for condiments as well."
Junior,4,"The NCJU School Of Business is a great place for students to get an education. Great location, close to NYC and safe. The tuition is cheaper than most schools and also the Accounting Program is accredited. Overall, great school."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at NJCU was very good. I started my college career in august of 2018 since I was part of the EOF(Educational Opportunity Fund) program. That program made a huge impact in my academics by reinforcing them. Also, during this program, I had the opportunity to met multiple individuals such as counselors and tutors  who helped me have a successful freshman year. 

Besides this incredible experience, what I liked most about NJCU was the professors this university posses. The professors were extremely polite and respectful with every student and in each class. Aside of their outstanding teaching skills, they also taught the students about life. The professors provided the student with guidance, advices and tips in order to be successful and become better individuals in the future. Personally, I didn't consider them as professors but mentors. 

To conclude, I would like see more security in campus and I also a better cleaning maintenance in the classrooms."
Senior,4,"Being a student at New Jersey City University has been nothing but great. All of the professors in the National Security Studies program are amazing, helpful, and knowledgeable. Transferring from a community college was a breeze, they took all of my credits with no problem. Another great thing about NJCU is that they offered courses at different locations, which was a lifesaver for me. So glad I decided to become a Gothic knight. Overall, I had a wonderful experience here."
Freshman,4,as a freshman here in NJCU the  diversity is good I had meet many people from all walks of life. the new dorms / housing  building looks nice and have all of space to roam around. academics  it's not bad its average college learning which it takes to getting use to. there summer bridge programs are  great for up coming freshman like me.
Niche User,4,The staff is awesome and very helpful.  The students are super friendly.  Classes are small so you get the attention you need.
Freshman,4,"It's pretty okay so far, people are friendly here and it has nice buildings. Even though it may seem like a small campus it's surprisingly big. However one of the best things in here is that we have less than twenty-five students in our classes."
Niche User,4,"New Jersey City University (NJCU) is an accredited institution providing a diverse population of learners with an excellent education. The University is committed to the improvement of the educational, intellectual, cultural, socioeconomic, and physical environment of the surrounding urban region and beyond. Established in 1927 as a training school for teachers, today NJCU is among the most comprehensive univerity"
Senior,4,"Urban campus in close proximity to NYC, outstanding faculty, rapidly expanding campus with new buildings in development. Excellent value."
Senior,4,I love the diversity of the student body and professors at New Jersey City University. Some professors get away with being unprofessional even when reported.
Graduate Student,4,"NJCU is a diverse school, therefore I get to see  different backgrounds. I learned so much in all my classes."
Graduate Student,4,"I loved my time ar NJCU. I had some ups and downs with Financial aid and some professors over a 6 year spam but overall, I made some wonderful people who have helped me become who I am today. I wouldn’t change of those experiences for nothing in this world."
Alum,4,"I like that you recieve a quality education that is inexpensive. I love the diversity of the students and professors. I also enjoy that the campus is small, so its easier to build relationships with others."
Junior,4,What I liked most about New Jersey City University is that it is diverse. It is great to connect with so many different people and attend and support so many different cultural events and how the University is welcoming to all race and genders.
Niche User,4,"I am not a college student there but I do go once in a while just as a place to hang out since my school is literally across the street, it's very pretty especially in the winter and spring time, the flowers are such a beautiful scenery."
Freshman,4,"My experience at that school is usually cool, I don't really have any trouble there but if i did it would probably be because of the professors but otherwise, it a great school to learn and experience new things . They do need to change the food , they have a GSUB, it make you either sick or it be cold."
Freshman,4,The new dorms are great but expensive. The food isn't great but the staff are very friendly but it is hard to understand most of the professors but English isn't most of their first languages.
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful and is very diverse The school is good in academics. However, Because it is a commuters school It lacks in students life. There are clubs and activities on campus to do. But the campus itself is dry. Most students just want to go to class and then leave."
Freshman,4,"I like that NJCU is a academic based school, oppose to being focused around sports. I would like to see the organization and time management of the facilities changed and enhanced so that students may get information on time."
College Freshman,4,I like my course work it's just the right amount my professors are great they care about the well being of students and the success of each and every student
College Freshman,4,Because this is my first I can answer that but I know couple alumni who have shared with me that it was fairly easy to get jobs after college
College Freshman,4,I believe that the school makes sure that their students are safe and protected
College Freshman,4,I love in the new building and it is really good and I enjoy everything about it it nice and it's spacious and nicely updated
College Freshman,4,The athletics here are great. The most amazing part is the amount of support that they get it's amazing how people commit to support their team and school
College Freshman,4,I enjoy how diverse the school is. being fresh from high school I expected everyone to be all about themselves so I was very happy to know that people were so friendly and nice. The people here are very caring nice and they are very helpful.The teachers here also are great they really pay attention to our ides and listen to what we have to say and that's something great
College Freshman,4,I belive that getting a degree or some hugher educatin is extremely valued at NJCU. The teachers will say to us all the time that college is expensive and the goal is to complete our degree within the four year span. They are very clear on how we will obtain our degree with the courses and who amd where to go if we decide to change because we still have time.
College Freshman,4,My teachers are actually great. They are very laid back engagin and rational people. They encourage us to ask question wether its to engage a conversation or if we need help. They all also have scheduled tutoring hours as well as the school.
College Freshman,4,"Overall the campus is always clean, inside and out. Everyones friendly with each other and so far I believe that all the students have some respect and understanding for each other whether they know them or not."
College Freshman,4,The teachers that I have are really engaging.with the students. You know that they are really passionate and patient about helping students. They all have schedules letting us know when they are free to give extra help and all around rational people so there were never really no misunderstandings.
College Sophomore,4,"The diversity in the school is definitely the stand out feature, no matter the background you come from you will meet plenty of different people from different paths. 

The only problem I have with NJCU is that is a large commuter school, therefore the main activities are sports, and if you want to find a club, you basically have to go on a wild goose chase."
College Sophomore,4,"I believe honing a degree from this university is the main goal of all students who attend. It has such a high value because of all the work you've put into it. By studying hard, stressing, crying and feeling satisfaction, all that is put into this degree that nothing else is more satisfying than getting this document and graduating on a stage viewed by your peers, professors, and family. I'm not too sure of job internship because I lack the information on that, but I think it should be decent."
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the professors I've been given my first year attending this university. The professors are very helpful and inspirational. Whenever you have a question, they try their best answering it and will go to all lengths to deliver their answer to you. They are very passionate with their teaching and it gives you this sort of feeling that you want to learn, that you want to do more in their class and your very best. the class sizes are decent that feel like the high school setting, the styles are a bit more than high school though. Since they are referred to as 'professors', they have more knowledge and skill than ordinary teachers in grade school."
College Sophomore,4,The security and vigilance of this university is high. I've seen a number of guards and the schools own police faction. I have not seen any issues with crime or safety because I have not yet experienced it in my first year attending the university. The school has its own vehicles for its police faction to operate and survey the area.
College Sophomore,4,"Although I haven't set foot into the schools sports facility, from what I hear it is a great place to go to for either working out or playing sports as recreation. If anything, joining a sport will make it more interesting in this facility. On my way to the university, I see a lot of students entering and leaving the facility which tells me that this place seems busy everyday. If that is the case, this facility is a great place to go to involving physical education or exercise."
College Sophomore,4,"Enrolling at this school made me realize a whole new world in higher education. The professors are easy to get a long with, students are open-minded and will hear you out as well as the professors. Making friends at this university is easy because of how diverse the school is. I find it unique because of its diversity and how all types of background are gathered into this university. I would choose this school again because of how my experience so far as a freshman was. I had fun, enjoyed the classes, making friends and enjoying the food as well! While I'm on summer break I feel homesick to this university because of how I miss it already. I am exited to start my sophomore year in September 6th and look forward to another year of fun and a learning experience!"
College Sophomore,4,It is spectacular. The work is not too much for me. It is at the point where I want it.
College Sophomore,4,"I love it I promise. I had this one teacher named Professor Hugh Snow who technique is clever. Every time we had a test, instead of the definition , he will give us a scenario to get the word. Therefore this help us get the concept."
College Sophomore,4,"My experience in New Jersey City University is an interesting one. There is a lot of diverse students in college depending on race, fashion, style, and definitely personality. I myself love going to the gym to workout and play basketball. The only thing is i am trying to pay off a loan as quickly as possible."
College Senior,4,Overall staff are very helpful in getting students ready for success. I'm glad I will be getting my bachelors in 3 semesters.
College Freshman,4,The athletics at my school is great. They take great pride in their sports teams and students who are into doing sports and also students who just want to stay fit. Everyone on campus supports all the sports teams and are proud when they win and have empathy when they lose.
College Freshman,4,I like this school and i would choose this school again. They help you when you need it and help you throughout your college life. They are interested in the students best interest
College Freshman,4,I live in close proximity to the health office and go there when needed. The hours make it very accessible.
College Freshman,4,"In this area, it should be easy to get an internship during my junior year. The quality of the education for the amount of dollars invested is very good. There are many recruiters in the area and on campus at different times."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms offer what is needed. They keep the dorms clean, and offer free laundry and sporting event tickets for residential students. The orientation process was clear and very informative"
College Freshman,4,"I think my school is excellent for the price and offerings. However, I am uncertain if the investment will be worth it on the other end.; since the job market is volatile. I plan to go into business for myself, and am trying to get to the higher level courses that will really help me."
College Junior,4,Health and safety on campus is very good. Security has a very visible presence.
College Junior,4,I have really enjoyed the graduate program so far. I feel like I'm going to succeed.
College Senior,4,The best part about campus housing is the ability to create study groups with others while in the comfort of your own dorm. Our school is mostly a commuter school.
College Senior,4,"Greek students, for the most part, are just a part of the student population. They are neither greater or smaller than non-Greeks."
College Senior,4,"The athletic department tries to involve athletes, as well as, non-athletes to participate in club sports. They promote the success of the students, not only athletically, but also academically."
Junior,2,"The online learning experience for NJCU has been mediocre. Sometimes the professors will be behind on their work and have to adjust the schedule throwing student schedules off. Other times their connection is terrible and the video quality is poor or breaking in and out. A large majority of professors at NJCU are older and have trouble working these modern say applications for online teaching. The online experience at NJCU made me realize why I decided to do it in person rather than online during my first year of college. It made me realize any of the material I'm learning, (on my own because professors don't teach), won't retain a week after the semester is over for any student including myself."
Freshman,2,"The school is not big on school spirit. You really do not get the full college experience. Many students that go here do not care about their grades, it is mostly a party school. Financial aid is not helpful, they basically steal your money.  Most of the teachers are not very good and you have to teach yourself a lot of the material. They basically just read off powerpoints and give an exam, that is pretty much it. You have to figure it out yourself.  I also lived on campus although the building was new. It smelt like marijuana everywhere and it is very loud all the time even during quiet hours and the RAs or security does not do anything."
Freshman,2,"Living on campus is very boring especially if you have no friends who also dorm. It is basically a commuter school and people treat it like comm. college. It's affordable&academics are ok for the $. They give financial aid but I was barely able to qualify for any. The location is in the suburbs&there are no places walking distance. I regret coming here w/o somehow having a car 1st because that is the only way to have fun! Bus stops are nearby but it's not worth it especially when the area isnt good. The party scene is TERRIBLE! There are probably 1 or 2 frats that host an ok party rarely,just far off campus&hard to get to. I have tried getting a job on campus&theyre absolutely no help! Theyre unfair&very limited.&like I said, barely any places are walking distance so Ive been jobless&broke all semester! There is only 1 dining hall&its awful. I dont feel sanitary eating at the dining hall&the food is never cooked right & never tastes good."
Alum,2,Not many people at this university are there to help students. Maybe 10% actually are willing to assist students.
Alum,2,Stay away from the biology department and chemistry department. They don't have enough students so they fail and some give you a low grade so you can repeat and this is how they make money. They hire a lot of professor that are miserable.
College Junior,2,it was fun and at the same time bad. having limited amount of professor in computer department makes my schedule worst.
College Freshman,2,"The class sizing is a good ratio, usually no more than 15:1. The homework given by the Professors is not challenging enough. Overall, the University has done an amazing job in hiring unique, caring Professors who are willing to help and want to see their students succeed. As far as the social life goes, this university has a terrible environment."
College Sophomore,2,"My overall experience in this school is bad. Not only the teachers don't care, but the staff itself. Not even helping the student achieve their goals."
College Sophomore,2,"The party scene as I heard is really bad at NJCU. I'm not sure exactly why, but I would say that it is probably because most of the students commute."
College Sophomore,2,"I personally said that the food is bad because the quality of it is horrible. I do not expect fancy food from the college cafe, but I would like to have food that is eatable."
College Junior,2,Im not too fond of the housing.
Recent Alumnus,2,I don't know any off-campus houses.
College Senior,2,"I love my major, but many people tend to know very little about marketing and have little interest in class.  It's unfair for those who want to learn and hope for a great career. The work load completely depends on the professor and the class.  Some professors take it easy on the class and only want classroom interaction with no test, only after reading 2 chapters.  But, many students take advantage and anger the professor, who them increases the work load and starts to include tests.  I've seen it happen a few times before. Also, internships are VERY hard to get. You have to get in well with an adviser or professor, and even then its very hard."
College Senior,2,"Unless you're going to be a teacher, it is hard to get a career from solely having a bachelors from NJCU. You would have to then go to a graduate school at a better college in order to help in getting a career. There is not much communication or networking on campus because any people fall into cliques. But, I hear the career center is great."
College Senior,2,"There seems to be many safety procedures that are flashed and talked about but not much implementation.  For instance, the "" security guard"" at the gate just lets people in without carding anyone.  It's just for show.  The area is said to be dangerous at night, so I bring pepper spray with me to class.  You never know who you can meet walking down the halls on campus, or if someone could be hiding in the bathroom.  Its kinda scary."
College Junior,2,"it's too expensive, and the food is not that great compare to other colleges."
College Junior,2,Snow is a bad thing on campus and in rain not much cover
College Junior,2,Very little interest in athletics. Need to support more on teams with equipment and facilities. 
College Junior,2,Campus housing is outdated with little to no amenities. 
College Junior,2,"Housing is alright, the campus is fairly clean and well kept. "
College Junior,2,People often complain about parking availability. Parking should be free that is why I take public transportation.
College Freshman,2,Needs more events to make the campus more fun!
College Freshman,2,I never know when games are.
College Freshman,2,"Sunshine is the best. I can get to class on time, I'm happy to be in class. Any other weather makes me late and bummed that i have class."
College Junior,2,"NJCU is a small university. Even though is one of the cheapest universities around, the architecture is quite stunning. Each building has its character.  "
College Junior,2,"The food made on campus isn't really great, and it is expensive. However, there are some days in which we can get free food. "
College Junior,2,There isn't much to do in NJCU at night. It isn't placed in a good spot to walk around at night time.
College Sophomore,2,Scholarships are geared towards certain majors. It's best to look on other sites for scholarships because the NJCU scholarships have a lot of connection to grade point average.
College Senior,2,"It's still the beginning of the semester, so i can't really tell until the end of the 2014 academic year."
College Senior,2,"I am giving NJCU a grade of C- mostly because they do not seem to care about the noise level at the school's library. Students usually enter the library with their lunch, and in groups they proceed to chit chat for long periods. I had to resource to complaining but since that never went anywhere I bought myself ear plugs and that cancels the noise. 
There is no effort from the librarians part to quiet people down, to send them to eat at the cafeteria. If someone is hungry, comes into the library to eat quickly finishes to get started on some kind of work for which he needs the library resources, that is great. I do not have a problem with people that eat quickly at the library, even if their food stinks a little. Its with the groups of 2 or more students that I have a problem. However when this does happen, it is very easy to get up and find a new study spot since the library is mainly empty of students."
College Sophomore,2,"New Jersey City University has a few professors that are extremely motivational, the rest are nonchalant.  They are in and out of class, bland, and care nothing for students.  No extra he elp, insight, and easy to coast by.  A lot of people coast by so much that when it comes close to graduation, they can barely keep up; especially when the class gets in the slightest complicated."
College Junior,2,There are not many options on campus.  Pricey food of average quality.
College Junior,2,"Not Much on This Side of Jersey City – A lot of businesses in the area do promote and support the University, so that's good.  But, safety, as much as I try to ignore it, is a big concern.  Something is getting stolen or broken into almost weekly; or there's a report of students getting mugged on the street.  The area around campus does look nice though, so it's a shame that these kinds of people are there to ruin that for the University's students.  Regardless, there is not much to do when compared to other colleges.  The effort is there, but the majority of the student population can't commit to such activities due to having such busy lives trying to pay for college, raise children, etc.  The sports programs are run pretty well, but most of the support/audience for those sports comes from within the athletics department itself(Teams supporting/in attendance for other teams of the school).  Most of these issues are due to the fact of NJCU being a heavy commuter school.  Campus is pretty much dead at night and a ghost-town on weekends.  Regardless, many of the facilities on campus are maintained pretty well and it's a nice little college experience due to the diversity and other things.  This is why it gets a C as opposed to anything lower."
College Freshman,2,The girls and guys walk around with egos. They act as if they are god gift to the world. Everybody likes to gossip and act like they do no wrong. There are very few people that you will meet who are down to earth and fun to chill with.
College Freshman,2,The food is good but it gets tiring because its the same stuff everyday. I love to make my own food from the stir fry section.
College Sophomore,2,"gave them a c- because i haven't received any scholarships. i receive state but it's very minimal, and i no longer receive fed aid. apply early so whatever is not covered you can receive loans if necessary.. it sucks"
College Senior,2,I like how close the campus is to my house. But the area can be dangerous for a small girl like me when it's dark. Muggings and sexual assaults around campus weren't pleasant to be informed of but I'm glad they informed everyone for our safety.
College Freshman,2,We are by the Waterfront so it's a little chillier than weather more in from the ocean but it does get warm sometimes.
College Freshman,2,its bad and is very hard to park. It is very far from the dorms
College Freshman,2,"I really enjoyed dorming as freshmen at NJCU, but as a sophmore now I really do not like dorming anymore I am currently looking for an apartment with my roommates. The campus is very small so there is not a lot of students that live on campus. There are also very strict rules about visitation. I like the fact that the dorms are co-ed so there are females and males in all the buildings, and in the new upperclassmen building Vodra Hall has all new bathrooms in each room and new air conditioning. The cafetertia on campus also closes during the week at 8pm and on the weekends at 6:30pm which is VERY inconvinent for us students who live on campus."
Niche User,1,"Do not trust the thieves in the FSM office with your money! I canceled my registration in December and Walter confirmed he was going to send my check back to me. In February he cashed my check, and I am still waiting for a refund. I am currently seeking legal counsel as they have unlawfully held onto my money. AVOID THESE PEOPLE AT ALL COSTS."
College Sophomore,1,There really isn't much of a party scene at this school.  Students tend to go to others schools to get more of a night life rather than staying at this school.
Recent Alumnus,1,Heard one of my classmate almost got jumped for her stuff in the park.
Recent Alumnus,1,I haven't seen them in action.
Recent Alumnus,1,Our campus isn't safe. Any non student can walk on campus without being asked where are you going? That's dangerous.
College Senior,1,"There is literally NOTHING to do on campus.  It's pretty boring.  Many people commute here so with such few students dorming on campus, there are not real parties.  However, there is a light rail that can take you into Hoboken and New York City.  People tend to party there."
College Sophomore,1,Wr don't have night life on campus
College Sophomore,1,"Aside from the fact that I do not engage in nightlife, my school is not much of a party school in general."
College Junior,1,"There is absolutely no night life here, expect for night classes.  To experience the night life, just take the light rail into NYC"
College Junior,1,There is nowhere to go.
College Freshman,1,There isn't anything interesting around.
College Freshman,1,The bus takes forever which sometimes make me late for class.
College Junior,1,"Honestly, I do not participate in the party life of school since it is located in not a very pleasant area. However, the school parties that the university offers are great. For example, this past Halloween, we enjoyed of a great party which included great music. "
College Senior,1,"Strict is not the word at this school. It is a dry campus, we have a curfew and 48 hours in advance you have to put in an overnight if you want someone to spend the night and pray the approve it. We only have 3 dorms and even dorms students can not commute from dorm to at any time they like. You have to sign in everyone that comes into your building (only 2 people). There are only allowed 6 people in your room at one time that includes you and your roommate. Looking for on campus fun this is not the school to come too."
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus can be a hassle. You have to get here early or the space will be filled. Around campus, there is a lot of traffic."
College Freshman,1,their is a lack of Varity in which would add to the college
College Sophomore,1,"I initially was given the Pell Grant during my first semester, but was then taken away because I was supposed to be receiving child support from my mother. The problem is that she hasn't paid in months, and when she does it is very minimal and in total owes over $15,000."
College Junior,1,Many get tickets or get their cars booted because they park on the side streets. They should make parking free for students.
College Junior,1,"Sad to say but we do have Greek life and no one joins! No one talks about it, has interest in joining one, nor wants to know about it!"
College Freshman,1,"The food at NJCU is not the best. If you live on campus everyone gets tired of the food after a while, that is at any college though. There is not a big variety on campus to eat from though there are only two places to eat on campus and if you dorm your meal swipes only work for one place. The other cafeteria you would have to pay out of pocket in order to eat there. The food sometimes is very plain and does not have a lot of seasoning to it. The school honestly needs more of a variety especially for the students that live on campus."

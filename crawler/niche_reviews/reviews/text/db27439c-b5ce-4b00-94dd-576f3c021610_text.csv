Sophomore,5,"Attending MJC opens new doors in life, forces you to be more open-minded, work with others, and focus. It has been an amazing challenge to return as an adult. The staff and instructors are very helpful and are always there quickly to respond and meet your needs, to learn."
Sophomore,5,"The campus itself is a community. You feel welcomed, and there are various programs to major in with helpful instructors and counselors to help you succeed and get you on your way to graduate and transfer to a four-year university."
Sophomore,5,"I love the school and the environment the school gives to students attending. All teachers are outstanding and do what ever they can to help individuals succeed. As for change, I would like to see more classes allowing more students. At times, it can be difficult getting classes you need, just because they fill up extremely fast"
Sophomore,5,"As online learning is not the funniest experience, Modesto Junior College makes remote learning a little easier on individuals. They are sure to provide plenty of information and detail on whats going on as well as the description of assignments."
Graduate Student,5,My learning experience online with MJC was good. There was only one class that I didn't like because of the teacher.  Overall I enjoyed my classes online and on campus.
Sophomore,5,I enjoyed attending MJC because the professors are great at doing their job and they provide a lot of help for students who are in financial need.
Sophomore,5,The online classes at MJC can be hard but the professors are usually available if you email them and answer quite fast. Also when discussing with other students online it’s easier to know what everyone in the class thinks while in a face to face class it can be more difficult to get that since not everyone talks or participates.
Niche User,5,"I love MJC. I really appreciate their online  courses. I am grateful they offer assistance with financial aid, particularly the BOG Fee waiver. I highly recommend this school to friends and family."
Niche User,5,"I took a variety of online courses at MJC. For a student like myself, who also works while attending school, it's my best option. I get to work with my availability while continuing my educational goals."
Freshman,5,"Remote learning is t for everyone, but it’s still great to see how we’re still getting to learn. Still receiving lectures and homework to help us prep. I enjoy school and I love that they did this."
Freshman,5,"MJC is a great community college! The whole environment is just awesome and lots of friendly people, very kind, campus police as well is very helpful. The whole staff there. The whole school is filled with faces full of joy and it’ll be a awesome experience definitely."
Niche User,5,"I took Summer courses at MJC during and after highschool and always had really cool professors :) Even when you're not enrolled in the current term counselors and MJC staff reach out and check up on you.  They also have a food pantry system to help students with meals which I always thought was just the coolest. Overall, I had a great experience with MJC and am thankful for all the help I received there."
Junior,5,I really like the help by the staff members on trying to figure out which major to go for. Sometimes is hard for students to enroll on a major but they help a lot. Counseling was very helpful through out my whole college time and it definitely game me more time to think about my major. There are more than one counselor students can go to to see which one you like the most and just stick with one through out the whole college time because they guide you and help you on trying to transfer or graduate there.
Freshman,5,"It is a very nice school, I have had excellent teachers this is my 3rd semester here and I feel great being here. Everyone just works at their
 own pace."
Freshman,5,"Amazing specialists in founders hall 116, they are always there to help every student, no matter race,gender, or major.  I am enjoying my first year in college at MJC"
Junior,5,Modesto Junior College is a great way to get your college education started! All of the staff are very helpful with achieving your goals.
Graduate Student,5,I love this school because of the teachers. There are two campuses and I spent most of my time of the east campus. Those teachers are some of my favorite throughout my entire schooling career. They really care about their students and make their message relatable. It took me a long time to finish all my classes with a busy schedule but I always had my priority registration and most of the time I could get my unit waived of fee. The counselors are also really good at finding the classes and degrees that are right for you to get the most out of your education in the least amount of time.
Sophomore,5,"Great school, a lot of help for the students. A good way for students to get started before going to a four year."
Sophomore,5,"Modesto Junior College is a great affordable school. I've been attending for 2 years and I've enjoyed the funny teacher and great friends that I have made. This school is very affordable, I've been able to complete my associates degree for free whereas if I would've gone straight to a 4 year I'd be in debt. I am happy for the time that I have spend at this school."
Sophomore,5,I like how this school tries to set you on the best path to success. Another thing I like is the teachers and programs they have for the students. Such as free meals every Wednesday or the school celebrating holidays with free items. This is school is definitely a good school to transfer from.
Freshman,5,So far all of my classes are good and I am enjoying each class. the Teachers are good and available for help. MJC is a great college
Sophomore,5,"Modesto Junior College (MJC) is a great college to get your feet wet. The instructors are very helpful as well as the staff. There are two campuses (an east and west) because there are a lot of good majors, certificates, etc.. offered. There are also many programs offered such as a free food pantry, English classes, and a pathway center where you can go for anything at all. Any questions can be answered at a pathway center. It is free for a first year full time student so you can expect to save a couple thousand dollars. There is also an ASMJC  office that can provide you with benefits and free stuff such as free scantrons and reduced price on concerts at the Gallo Center. You also get free bus rides with a student ID card. There are security at the campus but unfortunately a lot of robberies with cars still occur mainly because of wallets and purses being visible by the window."
Sophomore,5,I attended MJC for 2 years and the counselors were beyond helpful (of course if you take the initiative of meeting with them often). I completed over 60 transferrable credits and the professors were great.
Sophomore,5,I appreciated and enjoyed the professors at Modesto Junior College. They were always so helpful and had quite interesting material regarding various subjects. There was always activities on campus for students to be a part of. The East Campus in particular was in a great location with convenient parking.
Alum,5,"MJC is a good school. It has an amazing nursing program and great resources for students (ie. Pendulum, cadaver, museum). I've taken classes at Merced College as well and have noticed MJC has better wifi, resources, and overall runs more smoothly (financial aid, counselors, library hours, study space, cleanliness, campus security etc). MJC professors try to challenge their students but that's only to get them ready for the real world. MJC is probably one of the best community colleges in the Central Valley."
Graduate Student,5,Modesto Junior College has been nothing but good to me while I attended. They offer a vast amount of courses that can work with any time schedule. If students are confused with anything they can visit MJC's trusty counselors. I recently went to see mine and they looked through books to see other degrees I could be applying for that I didn't even know existed. The student life is decent. Everyone is a good mix of working moms to just recent high school graduates who are not sure of what their education path is yet. The food is good but they are located where students can drive a block and get a great piece of pizza at Churchkeys.
Niche User,5,"Attending MJC can be a hit or miss. Most of the professors are amazing, especially the English, Business, Political Science, Sociology, and History professors. In my experience, the math professors aren't the best. My overall experience has been great. Students jobs are only offered to Federal Work Study students, with the exception of the Technical Education and Workplace Development Division Office. If you are looking to join clubs and whatnot, MJC is not the place for that. There isn't much student involvement because most students either work full-time or work two part-time jobs."
Niche User,5,"It is a great community college, especially if you do not know what to major in. They have useful sources and classes in deciding the major that you would what to be in."
Senior,5,"For my two years i spent here, i absolutely loved. I’ve met so many great professors and fellow students here. I’m even involved in a club. There always so many great resources being offered and so many events always planned. This school has definitely prepared for my next journey to my university I’m attending in the fall."
Junior,5,"Great college. Wonderful professors, a wide selection of classes, and very nice campus. I’ve received two degrees through this school and am currently in the ADN program there, it’s really a wonderful place to get an education!"
Sophomore,5,"Good college, nice professors and always able to help. Always willing to show you how to get your work done well and accurate"
Sophomore,5,"I had the greatest professors and mentors while studying here. As all community colleges are, it is what you make of it. You can float in and float out never doing much besides going to class sometimes and never having fun, or you could take every opportunity possible while getting an amazing experience. MJC allowed me to get ahead of students at 4-years because I took every opportunity possible, with a cheaper price tag."
Freshman,5,Being a first generation child it was a bit difficult at first but the counselors and teachers were very nice and very helpful. The campus has a very friendly environment.
Sophomore,5,I love my experience at Modesto Junior College. The professor really help you when you need help. The professor are really helpful and are very clear with their lectures. The campus is every nice and clean environment. The environment is what I liked it the most.
Freshman,5,I am excited to go to Modesto Junior college. I want to get into the registered nurse program I will have fun and enjoy. I feel like I am going to feel welcomed and it’s going to be a whole different experience. People get let of help and they are also supported I feel like it’s kind of going to be like leadership like the environment. Something I would like to see change is that there are going to be way more graduating rates and I will make the percentage go up if I get accepted to Modesto Junior college.
Niche User,5,"Modesto Junior college is in a good area,and the campus is very clean. The people on campus are nice and helpful."
Sophomore,5,I haven’t yet experienced anything that needs to be changed. The past two years I’ve attended I had an amazing experience. Staff is so helpful. Teachers are great they make the class fun they don’t just teach to teach. They connect with the students and help everyone of us. Modesto Junior College is a school you would want to attend they help you get on track and the environment is awesome.
Freshman,5,Modesto professor are really down to earth and they love connecting with their students. the campus life is special all the staff members are very helpful and kind. i have not dealt with a mean or rude soul at all since i have been here. The students that go to this college are very kind and helpful they really love connecting with each other. i love that this campus has resources such as food banks and help centers for students to do there assignments.
Sophomore,5,"My experiences at Modesto Junior College are all great because I made them that way, no matter where you go to college it is what you make it. However, they could use a few more math classes to accommodate the students."
Freshman,5,I love it here! Great environment and even better opportunities. The academics here are very helpful and I am truly blessed to be attending here.
Junior,5,"The professors I have had have been really approachable for any questions and/or concerns. The campus is very nice, East is an old campus with new construction and many upgrades and West campus is beautiful. Both are easy to get to from the freeway. The cost is relatively inexpensive for the quality of instruction."
Sophomore,5,Modesto junior college has excellent resources and an easily accessible campus. I would like to see more parking space and better traffic control.
Sophomore,5,This campus is very friendly and helpful to every major out there. I really enjoy going to this school.
Alum,5,"It is a great junior college, with a newly built second campus featuring high tech chemistry and biology classrooms. They have really built it into one of the best JC in California. It is also connected to the Fire Academy allowing students to get free EMT/Fire training."
Sophomore,5,Modesto Junior College is a beautiful place to attend. Great buildings and classrooms. It feels like if you are at home
Sophomore,5,"I love being a student at MJC. Most of the instructors are very nice and always want to help you. Being an online student full-time is convenient, but they also have awesome on-campus courses I've been wanting to take."
Freshman,5,"This is my first semerster at Modesto Junior College after taking a semester break. Both of the campuses are nice, however the East Campus could use a bit of remoldeling or renovation because it is a little outdated."
Junior,5,The way I have made my education here at Modesto Junior College memorable is that I have made each opportunity to keep up on my school work on going. The learning center is a huge benefit to all students at all times. Free math tutoring all day every day throughout the week. All sorts of other tutors are there to help you in whatever you need. The counselors are spot on if you know what your major is but if not then they kinda are as good as you are just by yourself through finding the right college for you and what classes you should take to transfer with an AA. All in all the MJC life is not half bad. The on campus food isn’t the best but most Wednesday’s you get free lunch like subway and other great food for free!
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Modesto Junior College and so far from the looks of it, it is a really beautiful campus. Teachers/professors are very clear on what they say and do depending on who you get. The only down side is the parking, parking here is terrible, but the school is in a nice area both east and west campus so parking elsewhere isn't muich of a problem."
Senior,5,"Modesto Junior College is a great place to start your higher education, then to transfer. Not only is it great, but it also saves you some money. I enjoy this campus because the staff, professors, and services are very helpful and  want their students to succeed. I don't feel as if anything needs to be changed, because I have not encountered any problems at this college. With that said, I hope this helps any soon to be college students decide on where to go, good lucky!"
Freshman,5,I am having an amazing experience with this school. The academic environment is very enriching to your education and the staff is kind and helpful
Freshman,5,"Modesto Junior College is great place to start your education. Especially, if you are like me, who has been out of school for 15 years. At first I was scared of returning back to school But, after talking to my professors about how I felt, they only encouraged me to keep going. Since Ive started school its getting easier to understand my classes and my purpose of being in school. I would totally recommend this school to anyone!"
Sophomore,5,MJC is a great college with great professors! Wanted to stay closer to home to save money and I don't regret it a bit. Not to mention the beautiful campus they are constantly working to improve.
Junior,5,"Since I've been attending Modesto Junior College, I had many amazing experiences. One pleasant experience I had was a time that I needed assistance applying for a BOG waiver. I called a couple times to get help and kept getting sent to voicemail during business hours. Finally, the office manager answered my call and took my call directly to the person who was supposed to be helping students. Every time I needed assistance they always seemed to have no-problem helping me. One thing I wish they could change would be the location of their college. Its spread out across the city and can become a real hassle."
Senior,5,"The majority of Professors at this campus are caring, passionate, and effective in their teaching methods. I have learned a great deal since being a part of Modesto Junior College and have carried lessons that I am able to utilize in daily life from this school. It is easy to prepare for a career or for transfer to a four-year college at this school. I also love how the school works to involve the community by hosting free ""science nights"" and showcasing free informational films every semester."
Junior,5,I went to Modesto Junior College for 3 years and I will say they have amazing teachers and staff. The science department blew me away. Those teachers go over and beyond to help their students succeed.
Junior,5,"modesto junior college is an outstanding school! my mother attended that school, and i am now enrolled in it as well. My experience there has been easy going and my professors are helpful!"
Freshman,5,It's a great place to start out your college experience even if your older than the average student the whole scene is good and vibe is great I really enjoy being part of this institution and look forward to the coming semester
Junior,5,The aspect of Modesto Junior College that I most appreciate would be the fact that the campus staff and teachers are highly supportive and willing to aid the students in achieving success in their academic studies.
Niche User,5,Modesto Junior College has a great ag department. Lots of hands on experience and great teachers that want to help you get involved.
Senior,4,MJC has something for everyone.  They work with you whether you are fresh out of high school or going back years later.  I have always felt welcome at MJC.
Senior,4,"(Pre-Covid)  The classes I took online were easy to navigate.  The instructors made sure that you were engaged and participating, and helped you along if there were issues."
Sophomore,4,"I personally don't prefer taking online courses; However, with COVID going on, the professors have shifted to online/remote learning, and it is quite a good experience so far. Most professors understand that at home, distractions are bound to happen and that students can be busy."
Sophomore,4,I love the flexibility and closeness this school is to me! The professors are all very helpful and charismatic for the most part also.
Sophomore,4,I always thought my online courses to be very straightforward and easy going. I'm able to keep up with them while learning as well.
Graduate Student,4,I liked going to MJC. I really didn't have any problems there but when I did they got solved. In the past year I have see more diversity among the students.
Freshman,4,I don't like how we have less security and random people walking inside the campus. There is too much smoking in the campus.
Freshman,4,The campus should be a smoke-free campus. We need a safer and secured campus with security and cleaner environment.
Sophomore,4,I took a few online classes but I would highly recommend avoiding if you can. The professors are much better in person and were not at all equipped to switch to teaching online.
Sophomore,4,"It’s great for getting in and out, but really provides no college experience. It is good for commuting. I am now transferring to USC so I will say that MJC did help launch me to a fantastic school."
Senior,4,For being a community college I really like the school. The school is split into two different campuses called MJC west and east. The school has good teachers and really great staff for a helping hand. Its truly feels like everyone is there to help each other.
Senior,4,I love the professors! I have worked with so many that truly care about their students. Food could be a lot better.
Senior,4,"Personally for me, online learning is not my favorite way of learning, but most of my online classes have gone quite well. Canvas is easy to use and navigate and most of my professor's for online classes have been very responsive and helpful."
Junior,4,"Modesto Junior College has to be one of the best community colleges in northern California. The science department is amazing,  the professors are really hands-on and push you very hard, they want the best for their students. They have multiple programs and resources for students. Some of them include a Starbucks food pantry, where students are able to take bags of Starbucks food that has been donated. Free lunch is given every week and there is free tutoring for all students. The staff and administration are very kind, they help the student achieve their goals and make sure they stay on track. This school does not have dorms which are normal for a community college, but it does provide housing for some students in the agricultural department, I think that is pretty cool."
Sophomore,4,"The counselors and professors have great knowledge and they are always willing to help me with my questions. I like all the programs that are available to students, especially the tuition-free programs they offer. The sports are top notch and have a high success in their league."
Sophomore,4,"The professors are MJC are genuinely interested in their students success, which is shown through the passion they have during personal discussions. However, the campus life isn't the best it can be. I believe there needs to be more security on campus that patrol the areas, as there have constantly been many cases in short periods of time that have to do with harassment and robberies."
Sophomore,4,"Modesto Junior College is a good transfer school! although it lacks quite a bit, it is only a transfer college."
Senior,4,"The college I attend is good for a Jr. college, and the professors are attenuative to their students. Th quality of student life seems to be good compared to other colleges, for the material is challenging yet still simple because the professors spend the time teaching the material."
Freshman,4,"So far my experience with MJC has been pretty great. I am only in my 2nd semester, but I've had great teachers, and lots of help from all of the staff as well. I've been out of school for 10+ years and was terrified to come back. MJC has made the whole process easy and comfortable. My only complaint is that parking on East Campus can be difficult at times, but I anticipated that going into this."
Sophomore,4,My school really cares about the students and everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed! As well as being apart of clubs I currently serve as the BSU President
Freshman,4,I felt lost on my first semester. I was able to navigate the system thanks to mjc staff. You just need to set a whole day to complete your day.
Sophomore,4,"Overall my experience at MJC has been very positive.  It is a nice campus and the instructors I have encountered are very caring and supportive.  The biggest negative for me is that there are no semester breaks other than between fall and spring.  As an older student with a full life of work, family, and other responsibilities, it would be helpful if there was at least a week in between each semester to give me time to decompress and prepare to start over."
Freshman,4,"So far, my experience at Modesto Junior College has been far better than I ever could have hoped. I expected to be a thousand times more overwhelmed with work, and insurmountable amounts of stress, but so far it has been very manageable. The counselors and other staff are very kind and willing to help, and my peers have been more than helpful in answering my questions."
Freshman,4,The online classes are amazing. I started taking MJC college classes my freshman year of high school. I have always been motivated to get a hig education but money has always been a problem for me. I want to become succeeful in the career I choose. I recommand MJC because it will get you your basic knowledge to help you extend your education.
Freshman,4,"The school gives students opportunities to have any help that the student would need in anything like in financial aid, getting your grades up, and helping you plan for success. They have different programs like starfish for you to plan for success and there are always counselors to talk to about any questions you have about your plan and how to have a successful academic year."
Sophomore,4,What I like about Modesto Junior College is the expenses and people. This college is not very expensive and the people are mostly friendly. They  offer work study so you can work and go to school and they work around your schedule. What I would like to see change is the variety of classes for majors and better professors. There are some great professors at this college but some are not that good so you may have to take classes at another college or even because Modesto Junior College doesn't offer many beneficial classes for majors like astronomy or engineering.
Sophomore,4,This school is great if you want to get a feel for how to be successful in your college life. You can take classes before transferring to a four year college and the school helps with transfer questions as well.
Sophomore,4,the application website is horrible and it takes forever to get fasfa done. The pirate's net website is the worse website the government has ever allowed. All an all i really enjoyed my time at MJC the teachers were good and friendly the students were mostly nice. The teachers are helpful and they really want you to finish and transfer out
Niche User,4,The professors and all other faculty are very nice and helpful. The on-campus tutoring definitely helps with studying and I would 100% recommend doing it. I did notice that every once in a while my account would get charged for no apparent reason and the only way to fix it is call their business center. Other than that this is a really good school and it opens up many doors for those that cannot afford to pay a four year tuition.
Freshman,4,It’s been a great first semester so far and I love my teachers. I would just like to see more classes because I cannot get into the classes I need.
Sophomore,4,Modesto Junior College is a great place to get you two year degree. Throughout my time here I have had amazing professors and an overall pleasent experience. The biggest complaint I have is how fast some classes fill up. Getting into a math class can be very difficult.
Freshman,4,"I wish the campus would look a little brighter because it looks dull and dead. I also wish the parking lots looked safer and had better grounds. There should be more things going around on campus because I never really hear about anything, which is why I'm not always involved."
Alum,4,I liked the amount of classes to choose from and the security guards. Mostly because I somehow managed to get my keys locked inside the car 6 times or so per semester. Also ASL was awesome
Freshman,4,"Modesto Junior College offers its students with a convenient and efficient way of receiving the education needed to pursue a career. One thing I like most about this school is that they offer a Nursing Program for students to obtain their Associate’s Degree in Nursing. However, I feel it would be even more beneficial to many students if the ADN Nursing Program became a BSN Nursing Program considering the advancement of education in careers."
Senior,4,"The professors are helpful and willing to meet with you during office hours or even accomdate you if you ask. There are great resources that students should checkout such as the tutoring center, transfer center, counselors, and up to six free therapy sessions. You will be surprised to see how much they actually have to offer."
Junior,4,Great teachers and a great campus. I really enjoyed how each teacher did well at communicating after hours. All of the textbooks were easy to get to and most of the classes that required software had the software on campus so you didn't need to buy them.
Graduate Student,4,"Good College got my A.A. there and now employed there. Good teachers, that genuinely care about one another.  2 campus one on the east and west side of town. Overall i would say a good atmosphere for students. Friendly to the public and does community work."
Freshman,4,I like how helpful the counselors are and how the student help desk is so accessible to students it really helped make things alot easier while applying and registering for classes.
Niche User,4,I am disabled and can no longer work so  I attend MJC for enrichment.  The college and fellow students have been very helpful and supportive as well accepting.   I've had several instructors in the Arts department  and each one has been engaged and truly cares about their students.  They are encouraging and helpful in guiding students in their future endeavors.
Alum,4,What I liked about Modesto Junior College were the professors. They always tried their best to help me in the classroom. It’s not the safest environment but as long as you watch your back your good.
Freshman,4,"A great way to start your higher education career. The school offers a variety of technical programs, degrees, and levels of classes. Since the first year tuition free the for first-year students it's an affordable choice."
Sophomore,4,"Modesto Junior College (MJC) is a good school filled with many resources. Often the professors have office hours if you have any questions regarding the curriculum or your grades. MJC also has programs for free food, child care and financial support."
Junior,4,"I definitely like how relaxed the venue is. It’s not too noisy in the library. We have an amazing science department. The professors for anatomy and physiology have some OUTSTANDING backgrounds and are amazing sources of information. We have one of the best Advanced Cadaver programs in California. We get people driving from UC Davis to take our anatomy class because we have the best cadavers. The best part is, our nursing program is not only academically inclined, but affordable. To become a RN with an ADN in 2 years is around $7,000, which is crazy."
Sophomore,4,I like the professors! They seem to care about my success and career goals. It is important to have resources at school and i feel i have those.
Sophomore,4,"I liked the professors, they are nice and teach well the classes. I like how they are students and health services in both campuses."
Junior,4,"Many professors are passionate about the subject they teach, and it shows through their students' application of learning and acing the class. In many of the classes I've been in, I enjoy seeing my professor's enthusiasm and love for what they teach, and seeing that passion makes learning not so boring. I used to think that I wasn't that smart, but going to Modesto Junior College made me see what possible potential I had for math and science thanks to the teachers I've had these past semesters."
Alum,4,"I have attended Modesto Junior College steady for 4 years. I know its is a 2 year school, yet I changed my major a few times, but thats why I decided to go there! In the last 6 years, I have seen Modesto Junior college grown and become a place I was proud to attend. With newly remodeled buildings and state of the art facilities, I was happy to sign up for the next semester. The instructors I had were often very good, having only a few that I disliked."
Niche User,4,The classes and instructors are great. I would like to see better and more affordable housing for students. Not all of us get help with finances and can't afford housing in this area. Pretty centrally located and close to freeway and lots of food. Modesto is known for its meth community and huge homeless population.
Freshman,4,This is a good school. Only been there one semester but it's smooth sailing. Just look up your professors before registering for a class.
Sophomore,4,I really like how much the professors care about their students. I feel that the surveys the students take at the end of the semester should impact the teachers to make the changes necessary to be better teachers.
Senior,4,Modesto Junior College is a great alternative to taking general Ed at a 4 year. Classes are a bit impacted but if you get good grades your priority for registration gets a nice boost.
Alum,4,"It's a good school if you are looking to transfer out from a two year college to four year. The professors, for the most part, are pretty good. There's not much a party scene or housing but students tend to commute to the campus."
Sophomore,4,"This school has amazing professors who will take the time to get to know their students, this makes the school enjoyable."
Junior,4,"Modesto Junior College is a nice community college that people attend, so they can pursue their education at their own pace. The teachers and students are very friendly, I've never had any issues with the school. MJC was never my first choice however after attending this school I feel like it was one of the best decisions I made because I saved a lot of money and still received a good education."
Junior,4,"MJC provides programs to ensure that students, regardless of hardships, have a equal opportunity to succeed in school. From free busing, free student marterial resources and employment opportunities after college, MJC does its best to make sure the only thing standing between you and the diploma is yourself."
Freshman,4,I am still enrolled in MJC classes but so far I have enjoyed the ones I have completed. The teachers have been very kind and for high school/ first time college students they help and are easily reached in person or through email. I will continue to take classes through MJC.
Junior,4,"It is okay. The professors are very proactive with the students, but it is sometimes very hard to get the classes needed."
Senior,4,"Modesto Junior College is a decent school and it a lot harder than people make it out to seem.  People automatically assume that because it's a junior college it is lower or easy; however, I have taken courses at state colleges and MJC is no picnic.  Overall, I am extremely pleased with my time at MJC."
Sophomore,4,Modesto Junior College is a great alternative route to take rather than going straight to a 4 year university. The professors make a very good effort to try and help the students when they are in need of help.
Sophomore,4,"The professors are attentive & will go over things to get you to understand what you are missing. I feel they are friendly & approachable, & always willing to help when they have the time."
Sophomore,2,"I would like to see there be more of an effort put into the students and getting them to graduate in a timely manner. Counselors don't know how to help students transfers, there's not enough classes for all the students attending. The school itself appears for concerned with money than helping the students succeed."
Junior,2,MJC is a two campus junior college. The campus is always under construction and there is never any parking. The food price is more then going to  fast food restaurant and the quality is not worth the value. The professors overall bring the only positive nature to this college. There is no dorms or social life for campus aside from club events and a few events like free lunch and culture events put on by the school. 
College Freshman,2,"There arent many jobs in this city for graduates, they sometimes have to commute"
College Freshman,2,There's so many different aspects to juggle at once it becomes difficult to manage
College Sophomore,2,"the only thing that is really on top with the online courses that I have noticed so far, is that the peer to peer interaction is very good. Other than that, the way it is all set up is extremely confusing.."
College Sophomore,2,the quality of the courses and the professors are good its just that the variety of the classes with what is offered is very slim if you would like to get in and out with an associates in which ever you are trying to major in..
College Sophomore,2,"the classes have been really involved with making sure that the students grasp the concept of each course, but other then that I have the most difficult time with moving out here without the housing that I had believed was available from the initial application process, along with the misdirection about just how much it will cost to get the basic security in order to live and the amount of funding I personally thought I was supposed to receive, which I did not!! It has been very difficult trying to survive off the little amount of grant money I have gotten plus maintaining my grades, not falling behind, buying the essential school supplies, paying for a place to live and still having some kind of money to be able to eat.. While doing all this off the 1,440 I receive every 3 months.. Other then that I have been really taken by surprise with how much I like everything and how easy I have found the academics to be considering I have been out of school since 2008.."
College Freshman,2,i am not attending the college yet but the coucling has helped me alot
College Senior,2,"I as an international student experienced a lot of difficulties funding my education in U.S. Reason a rated my school with ""bad"" in this section is because there is no any possible financial aid or merit-based  aid for international students. Even with 4.0 GPA I couldn't get any help funding my education. And last, but not the least, costs per credit hours for out of state and international students are four times as more expensive than for in state students."
College Junior,2,The classes I need to take are fully enrolled by the time it's my day for registration so I haven't really taken the classes I need for my major.
College Junior,2,People are helpful and friendly. It expensive but its an education that cant be taking away.
College Sophomore,2,I do not have any special facilities. I received some sort of plan from my counselor but I am not really sure how any of it works out. I know what classes I need to take but the major I signed up for does not have any special benefits in this college as far as I can tell. Other majors in this college do have special programs such as agriculture which has a big facility and I do believe that one can get a degree in teaching here but I am not entirely sure.
College Sophomore,2,I really have no idea what the career services at this school are. I have attended a job fair that the school hosted but this is really all I see pertaining to career services.
College Freshman,2,"The East Campus can definitely use some upgrades to the scenery and student environment. West Campus seems to look more modern and with the times, but lacks in art and creativity, other than the amazing science center."
College Sophomore,2,The wifi is so overcrowded it makes it difficult to get on and do research in class
Recent Alumnus,2,I have no idea. Seems right.
Recent Alumnus,2,I really haven't been able to get any help. It seems as if I get more help by calling in then actually going into the financial aid center.
Recent Alumnus,2,I'd say its baf db because I dont know anyth about it.
College Junior,2,"I dislike how science lab classes run late in the day. Also how there is two different campuses, and I sometimes have to drive back and fourth. "
College Junior,2,I hate how we have no library right now. It was supposed to be finished years ago. 
College Student,2,"The computer labs could be bigger but the network, operating systems, and internet connection speeds couldn't be better. One major improvement is the printing system, the print card is a great idea but without a way to easily put money on the card, what use is it? "
College Student,2,"I havent had much experience with the career center but my degree has my in college a minimum of eight years, I'm sure the job prospects will be plenty."
College Student,2,"I might have a biased opinion on the tuition situation because I am a 'starving student'. $50 for a class would be expensive, right now I believe students are paying upwards of $45 per unit, not including all the extra feeds, parking fees, and books. The financial aid office was straightforward and easy to work with, filling out applications and getting information was the least difficult besides registering for classes. Although, over the phone information could be better than always being told to come down to the office. "
College Student,2,"There is definitely a mix of people at my college, I spend a lot of time just in the agricultural department but when I am over by the student forum, cafeteria, court yards I see a lot of people rushing to class, some sitting in groups talking or doing homework. The only constant thing I notice at my school is its always busy, until about eight o'clock at night."
College Freshman,2,"To use a computer or printer at the school, you have to have a card for it and its ten cents per page that you print out. I don't mind paying for the pages I print out but it sucks not being able to use the computers without your card, that's why I fell the need for my own computer and printer. The wireless connection works great, I get good service in all of my classes, and it's fast."
College Senior,2,"MJC is average, nothing really stands out to me besides the teachers."
College Senior,2,"The location, classes, teachers are all convenient and flexiable."
College Senior,2,fill out the financial aid ahead of time.
College Senior,2,"Computers are very busy sometimes you get get on a computer, too crowded."
College Senior,2,Calwork and ESOP are great programs for low income students.
College Senior,2,Easy regisrations and helpful staff.
College Senior,2,I'm not sure what our post graduate services are.
College Senior,2,very diversity and understanding with in different cultures.
College Senior,2,"printing on campus is $0.10 each paper you copy or print. which I believe is a great price. wen need more computer labs because like i said earlier we have 26,000 students on campus and there can be a lot of wear and tear to the computers we have know so we need more to balance that ratio out.our Wireless network has hut down 4 times the whole time I've been at this college so we need a little more help in that department."
College Sophomore,2,"Professors are mostly ""ok"" but some just make the student feel lesser merely because it's a JC."
College Sophomore,2,"Granted that this IS a community College, there isn't much tuition to worry about. However, the Financial Aid department is very uninformative regarding laws and limits of federal grants and state grants. There is always a 20+ line of people waiting to talk to two people. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!"
College Senior,2,"Currently, I have not been able to work my classes around my schedule because I am enrolled in a program, but I do get priority registration so that is a definite plus."
College Senior,2,"Whatever MJC does, another college can do it better as well as have more variety in available resources."
College Senior,2,This school is very hard to get into classes. This is understanable because there are so many college students but its frustrating
College Sophomore,2,"I don't really here about campus activities much or about the athletic centers. However, the student center and library is very resourceful when it's not closed down for construction for the last semester -_-"
College Senior,2,In my school there isn't anything unique about it. It is hard to get in classes that are needed to complete general ed but I would imagine every college is like that. There is a lot of clubs and opportunities but I personally don't have time because of work but the school is just average.
College Senior,2,"You get a good, quality education while having to pay low tuition here, but the financial aid process is very time consuming and sometimes you don't receive your money until after the semester starts."
College Sophomore,2,"The reason the grade above is not an F like I would like to have put is because there is one teacher I will always remember who gave me hope in going through MJC. With the different classes I have taken and teachersI have experienced, most of them are there for the pay check not for the joy of teaching. Even the counselors look misirable and rush you out as quick as they can."
College Sophomore,2,"I have had online classes that are very straight forward and easy to use and I have also had online classes where the teacher is nowhere to be found and the due dates for assignments are different everywhere you look.  It depends on the teacher of the class and how committed they are to keeping up with the class.  In my experience, they are not that committed."
College Student,2,There are good resources on campus but majority of times I feel that you are on your own to find the information that you need.
College Junior,2,There is no flexibility in my current program.  I had to drastically change my schedule to accommodate
College Junior,2,"Overall the school is ok in terms with being somewhat up to date in regards to computer lab, library, auditorium, and classrooms. The school in terms of teaching, interaction with students in terms of teaching has its ups and downs like every college does. Since it is a junior college though there has been limited funding for the school to update, for students who are low-income, and teacher's income. Of all those things listed i give MJC a 3/5"
College Student,2,They tell where to go and what information to get but from there your own to guess what to do and search.
College Senior,2,There a a handful of teacher that i loves at MJC some don't take their job and don't care for the students at all.
College Senior,2,"The school has a lot of cut back I have seen over the years. I been attending four years now and it really is sad how much they cut. I see less students trying and just getting into class to get FASA however, they drop out, thus having the cuts. It is not fair to students like me who try and get involved. I am in the TRIO program however, they have also got cut and it turly is not fair to the students who try and make it and was to better their life and want an education."
College Junior,2,"I have received a few years of fee wavers, but no financial help otherwise. Education is always worth money spent, but there is not enough help. THe school (s) need better programs to help out more students"
College Senior,2,"I feel like with all the budget cuts, academic flexibility is harder than it use to be.  The teachers are a lot stricter about the amount of students they will allow in the class."
College Senior,2,"Like I previously mentioned, our library is closed for construction which was a big area for students to study and do homework.  There are several computer labs in the buildings but it's not really compatible for studying with large groups."
College Senior,2,"I've been at MJC for a few years now and I've never really attended another campus.  I think that MJC doesn't have a lot of school spirit but I do believe it's because it's only a Junior College.  We do have a lot of BBQ on campus for various clubs and we do put a lot of time into Earth Day, which I feel is pretty cool.  Our school does sponsor several events for the local elementary schools and I've participated in a few of the events.  I felt like it was a fun experience and I was always surprised when the young children were so familiar with things I just learned about."
College Junior,2,"Some professors are good, the chances of getting into the class you want is low, the tutoring center is not much helpful"
Recent Alumnus,2,Financial aid is an extreme hassle and I went through way too much trouble to find out I was not going to recieve any based on my major.
College Senior,2,"A lot of the student body are young kids right out of high school, so they do not take lectures and homework seriously."
College Senior,2,I feel that a few of the adju professors arent very helpful and are rude at times. My current teacher is very standoffish and sometimes im intimidated to even ask questions. I had another teacher who accused me off plagiarism even when it was absolutely false.
College Junior,2,I do not believe that the value of education I receive is worth the money that I am spending.  The education is the same but the cost of units increases.
College Junior,2,I Should Qualify – I live on my own and myt parents dont support me i support myself and i cant afford books and have a hard time with money and becasue my income and my parents WHO DONT SUPPORT ME AT ALL I cant qualify for any help
Sophomore,1,"Online classes are terrible at this school. Do not take them. Teachers will not respond to you and if they do, then you have to email online learning, and library, tutoring centers, and ask them to email your instructor to ever ger a response. It is absolutely chaotic. Human Services Department is the worst. Those teachers have long tenure with the university and pretty much do what ever they want."
Alum,1,"Terrible counseling department. East campus is very much an eye sore compared to the west campus. Many professors that I had were rude and not very helpful at all, and counselors didn't know what they were doing."
Freshman,1,I think its a experience of what college is like. I will be attend for 2 years to get a experience thatn transfer to a four year college.MJC is a really nice campus with familiar faces and again a great experiences of college before you go to a four year.
College Freshman,1,"When applying for schools, many of my friends told me that I would be secure financially; however, that changed quickly after I was denied financial aid. I have been granted the Board of Governors Waivers, but that barely helps. My parents are divorced and do not have a relationship with my father. My mother supports me as much as she can, but that is only in the form of a gas money, here and there. Because on paper she earns enough money, I do not qualify for financial aid. I am attending one of the best junior colleges for the area in which I am studying, yet I am not from the area. Therefore, I have to pay for rent, food, and transportation. I have a job, but with recent cutbacks, I rarely get the opportunity to work, and even then it is a four hour shift at minimum wage. I want to stay here, but if I don't receive any financial aid, I will have to resort to other options."
College Senior,1,"So I believe every school receives an F on this topic because sometimes financial aid comes very late and your stuck with the bill, which means you're either over drafted, owe someone else money, or are with ought food at times and the last one is myself. They need to some how get the paper work together before we fill it out on the first of January if they know they candle all the influx of paper work we need to set up a system to where were turning things in 4 months before we receive funds so we all can be okay and not be lat on payments, or paying people back.  I believe MJC should actually charge us more for the education they give us, its honestly grad school type work with knowledge some of us never thought we could acquire."
College Senior,1,"I'm not sure what I want as my major so I'm taking the general classes first to get it out of the way. I am currently taking on 16 units and working part-time as well so the pressure definitely gets to me at times, but I never let that stop me. I would just like to figure out my major first and go on from there"
College Senior,1,Too. Much. Money. Is being sucked out of us. Especially for a Junior College. Tips on Financial Aid? Do NOT slack. Money is what will get you through this school. Money and motivation.
College Sophomore,1,I have no idea about any social events or unique opportunities at my school. Everyone pretty much just sticks to themselves and their agenda. MJC does offer good variety of reliable academic programs.
College Sophomore,1,"Honestly, I don't look at the student body and judge them. I go to class to learn. Modesto Junior College is very diverse."
College Senior,1,Even though they offer work-study and such they don't really have any programs for students to help them find work nor do they offer many opportunities for Employment on Campus.
College Sophomore,1,"The student body is quite diverse only because people of different races hang out(only if they know each other).  When a group of religious or political individuals come onto campus and set up, it's usually a bunch of bigots that no one wants to listen to.  Instead of telling the passing students what they stand for they try to shove their beliefs down their throats. This causes the student body's acceptance of these things to lower."
Recent Alumnus,1,the key for my online homework cost more than my book. The website is confusing and hard to read.
College Senior,1,"in order to get into my science classes, you need to be in trio to get priority. its hard to get into the nursing program at mjc"
College Senior,1,"The school is constantly dropping programs and cutting back and increasing the tuition. Most of the classes shown in the catalog are no longer in existence at the school. The workload is easy, and not stressful until it comes to tests. The registration is not bad; you can register online or at the school. I've gone to counselors for help about classes and my academic path with many questions, but they were no help and a minuscule amount of my questions were actually answered."
College Senior,1,"It's difficult. There are several steps, and sometimes my fellow students are given incorrect information. It is also only located on one campus except one day out of the week its on both but only for a few hours."
College Senior,1,I could only get a certificate in recording arts and the selection of classes was so limited there was almost no other options
College Sophomore,1,"Modesto Junior College is rather boring and average feeling. They have invested in a new student services building and auditorium, though."
Recent Alumnus,1,Teachers do not care about the studentsand it is almost impossible to get into core classes I had priority registration and was still wait listed for my math class. Councilers don't know how to do their job  they tell you to take one class for graduation requirement but then when you go to graduate that class didn't count so you end up being their longer than you need to be.  All they want is your money.
College Freshman,1,I had a horrible experience with the financial aid office. They were no help to me at all and didn't help me get any aid and I live on my own and support myself.
College Junior,1,"Online Classes – Online classes require much more attention because there is no one there to tell you to do the work, no teacher to tell you when to log on and when to read, you have to do it all yourself."

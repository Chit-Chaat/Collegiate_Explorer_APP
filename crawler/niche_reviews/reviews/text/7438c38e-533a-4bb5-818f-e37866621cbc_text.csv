Freshman,5,I absolutely love Lawrence. The atmosphere is great and the people both teaching and learning there are incredibly diverse and friendly.
Alum,5,"A classic liberal arts college with the added advantage of a full music conservatory. Academics are great. Professors are wonderful and committed. The campus is beautiful. Kind, smart, unpretentious students. A gem of a school."
Alum,5,I did not take online classes. I'm not sure why I have to answer this question. Niche won't let me submit unless I write 100 characters.
Freshman,5,"I love the friendly atmosphere the Lawrence community gives out. This comes from the students, professors, and staff members. Professors have a lot of knowledge in their careers. Small campus, but yet a lot to see and explore."
Alum,5,"Lawrence was a fantastic experience for me. It has the full liberal arts experience, with great integration and collaboration among different departments (especially the conservatory which offers its own bachelor's degree in music) as well as student organizations and community interactions. Professors are approachable and love interacting with students (all undergrads) and offer tons of flexibility for students to choose or create independent study courses. The campus is beautiful. Students are motivated, engaged, creative, and passionate. I graduated in 2012 and the things I learned at Lawrence - technical skills in linguistics and Arabic and music, social skills and networking, ways to think outside the box and take initiative - have served me very well over the past near-decade!"
Sophomore,5,Lawrence is a lovely little liberal arts school with a great community. Small calss sizes and professors that really care about their students are some of the best things about it.
Freshman,5,"If you like smaller campuses then this is the school for you. Beautiful campus, but easy to navigate. The community, students and staff, is very welcoming no matter your differences. Brilliant teachers and filled with talent."
Senior,5,"Real graduating film student here.  While Lawrence's film program may still be young, it already has so much to offer.  I came in thinking I was only going to care about production, but ended up loving the history and study of film just as much, as the professors here do a great job teaching you all the angles of a film. More than that, I have studied important films I feel like no other school would've given the time of day.  
I am also a computer science double major and my professor has been extremely supportive of both of my areas of interest. She came to watch my capstone presentation when she didn't need to and remarked to me what a great job she thought I did.  Even the fact that she came to watch me meant a lot, and her comments about my presentation made my whole week.  What this school lacks in size it more than makes up for in heart, as I have built great relationships with almost all my professors and feel that they truly want to see me succeed in whatever I choose to do."
Senior,5,"The student-professor ratio is unbelievable, the professors are engaged and the classes are small. The campus is beautiful. Appleton is beautiful, safe and a very nice city to live in."
Senior,5,Academics and professors were outstanding! Wonderful social atmosphere. Just we willing to say hello to someone you don't know and it propagates! Lots of networking and support.
Sophomore,5,"I love everything about Lawrence, from the small class sizes and caring professors to the wide range of activities and classes."
Sophomore,5,"Lawrence is the most incredible private school, offering everything that you could hope for. The academics are rigorous and pristine with the trimester system allowing for students to achieve more. The liberal arts education is incredibly valuable in crafting well-rounded individuals. In terms of catering to interests, Lawrence's countless clubs, athletics, and musical opportunities provide something for everyone. A prestigious, impressive, invigorating, and rewarding school, Lawrence University is the greatest option for intelligent, multi-interested students who want to be treated as individuals, not just as a face in a crowd or pit class."
Alum,5,"Lawrence is a wonderful, nurturing, challenging, and kind university on a beautiful river in friendly Wisconsin.  I was a double major in foreign language, and didn't decide till the end of my sophomore year to go to veterinary school.  I believe that the close relationships I had with my professors, and the multitude of fantastic opportunities I had at Lawrence made my dream possible.  I am forever grateful."
Sophomore,5,I love the close-knit community that supports you through the rigorous academics and pushes you to be active and passionate about what you love.
Junior,5,"For someone who wants a small college experience, Lawrence University is great! There are a lot of opportunities to get involved in leadership, research, and other educational and extracurricular activities. Even though it's in a small town, there are a lot of opportunities to see incredible speakers and artists! A lot of people also develop personal relationships with staff and faculty, who can be very helpful and supportive!"
Alum,5,"Lawrence gave me an opportunity to explore my wide-ranging academic interests.  When they didn't have a major I was looking for, I was able to design my own!"
Junior,5,"I like the liberal arts approach to education, I was able to explore many different areas of study and double major.  There is a wide variety of clubs to choose from.  The university also has an excellent music conservatory so the intellectual and creative minds can flourish."
Freshman,5,"Lawrence is great! The professors very obviously care about their students and want to make sure everyone succeeds. Students are supported, yet challenged to improve in all areas. Our dining hall has great food!"
Senior,5,"I love Lawrence! From the community to the professors to the food, I do not regret my decision to attend Lawrence. There are always tons of things to do both on and off campus, and the people you will meet will change your life for the better. Every opportunity is open to all students and you can really take your education in any direction you would like."
Senior,5,"Lawrence has a unique, close-knit campus community because of its small size and the fact that most students live on campus for their entire time here. The professors are truly exceptional in how they go out of their way to meet with students and encourage them in their individual academic endeavors. At Lawrence, every interest is encouraged and treated as legitimate regardless of whether it is a student's major or something that they want to pursue outside of their academic course. Lawrence has provided me with countless opportunities to grow both academically and socially in an environment where I feel supported but also encouraged to grow independently."
Sophomore,5,"Lawrence is my home. Sometimes home is not your favorite place at times, but it always has that special place in your heart. Lawrence has been there for me whenever I need it, professors are there when I need academic support, friends are there to keep things interesting and fun, organizations are there to keep me involved, and the food isn't half bad either! I wouldn't trade my Lawrence education for anything in the world."
Niche User,5,I recently just got admitted but I spent a week there this last summer of 2016 for College Horizons and i completely fell in love with the place. It is an amazing small little campus with such beautiful scenery. The classes also tend to be small and are discussion based.
Senior,5,"I like the help a student can receive from professors because of Lawrence University's low student to teacher ratio. The conservatory really is a hidden jewel of the music world, with the quality of musicianship only limited by how much work a student invests. I do believe there could be more diversity in professors and faculty, but these needs have been voiced and at least some in the administration have listened to them. I have heard of problems related to the school's administration, and I know that offices like campus life and financial aid can be difficult to deal with. I believe however that this is more than counterbalanced by a supportive and receptive student body and faculty."
Freshman,5,"I love it, its perfect the way it is. It's small yet it has everything you would expect out of a large ivy college. The best part being that it really is a LIBERAL arts college"
College Sophomore,5,"Lawrence University is a school that houses many different types of people, but makes each one feel supported and special. It is academically rigorous, but there are many different resources, including professors, to help you feel confident with coursework."
College Sophomore,5,"all professors I've had classes with are very apporachable. They are available outside of regular office hours and are willing to help student s with their problems. They a ccomodate issues like mental health as well. Some professors give more extensions than others. A wide variety of courses are available every term, ranging from lectures style to seminar based classes or a mix of Both. Class sizes are small. Biggest class is 50 students and the smallest is about 3-5. Average class size is about 20."
College Sophomore,5,All of my professors have been outstanding. They understand what their students experience and the general life at Lawrence. A wide variety of courses are offered and there are many interesting courses offered every term
College Sophomore,5,"All around, Lawrence University is filled with curious and driven students as well as dedicated professors who put in effort to see all their students succeed."
College Junior,5,This is a very diverse campus
College Junior,5,"I love this university more than i could ever explain. It has opened more doors for me and presented me with so many opportunities. I have learned that I am more capable than I ever knew, and that if I work hard, I can make just about anything happen for myself. The professors care so much, and are always there to give help and advice. They form genuine bonds with their students and it's incredible having that support and resource."
College Junior,5,"I have had an internship every summer I've been in college. Our career services office doesn't always wait for you to come in, but also sends anything they think would be good for you your way. The value in the degree I will receive from this school, in my opinion, is the same as receiving an Ivy League degree, maybe greater."
College Junior,5,"Honestly this school is my home. I am so proud to be part of this university and the academics, community and professionalism I have gained."
College Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy going to school here. Everyone, professors and students alike, are engaging."
College Sophomore,5,"I really like it here. At first I didn't think I would, but I really do value the community."
College Junior,5,"Lawrence really pushed me to do my best academically and I've learned so much about being myself and reading, thinking, and writing critically."
College Junior,5,I really love Lawrence and I can't imagine going to school anywhere else.  Where else could I study an intensive five year double degree program (Bachelor of Music in Violin Performance and Bachelor of Arts in Biochemistry) while also competing in Lawrence University's varsity Fencing Team and doing biochemistry research?
College Junior,5,I can truly say I absolutely made the right selection in choosing Lawrence University. The community is absolutely perfect for me as an individual and the academics are top-notch.
College Freshman,5,I love college. But I HATED the admissions process.
College Senior,5,"I love Lawrence University! I have amazing academics under my belt, great professors, excellent coaches and fun diverse people to be around."
College Junior,5,"There are a lot of parties with live, on-campus bands, which is fantastic.  On nights without organized parties, it's usually easy to gather with friends and have a good time."
College Junior,5,They enforce all the important things and make sure everyone remains safe at all times.
College Freshman,5,You will most certainly find your niche no matter who you are.
College Freshman,5,The academics here are amazing. W have the best faculty around.
College Freshman,5,Everything about the campus feels very inviting and accommodating. Things are easy to find and look very appealing.
College Freshman,5,Very safe. I feel very well protected on campus.
College Freshman,5,"It is very good here academically. Many people underestimate Lawrence because of its size, but it is very rigorous academically."
College Freshman,5,They mostly let you do what you want.
College Freshman,5,I find classes challenging and very stimulating here.
College Freshman,5,Campus security is super chill and they really only care that everyone is safe.
Recent Alumnus,5,I intend to go to graduate school for a Master's in Library and Information Studies.  My education at LU helped prepare with a program emphasizing both breadth and depth.
College Junior,5,"I'm a biochemistry major, and it's a great major to have at Lawrence. We have a really good science program and one of the greatest aspects of this major at Lawrence are the research opportunities. Each professor funds 2-3 students each summer to work on their research project with them, so many students have the opportunity to take advantage of this. I know of a few freshman that have been able to do research over the summer with professors and many sophomores that have as well which is not usually common at a larger school."
College Sophomore,5,"The geology department is awesome, our professors are wonderful and passionate about their fields. Our course load is a little intensive, but if you're into geology it's not a problem, the curriculum covers a broad spectrum both basics, and specifics and our labs have field trips which allow a lot more solid application of knowledge and exploration."
College Sophomore,5,"Lawrence is very, very generous both with financial aid and scholarship aid, while it's an expensive school to attend they are very good about working with you and your family to help make it more affordable."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm a geology major and I love our department, it's a great group of students and faculty. Our professors are all wonderful, our field trip/labs are great, and what I'm learning in my classes has real world applications."
College Senior,5,Its not like we just go through bio courses we are immeresed other fields as well.
College Senior,5,Hardest major to obtain on campus and in country probably.
College Senior,5,Well only bad time is FINALS when cram studying is holding parties up but great altogether Nightlife.
College Senior,5,"Its WISCONSIN come on Snow, Rain, Sunshine, the whole Nine yards best place in the world for seasonal weather."
College Senior,5,We live in APPLETON the largest police force per person ration in probably the US.
College Senior,5,There is a diverse community of restautants but no student discounts that i know of.
Freshman,4,My online experience has been a blast and would recommend to a couple of people. The classes online are organized pretty well with breakout rooms for group work and getting to know other people.
Freshman,4,My experience at Lawrence so far as a freshman has been all online for the first term. All the classes have been great online and few involvements for students online.
Alum,4,This is a small liberal arts college with an inclusive environment and focused peers. The music scene is awesome because of the Conservatory of Music.
Freshman,4,"It was easy to communicate, but personally online learning isn't as effective as in class learning is."
Senior,4,I love my time at Lawrence. I only rated it a 4/5 because it is so expensive to attend. If the school could offer more money and not increase the tuition every year that would help the students and defiantly would have increased my experience. I loved living in the dorms all four years but it is not fair to those that want to live off that we have to live on.
Freshman,4,As a prospective student going into Lawrence I was very impressed on my campus visit.  The overall campus was small yet big enough where you wouldn't know everyone going to school there.  The only down side to Lawrence seems to be that not all their dorms are brand new and clean.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Lawrence so far has been pretty good. My biggest complaint would be that there isn't much to do in Appleton, so I spend most of my time on campus. However, the school does have events planned every single day. I think the biggest thing I love about Lawrence is how safe I feel here, and it's such  a small school that I see the same faces walking around every day. The dorms are average, most professors are great, and the food is decent compared to other universities I've visited. The only other downside is that there is the ""Lawrence busy"" mentality, and there is a slight mood of competetion throughout the campus to constantly be grinding."
Junior,4,"I love how close-knit the Lawrence community is. The biggest reason as to why I chose to attend this college was because of how welcoming students, staff, and faculty were. If I could change one thing,  it would be to see more Pacific Islander representation on campus as well as more diversity."
Freshman,4,LU is a small school that is able to provide its students with a personalized learning experience while receiving a well-rounded education.
Freshman,4,"Lawrence University is an excellent college that cares about the well being of their students. The student life is always very active and there is always something to do. The conservatory offers many opportunities for students to perform as well as to watch performances from traveling musical groups. Lawrence University offers free counseling for all its students as well as academic help for those struggling in classes. The dorm life is very good and it is never too nosey. However, my favorite aspect of this college is the students. They are all nice and care about the well-being of the college and each other. Most of the students are involved in the college and participate in many clubs as well as ensembles."
Sophomore,4,I absolutely love it here. The trimester scheduling is awesome! Only 3 classes per term and classes of no more than 40 people. The liberal arts perspective enables me to take courses in a variety of fields regardless of the constraints of my major.
Sophomore,4,Some of the professors at Lawrence University are excellent. They work diligently to prepare their lessons and explain themselves clearly. The food is healthy although not super appetizing. The food service company Bon Appetit which manages the food at Lawrence is very responsive to food requests though. I asked for sugar-free soy milk and soon afterwards they had that in the dining hall.
Freshman,4,"I love Lawrence University. At LU I am never just a random student in a class of over 100. All of my professors care about my success and growth. As an undergrad Music education student I get more opportunities to teach AND perform than I would at any other college or university. While the student body is considerably small, the positives far outweigh the negatives in my experience. Lawrence is an amazing place of inclusion as well. I feel as though my identity as well as my fellow students’ is respected and celebrated. This is so important to me. Lawrence cares about who I am, what I want to do and become, and how they’re going to help me get there."
Sophomore,4,"Lawrence is a very open and welcoming campus that offers a lot of opportunities for advancement. While at Lawrence I have met an amazing array of different people, each with their own background that brings a unique perspective to the campus."
Freshman,4,"Lawrence has offered me the perfect environment to learn and grow as I work my way into the world. Even as a part of two fairly small departments, Linguistics and Classics, I have learned a lot and felt supported by my professors and my fellow students alike. Most of us seem to share a contagious enthusiasm for learning and exploring, whether in the classroom or at a concert or just sitting around in the dining hall and chatting. Throughout campus, students are known for their ""busy culture""; they are determined to find more to get involved in or accomplish. This can sometimes create a stressful or even competitive environment. However, both students and faculty members are doing their best to promote balance and ensure that this busy-ness doesn't reach unhealthy levels, and I have felt a campus-wide camaraderie and concern for the whole community's well-being."
Freshman,4,"- The intimate relationship with Professors
- Accessible academic assistance from tutoring services
- More discussion based classes that allow room for creative thinking"
Freshman,4,"Lawrence is a small school, and diverse for it's location in small-town Wisconsin. The professors are always invested, providing you with plenty of tools to be successful, and by the end of the first term, I was already calling it home."
Sophomore,4,"Lawrence is a rigorous, respectful, open-minded university. All students are required to take Freshman Studies where they have to explore unfamiliar texts which challenges and brings the best out of everyone. Since it is a small school, there are lots of opportunities to talk directly to professor and build strong relationships. Everyone is welcoming and friendly which makes the transition to a new place very easy. There are many local clubs that engage students from all across the world and the president is very active in meeting students which makes it a very close-knit environment."
College Sophomore,4,My professors all have made me feel very supported and have been accommodating.
College Sophomore,4,Students from Lawrence go on to do a variety of amazing things.
College Sophomore,4,Campus Safety makes you feel very safe but isn't overbearing.
College Sophomore,4,"Many different options for on campus housing, which is great."
College Sophomore,4,Greek life on campus is very unique and is incredibly inclusive.
College Sophomore,4,There's so much available. Dual degree is a great option
College Sophomore,4,The campus is very diverse.
College Sophomore,4,I have been enjoying my time but it could be better. The class sizes and they ways they're taught are great.
College Sophomore,4,"Our campus has had issues concerning sexual assault, but has been working hard to better it. Other than that we are quite safe"
College Sophomore,4,"I feel at times that some areas in the Conservatory have been struggling which concerns me as a music student, but the school has a nice atmosphere and is very accepting. People are very approachable and I am able to be myself. There are so many opportunities I feel I couldn't find elsewhere."
College Sophomore,4,Pretty diverse but still 60% white
College Sophomore,4,"Campus housing is pretty good. Some dorms are newer than others. The older ones are pretty good too. Some are closer to classes, where are some are closer to the campus center where our dining options are located."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a great school when it comes to resources, opportunities and fitting in. The social scene of more or less standard. A couple parties every other weekend which you get used to. Something or the other to do with friends. Professors are really helpful. You will get into most classes you want to take."
College Sophomore,4,Career services is great and a degree from Lawrence is valued fairly highly
College Sophomore,4,"campus safety responds quickly and effectively. Overall, I feel safe on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"No sorority specific housing, however, fraternity group housing is an option."
College Junior,4,"Lawrence is lenient on alcohol, but doesn't let it get unsafe. They have an educational approach."
College Junior,4,"I feel safe on the Lawrence Campus. I don't always feel safe walking through Appleton, but it is very safe as far as small cities go. Our security is fantastic."
College Junior,4,"The buildings on campus differ, so you can have any kind of dorm life you choose after your freshman year, in which they choose for you. All of the dorms are clean and nice and people are generally respectful of common spaces. I have been in all the dorms, and lived in many, and they're all great."
College Sophomore,4,I generally feel safe. But some of the lighting on campus isn't the best and I prefer to walk with friends at night.
College Junior,4,The university is very supportive and provides its students with endless opportunities.
College Freshman,4,The campus is very safe with campus security everywhere to help you out.
College Freshman,4,"I love this school in most of the aspects including academics, relationships, etc."
College Freshman,4,It is very easy to get internships related to your major!
College Freshman,4,I love the dormitory here. The rooms are relatively larger than those of other colleges.
College Freshman,4,I liked this school very much. Professors are usually very supportive for students.
College Junior,4,"I feel very safe on campus, even when walking home late at night"
College Junior,4,We have a great and very supportive career center which is constantly offering students opportunities to talk to recruiters and network with alumni.
College Junior,4,"The dorms are pretty great, but I wish they would let students live off-campus"
College Freshman,4,"I love living in Ormsby, but at times there are issues such as heating problems. But it is a really great place to live with great people."
College Freshman,4,"I am loving Lawrence so far. The faculty is really easy to work with and care about how we are doing, it is easy to get involved in anything you want, and I have met some great and supportive people."
College Sophomore,4,Lawrence University is a rigorous institution prepare to challenged and become a better person because of it
College Sophomore,4,The career center loves to help students it's really up to the students to express that they need or want the help.
College Sophomore,4,"Lawrence University Greek life board members strive to make the college experience beneficial to all, but I must say there is progress still to be made. I love that when I walk on this campus the sorority and female fraternities do not have bitterness and backbiting among them. Now that doesn't mean their equal but the women's Greek life is at least at peace with one another. The fraternities on the other hand .... not so much."
College Sophomore,4,"Hiett hall is the nicest, being a mostly upperclassmen dorm, but Trever hall and Ormsby hall are also newly renovated. More construction is coming along nicely for Coleman hall!"
College Sophomore,4,Show a little bit of interest and hang around the houses or the people to give them a good sense of who you are and you will have a bid in your hands in no time at all!
College Sophomore,4,As a football player and track athlete I know that the teams on campus work very hard year round to fight for our school. The win to loss ratio is not the best but athletic events are still fun to attend with a significant cheering section from the students and community.
College Sophomore,4,This school has opened opportunities for me like never before. Advisors will work for you when you go see them and when you apply yourself. When you work hard in the classes you will find yourself connecting with professors and this then leads to internships and other in school applications.
College Freshman,4,Independent studies are very common and the professors are amazing. They really seem to enjoy working with us as students and they seem truly dedicated to the betterment of our education.
College Freshman,4,Campus safety is willing to help no matter what. They are really good about getting to you and your problem in a timely manner.
College Freshman,4,"All the professors are willing to work individually with their students and they're all fairly accommodating when it comes to missing class, etc. The variety of courses is unbelievable. The sizes of the classes vary, but there are never more than 50 students in a class. Some classes rely more on technology where others use good, old pen and paper."
College Freshman,4,"It's fairly easy to get a job/internship straight out of Lawrence. However, if you are having a harder time, the campus is really good about helping you find a place to go."
Alum,2,"When I first arrived as a freshman, I was disappointed by the old dorms, remoteness, and lack of diversity, but I was willing to give Lawrence a chance. After struggling through 4 years of courses taught by professors that were hit or miss, in which I would often be the only person of color, I was finally ready to get my degree and go back home. However, the administration - particularly the registrar's office - did anything but make it easy for me. It's been almost a year and a half since I left Lawrence, and I still don't have my degree: and I won't get it for another 4 months at least. The only reason I didn't give a one star rating is because of the few friends and professors that supported me while I was there."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't drink, but it shocks me how many people drink especially that are underage and I feel there should be stricter rules"
College Sophomore,2,"new football field way off campus, no one supports the sports on campus"
College Sophomore,2,"Appleton,WI is a small town and the police make a lot of students feel uncomfortable. We have to find a way to make the police not fear us and as student help the police to understand we are all human."
College Sophomore,2,This past term was terrible the students of color received threats from white students and community members. According to out president steps have already been taken to insure the safety of those students
College Sophomore,2,I consider Lawrence University Athletics to be bad because freshman after a couple weeks already understand sports is joke on our campus.
College Junior,2,It is not a good system for anyone that needs to go on a payment plan.
College Junior,2,Most Lawrentians live on campus. Finding housing off campus can be a difficult process and is strongly discouraged by the school.
College Junior,2,"Lawrence is a residential campus, so all students are required to live on campus all 4 years. There are some exceptions, but I know of very few students that actually live off campus. That being said, we do have theme houses and small group houses that student organizations can apply to live in that may feel like living off campus since you are not living in the dorm buildings. We also do have 2 dorm buildings that are apartment style for upper class-men."
College Sophomore,2,It's hard to get off campus unless you walk.
College Sophomore,2,Too high a price for too little a reward.
College Sophomore,2,Few minorities and plenty of ignorant white kids.
College Sophomore,2,Too many students and not enough rooms.
College Sophomore,2,"Super cold, but you get used to it."
College Junior,2,"Off campus dining is okay but it has flaws in the sense that everything closes early. The only things open late are Toppers, Erbet and Gerberts and Jimmy Johns. 2 of those places being sandwich places and then the other being a pizza place that is ridiculously expensive and grossly unhealthy."
College Freshman,2,Students are not allowed to live off-campus
College Freshman,2,I really don't like how cold it is (it also snows a lot and makes the floor mushy)
College Junior,2,"Athletes are outsiders, it seems."
College Sophomore,2,"It's cold as butts here.  Winter is pretty awful, but fall colors are great!
"
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is relatively inexpensive, but there are not many spots, and it's done on a lottery system with grade preference, so if you're an underclassman, don't bother."
College Student,2,"Appleton is not much of a town. College Avenue is the main attraction with different stores and resturants, but it's no city life and there's no much to do off campus."
College Sophomore,2,There is a city bus stop located on campus. There are also shopping shuttles that run on the weekends and some evenings. Transportation to and from airports is left for the student to organise with friends or a taxi
College Freshman,2,Athletes work very hard but they are not appreciated as much as they should be. Not many people go to watch sporting events. Athletes focus more on school work than on sport.
College Sophomore,2,"The bars off campus are full of creepy townies, are overpriced, and too far to walk, especially in the bitter winter. There's an awesome on-campus, student-run bar called the Viking Room, which serves the cheapest drinks, and is frequented by students and faculty. Frats host large parties a few times a term, and room parties are frequent, but this is by no means a party school."
College Freshman,2,"There is a free parking lot, but it's across a fairly long bridge, and the closest parking garage is a good mile or two away. Parking close to classroom buildings is a hassle, but since Lawrence is so small, many people don't feel the need to have a car on campus."
College Freshman,2,"Campus Security is pretty relaxed. Appleton Police are not allowed on campus technically. They only come on campus if things get out of hand. If you get caught doing something you shouldnt be doing in your room, all you have to do is talk to your RHD depending on how nice they are. after another offense you will have to talk to campus life, and even then theyre going  to tell you not to do it again. However its not hard to not get caught, you just have to be careful in the dorms. As long as you are not obvious with your drug use or drinking you should be fine. If security catches you with alcohol, they will usually ask you to chug it or dump it."
College Freshman,2,"The computer labs are fine and very accessable, but the printers (at least the one in my dorm) often stop working and the wireless internet is pretty terrible. If you bring a personal computer do not bring a netbook, that's what I have and I lose my connection all the time. Bring an actual laptop, because they hold a better connection."
College Junior,2,"Toooo Cold. I'm not from the midwest, so these winters can be pretty hard on me, but Fall and Spring are generally pretty nice, and May can be really beautiful. It's just hard to remember that when it's 5 degrees and you're walking to your 8:30 across campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a School for Sports. We have sports teams, but I do not know people who regularly attend games.  This school is mainly music and academics, and most sports games are not noticed.  You will have an opportunity to play almost anything, but don't expect a sports scholarship or a world-class team."
College Sophomore,2,"It's Wisconsin, It's Cold. It does get very cold here in the winter.  The campus is small so it only takes 5 minutes to walk between buildings, but that can be a long walk in the snow.  Spring and Summer are great and frisbee games take place almost constantly!"
College Sophomore,2,"A Bit Sad, Dating Wise – There are many intelligent, funny, outgoing and all around awesome guys at Lawrence but not very many excessively attractive ones.  I have made great guy friends but found no romantic interest. Also, relationships at Lawrence are one of two things. Either random hookups or a seriously long term relationship, there isn't but of an in between."
College Junior,2,"Not Common – We are expected to live on campus for four years, but people can get off campus housing if they petition it, or above a certain age.  It's not very common, though.  I have a few friends off campus who really enjoy it, as apartments are not super expensive and are close to campus, but it's not necessary to live off campus at LU. The school can provide housing to all who need it."
College Senior,2,"If You Do Not Have a Car, You Are Stuck on Campus Forever – The campus is really small and there is no need for transportation. It is also very close to downtown Appleton and there are a lot of coffee shops and restaurants. Nevertheless, if you want to go further you can take the city bus which takes forever. There are also shuttles from mondays to thursdays but nothing during the weekend days"
College Sophomore,2,"We're a D3 school. There's a football team that looses almost every game, and a tiny number of students even bother going to home games. (and few students who seem to care that we have a football team?) The talent lies more in the conservatory and other arts. When I was a freshman, my RLAs would often convince us to see student recitals or theater productions on Saturday afternoons.
An advantage to this is if you are motivated enough to show up to all the practices, you can join a lot of the sports even if you've never played/participated in that sport. You also don't have to worry about not having time for other things because of 2-a-days. 
Athletic facilities aren't brilliant, but relatively decent for the casual athlete."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is a frustrating subject at Lawrence.  It is challenging for parents or visitors to find a place to park in Appleton since street parking isn't permitted.  There is not a lot of parking spaces behind dorms for students to park their cars in and most end up having to pay for public parking in downtown Appleton.  Since you do not need to have a car to get around campus itself this may not be an issue for freshman, but upperclassmen or people who want greater freedom may find parking/bringing a car challenging.  Also, you can't park illegally or you're bound to get a ticket within 10 minutes"
College Sophomore,2,"Good Old Wisconsin – Its typical Wisconsin weather.  It can and will snow from november to may, and classes are nearly never cancled. Campus does shovel fairly fast.  The bus are annoying too by the river, but that only happens once a year when they hatch."
College Freshman,2,"Catch Me If You Can – They are usually ok with alcohol, but when it comes to drugs they have started really cracking down and bringing the police in."
College Junior,2,"Parking is available on campus, but it costs about $75 per term and it is first come, first serve. However, there are parking ramps downtown that you can use that are only $1 every time you enter (free on Sundays).

If you have an unregistered vehicle parked on campus during the week, you will be ticketed."
College Student,2,"I'm transferring from Lawrence for a variety of reasons. The students are overall unmotivated, even though the professors are amazing. The general lack of amenities is absurd considering how expensive the education is. The social scene is virtually non-existent. The Lawrence bubble is overwhelming. Isolation is terrible, and suffocation is common."
College Sophomore,2,But it's generally located in a Bar. There's mostly just bar around campus...
Sophomore,1,"I would not suggest that you come to Lawrence if you are a student of color. Your name alone will be grounds for a substantial amount of discrimination on the part of administrators. The college is extremely expensive, and for that price, students expect to receive a fantastic education, however, that is oftentimes not the case. The administration is inflexible about your circumstances, and tries to squeeze every penny it can from every student it can catch. If you are a student at Lawrence, don't be surprised if you are unfairly targeted by teachers or given lower grades because of your skin color. The surrounding area is also despicably racist, and you will receive markedly better treatment if you are white. Many shops in Appleton are boarded up, and the mall and grocery store are pretty far away, making shopping difficult unless you catch the shopping shuttle (which only runs twice a week btw).  Lawrence is a school desperately in need of improvement and a better administration."
Senior,1,"Graduating Film Studies student.  Bad school, even worse program. Do you want to learn and study film legends like Orson Welles, Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock, Francis Ford Coppola, and Martin Scorsese? What about the tools to to make the kind of film you've always wanted to make? Whether it has a story or not. Awesome, go to a different school. You will learn nothing of the sort here. I've never seen people who hate film as much as these students and Communist (not a joke) and Freudian-obsessed professors. They only like films that push a political agenda, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's the only thing you will study. If you want to go in to production, they'll only allow documentaries and Avant-Garde stuff."
College Freshman,1,"Nobody goes to sporting events at Lawrence and there is no school spirit. The athletic facilities aren't that great, but you can get a free membership to the YMCA a couple blocks away."
College Freshman,1,You won't find any actual parties here.
College Sophomore,1,Students are not allowed to live off-campus.
College Sophomore,1,Plenty of drinking and not much else.
College Junior,1,I'm from a big city and HATE living in this town because of inaccessibility. It is difficult to get anywhere around town without a car and it feels like I'm truly in a bubble.
College Junior,1,"Our campus refuses to allow students to live off campus unless they are 4 yeas out of High School, have children or married because they insist on keeping with the archaic laws of wanting to be a ""residential"" campus. I call a bluff and wanting to just get more money out of students."
College Junior,1,"I come from a big city where I am able to take a train and/or bus everywhere when I need to get somewhere. It's a reliable system that gets me where I need to. In Wisconsin the buses take forever, there are no trains and everything is at least a mile away. If you need to go to Walmart or the Mall hopefully you have a friend who has a car."
College Senior,1,"Very conservative campus! Not diverse at all. If you are a minority, you will feel like you are coming from another planet. In my four years here, I was taught by only one professor of color. This professor is now teaching in another college."
College Freshman,1,The amount of financial aid I received was not fair at all. I felt like they really did not take into consideration what I needed.
College Freshman,1,"You have to live on campus all four years, as it's a residential campus specifically designed to create a learning community, so don't even think about living elsewhere. The only exceptions to this are for older or married students, students who are from Appleton (although they're only allowed to live at home if they can't afford to live in the dorms) and for fifth-year seniors, although the vast majority of them live on campus. In fact, I've only heard of one super senior who doesn't live on campus. Appleton is small but by proportion the university is still tiny so there really isn't much in the way of houses or apartments to rent nearby campus. 

Don't fret though. There are a lot of housing options on campus besides just the dorms. There are frat houses, theme houses, executive apartments and other housing options. The upperclassmen-only dorms are really good to live in and are basically like studio apartments."
College Junior,1,"Sports Are More for Fun – We aren't really huge on sports at Lawrence. We have a few teams that are really good, like track and hockey, and some that are not so good. Most of the people who do sports do them because they love them, and they're there for people who want to do them."
College Junior,1,"Wisconsin Typical – It's pretty white on campus, with only a handful of other races/ethnicities."
College Sophomore,1,"There isn't really any Lawrence-provided transportation to anywhere exciting. There's a shopping shuttle that runs to the mall and walmart and whatnot, but it's not the most convenient. There's also really no way to get to any of the surrounding cities (madison, chicago, etc) unless you have a car."
College Sophomore,1,"Generally Not Helpful – I have yet to have financial aid actually be helpful when I've gone in there. They gave me a reasonable amount of aid (about the amount I would have expected) for the first two years, but then they cut my work study, unsubsidized loans, and grant money by quite a lot. I don't know anyone who has gotten financial aid to budge; the only instance of ""more aid"" that I've heard of was more subsidized loans, which is obviously not helpful if you don't have the money in the first place."
College Sophomore,1,"LU is a very high regarded and rigorous liberal arts college. Anyone accepted here is generally smart and brings to the table various skills. For me personally, this school is very boring. The school is small and you see the same individuals over and over, the night life is limited, the town is small (nothing exciting), so the typical student barely goes off of campus, P.S. the weather is HORRIBLE!! There is a lack in diversity and also a lack of programs catering to the diverted students already here. I would not encourage anyone who is from a big city or looking for a memorable college experience to attend this university. If you are looking for otherwise .. Please come .. Lawrence might be for you!"
College Sophomore,1,"F for Fail! The night life here is boring and repetitive. There are room parties and theme parties sponsored by frats, and they suck because the music only caters to their taste and that's it. Off campus night life is even worse. There are only bars in our little town, and of course if you arent yet 21, you have to settle for drinking illegally in your room or somewhere else on campus."
College Student,1,"Other than having one friend on the track team, I virtually never hear about athletics at Lawrence. The football team is sad, especially considering I was raised to worship the pigskin. If you're looking for exciting athletics, Lawrence is not the place for you."
College Junior,1,"Not a Sporty School – Sports are not a huge part of campus life at Lawrence.  Very few students attend the games of any sport, and our sports teams are nothing to write home about."

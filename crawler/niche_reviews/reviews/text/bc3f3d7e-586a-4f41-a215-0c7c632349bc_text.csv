Graduate Student,5,"It is a great college to attend and it offers so many opportunities for students to flourish. My aunt, uncle, and father attended this college for undergraduate and graduate school. I basically grew up on campus watching the men’s soccer team while my father would talk to his old professors and colleagues. My love for this school has never wavered. Being able to continue my education within this wonderful institution is a great gift that I will not take for granted.Everything that University of Lynchburg has to offer transcends any other college/university."
Sophomore,5,"Definitely an excellent choice for higher learning. You will stay focused, and be deligent in studies as there are no distractions. Making you nothing short of a Scholar upon graduation."
College Sophomore,5,I will start school in the fall at Virginia University of Lynchburg and I ma looking froward to going.
College Junior,5,"Virginia University of Lynchburg is surrounded by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Appalachian trail where you can go hiking. The landscape and scenery is very beautiful. There is also swimming and boating at Smith Mountain lake. If you like to ski ,there is the Wintergreen Resort"
College Senior,5,Athletes Here at Lynchburg – The women's basketball team put the school on the map. The sports in winter and spring helped also.
Sophomore,4,I feel that Virginia University of Lynchburg is a great college to attend. The instructors are awesome with their teaching. The campus is small and so are the classes therefore its more of a comfortable learning environment. I would not change anything this is a great college.
College Freshman,4,The weather is beautiful all the time and I love the mountains
College Junior,4,"If a student want  to eat off campus whether it's breakfast or lunch they should try Georgia's Subs & Deli, this is  great place to grab a quick bite
or, the Osaka Japanese Express if they like Japanese food. these are two great spots for college students on a budget."
College Junior,4,"The acceptance in this school is remarkable. I am 57 years old. A lot of my friends are older. When we decided to continue our education, they made the process easy. Very understanding and patient personnel and teachers. We were not discriminated against. The color of your skin, male, female and age doesn't matter. I started on a local campus and I am now continuing my education on-line."
College Junior,4,"I Am a on-Line Student – I got to eat on campus once during commencement in May 2012. the menu and dining hall was excellent. They even offered snacks as an option. I dont live on campus but, I will recommend this as a good place to eat and dine."
Niche User,2,"It’s not really a school, they don’t focus on your major and you have to take the classes they tell you to take. They don’t have clubs or numerous sports they only have football. Something that can be changed is everything really because nothing is right there, I wouldn’t recommend anyone to go there."
College Senior,2,I gave the weather a c- because it rains bad and it ges really cold
College Senior,2,They Deserve It – They deserve a c because they say they care but it doesn't show on campus..
College Sophomore,1,Only two buildings for students but some students lived at motels
College Sophomore,1,"its very boring, the school only has about 300 students and only three buildings."

Freshman,5,"From my very first contact with the staff and faculty regarding enrollment at Ouachita Baptist University, I was struck at how welcome they instantly made me feel. It did not take much convincing for me to want to become a part of the OBU family as soon as possible. They have been nothing but helpful and kind throughout the whole process and I look forward to graduating from such a great school!"
Senior,5,"Online learning has become especially relevant recently due to COVID-19 disrupting normal college life across the world. Ouachita truy handled switching to online learning with grace and ease--the professors and staff were determined to make this transition not overwhelming for us as students, especially since they knew that many of us faced different things as we had to move back home. They were gracious and understanding when technology and the internet failed us, and offered support all of the time even though we were no longer meeting in person. 

As for before COVID-19, I took several online classes during normal semesters, and each of them were structured so well. They allowed for an ease of learning on my own time, which I was so thankful for during busy semesters. The lessons were challenging but not overwhelming to work on during my own time."
Senior,5,"Ouachita strives to give their students the best environment to learn in possible--they seek to make sure that you are growing in every aspect of your life: socially, academically, and spiritually. They foster a strong need for being in community and give you the oprrotunity to live and learn alongside incredible people. It is not the location or the place itself that make Ouachita so special, rather it is the people. The staff and professors seek to know you and serve you in the best way they can! They support you, encourage you, correct you, and help refine you into who God designed you to be--they are truly iron-sharpening. I am incredibly thankful to call Ouachita home."
Niche User,5,"I've been on a few tours, overall, it was an incredible place. Very Beautiful, full of life, and kind people who are willing to show other people around and give them the attention they need."
Senior,5,Ouachita successfully transformed the learning environment during this time! They listened closely to student concerns as they assist them to finish the semester. I love to be in a place like this!
Senior,5,I love OBU! I could not ask for a better place to spend my college years. Ouachita is a place where faculty cares deeply about student learning and development as they also challenge you academically. The campus is fantastic and safe. You will meet a great community of people who cares about you!
Freshman,5,Best place ever. To know Ouachita is to love ouachita! The community here is loving and welcoming. The professors are great. The way the invest in your faith is impecable. The campus is peaceful and so beautiful. So many opportunities to get involved
Niche User,5,"My experience with Ouachita Baptist was overall amazing , the family aspect and being a baptist institution made my time there great."
Niche User,5,"I love the community of OBU, as soon as I step onto the campus I am overwhelmed with joy. Multiple people come and make sure I feel welcome and am taken care of. Also, I see the president of the college almost every time and he always stops and talks to me."
Sophomore,5,Ouachita is a fantastic university!  I have really enjoyed every aspect of my experience there.  It has a great family-like atmosphere in a faith-based community
Sophomore,5,"I love Ouachita because of the close knit environment created by the students and faculty on campus. I love that I cannot go five minutes without seeing someone I know, and having the ability to get to know my professors in our small classes."
Sophomore,5,This university has honestly done so much for me in my development into a young adult and christ follower. The staff and the students are all so welcoming the education is incredible. Coming to Ouachita has probably been the greatest decision of my life.
Freshman,5,I love the small school community feel.  My professors are interested in my success in the classroom and in life.  There are lots of opportunities to be around people with the same goals and values.
Freshman,5,Ouachita is a great place to kickstart your career! Ouachita offers a variety of programs tailored to students needs all taught by professors who care about the students. The campus is located in a beautiful area of Arkansas.
Freshman,5,"Great school! The teachers have a special bond with each of their students and you make a lot of friends here on campus. Academics and student life here are great, the athletics are state-winning, and the campus is cozy and beautiful. Freshman dorms are a bit small but other than that it's a winner! Would definitely recommend!"
Freshman,5,Everyone is very kind and are always willing to help anyone. The classes are smaller so the professors can have more individual time with their students. The campus is beautiful and has lots of activity.
Niche User,5,Ouachita Baptist University not only has an amazing campus but the students and faculty there are so welcoming and understanding. They will do whatever it takes to make this university a home away from home.
Alum,5,"The faculty and staff at Ouachita are some of the most loving, genuine people you will meet! I loved my time at OBU and will be a frequent visitor as an alum. The professors push you to be the best person you can be, both in and out of the classroom. Highly highly recommend!"
Freshman,5,It is amazing how much you can learn when the teachers really care about their students. They take the time to explain things if you don't understand and that is why I think so many people are successful there.
Alum,5,I loved every moment of my time at OBU.  The professors were great and the classes were small so you could take advantage of 1 on 1 opportunities.
Freshman,5,The professors care deeply about each individual student and will do all they can to make sure that everyone succeeds and becomes the best adult they can be.
Senior,5,"Without a doubt, Ouachita is the best choice I could’ve made to further my education. Ouachita has one of the strongest science programs in the state and I am beyond grateful to have had the opportunity to learn from these professors and gain hands-on experience outside of class. The extracurriculars are awesome- club life, intramurals, and football games are a few of my favorite things!"
Senior,5,"Ouachita is a place where I have learned so much about myself and truly grown as student, leader, future employee, Christian and all around became a better person. Due to the positive learning environment and faculty and staff constantly pushing us and encouraging us it gave me the motivation to invest in myself, my school work & my community. I wish I could describe my Ouachita experience perfectly in words but there is simply not enough room or words to describe the impact this school has had on my life."
Junior,5,Overall the best college experience you can receive. You’ll never feel more at home at Ouachita. Facaulty and staff do an incredible job of keeping you in charge and treat you with respect. I love Ouachita
Alum,5,Ouachita was the perfect place for me to learn and grow in a Christian environment. I made lifelong friends and became friends with professors who at  any time throughout my career have helped connect me with people in my field to hire me or connect me to someone who would. I was given opportunities to develop leadership skills that have served me in every job since graduation. I enjoyed my experience so much that I returned to Ouachita to work and invest here.
Niche User,5,"I love Ouachita Baptist for many reasons. First, it is a small campus with a friendly and Christian atmosphere. Everyone at Ouachita knows each other. Another thing I love about Ouachita is that the teachers care for your wellbeing. The teachers are not hesitant to sit down with you and actually help you. This is due to having small classes, which are great for more one on one instruction. There is nothing I would change about Ouachita. I look forward to attending later this year."
Niche User,5,"It is a very nice school. It has great academics, great housing, an amazing environment and has amazing staff."
Sophomore,5,"Ouachita is a great small Christian University in Southern Arkansas. The academics are great and the administration, staff, and students all support one another."
Freshman,5,"I love Ouachita! The experiences I've had here are those that'll last a lifetime! If I had to advise anyone on which college to attend, Ouachita number one on the list!"
Freshman,5,"The classes are intensive, but they build the character needed for the work force. Great atmosphere, great teachers!"
Sophomore,5,"The campus is very nice and the professors are very helpful. Ouachita will insure that you feel safe and secure, and that you are welcome. The staff and students are friendly and outgoing. Although the campus is nice there is not much to do in the city."
Alum,5,I attended all 4 years 1995-1999. I lived in the dorms. The meal plans were good. The staff was very knowledgeable.  The facilities were nice. I highly recommend this school.
Freshman,5,"Ouachita Baptist University provides high-quality academic program and professors here are all nice. Students are nice and warm to you, and you can easily make friends here."
Freshman,5,everyone at Ouachita Baptist is very friendly and always ready to help. they believe in small class sizes.
Sophomore,5,"Ouachita is simply wonderful. After my freshman year, I hardly wanted to go home. I have found myself looking forward to the summer ending, so that I could go back to school. The students there are amazing, I have made some lifelong friends already. The professors are always looking for ways to help me and my peers succeed academically and in life. Ouachita is a school that prepares you for adult life and helps you to grow into the person you have always aspired to be."
Sophomore,5,"Ouachita is a great school academically. The professors care about their students and seek to foster relationships with them. Small class sizes mean you can get practical research and career-relevant experience while you are still in undergrad. The only downside to Ouachita would be its location. Arkadelphia is a nice little town, but there is not too much to do outside of campus life."
Junior,5,"It's a smaller school, but it has a wonderful sense of community. The professors are able to step in and help individual students, as opposed to being in an auditorium type setting like a big University. Even though it says it's a Baptist school, there are many people who make up the student body that have a different religious view or no religious views which makes the diversity of population and class discussions more intriguing. This also helps when preparing on working with others that have different lifestyles, morals, and views on different things, which will occur all the time out in the world."
Alum,5,This was the best experience for college that I could have ever asked for. All of the professors here are so incredible and truly care about their students. Classes are small (20-30) which was one of the things I loved most about this school. The campus is beautiful and the academics are top notch.
Freshman,5,"I love the intimacy of the staff and students! I love how the staff does not give up on the students, and they do not let the students give up. They WANT us to succeed and I love it!"
Freshman,5,"Everyone was so wonderful and the overall atmosphere was amazing,  I did  a tour and the counselors are really great. the campus and everyone that I saw were smiling, and everything there just seems so dreamlike."
Freshman,5,"OBU is a great place to grow as a person.  The faith-based education is top notch and my experience with the athletic program has been amazing.  I chose OBU because it allows me the opportunity to grow mentally, socially, athletically, and spiritually.  My interactions with the faculty and staff have been very positive and I feel everyone associated with OBU truly wants the students to be successful.  I highly recommend OBU as a destination for students looking for a second home.

Freshman,5,"Ouachita is a VERY friendly and welcoming for campus, filled with genuine people. I especially love the campus ministry programs, such as noonday and refuge"
Sophomore,5,"I have never been in a place like Ouachita Baptist University and I don't think I will ever find another place just like it. The school has literally so much to offer when it comes to its degrees, campus activities, student life, and its christian focus. At Ouachita you have professors that easy to talk to and work with. In ways, you can even grow life long friendships with the professors and of course the student body. Ouachita has lots of opportunities to get involved and to meet new people when it comes to Social Clubs, Worship Gatherings, Sport events, Social events, and two of the biggest events being Tiger Tunes and Tiger Traks. Ouachita has an amazing atmosphere for students that encourages them to be the best they can be and to conquer any obstacle thrown at at them."
Sophomore,5,Ouachita Baptist University has a lot of elements that make it great.  One is that it is a tight knit community.  I came from a large town and a large school.  However the smallness is one of my favorite things about this school.  I always can walk across campus and see several friendly faces.  The staff at OBU cares genuinely for the students.  Staff at OBU know you by name and know you personally.  Often they go out of their way to help you grow and succeed.  OBU offer many things for all students but two of my favorite things about my school is that it is friendly and helpful
College Freshman,5,"This college has done everything they can to help me afford it and as well given me a job on campus during school/summer as another big help! The campus is so pretty and the staff actually cares about you, it's not just a college that wants money; they are always helping students and the community around us. From band to volunteering there is a place for everyone here and I'm honored to go here!"
College Freshman,5,"There are so many options for a career after i leave Ouachita and while I am in currently in school. Alumni runs very strong in this school, they are constantly supporting and staying connected."
College Freshman,5,"There will always be hard teachers on campus but I have nothing wrong to say about a teacher, they are all great. I love this school, just show effort and they will too."
College Freshman,5,"obu has a great fan base and being apart in the athletic training program I am very involved. The players are kind and so are the coaches, they devote a lot of time to the sport but the coaches makes it very evident that the students put school first."
College Freshman,5,I transferred to OBU in the spring and could not be happier with my decision.
College Freshman,5,"Ouachita does not have sororities, we have social clubs. They are great ways to get involved with the community and enojoy the company of the people that are part of your social club."
College Freshman,5,I have loved every single moment spent at Ouachita.
College Sophomore,5,The school actively seeks out opportunity for the students. A large percentage of the students that graduate find fulfilling jobs soon after graduation. There are chances on campus to meet possible employers.
College Sophomore,5,"I am a member of the Greek life on campus and I really love the guys in my fraternity. We are relatively small, but we share a closeness that many others can claim. We take care of each other during our time here and even after graduation. Our alumni stay active and support the club and the current members stay in contact with the alumni and we help each other when the need arises."
College Sophomore,5,We are a small private Christian Univeristy. We are definitely a community that loves each other and all the opportunities that we have together on our campus. Our teachers genuinely care and professors that don't even have me in their classes know who I am.
College Freshman,5,"Greek life on campus is fun and very existent. The clubs do great things for the school, community, and gods work. All Greeks live on campus in regular housing. This eliminates parties and illegal activity from going on. It is an honor to be in a Greek club at my school."
College Freshman,5,Our facilities are great! We have a lot of school spirit and a lot of student support. My school has a lot of great and fun athletic traditions and caring and supportive coaches. Our athletes take pride in their sport and show a lot of heart and great sportsmanship
College Freshman,5,My school is a private Christian school. It is close knit and very supportive. The staff is helpful and friendly and will go out of their way to help you. There are a lot of on campus's activities and ministries for everyone's needs. I will recommend my school to everyone. I love ouachita baptist university
College Freshman,5,"I have really enjoyed Ouachita Baptist. I was very nervous and scared to move off to college, but Ouachita really has become my home. I enjoy that my teachers make me feel like my learning matters. Most of my teachers remind the class that it's not all about our GPA, but about what we are learning and retaining. I am on the school soccer team and that is a great experience. I absolutely love being a part of the team and getting to represent my school. Making new friends is always fun, and in Arkansas we have the opportunity to go adventure. There isn't a lot to do in our town so we get to come up with fun activities. Overall, I couldn't ask for more from my school. They definitely give back all that we put in."
College Freshman,5,You earn your Degree at OBU. Academics are outstanding.
College Freshman,5,OBU is a wonderful school!
Freshman,4,"I am attending classes this fall in person and have not taken their online classes. Any project we are required to complete online though, is nothing but thorough and detailed in description. The staff and teachers are very patient and kind and I've enjoyed meeting them and getting to know them."
Senior,4,"I've only taken one class online and it went well, even though it was in the midst of the pandemic. The professor had all necessary information available through Moodle in the form of links and self-created PowerPoints and other documents."
Senior,4,"Overall, my experience has been very nice! The professors truly care about their students and will often go out of their way to help in any way they can. I've met a wonderful group of people that I'm so happy to call my true friends. The only thing that I can think of to improve is the diversity on campus. It is a majority-white campus but the number of minority students has slightly increased in recent years."
Niche User,4,It was very easy to get the tours set up. They are very communicative and easy to talk to. Loved the whole experience!
Alum,4,"I had a lot of medical issues while I was there, so my opinion was pretty low when I graduated. I've since realized that it was pretty great, despite the two professors who gave me unnecessary hell over ""being too happy at work study,"" ""not being enthusiastic enough"" about making copies for them or ""laughing at my jokes during class."" (OK, it was really just one professor. I'd have completed a double major if not for him, actually.) But I really did feel like people had my back, even though I was kind of a loner and didn't participate in all the extracurricular stuff."
Senior,4,"My time at Ouachita Baptist has been a frustrating but rewarding one. The education I have received in music and theatre are high quality and my professors care deeply about my education and me as a person: I would not trade them for the world. However, the administration has failed me. The misconduct I have personally experienced and seen with friends when it came to housing accommodation, mental health needs, and varying levels of punishment for the same infractions are unacceptable. Additionally, many of the rules on campus are antiquated and demeaning, stunting young adults growth into responsibility in the real world. Those rules are held in place by the elderly donors who seem to run the school, based on religious virtue. I am thankful for my time and academic experiences at OBU, but I would never recommend to go there now after my four years of experience with the administration and campus life."
Senior,4,It’s a small campus with so much student life. The professors and students are all amazing. The campus is beautiful and everyone cares about each other here.
Freshman,4,"Ouachita Baptist University is in Arkadelphia, and the water tower in town says, ""A great place to call home."" Independent, small town America isn't for everyone, but I love it. OBU could handle the money better as far as returning funds which aren't used during the year to students, and security needs some work, but it is improving."
Freshman,4,Within Ouachita Baptist University there is a great community  that takes importance in getting to know you as an individual and not just a number on campus. Ouachita has many opportunities to get involved on campus. You feel at home while at Ouachita and it makes the college experience that much easier and memorable.
Freshman,4,"I love that Ouachita Baptist University is a Christ-centered university that focuses not on just a love of learning, but a love of Christ as well. The professors really care and love on the students here and will work with you to help you succeed and master your area of study. I love the fact that OBU feels like a big family who love you and will help guide you in this new chapter of life."
Junior,4,"OBU is a great school. The dorms are nice, the other students are friendly, the meals here are great and a meal plan is included in your tuition. Teachers are interested in your academic success. The class work is hard and the tuition is very expensive. I would highly recommend this school."
Junior,4,I have been at Ouachita for two years now. Throughout these years I have built lots of close friendships not only with students but with my professors as well. I am also a member of the swim team and have enjoyed every moment of it. It is great to have a small school where I know lots of people and can make great connections.
Freshman,4,I like how nice the people are at Campus and the faculty! I would like to see better dorms for the freshmens their first year at ouachita in a bigger space.
Junior,4,The right fit for me. I love the small school atmosphere where the professors know you by name and genuinely care if you succeed.  The down side is Arkadelphia is also a small town so there is not much to do for entertainment.
Sophomore,4,"I love the community that is developed on campus. It is small enough that you constantly see people you know but also big enough to meet someone new every day. Not only is the student community great, the relationship between teachers and students is great as well. The teachers really take the time to get to know you and are always available if you need help or simply want to talk."
Junior,4,"Ouachita is the best college ever! It is a great school academically, great sports programs, and everyone know and cares about one another. It is like a family, it really is a home away from home. It is located in a small town but the campus itself gives you a lot of opportunities to get out and do stuff! It is also located next to a lake and in the natural state of Arkansas so there is a lot of great things to do outside! Your professors really care about you and they know everyone by name and will do everything possible to watch you succeed. The people here really genuinely care about you, you get a great liberal arts christian education here."
Niche User,4,Beautiful campus with a ton of school spirit! Ouachita will help you grow in your faith and you will leave a better person! 
College Freshman,4,The greek life here is important because one thing that OBU is known for is Tiger Tunes where all social groups on campus to do a talent show for students and anyone in the community. The are super fun to watch as well as be in!
College Freshman,4,"I know we don't have the best football team coming from a school who is state champ 5 years in a row but they do give other teams a run for their money! There are so many option for intramural sports, like water tube polo!"
College Junior,4,I have heard it is great.
College Junior,4,"Overall, I have had a great experience with the educational aspect of this school.  However, I can't say the same when it comes to encounters with staff members."
College Junior,4,I have never not felt safe on campus.
College Junior,4,I really love my school!  The town is small but it allows you to get to know the people in the town.  The campus is beautiful and if you put yourself out there and get involved it becomes an even better experience.
College Student,4,OBU has something called Tiger Clubs instead of Greek Life. They are very inclusive and help out around campus a lot. I think it is even better than Greek Life.
College Student,4,My school is so encouraging. The teachers are like friends and they want to see you succeed in anything you are passionate about. I feel like OBU is my home away from home. There are so many activities to get involved in and so much going on. We have Tiger Tunes which is a huge blast going to watch. Hopefully someday I will get to participate! Overall I have absolutely loved my time at Ouachita and would do it all over again.
College Freshman,4,"we have saftey on campus and at times they over ticket people they are not very fair or nice people, but I do feel safe. Administration is always kind and has our best interest at heart."
College Freshman,4,"Its great once you leave Frances Crawford. Freshman year is the hardest but the upperclassman options are much better, but the cost is high for how small everything is. Getting an apartment is almost impossible."
College Freshman,4,"At obu we do not affiliate with Greek life but have social clubs, they are more based around friendship and careing for our community, no crazy parties or houses."
College Freshman,4,"Frances Crawford may not be the best building to live freshman year, but the people you live with make it worth it.

Georgia is really pretty, and so is Gosser."
College Freshman,4,"I did not know much of sports, but ever since I came here I've learned to enjoy sports."
College Sophomore,4,The class size is great because the professors can give each individual student the time and attention they need to succeed. There are only around 1500 students that attend the school regularly. I believe that this helps to build a strong community on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Ouachita's sports programs excel in almost every sport. Each year at least one of the sports teams make it to the playoffs tournaments. Most students go to every football game and many go to the basketball games. Sadly, the students don't show the same support for the less popular sports on campus such as tennis and soccer."
College Sophomore,4,"Ouachita Baptist University is a great place to start to come into your own. The variety of people here is outstanding. There are many opportunities to get involved on campus, either through social clubs, which are the University's form of fraternities and sororities, as well as in campus ministries or campus activities. Each semester the school has a day where the students give back to the community by doing yard work for the elderly and sick, or cleaning a public area of trash. The professors are very intelligent and do their best to impart their knowledge to their students."
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe and we have health services with an actual family physician and nurse on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Our alumni network is insane and we can meet someone just about anywhere that has connections to our school.
College Sophomore,4,Like I mentioned earlier professors are great and they really care about our success and us as a person not just a student/number
College Sophomore,4,I love living on campus
College Sophomore,4,We don't have nationally recognized sororities and fraternities. Our clubs are unique only to our campus and we love them.
College Sophomore,4,We enjoy cheering on our tigers no matter what.
College Sophomore,4,"its not bad, I like the way the dorm go from really bad to good"
College Sophomore,4,"My past two years here have been good. I play for the women's soccer team, and actually that is the true reason why I decided to choose this school. I am a big fan of a small college that way I can get to know my teachers better and it makes getting help from then easier. If I could change the past and choose a different school, I don't think I would."
College Freshman,4,"The academics at Ouachita is great because every part of the environment makes the students feel like their education matters. So far, I feel like my classes are very helpful and will further my future success. The workload is crazy, especially being in soccer too, but it is doable. Learning to time manage is very important. Many kids are in the kinesiology or education departments, along with the theatre department. We also have many study rooms available all the time, and the library is great."
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus. I hardy ever hear about campus crime and if I do it seems to be taken care of. Our security guards are always walking around. I don't hear anything about sexual assault or anything like that so I assume that is a good thing. Overall I feel that our campus has great security.
College Freshman,4,"The courses I have taken have been really great. They were not easy or too hard. You definitely had to work for your grade. I enjoyed learning how to study properly and work for my grades. All of my professors love their jobs and want us to enjoy learning. Class sizes are very small, so we get to have good relationships with our professors."
College Freshman,4,"There are many opportunities for internships. I haven't partaken in them because I am only about to start my second semester. The alumni network is huge, and it is a very big deal. We have weeks dedicated to our alumni and our donors. The career center is very helpful from what I have heard. Again, I haven't gotten that far in my major to start looking into that."
College Freshman,4,"We don't have sororities or fraternities, we have social clubs. They are more or less the same thing. I am rushing next semester, and I am very excited. Greek life isn't a huge deal, it's just another opportunity to get involved in something. As far as I know, there is no big conflicts between Greeks and non-Greeks. We also do not have Greek housing, given that we have social clubs. Our clubs mostly get together and throw parties and often do community service events."
College Freshman,4,"I am on the women's soccer team. We have wonderful facilities. Our field house is brand new, and it has everything the team could ever need. Most of the teams on campus, and far as I know, are provided about the same as the soccer team. Many of my friends are part of intermural team, and these are very big on campus. I really enjoy getting to watch all my friends participate in all different sports. There are definitely opportunities for all students to get active and be a part of a team. Our school is also full of school spirit. Everyone goes to games, varsity or intermural, and it makes for a very great environment."
College Freshman,4,"The professors on the School of Science are amazing.  I have had poor experiences with my professors in other classes.  One of my professors does not use our online grade site to put in grades.  He just puts in a final grade.  I checked my final grade and it said I had a B.  I believed that was incorrect and went to talk to him.  He assured me he was not wrong when I asked him to check.  After begging him to double check,  he noticed he entered in my final exam grade wrong which brought down my score dramatically.  If he would use the online grading system this would have easily been avoided."
College Freshman,4,"I have not yet to join a ""Greed life"" at Ouachita.  Ouachita's Greek life isn't normal.  They have social clubs not fraternities or sororities.  There are no Greek housing.  All event for our social clubs are school regulated.  The clubs are not allowed to do anything the school does not approve of.  The biggest event for our social clubs is Tiger Tunes."
College Freshman,4,There are a couple of older dorms I didn't like.
College Freshman,4,School spirit is very positive.
College Junior,4,"It's a new school, a new program currently in New Life Church."
College Sophomore,4,Chicken express is the best
College Sophomore,4,There are a good amount of different restaurants around town. There are the normal chain fast food places but you can also find a good amount of small Mexican or other restaurants around town.
College Sophomore,4,The financial aid people were very helpful in helping me receive my financial aid. I felt like they were very knowledgable as were easy to work with.
College Sophomore,4,I love Ouachita. Housing is old but it is not run down. Living in a. Dorm has given me opportunities to get to know people I would not have otherwise. The process for choosing dorm and rooms inside the dorm is a fair and easy process by hours. The housing department does a good job in organization and doing everything in a timely manner. All the dorms are relatively close to the classrooms and everything is very close together but not crowded. Overall for living in a dorm I know there could be much worse options and I've loved living in the dorms.
College Freshman,4,I don't know anyone who lives off campus. You have to be 22 or married to live off campus.
College Freshman,4,"It's what you would expect from a small city, since Arkadelphia is a small town."
College Freshman,4,"I wouldn't know, but some of my friends party, and they seem to have fun."
College Freshman,4,"The caf is close to your classes, has variety"
Sophomore,2,I currently attend Ouachita Baptist University but I am transferring to another school that is a better fit for me. I feel that there are some good things about it but to me the people seem fake and over bearing. I just feel that OBU isn't the place for me and I am ready for a new start at my new school in the fall.
College Freshman,2,"There is no crime on campus; however even if there were our security guards are very old and probably not suitable for protecting students.  They are good at giving parking tickets,"
College Junior,2,We do not have much around Arkadelphia but there is always Little Rock and Hot Springs.
College Junior,2,I do not like campus safety
College Sophomore,2,"It is very secretive. Drinking is not allowed at the university and you could get in trouble for doing so.  Because of this people go to Little Rock, Hot Springs, or super sketchy parties held by one of the local fraternities of either OBU or Henderson State University."
College Sophomore,2,The Nightlife at Ouachita is not really prevalent mostly because our school does a good job at keeping alcohol and other drugs off campus; although with that it is fairly simple to go to Henderson State University across the street and go to parties there or to go to an apartment complex.
College Freshman,2,"Arkadelphia is a very small college town with two universities and, not much to do off of campus. We aren't very far from other cities with things to do."
College Freshman,2,There is a huge racial barrier at school when it comes to students having fun with one another but with professors its a bit easy.
College Freshman,2,It rains quite often on campus. Due to the excessive rain at times it floods quite a bit.
Recent Alumnus,2,There is no public transportation in Arkadelphia. You need a car to go anywhere.
College Freshman,2,Old Man Town – Arkadelphia has absolutely nothing to do. If anyone wants to do something outside of Ouachita they pretty much have to drive at least 30 min to nearest movie theater.
Recent Alumnus,2,Parking at OBU is average at best.  Security is strict on writing tickets for students without proper authorization to a specific lot.  Availability during the day is always very average.  The only 100% guaranteed parking is behind one of the dorms on the far side of campus which can be a hassle if you are visiting or need to get to class in a hurry.
College Sophomore,2,There never seems to be enough parking for freshman at Ouachita. The spots closest to the buildings always seem to be taken. Upperclassman and faculty get the spots close to everything. The parking lots seem to be a little unsafe too. Tickets are given out very regularly to parking violators.
College Freshman,1,"There are no attractions, no activities, and no shopping.  The safety sucks off campus.  There are sports but they're okay. And most locals don't like OBU because it is a private college that is really expensive and there is a state college literally right across the street that costs a lot less to go to."
College Freshman,1,There is not many places to eat. The cost is about average everywhere. There are not student discounts and not many varieties. 
College Freshman,1,I don't think that there are any unique things that set my school apart from others.
College Freshman,1,"Ouachita does not at all support the ""Nightlife"" on campus."
College Sophomore,1,Parking is really hard to find and very restricted

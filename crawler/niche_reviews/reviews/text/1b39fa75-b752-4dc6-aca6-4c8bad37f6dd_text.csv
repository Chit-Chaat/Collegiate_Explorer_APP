Junior,5,"I have nothing but great things to say upon reflecting on my time at Lafayette College. As a junior attending Lafayette College amidst the Covid 19 pandemic, I have had far from the typical college experience. However,  the sense of community that Lafayette has provided me has been imperative in my success and mental health during these times. As a member of greek life I belong to many communities within the Lafayette family, each of which has provided me a unique sense of belonging and courage. Attending a small liberal arts school provides a student with special opportunities that larger institutions would never be able to. Creating connections with professors, other students and classmates, and even workers in the dining halls and bookstores are a few of the perks of being a pard. I applied to Lafayette College early and would highly recommend anyone considering to do the same. I have never felt so involved within my community as I do as a student at Lafayette!"
Freshman,5,"I love my experience at Lafayette so far. I am surrounded by like-minded, driven students who are all passionate about learning and fearless in their desire to change the world. My professors have all been extremely knowledgeable, supportive, and willing to help every student, and care about each of us individually."
Sophomore,5,"I love everything. As someone who has always been in small school environments, Lafayette has been the perfect balance. I was able to get involved in anything I wanted to get involved with (greek life, theater, clubs, etc.) while also getting an amazing eduction and overall great college experience."
Alum,5,Great school. Gave me a great education and helped set me up for my career now. Incredibly welcoming community that also is a lot of fun. Students are dedicated to academics but also have a good time. Honestly a wonderful balanced education.
Freshman,5,"I am loving my time at Lafayette! From the amazing professors to the beautiful campus, this college checks off all of the boxes. I have made some of my best friends here, and can not wait to get back on campus. If you are looking for a school that has the perfect mix of academics and fun, Laf is the place for you!!"
Sophomore,5,"It is the best school anyone could possibly go to. It has anything you want for an undergraduate school. There is a ton of school spirit, more than enough ways to get involved, and most importantly, the students and faculty are some of the most amazing, dedicated people there could possibly be."
Junior,5,The campus is stunning and all the professors and students are so genuine. The students are driven and the professors really want to assist. The food is really good as well.
Alum,5,"This school is far better than the admissions statistics would suggest.  The endowment, campus, resources, professors and alumni success rival the best of the Patriot League and the New England Liberal Arts colleges.  This school has it all from humanities, to engineering and the undergraduate offerings in economics and business.  Maybe the fact that the students here tend towards the pre-professional and seem less inclined towards academia reduces the allure to those interested in an academic career.  Still, Lafayette is a rigorous school full of ambitious and talented students with amazing resources at the disposal and with proximity to the best labor market in the country, Philly, NYC, DC.  Few colleges can offer what Lafayette does, and that is no exaggeration."
Freshman,5,"Lafayette is the perfect school for anyone who wants the small college experience. There are so many opportunities on campus, from study abroad to sports to tutoring to help in job searching. Campus is beautiful and safe."
Niche User,5,"As a dual-enrollment student, I felt very welcomed on campus. My class was an amazing experience and taught me how to manage my time for college next year, when I will be full-time."
Niche User,5,"I would highly recommend Lafayette College. The small town feel is so cute and quaint. The town and campus feels very safe. 
The administration is so helpful. The small class sizes combined with the wide range of courses contribute to the top notch education provided by Lafayette College. Further, this school has so many connections and has many internship opportunities. The financial aid department 100% met my needs."
Sophomore,5,"I chose Lafayette because I am interesting in engineering and physics as well as art, music, etc. Most people here are very well-rounded. I love the professors in the engineering and physics departments. Nothing's perfect, of course. Some professors are better than others, but who you get is kind of up to you. If you check professor evaluations from previous semesters and maybe sites like ratemyprofessor.com, you'll be fine. Lafayette's sitting on a lot of money, especially considering its size, so every student gets incredible access to good food, interesting public lectures, expensive technology and equipment, and so on. There are a lot of very wealthy students here, but I've met so many good, down-to-earth people regardless. There are lots of international students here and many students go abroad at some point, which is pretty cool."
Sophomore,5,"What I like about Lafayette is that the college is extremely inclusive of all student, regardless of their backgrounds. They give everyone and honest opportunity to be a part of the school and the campus."
Freshman,5,"I applied early decision here- and I am so happy that I'm here. I love everything about it- the people, the classes, the campus, ect. I don't play a sport, but am trying to get involved in the many clubs they offer. This place is truly a hidden ivy, and is one of the best decisions I've ever made. Just like anything, it's what you make of it."
Senior,5,Lafayette College left me with the best alumni network and internship opportunities ever. If you actually work hard here you will succeed and you will have an incredible career. Easton is getting better and this part of Pennsylvania is an amazing place to spend 4 years. If I could I would do it all over again.
Alum,5,"I attended Lafayette in the 70’s in the second class of women.  With a beautiful campus, and  strong academics, particularly in math and science, I helped establish this great little school as a co-ed institution.  Like most colleges, you get out what you put in, but the atmosphere encouraged the students with fine professors, a marvelous new library, and challenging fellow classmates. 
The social/fraternity life was unmatched. Great fun...yet a bit formal still with ties and jackets at all football home games.  So they looked like gentlemen and behaved that way often too..  
Nice classmates, great education and phenomenal preparation for moving on to bigger challenges."
Alum,5,"I wondered how Lafayette is rated now as compared to 45 years ago.
Then, it was ""Highly Competitive""
The Graduation rate was around 65% due to the competitiveness. We were told at orientation, ""Look at the person on your right. Now, look at the person on your left. One of you will not be here 4 years from now.""
And yet, with 19 Fraternities on campus, it was an A+ Party school."
Alum,5,Great education. I attended Ivy grad school and it’s clear to me that Lafayette provides a small and academically challenging experience that prepared me better than any large school could have for professional school and my career.
Niche User,5,The Lafayette Community is empathetic and reinforces the endeavors of all of its members. The college has plenty of activities on campus to join with and the resources for undergraduates to understand their success in the future. (Based on my visit)
Freshman,5,I am a freshman at Lafayette and it is so much fun I have made such amazing friends and i am so glad i went here!
Alum,5,"Lafayette is the best decision I ever made. The professors are incredible. The friendships I fostered there with fellow students, and with professors and staff will last for a lifetime. If you take initiative you can do absolutely anything. You will learn so much more than what you learn in the classroom (which is plenty!), you will learn how to care about other people. You will grow in ways you can't even comprehend. And, if you're at all like me, you will find it impossible to say goodbye when you graduate, and counting down the days until you can visit again."
Sophomore,5,"Lafayette is amazing. Beautiful campus, mostly great professors, social scene is great for sophomores and up, dorms are nice."
Freshman,5,"If you get good grades in a marketable major, you will be making large amounts of money - Lafayette grads are regularly hired by prestigious companies like Google, Goldman Sachs, Deloitte, Bloomberg, and Amazon."
Senior,5,"Lafayette College is a small community with a small town atmosphere. The Easton community is involved with the students, and enjoys the students. Professors are hands-on and work closely with the students to help everyone succeed."
Niche User,5,The Lafayette campus is really beautiful and I loved it as soon as I saw it. Everyone is really nice and welcoming and the professors are so easy to contact.
Freshman,5,"The environment created by the space, professors, resources, and much more allows students to find a place to feel comfortable and welcomed."
Freshman,5,Lafayette has a small secure campus and provides a rich liberal arts education. The course selection provides for a wealth of choices. Traditional course selection is highly valued. Food services is awesome and campus housing is fun.
Freshman,5,"Love this college. Wide variety of activities, terrific classes, friendly people - who could complain?"
College Freshman,5,"With Lafayette being a liberal arts college, you get what you pay for."
College Freshman,5,I love the college and everything about it.
College Freshman,5,Any time I have reached out to anyone in Lafayette they are always timely and kind in their responses. They offer real help.
College Freshman,5,The parties here are fun and don't place massive pressure on the student community
College Freshman,5,Parties are pretty frequent and happening in a lot of places
College Freshman,5,"Lafayette gives you the opportunity to have one-on-one time with professors on the forefront of their disciplines and to develop strong working relationships with them. With a shared research credit on your résumé, you will go far - and will have Lafayette to thank for that."
College Freshman,5,Lafayette is only getting more diverse with each year
College Freshman,5,"It's there, but the students are smart about using it"
College Freshman,5,I wouldn't trade Lafayette for anything in this world.
College Freshman,5,"If you get good grades in a marketable major, you will be making large amounts of money - Lafayette grads are regularly hired by prestigious companies like Google, Goldman Sachs, Deloitte, Bloomberg, and Amazon."
College Freshman,5,Lafayette has a strong infrastructure in place to make sure the students feel safe.
College Freshman,5,The housing is amazing - it truly does terrific work in building a community of students.
College Freshman,5,The parties are amazing and Greek students contribute a large amount to the quality of student life and to charity.
College Freshman,5,"The sports teams don't typically do well, but they are the cornerstone of Lafayette spirit."
College Freshman,5,"Lafayette is amazing. Small enough to get personalized attention from your professors, big enough to have a vibrant social scene and plenty of research opportunities. Additionally, Lafayette students strike the perfect balance of socially active and academically devoted. Wouldn't have done anything differently."
College Junior,5,My classes are never large and my professors are ALWAYS acessible.
College Student,5,Always something fun to do
College Student,5,It's quite safe on the hill
College Student,5,this school is the best ever. academic heaven
College Student,5,You will be making stacks with the right degree from Lafayette
College Student,5,Best school ever - no doubt in my mind
College Freshman,5,Campus security officers do a good job in protecting us and keeping us informed of anything odd that occurs.
College Freshman,5,The alumni are really helpful and are easy to reach. The career services are among the best in the nation.
College Freshman,5,Professor actually know you by name and are very approachable. Classes are small and offer an active learning experience.
College Freshman,5,My room is a bit smaller compared to my friends who go here but it is still bigger than many of my friends at other colleges.
College Freshman,5,"There is a wide variety of people who are interesting and fun. Everyone is friendly, intellectual, and fun to talk to. The academic aspect is great with top tier professors and equipment."
College Freshman,5,Lafayette is a great place to learn.
College Freshman,5,"So far, I love my professors, courses, and the environment I am in.  Lafayette really fosters the growth of its students.  I feel blessed to be a Lafayette student."
College Freshman,5,"The career services program and Lafayette is one of the best in the country.  Alumni come back to Lafayette and ""stay in the loop"" because of the great experiences they had."
College Freshman,5,"I love Lafayette.  When I was looking at the school, people would advertise how great the professors are and how much they want to help you.  I really have experienced this so far as my professors make time to meet me and go out of their way to give me unique opportunities (and I'm just a first year!)"
College Sophomore,5,Fantastic sized rooms in a great housing scenario
College Sophomore,5,The frats have incredible housing opportunities
Junior,4,"Online learning is not something that any student or professor expects or even looks forward to. Although I'm sure the majority of the students and faculty are looking forward to returning to classrooms and labs, the flexibility and cooperation of the Lafayette Community as a whole has led to the success of online classes thus far. Entering the fall beginning online classes, professors made changes to their syllabuses from the past to ensure that they were providing students ample time to perform to the best of their abilities in a very different academic setting. As a student, if you are ever struggling with an assignment due to online learning, or are having trouble meeting a deadline due to unforeseen circumstances, professors are always extremely understanding and accommodating. While all of my classes are on zoom, the professors are actively engaged and passionate to ensure that the same quality of education is given over a screen."
Alum,4,Great professors. Classes tend to be overviews of larger subjects rather than deep dives into specific theories or schools of thought. I developed a severe drinking problem due to campus life my freshman year that I still struggle with until this day. Avoid living in the dorms.
Junior,4,It's a very organized and focused learning experience online. Provides me the opportunity to learn on my own.
Junior,4,I liked the class sizes and focused learning experience that gave me the opportunity to cultivate my love for my major and further my understanding of myself as a learner.
Junior,4,"Overall a good college to attend, especially if you're an engineering major. If not, you'll still receive a good education, but may have to fight/search harder for resources available to you."
Freshman,4,"Though the adjustment to online learning was tough for all parties involved, my professors were dedicated to making the transition as smooth as possible. Many of my classes still held weekly meetings, and all of my teachers held office hours at the same time they did on campus."
Sophomore,4,"My online learning experience was definitely different than a normal in-class experience, but my professors did everything they could to normalize the situation and be as receptive as possible to individual needs."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at Lafayette because I met amazing friends, colleagues and professors. The campus is stunning too!"
Sophomore,4,The Lafayette Community is compassionate and supports the endeavors of all of its members. The institution has plenty of organizations on campus to get involved with and the resources for undergraduates to realize their future success.
Freshman,4,Lafayette is a very welcoming community with a lot of great opportunities to offer. Everyone has each others' backs and everyone is there to support their peers and take care of them when they need it. The nearby town is fun to stop by and it is a great location.
Sophomore,4,"Lafayette has a beautiful campus, friendly atmosphere, and small class sizes. The courses are rigorous and the professors are tough but fair. My only complaint is that some of the residence halls are outdated and could use some renovation. Also very expensive, but they are pretty good about giving out scholarships to those who need them."
Freshman,4,"Though I have not spent very much time at Lafayette, I am already very excited to be spending my next four years here. The opportunities that I have available to me are plenty and bountiful, and the duality of engineering and liberal arts is both unique and effective. I've found my time so far on the Hill to be both rewarding and enjoyable."
College Freshman,4,We are all required to take online classes to prepare for safety and health.
College Freshman,4,The dorms are very neat and well kept.
College Freshman,4,The facilities and teams reflect that we are a division 1 athletic school.
College Sophomore,4,"My experience thus far has been filled with great, approachable professors, involved students, and a great learning environment."
College Junior,4,"Security is always around on campus 24/7. Plus, we're on a hill so not many people from Easton interact with us."
College Junior,4,"If you like quiet: Rubin, Watson, Fishers. All the wild kids live in Ruef and South"
College Junior,4,I love Lafayette. There is so much to get involved in and so many opportunities to do research with professors in topics that you love. I would apply to Lafayette all over again. My only regret is not picking my major sooner. When you pick a major that is heavily science or math based you are restricted in the amount o other courses you can take.
College Freshman,4,"The school has really worked hard in the previous years to bring more diversity onto campus. For example, this year has seen the biggest number of international students ever."
College Freshman,4,We have a great good Samaritan policy which encourages people to be safe and responsible.
College Freshman,4,We have a good team but most varsity team members are close and tend to form cliques since they spend most time with their teammates. That doesn't mean that they are any less friendly or open to making new friends.
College Freshman,4,"Overall, I feel safe on campus.  However, I feel like there needs to be more services in place to protect the integrity of those who are victims of sexual assault."
College Freshman,4,Greek life does not take over the social scene at Lafayette.  The Greek life hosts a lot of charity and inclusive events.
College Junior,4,School spirit is not the best.
College Junior,4,I feel like this school is giving me a great experience.
College Freshman,4,I live in one of the worst halls on campus and I love it because I have a walk in closet and a ton of space.
College Freshman,4,"The Good Samaritan policy really changes the atmosphere towards alcohol. It's great that people feel comfortable reporting problems with alcohol poisoning, but it almost makes binge drinking acceptable."
College Freshman,4,"On campus, the safety is wonderful. I feel comfortable walking around campus at night and alone. Once you get into downtown Easton, the surrounding city, it can get a little more sketchy. Public safety and the Easton PD are very vigilant, though."
College Freshman,4,"Some dorms are obviously better than others. For freshman, it really is the luck of the draw."
College Freshman,4,Greek life is available to those who want to be involved in it. It's a small school so the Greek life will never be as large as it is at state schools. You can still party and not be in a sorority/fraternity.
College Freshman,4,I use the gym every week and love the quality. The fields are beautiful and I like watching an occasional football or basketball game. We have on of the longest standing rivalries in the nation and rivalry week is like none other! Faculty and students alike really come together in support of the football team particularly on that weekend.
College Sophomore,4,"Most parties are off campus, occasionally fraternities will have parties in their on campus houses. Most parties are at sports houses off campus and fraternity houses off campus. Freshman girls can get into anything, second semester freshmen boys have it way better than girls (rush begins, they have the opportunity to go out every night). After parties usually people go to Milo's or Campus. Thursday nights are drinky's nights. Before big events (homecoming, laf lehigh), people go to Riverside. Saturday nights are really big. For freshmen social life is usually 3 nights a week at most, but once you join a frat/ sorority, you will go out almost every night. Social life as a sophomore and above depends on the sports team your apart of or the sorority/ fraternity you are in."
College Freshman,4,Safety was stress at orientation and has been reinforced over and over thus far.
College Freshman,4,Dorm life is great particularly for freshman getting established. Overall the RAs are very good and willing to help people .
College Freshman,4,"Sports are blended into academic seamlessly, and varsity athletes are not  treated much different than anyone else. sBy far the biggest sports event of the year is the final game of the football season against Lehigh."
College Sophomore,4,"It is a quiet and safe campus. The only problem is the sexual assault, but if you stay away from the loud party and keep clam. It is not a big problem."
College Sophomore,4,I am a sophomore and got two externships this winter through career center.
College Sophomore,4,Baseball game is very popular.
College Freshman,4,The housing is better than most college housing.
College Senior,4,"Matt Musci who is the Men's Lacrosse Coach tends to creep on students, I wouldn't go as far as saying he's hitting on students, more of a ""stop looking at me that way"" kind of creepy.  I've experienced it and so has a few of my friends."
College Sophomore,4,"There is nothing like the Lafayette/Lehigh Rivalry weekend. It's one of the most fun days of the year. Team performance may vary since we are a very small Division I school but, more and more sports teams have been receiving scholarships so better athletes can now be recruited. The future looks very promising. Our school has a great fan sections and school spirit is very prominent during big games. Football games and basketball games are a lot of fun."
College Sophomore,4,I really like the options that we have because there is a lot of variety. Mojo Hill was added this year and I love their smoothies! Sette Luna is a great Italian spot in the circle that pretty reasonably priced.
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoy the food actually. Upper and Marquis rarely ever disappoint me. Gilbert's has great food but took a bunch off of our meal plan (so we have to pay cash or flex) and that was such a bummer.
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the dorms are pretty new. I would say that the worst dorms are McKeen and Watson, but they're also the oldest. I know some people may be hesitant to get a new roommate but I would totally live with someone freshmen year because it really helps with gaining new friends."
College Senior,4,To go out a decent amount you have to be involved in greek life or sports.
College Senior,4,Ive never had any issues. They seem to dislike greek life but overall just want to help the students
College Senior,4,Most dorms are nice. South is one of the nicest and great for people who want to go out. Currently living in soroity building which is lots of fun
College Sophomore,4,"Plenty of delicious choices. If you're willing to make the trip to Downtown Bethlehem, you can find so many delicious and cool dining options."
College Freshman,4,"It's a small school, so there aren't as many options as schools with 20,000+ undergrads, but I think for its size it definitely has a ton to offer and each student will receive and excellent and worthy education in the process."
College Freshman,4,"Easton is no NYC, but it's a nice college town. Definitely has gotten a lot better over the last few years. People are always down about Easton, but honestly, I think it's a very cute town. There are a lot of restaurants and cool stores in town."
College Freshman,4,Campus housing is very nice compared to a lot of other schools. Lafayette has beautiful facilities.
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of merit scholarships offered at Lafayette. I didn't apply for financial aid, but I do know that 98% of Lafayette students receive 100% of the need they require."
College Freshman,4,"Lehigh/Lafayette day is not to be missed. Personally, I think it's the greatest college rivalry out there. Sports in general are a big part of campus because Lafayette is a division 1 school. It makes for fun events and more passionate fans."
College Freshman,4,"Personally, I plan to join greek life next year; however, I do know many people think it's overly cliquey and the administration is trying to tear it down."
College Freshman,4,High quality academics and passionate students make for a good learning environment
College Freshman,4,"Beautiful women everywhere, i've met some very interesting people as well"
College Freshman,4,"I really like Easton, up and coming city with some pretty decent food and a great farmers market, the view of the rivers is great"
College Freshman,4,"Good RAs, care more about your safety than about getting you in trouble"
College Freshman,4,"Great mexican place called Mesa down in Easton, definitely recommend if you're in the area"
Junior,2,"I very much so regret going to this school. Everyday I wonder why I didn’t take my opportunity to transfer to another school. While the engineering department is very good and I’ve had some good opportunities to do research, the people at Lafayette are all rich and snobby. Many people are extremely cliquey and it’s hard to find a friend group if you’re not a d1 athlete or in Greek life. I didn’t rush my sophomore year but after having one of the worst semesters of my life (all of my friends are in Greek life so I was very lonely) I decided to rush my junior year. I ended up getting dropped by nearly every sorority which just made me hate this school even more. Overall I cannot wait to graduate as I hate every second i’m at that school. So please, do not come here if you want to meet down to earth and chill people, because you will not find that here. I recommend strongly thinking about wether or not you want to be in Greek life, as it is a huge part of the school."
Sophomore,2,"Amazing academics and professors. The social life, however, is terrible, depressing, and boring. There are never on campus events so weekends are terribly boring (Easton is not much of a town). I made some good friends here, but all of us hate it here. The only way to have any kid of social life here is to join Greek Life or be on a sports team, if you're not interested in either, you're in for a loooooong four years."
Alum,2,"Professors are high quality but the entire social scene revolves around Greek life (drinking until blacking out) and athletics are sub-par for a D1 school. The school is lowly ranked in the Patriot League, and as an athletic recruit on a scholarship, I was shocked at the low school spirit (no turn out at games) and lack of support. The town is also depressing and offers very little in terms of culture, restaurants, the arts, etc. I am grateful for the quality of the academics and made some lifelong friends, but other than that, not a great experience."
College Freshman,2,"Parties on campus are almost nonexistent. Most are off campus. After party, most people migrate to bars/clubs. Some are easy to get in if underage depending on the night. If you want to go out on a week night, tough luck."
College Freshman,2,"The teacher you get dictates the grade you get. It's unfortunate, but true. The amount of work you put in hardly reflects on your grade if you have a poor teacher. There are good teachers, but not enough for the price a student pays to go here."
College Freshman,2,"This semester, I had two good teacher who effectively made the class challenging, but manageable if you payed attention, used your resources, did the homework and studied the notes. Two of my teachers were the epitome of ""if you can't do, teach"". Both gave notes/ lectures that had little to do with what the material was on the exams. Every exam, students would see a new surprise that wasn't explained in notes, lectures, or the textbooks. No curves were given as ""grades with a mean of a 70% means the test was fair"". The amount of work you put into those two classes had no reflection on your grade whatsoever."
College Sophomore,2,"Okay so there is never any peanut butter and that really pisses me off. Plus the food choices are so inconsistent. I really wish they offered the roasted veggie wrap every day because it's seriously delicious. The bagels are stale and the Kind bars are expired, which also pisses me off because I pay mad dollars to go to this school and I deserve gourmet food."
College Sophomore,2,"Dorms aren't the cleanest, especially after big event weekends. They can get really loud too, which is annoying for those who wish to study in their room instead of at the library. In my personal experience, the RA really didn't enforce the rules at all. In fact, it was her and her friends that caused a lot of the disturbances."
College Freshman,2,"Minimal security in dorm buildings, health center is largely useless"
College Sophomore,2,There is not much diversity on campus. Everyone pretty much comes from the same economic background.
College Sophomore,2,The school is currently very strict about alcohol use. The student body runs into many issues with administration about activities on campus and greek life organizations. Lafayette College just got a new president who seems to be understanding so hopefully we will see new changes.
College Freshman,2,"Only thing good is the academics. No social life unless you want to go Greek, and even then it is an extremely tame Greek scene."
College Freshman,2,"Greeks dominate the social scene, they get the houses."
College Freshman,2,"All i'm here for is the college, and then im gone ;)"
College Freshman,2,Transportation isn't great to be honest but students don't really have a need to go off campus too often
College Freshman,2,"Public Safety, though helpful, are there to break up the fun here. The alcohol policy is strict and they mostly catch people for noise violations. They patrol dorms on weekends so though people still party it is a risk if it is in your room"
College Freshman,2,Most people here are either white or an international student
College Junior,2,"With new construction, the goal is to remove all need for driving at Lafayette."
College Sophomore,2,"The majority of people come from the same tri-state area and are from the same class. Even though Lafayette claims to have people from all over the country and world, those people are few and far between."
College Junior,2,"Although the Greek houses are great and try to be involved with campus life, the administration has made it its job to eliminate Greek life and purposefully targets fraternities and soroities."
Sophomore,1,"Not worth the ridiculous tuition. Professors could care less about students contrary to what the school tries to advertise. Not a lot of options as far as courses and your major. Sports here are trash. Boring city. Socially deficient and immature student body, half of which are rich Democrat New York City natives. I honestly do not know where the tuition I paid went."
Sophomore,1,"Lafayette is academically a great school, but the social scene is absolutely horrific. They work so hard to suppress the statistics on just how huge Greek life is on campus - if you’re not in Greek life here, you will feel incredibly left out and sometimes ostracized. This goes the same for sports. The social elitism is EVERYWHERE on this campus, and it is extremely toxic. I would not recommend Lafayette to anyone."
College Junior,1,There are no words that can possibly sum up how terrible the administration is.
College Sophomore,1,"After my first year, I realized I couldn't be in a quarter million dollars worth of debt and decided to leave Lafayette. No one even attempted to help me with my situation or talk to me about figuring a way to stay, however I was more or less reminded that I was fortunate enough to have been accepted into the school in the first place. It made me very aware that they truly only care about the students with money."
College Junior,1,"The main form of transportation is the LCAT shuttle, which takes you to  Giant, CVS, and the mall (during certain times). The problem is having to wait for the bus to come back to the location."
College Freshman,1,"The diversity here is almost non-existant. 90% of the students are white, and many of the ones who aren't are international students. There is a scarcity of American minorities here, which I think takes away from the college experience."
College Junior,1,They all think they are good. Few people attend games. Except homecoming and our rivalry game.
College Junior,1,"Its terrible. It cost more than $55,000 to go here. If you're lucky enough to receive aid, its most likely a loan."
College Junior,1,"Located in Easton, Pennsylvania. 
The capital of sadness world wide. Note a nice area."
College Senior,1,"No Fun. The school is draconian about drinking and otherwise. The community round the college is spoiled beyond belief for a college town, and they won't hesitate to call in a noise complaint for loud music at 10:30 pm. This is only made worse by the administration promoting this sort of action."
College Sophomore,1,"Freshman have to park 10 minutes away from campus and have to take the shuttle to get there. Since school is small parking is limited,"
College Freshman,1,"BELOW STANDARD – the air conditioning and heat systems barely work. there's no space to breathe. i am literally all up on my roommate, there's no room. My closet is so small and I have no room for my clothes! The bathrooms are so dirty."
College Senior,1,"Whatever Fun There Was Is Dying – school sucks. 2 times a year there is a party for everyone, Homecoming and All College Day. that's it so get used to it/"
College Senior,1,"They Are Taking It Away – what little off campus housing that existed is now being taken away by LLC living learning communities which will be dry. This will leave partying to your room or one of 4 frats, 2 of which are on probation."
College Sophomore,1,"The school is incredibly strict. The only fun and redeeming part of the school is its Greek life, which the administrations is trying to get rid of.  The school is making a big mistake.  Students who wish to drink will have to do so in their dorms.  Its not safe and will lead to more alcohol related incidents."
College Sophomore,1,"Terrible, School Owned Buildings – The School is going to have essentially a monopoly on off campus housing, and its going to be for ""special interest groups.""  This means sports teams cannot have off campus houses.  It also means less social life"
College Sophomore,1,"Diversity on Campus – I feel that there isn't that much diversity on this campus. When I walk through the quad I don't see people of different colors. Sometimes I am the only Latino in class and it makes me feel like I don't really belong there. Posse is one of the biggest groups on campus that brings diversity aside from International Students. But, if we take those two groups outside Lafayette, Posse and International Students, we would probably have less than 5% of diversity on campus. I feel that Lafayette is not doing enough to have more diversity on campus. Easton is very diverse but when you come to Lafayette there isn't a lot. Maybe is the really high tuition or maybe Lafayette is not attracting minorities."

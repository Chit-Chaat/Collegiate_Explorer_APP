Junior,5,"Norwich is a great University,
They really communicate with you.  The administration and staff are always there to help and assist you.  The instructors are always engaged in each course, and they are always providing extra knowledge to take with you moving forward."
Junior,5,"I take online classes, In the past I did not do so well.  Taking classes at Norwich has help me become better with my studies.  The instructors are always engaged in each course, and they are always providing extra knowledge to take with you moving forward."
Freshman,5,"So as a freshman Norwich was very accommodating and I love the smaller class sizes. As a civilian there are some things to be aware of but if you pay attention they do an excellent job of informing you of them.

I do have a beef with their COVID handling, I'm from the West Coast and when they announced they were closing campus it was on a Friday when I petitioned to stay they granted it on the following Tuesday, I needed it Monday so I could make travel and lodging arrangements. By Tuesday I  had already rented a car, packed my room and made travel arrangements to return to my parents house."
Junior,5,"Going to Norwich University has changed my life and I am blessed to call it my home. Being from Arizona, I was worried about going to school on the other side of the country, but as soon as I arrived on campus I was welcomed and entered into a larger family of some of the best people I know. I have made bonds that will last a lifetime and I have grown exponentially as both an academic and a person. Attending Norwich University was the best decision I made in my life."
Freshman,5,"I entered Norwich as a Rook, a candidate to become a cadet in the Corps of Cadets, and I did not regret my choice. The training was rigorous. The academics was worse. We were pushed to our limits everyday. It was horrible at the beginning but slowly things start to pay off. I learned so much about brotherhood, leadership, discipline, and determination that it changed my life and my perception of the world. I realized that people talk about all those things without having a clue what they were talking about. And by coming to Norwich I realized what it truly is to be a leader. This is all thanks to the phenomenal cadre staff that I had the bliss to be led by. They changed my life. God bless the cadre, God bless Norwich. Norwich forever."
Alum,5,"No better prep for a military career.  Probably the same for a civilian, not many schools offer the leadership training you will receive here.  45 years later my classmates are still my friends.  Much better school than when I entered with far better choices for degrees.  Maybe no better school for cyber-security training."
Senior,5,School has a great reputation in the business world and great connections through alumni all over the country. It makes finding a job with a good degree much easier.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Norwich for the simple fact that it brings people together. You get a sense of family while being away from your family you gain a new one. You become so mature because you have to do things on your own now but also you have people around you who are willing to help you out just because you go to Norwich University. For some people who haven't been able to make friends in their hometowns, you meet people here who actually want to be your friends because of the experiences that you guys go through together."
Niche User,5,"In late September I traveled to North field Vermont to visit my dream college. In September the fall foliage was just starting. The drive to Vermont was beautiful. Arriving on campus was like a dream, the campus was lined with trees and bright beautiful leaves. The campus was clean and the staff, civilians, and cadets welcomed us with open arms. All my tough questions were answered and I left leaving Norwich fulfilled."
Alum,5,The professors were amazing. The coursework is challenging but forces you to look at things from another perspective.
Freshman,5,I love the campus and the quality of the facilities. I am also very pleased with the commitment of the professors and the only thing I would change is how students can have a more easy access to the cities nearby.
Senior,5,This is a great school with so many opportunities.  We have students from all over the world and a lot of international opportunities.  Professors are supportive and course work is interesting!
Junior,5,"Don't come here if you want Greek life; we don't have it. Don't come here for your traditional college experience; we don't have that either. People say there is nothing around, but I disagree. To the east is Paine Mountain, to the west is the Dog River, and the north is a tiny little town called Northfield. If you have the mental capacity to enjoy something other than frats and parties you'll love this spot in the middle of nowhere. If you like the outdoors, you'll love this spot. I don't recommend the civilian side, join the corps. Challenge yourself a little, it's not that hard and if you're weak minded enough to quit you never should've came in the first place. Norwich Forever!"
Sophomore,5,The Corps of Cadets is great and has done everything to make me a better person. I would recommend this path to anyone willing to take on a challenge that will force you to learn a lot about yourself.
Freshman,5,"I am just beginning to attend Norwich University, but my experience with Norwich University has been outstanding. The staff have all been extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I have thus far nothing but great things to say about this University!!!!"
Freshman,5,"I liked Norwich University because it made me feel at home, the only thing I would change is the fact that they decided to start changing the corps. They are taking the old traditions and saying no more to them."
Niche User,5,A small and friendly school with great opportunity in different fields. The hockey-program is fantastic and the academics are high.
Niche User,5,"I went and visited Norwich as a prospect. And the staff, students and just campus life was very friendly and understanding. The campus was absolutely breathtaking. I do think for their campus visits they need to organize the events better and more efficiently."
Freshman,5,Great environment to build the leaders of tomorrow.  This is the school to attend if you want to pursue a career in cybersecurity.
Freshman,5,I love the corp of Cadets! I want to commission as an officer after graduation and this programs allows me to have the exposure to military life while offering me an education with prestigious professors.
Alum,5,"Most of the negative ratings on here are from civilian students... this was originally a military college with the civilian part (Vermont College) being off campus with civilians being bussed in for certain classes. That all changed in the early/mid nineties, when civilian housing was brought onto the Northfield campus (Military College of Vermont). Ever since then, the civilian students always felt like second class students. 
Campus is in the boonies....so there are less distractions....when it comes to the typical college night life,  just get a ride up to Burlington or Montreal on the weekends like I did. 
This is a unique school. It takes a unique individual to want to go here. If your looking for that career in Law Enforcement or the military this is a great start to that path."
Freshman,5,"Norwich has a very welcoming atmosphere and this is most noticeable with the corps side of the school. Teamwork and unity are important here and there is always someone willing to lend a helping hand. While rotc and corps obligations are held in high importance, education definitely comes first. There is an abundance of tutors and help centers with flexible availability hours."
Freshman,5,"I think Norwich University is really what you make of it. It's definitely different with both cadets and civilians on the same campus, but after a while, it's hard to even notice. All of my teachers here have been so ready to help and available, as well as my advisors and everyone who takes care of the business behind the scenes. Not to mention, the hockey games are also exciting and a fun, school spirit-filled atmosphere."
Freshman,5,At a military college nothing is easy. I've had to earn every privledge I have and its been a challenge physically and mentally.
Niche User,5,Norwich University is an excellent school if you are looking to become an officer in the United States Military. Norwich was the founder of the ROTC program. For me this will be the best experience I will be able to get. Norwich is a very fine institution.
Junior,5,"Norwich has its ups and downs like most schools. However, with it being a military college, it provides you a family like no other college could offer you."
Freshman,5,"Being a freshman in the Cadet program, it has been a truly once in a lifetime experience to see how military and civilians can work together to make our world a safer and better place for many."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy the structure that Norwich has on education.Deadlines are always exact and rarely change, so you are always aware of whats due and when test dates are.As far as teachers go however, Norwich needs to work on staffing.Some teachers here at Norwich lack the ability to truly teach us students to our best potential, therefore stricter teachers would be better for the school."
Freshman,5,The school is so amazing and great for though that wish to join the COrps of Cadets and expericene a bit of the military officer life. Not to mention its purpose is to prepare you for the military but you dont have to join if you dont want to just know by junior and seionr year recuriters will bug the hell out of you.
Niche User,5,"its amazing, great atmosphere, great views, and great professors who truly help you as an individual"
Freshman,5,"The community is close and respectful. I was greeted by upper class men with smiles and comforting direction. Norwich offers a vast selection of studies and professional guidance to make sure you as a student are where you should be. Students are proud of Norwich's tradition and what it stands for and so are the alumni who support it. I can't imagine myself anywhere else.

As a college athlete, who lives on campus, if I could change anything, it would be that dining services had extended hours.  Late afternoon practices make it impossible to get to before it closes and eating before is not an option for a good workout. Athletes then have to go elsewhere and pay out of pocket to eat; this can become expensive."
Sophomore,5,Norwich is a hard school the pushes people to excellence and teaches students how to be better time managers. There are clubs and activities to suit every student.
Freshman,5,"I will be attending Norwich in Fall 2018, but I recently attended a school full day tour and had my mind blown. It is a military school but more it is a brotherhood that you can take throughout your life. They make sure you pass classes when having a mandatory 2-3 hour study block every night and a annual check in for grades. Not only that but you can always find a tutor/ teacher to help out. In terms of scenery it’s peobably one of the most beautiful colleges I have ever been to sitting in the middle of a plush Vermont Forest with fresh air. Also if your looking for a challenge they offer every single branch of military ROTC you don’t have to join the device though when decision is made in junior year but most likely you will want to. By my experience at this daily tour I think you should go!!"
Junior,5,"There are great people at Norwich University. It is not a huge campus, so it is easy to find people you connect with and to find all the academic buildings. There are many services around campus to help you with financial, security, military and many more services to help you have a wonderful time at Norwich."
Freshman,5,"In the Corps of Cadets what is instilled is unmatched at any other institution. The sense of honor and pride that this Senior Military College has ins like nonother, this mixed with the incredible teaching staff makes this university one of a kind."
Freshman,5,very good admissions office that really connect with the applicants. when i applied to this school i was nervous because i made mistakes during high school. My grades during my freshman and sophomore year were not the best. I only began to put my best foot forward during my junior and senior year.  This has had an impact on my cumulative GPA that their admissions team was able to look past and look at me based on my recent grades and substantial changes academically.
Sophomore,5,Norwich University is a great place. It teaches more than academics. It teaches leadership and brotherhood. Being in the corps of cadets is a great experience and learning opportunity. The class soze is relatively small. Teachers are able to work one on one with students.
Freshman,5,"Norwich has been an awesome experience.
Actually, coming to Norwich University has opened my eye to think differently.
with more of practice rather than just theory"
Freshman,5,"Norwich is a beautiful,school nestled into the Green Mountains. Everyone on campus shows an abundance of respect for others. The academic programs are limited, but the are extrmemely focused. Also, we have a really well founded Alumni department, allowing our students to meet folks who have gone down the path they were traveling."
Freshman,5,"I am very glad I found this Norwich University of my top choice so close to home. I was recently admitted to Merrimack College in North Andover, Ma. I went to visit both campuses and I like Norwich University more. I will do well in my course of major to keep up with the wonderful and generous scholarship Norwich University had awarded me. Thank you Norwich University for given me this life changing opportunity."
Freshman,5,"Norwich University is a good school, the only thing that I think needs to change is the food. It needs to be fixed because sometimes the food is under cooked or way over cooked"
Sophomore,5,"I started out as a Rook, a first year corps student, but had to drop out of that lifestyle due to a serious injury. I moved to Civilian and don't regret it. I've made lot of great friends and the teachers care. The class sizes are relatively small, your professor will know your name by the second or third week usually. It's a close community for the most part."
College Freshman,5,It's really good on what the students are looking for.
College Freshman,5,The best football team at Norwich university  and more.
College Freshman,5,"The dorms are great, and they put you in a dorm with people of your major."
College Freshman,5,It is the best school that meets the needs of each and everyone of its students.
College Freshman,5,On campus there is very little crime. I have not heard of anyone having anything happen to them while I have been here. There are blue lights spread throughout campus and security is always driving by and through campus. The blue lights are there so if you feel unsafe in a certain situation and need assistance you can press the button and security will be there very shortly and the town police are always policing the road in front of campus. It is very safe feeling on campus and there is no reason anyone should feel unsafe.
College Freshman,5,"The value of t your degree coming from Norwich University depends highly on what you studied. For instance the engineering, architecture, and nursing program are highly respected degrees from here. Other majors not so much but still are very respectable degrees. The number of opportunities to acquire an internship from Norwich are amazing. Most people who do provide internships here are Norwich alumni giving back to the school. The amount of alumni there are for being such a small school are great in number and spread far and wide. They are all over the world and are constantly helping recent graduates from here. The network is amazing. Alumni from here are very proud in the school just like the students and will give any student a shot at a job if they show the interest which is absolutely amazing. The career center here are amazing at setting up internships and great opportunities as well. These opportunities do not come knocking at your door. You have to go out and get them."
College Freshman,5,"I fit right in to my school. People here are considerate and welcoming to who you are. Here if you have a goal it is up to you to reach it, meaning you need to find the help if you need it forcing yourself to grow and mature all while learning and becoming a part of a bigger picture."
College Freshman,5,Norwich is a very unique place. I highly recommend
College Senior,5,"The university, as a whole, works to educate and facilitate the education of the student body."
College Freshman,5,I love being at Norwich University of Vermont. It is the school that I wanted live in. I love how they teach us and all the people who are around us to help us through our difficulties.
College Freshman,5,Our campus is pretty safe being that we are a predominately military college.  I generally feel safe at all times on campus.
College Sophomore,5,Majority of the students go here for free
College Freshman,5,"Campus housing is overall great. They take cleanliness very seriously in all of the dorms. A good amount of showers and bathroom stalls for the students, and windows to allow air in."
College Freshman,5,"I was welcomed into my major with open arms I didn't really experience any difficulties, the professor is just a thrill to communicate with."
College Freshman,5,"Even though I haven't attended Norwich for a year yet, I was completely amazed when I explored my major for their overnight tour. There are so many things to offer through my program, and many after college jobs and opportunities."
College Freshman,5,"Norwich takes sports very seriously and the coaches are very understanding about the life of a rook their freshman year and all that they go through. They allow the athletes to listen to music, and try to make them feel as close to home as possible."
College Freshman,5,"I'm not much of a party person and a lot of things that go on at college parties are strictly prohibited, but where the cafeteria is there is a huge selection of things you can do with your friends, xbox, wii, pretty sure they have guitar hero for the gaming systems!"
College Freshman,5,"Besides the training cadets get through rook training, the staff overall are very welcoming to any problems that may go on and always have their doors open so you can talk to them. Everything is very close together enough that there are eyes looking everywhere at all times. I feel extremely safe while I am on campus."
Freshman,4,"It’s a small college but there are many different things offered at Norwich. All of your professors are very open and communicate clearly about their office or drop in hours and if you send an email they usually reply within a day even on Saturday’s 😂.  Another thing that’s great about Norwich is the respect and values taught here, it is a military college but even as a civilian the core values and ideals that the cadet kids learn are carried through into how the civilians act and are treated which then helps in everyday life and career/job possibilities. The main values and ideals instilled into everyone at Norwich help build a better future of citizens. Lastly, the views and location of Norwich, while in a small town called Northfield are breathtaking, Dole Mountain is visible from almost anywhere outside on campus and watching the trees change colors every year and than grow back in the spring is a breathtaking experience."
Niche User,4,"My experience with Norwich University as an incoming student for Spring 2020 was kinda hard because of their demands. But otherwise, it was worthwhile, I was even given a financial aid award but not enough.."
Sophomore,4,Norwich has been great so far. The classes are challenging but the professors are fair. The cybersecurity facilities are great and very up to date. The campus is beautiful but the town of Northfield doesn't have a lot around it.
Junior,4,"If you know what you're coming to the institution for, you get what you came for. It is unparalleled in giving an education to prepare the graduates to serve in the military and the civilian workplace."
Sophomore,4,Norwich University and the Corps of Cadets has changed my life for the better. i became much more disciplined as a person and gained an overall better attitude. The only downside is the food and lack of campus activities.
Freshman,4,"I am only a freshman at Norwich, but, thus far, I have been happy with my choice to attend Norwich University. The smaller class sizes allows for better access to teachers and it creates a tighter connection within the classes. Since it is a smaller school there is almost no chance of being lost academically here at Norwich. All of my teachers have put forth the utmost effort to help me succeed in the classroom and in sports."
Niche User,4,I have been accepted into this university. It is a great school for people like myself who have a dream of serving our great country. I would highly recommend this school for anyone who does not believe they could make it into a West Point or Naval Academy. This is a true military school through and through.
Junior,4,"Patriotic, one of a kind. I know I found the place for me, but this definitely isn't the place for everyone."
Freshman,4,"It's a pretty good school overall. The Corps kids greatly outnumbers the civilians but that's to be expected from the nation's oldest military college. The male to female ratio here is remarkably lacking . . . I'd guess about fifteen guys for every girl, making it a massive sausage party. Some girls seem to love the attention from thirsty guys, others not so much. The food is okay but sits heavy and somewhat bland. Teachers are a roll of the dice, you'll never know who you get. Parties are lowkey and nonexist for the freshmen in the Corp until Recognition. You get a mix of genuinely nice, funny kids and some morons who will do anything for attention. I've had a good time here so far, hope it gets better as the years go by."
Freshman,4,"My experience so far at Norwich is like no other. The unity and family like connections that I see throughout campus is something I aspire to be. The student ran leaders are truly men and woman who will make a difference one day because for simply being a cadet program they take their jobs seriously. The amount of activities and resources offered to assist and keep people busy is almost overwhelming, but there is a spot for anyone who does come here. The food however could be a little bit better because some days it truly is disgusting."
Freshman,4,"Norwich isn't a bad school, just like every school has good professors and horrible professors. Overall it has a good alum base and support later down the road, pretty good academics dependent on your major, but really bad athletics. The hockey team is D3 but very good in their division, with eh exception of Rigby all other athletics are very sad."
Alum,4,"Norwich University was a bit pricey, however, I enjoyed my experience. My online professors were incredibly helpful, and were always available when i needed help understanding the information."
Sophomore,4,"Norwich University is a very good school if you like the outdoors or plan to join the military, not too much to do on campus or in Northfield. However if you can find a ride to the surrounding towns they are very cute and have some cool shops. Not a big-city place though."
Sophomore,4,"I began Norwich about a year ago, and it has been nothing short of amazing! I enjoy being around many like-minded people as well as getting NROTC training."
Senior,4,Norwich University is a Senior Military College that has a main focus on the education it provides. Professors who are on tenured track are more professional and knowledgeable then those who are not. On the military side many staff members of the Corps are incompetent at what they do and fail the students in the Corps.
Freshman,4,"My first semester after staring Norwich University I felt alone because it is in the middle of nowhere. After my first semester, I never felt more certain about college the starting of my second semester is when I knew I made a great decision to come to Norwich. They have the best Professor, They have great resources, and they are always making sure their student is taking care of in the best way possible."
Freshman,4,"Small university where you know almost everybody. Core is very important and most think they are better than every civilian. Fortunately, not all core members are like this. They have a bomb architecture program and nursing program. The other programs dont get as much credit as these two do. The professors are strange. Some are very strict for their classes and others could careless about what you do. I have had the chance to have awesome professors though that do care about your experience and grade. Also the food is terrible. The library and writing center are amazing and they are willing to help you with anything you need."
Sophomore,4,"I love Norwich University! The campus is generally pretty quiet, which allows me to focus more on my academics and really achieve greatness."
Junior,4,I generally enjoy my college life here. I think the academics and professors are great and I love the small class sizes. I think the school is a bit to demanding when it comes to useless general education classes that students may have 0 interest in and that are not helpful at all. Overall I consider it a well rounded campus.
Freshman,4,"Norwich University is a small campus in Northfield, Vermont.  It takes not even 10 minutes to walk from one end to the other.  It is mostly a military college but also has dorms for civilian students.  There is almost nothing to do around campus and parties are weak.  The classes are for the most part easy depending on what major you are in.  The sports teams are alright with the best ones being rugby and ice hockey.  Once it hits November, there will almost always be snow on the ground until March."
Sophomore,4,"Norwich University is the oldest private military school in the country. It has a long history of service to this nation. Many leaders of the military, government and even CEO's of companies have attended this institution."
Junior,4,"Norwich University is an amazing school. It’s the oldest private military college in the US, although you don’t have to be in the military to attend, you may be a civilian. Everyday Norwich instills skills into their students that will make them better students in and outside of the classroom. Leadership is one of the biggest qualities students gain from attending here. We’re located in the middle of a mountain valley and the seasons are breathtaking here."
Freshman,4,"Norwich University has allowed me to make the best transition to college after being out of school for quite some time. The professors have been extremely accommodating, everyone is very friendly, the coaches are all nicer than I could ever ask for and the friendly, close knit community has allowed me to make many friends. I am a woman of color in a very rural area, so that fact that everyone in the area happens to be white initially made it a bit hard for me to feel like I can be myself but when I actually got to Norwich University, I found that everyone here was more focused on getting the best education possible and they all accepted me for who I am."
Freshman,4,It's a beautiful campus full of opportunity. I have toured it several times and it is in a great setting and the people are fantastic. I have been accepted and honestly considering attending the university.
Freshman,4,The build in character and the discipline has really changed others and I. Norwich has matured me and is leading me in the right direction. The small classes is beneficial because its easy to get one on one with the professor if needed. I think for those who are civilians should be getting more activities because they pay just as much as the corp. They seem to get bored often because there is nothing around.
Freshman,4,"Wounderful school for both civilian and military lifestyle. It is a bit pricey at about $50,000 a year not including books and supplies."
Senior,4,"I have really enjoyed my online Interdisciplinary Studies program. The courses are diverse, interesting, and relevant."
Freshman,4,"I like is as much as a Freshman in the Corps of Cadets here can. Great school, but being a freshman here is not much fun."
Freshman,4,Norwich University is academics driven. Its faculty and staff strive to see each of their students succeed.
Freshman,4,"Norwich University offers a calm, kind, and great environment for college students. The amount of activities and opportunities that the school offers helps with studying for classes. The school offers so many resources to help expand education. The professors are easy to work with when it comes to academics. The overall experience at Norwich University is great for all diversities."
Freshman,4,"I think this university is great. I am in the corps of cadets at the school. For the first few months, you go through this initiation period called rookdom which is a period in which all military tradition is thought and followed such as making your racks and so on. This experience has really helped me in all aspects of life like academics, my personal life and just how disciplined i've become because of it . I think if you want to get the most out of norwich university, you need to join the corps of cadets."
Freshman,4,You will find many interesting people here. It ranges from friendly to rude so if one person doesnt like you that doesnt mean it will be the same with everyone else. There are plenty to do around the school you just have to get involved and pursue an activity. It make suck at first but this school is a gem in itself.
Niche User,4,The application process was simple and my admission counselor has been great. I really liked our campus visit that was individualized. I was accepted into the Corp of Cadets. This is my #1 college course if I am not appointed to a service academy.
Freshman,4,Norwich University's Early College Program has been an ideal experience for me. I am getting a head start on my college education and I could not be more thankful for all they have done for me and the hard work of my professors.
Alum,4,"One thing that resonates the most with NU is the family atmosphere. Whether you are from a class in the mid 1900's or present day, there is an inseparable bond that binds us all together. I was a student that tragically was impacted by the results of a car accident. I had professors, a Chaplain, and staff of the university rally around me and helped me get across the finish line. This enabled me to graduate on time with my class. I have had professors come in on their own personal time (off the clock) or stopped by my deck to visit my room in the barracks. You know the professors care and they always push you to be successful. The growing threat to the university's Corps of Cadets is moving forward amidst the hazing hysteria and lawsuits. Many changes occured following my Freshman year that things seemed so alien to me by the time I graduated. Training time was cut, Cadre were micromanaged, Rookdom was shortened, and standards reduced."
Sophomore,4,"Norwich has a beautiful campus as well as great diversity throughout the student body, not only from around the country but also from around the world. The school also has so much to offer aside from academics and sports for those students who decide to join the Corps. Here at Norwich although yes you are in a way competing against many of peers for scholarships and contracts they are also some of the best people you will ever meet and grow close to."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman this year, I am loving my college experience thus far. I have made just one close friend, but one is way better than none. I feel welcomed in the nursing department and by the staff of all Norwich. As a civilian commuter, I feel that I had been able to click with the rooks better than I anticipated. I have been using the Academic Achievement Center this semester and have had some extra success in Anatomy and Physiology. "
Freshman,4,"Attending Norwich University has been a very challenging and great experience so far.  Norwich is a unique school because it offers just more than academics, it offers you the opportunity to become a leader and to be a better citizen. So far, I have already become better in many aspects in my life. This school pushes you physically and mentally from Day 1. I live over 4,000miles away from home and I became homesick. Living far from home surely is a challenge and with the people that surround me, they helped me get through and overcome this obstacle. Not only that, physically, I was having a real rough time with endurance and cardio, but with self-motivation and the support from my rook brothers and sisters, I was able to improve my run time in no time. This school has something that no other school has and that's motivation and teamwork. This place puts you to the test and will surely make a great impact on your life. This place is what you make of it. "
College Sophomore,4,"Our sports are okay. Everybody support our school during a game but not most people would attend for example me. I have my own priorities right now and that is to focus. However, it doesn't mean that I dont have any school spirit in me. I would support my school if I have any available time. As for the mean time I would stay in door and study."
College Freshman,4,They customize to each athletes needs
College Junior,4,It's like a second home to me.
College Junior,4,"They`re there is you need it, but don`t expect them to do all the work."
College Junior,4,The school was worth all the challenges.
College Sophomore,4,"There are two civilian dorms on campus, which are both pretty nice. I lived in Dalrymple my freshman year and I had one of the bigger double rooms. In each room is a bed (either captain or lofted, I had captain which is what you want to get) with 4 drawers underneath, a desk, metal chair (which I switched out for my own chair), and a wall locker (about the size of a bookcase with 3 small drawers and space to hang clothes)."
College Junior,4,Degrees from this school look really good after college.
College Junior,4,"Our campus can be aggressive on the weekends but overall, it is very safe."
College Junior,4,"As a military college, this school is successful."
College Freshman,4,"Here at Norwich University we do not have many diverse classes offering courses that are not at other schools but they make up for it in the class sizes, professors and the quality of the classes. The class sizes are small, the biggest lecture you will find has around 40 students in it. That's only as a freshman. They get smaller as you go on and progress more into your study. Having small classes really lets the professors get to know you on a personal level. They really get to know your learning style and they do know when you are in class and participating. They also know when you are not there which has its ups and downs. They have the ability to drop you if you do not show up to 3 or more classes without a pink slip from the infirmary dismissing you from class. This leads into the style of class. Very rarely will you have a lecture that is just the professor talking the whole time. Most of the time you are encouraged to participate and do activities in class. Labs are the same way. All the labs I have ever taken here are very hands on and include a lot of field trips around campus and off campus as well. Overall very good experience."
College Freshman,4,"On our campus we have two options of life style. We have the ROTC program which is what we are widely known for and the civilian side. The ROTC program will room you with whoever is in your major. You don't have much of an option. As a civilian your freshman year you are sometimes paired randomly or you'll find someone on the Facebook page that you think you would get along with and would like to room with. As a civilian you have two options for building. Dalrymple, which is the newest dorm and most updated and South with isn't as nice but still nice compared to other campuses. The Freshman and all the upperclassmen with the best gpa get Dalrymple and all other students get their choice in South. Dalrymple is a very quiet dorm. Not much happens on the floors like in South. South has most the upperclassmen so it is much rowdier. The housing process is very easy as long as you have a good gpa then you will be the one first to choose. Juniors get to choose first then sophomores and the freshman get placed in a room in West with no option of where they go. The ROTC students have an easy commute to and from classes because they are located on the upper parade ground which is right next to the busy building and close to the gym. The civilian dorms are on the other side of campus. This is because every morning the ROTC students are woken up by a cannon at 5:30 am every morning and the civilian students do not want to hear this. The campus is very small so getting to classes from the civilian dorms are not very hard but can be a hassle in the Winter. There are shortcuts through buildings which makes the walk less dreadful."
College Freshman,4,"Since I have been a student at Norwich University, I have never heard of a sexual assault case.  I know that there has been some past issues with it, but I think that the campus is really safe.  They even have emergency boxes all around campus in case you do feel threatened/scared by anyone that might be following/harassing you."
College Freshman,4,I think the professors here really know what they are talking about.  There are a lot of teachers that I feel are passionate about teaching at this school.  There are also teachers here that are a little too strict at grading and one little mistake can make a big difference on your grade.
College Freshman,4,"I feel that Norwich has a very good following of alumni.  They are always donating or finding a way to give back to the school.  They also come to our sporting events and cheer on the teams.  From what I know if you are in the corp and you get your corp ring and wear it to a job interview, and if the job interviewer is a Norwich alumni, you are pretty much guaranteed the job."
College Freshman,4,"I am currently on the wrestling team and from my prospective, the weight room is really nice.  There are both athletes and non athletes in there all the time.  The only thing that I think the school could do to make the gym better is expand it and put more equipment that we don't have in there."
College Freshman,4,"There is a variety of options to chose from for a major, minor and concentration."
College Freshman,4,Most professors are very willing to help you one on one because they genuinely care that you succeed in their class.
College Freshman,4,Sports especially Hockey really bring the school together to share our spirit and support for our fellow peers.
College Freshman,4,Considering that it is a military college there is not much to worry about.
College Freshman,4,"There really isn't any drug activity that takes place other than those who smoke cigarettes, but there are designated areas so it doesn't really bother anyone."
College Freshman,4,The alumni from this school are very active with donations and attending school events which is a great thing because you get to speak with them and make great connections.
College Freshman,4,The dorms are in great condition and are kept up by the campus custodians. Rooms are usually the same size and allow plenty of room for yourself and up to three roommates.
Senior,2,"Some of the teachers are really cool and actually want to teach you, some are not. There is heavy emphasis on the discussion boards, so if you're not a fan, I would pass on this school. The main reason for my two rating is that they like to add extra classes. I was less than a year from graduating and someone decided I needed two additional gen Ed classes, out of the blue and said I couldn't graduate if I didn't take them. 
This was the second time that happened."
Sophomore,2,"I can't stress this enough - do not come here if you're looking to be on the civilian side. There is truly, absolutely nothing to do. The school is geared completely towards the Corps side. They also let just about anyone in on the civi side, in order to up their enrollment. Classes are easy, nothing you have to try too hard at. Many civilians transfer. If you want a real college experience, this isn't the place for it."
Freshman,2,"This is a decent school if you were an average High School student, and you have military aspirations. It's home to the first ROTC program, and a corps of cadets is a good introduction to a military lifestyle. The food is average to bad with only three real on campus dining options, there's no sense of campus community for civilian students, and there's a nothing to do off and frequently on campus. Not a school to go to if you're looking for the ""college experience."""
Alum,2,"If I could rate this university solely on the professors, I would give 5 stars. The connections I've made with the professors will be life long. However, Norwich university is not like any other college. You have two sides, Civilian and Corps of Cadets. The civilian side is hard. You need to have a strong mentality and be able to keep a positive mindset."
Senior,2,Completely biased place. Honest people get in trouble while the trouble makers walk free. Does not teach leadership at all. Aside from the academics it has a very toxic environment.
Freshman,2,"Unique environment that is certainly not for everyone. Focus is on military training and not on education. Very good for those whose primary focus is the military, but lacking for any sort of student dedicated to education."
College Freshman,2,"I wake up everyday wondering why i chose to come here. The only thing that makes this school worth it is the connection you make with your rook siblings. This military school is just for show, barely any PT and after rook week its just mindless bs"
College Sophomore,2,There are too many days where its repetitive and seems like they are just using stuff from the day before.
College Senior,2,"Speaking as an athlete, the programs are nice, but the school recognition is terrible unless you are Women's Rugby or Men's Hockey."
College Senior,2,"Off campus housing is up to the student to find, and is often the run-down places no one else wants. Terrible, no one really gets off campus housing because the snows make it too much of a hassle to get to campus because of the isolation of the campus."
College Senior,2,"The menu is not very flexible. The overall price is high for the quality given, and the hours of operation during the weekend are reprehensible. The chow hall only provides two meals during the weekend and both are late in the morning/early in the evening. Being so far away from any large town a car is needed to get any good food off campus, or for that matter period. The local mill, a cafe like place, is not much better. Very small menu, and often burnt or disgusting food."
College Freshman,2,There are no parties just people hanging out in their dorms.
College Freshman,2,The only option for food is the chow hall. The students pay enough for it there should be better food and healthier. Also the times the chow hall is open is awful for instance only twice on the weekends. Students are hungry on the weekends too. There is not much other food places to go unless you want to spend more money.
College Freshman,2,"It's a military college, so expect the strictness."
College Freshman,2,"The food company that runs the food services is called Sodexo, and the quality that they provide simply don't cut it for a lot of the people here... It will destroy your stomach."
College Freshman,2,Very hard for anyone to need receive support for anything they need.
College Freshman,2,"The local area is pretty crappy, the town of Northfield has like 200 people in it and a couple of small shops."
College Sophomore,2,Its hard to drink and have a good time with so many restrictions
College Sophomore,2,Only certain students can live off campus. The houses are nothing special.
College Senior,2,"Military college = White, conservatism. I.E. not much diversity"
College Senior,2,"If you are looking for a sausage fest, then a Norwich Party is the place for you my friend!"
College Junior,2,The school is now starting to charge us 5 cents per page printed despite the technology fee at the beginning of the year. The internet is slow and often crashes multiple times a semester. There was a point in the semester where the internet was not working for about two weeks. Tech support is terrible and are rude most of the time.
College Junior,2,Transportation at this school is terrible and the only campus shuttle available is for when you are drunk. If you do not have a  car or a friend with a car you aren't leaving campus.
College Junior,2,There are only two bars on campus and to have any night life in Vermont would be amazing since everything you have to travel over a half hour away and then nothing is open past midnight even on the weekends. It makes things very boring and leads to much of the drinking on campus.
College Junior,2,"In terms of sexual orientation there is a large lesbian population, but other than that most are straight. Economic status is diverse due to the large amount of ROTC scholarships that are available that allow lower economic status to afford this school. Since this school is a military school political beliefs and religion often are the same throughout the students."
College Junior,2,"The schools policies changed this year that no longer allow students to live off campus which will hurt a lot of the locals in the town who own property. Prior to that off campus housing was relatively small, but good for the price."
College Junior,2,"The long winters make it hard to be outside, but even if there is nice weather there are not enough open fields that non-athletes can use. There is no real place for students to hang out on the weekends besides the dorms. The library is usually a good place to study, but often gets too noisy. Traditions on this campus are slowly dying each year."
College Junior,2,"There are too many guys at this school and many of them think the gym is their home. Jeans, boots with a sweatshirt is often good enough when not in uniform. The girls are not the classiest and often can look like many of the guys. Too many lesbians."
College Junior,2,The ratio of guys to girls on campus is very skewed. There are far more males than females here due to the military aspect. This leads to many girls not applying and coming here. Everyone is dressed in uniform all day and the males do not find that appealing. Many people go to other colleges like University of Vermont to find other people to date. Even with the skewed guy to girl ratio there are still many relationships on campus.
College Junior,2,"There are not many places the live off campus. Only those who are civilians at our school and not in the Corps of Cadets can live off campus. These houses are usually not in the best condition and typically more expensive than other off campus housing at other schools. Recently the school released that they will no longer allow students to live off campus which has caused many issues for those that were hoping to do that next semester. There is also very limited parking once you are in town near the houses, but it is within walking distance to school."
College Junior,2,"The town that my campus is located in is very remote and doesn't have much to offer. There are some small local shops along with 3 places to eat. In order to do anything fun you have to drive out of the town at least 20-30 minutes. That requires a car, which many students don't have either. It is a safe town because there aren't many people and it has many street lights. The local attitude toward the students is good because the school provides a majority of the income."
College Junior,2,"The only nightlife that occurs on campus are when the school has movie nights in the auditorium, karaoke, or going to the campus bar. Other than that, many parties are held off campus at houses. These houses are typically sports team houses that host the parties. Unless personally invited or on a sports team, many people will not let you into the parties. The local bar in town is where everyone usually goes who is over 21. There is NU safe rides that will provide transportation back to campus, but that is only until 1 in the morning. On campus it is typically boring, or there is just drinking in the barracks."
College Junior,2,"There are not many off-campus dining options once leaving the campus. There is Subway, Chinese restaurant, and a local pub that serves some food. These places typically are slow and have many customers at once. If someone wants to get quality food they would need to drive at least 20-30 minutes away from campus. That is difficult for most because of either the Vermont weather in the winter, or the lack of students that bring vehicles to have on campus."
College Sophomore,2,None - can use a few bed and breakfasts nearby if you have a car
College Sophomore,2,90% white male - 10% women and minorities.
College Sophomore,2,remote location - no public transportation readily available. Not needed on campus.
College Freshman,2,"there is no variety here. most of the girls here don't like boys, and the ones that do usually end up sleeping with all of them. "
College Freshman,2,Always either cold or rainy at Norwich. Right in a valley some 3/4 of your year you're freezing.
College Sophomore,2,Really I cant go home on the weekend because an upper classman doesnt have the form needed and wont get one or say where to get them....its not prison.
College Freshman,2,"Because Norwich University is a Junior Military College, the rules are very regimented regarding student life, though they're reasonable for most people."
Niche User,1,"Unfortunately, I had no chance to study here. The rest Explained above. Please review the admission policy and put properly trained student advisors."
Niche User,1,"Had the worst experience dealing with the student adviser K.King. He tried to get me enrolled by all means and put me on the financial burden, even after when I explained to him several times the obstacles. I hope you'll never deal with that individual. Because of him, I was totally frustrated to continue my application for Norwich, albeit it took me almost two months to deal with that person."
College Junior,1,There is no greek life at my university.
College Sophomore,1,"If you're not in the corps, I wouldn't recommend going here at all. It definitely isn't the typical college experience and if you don't play sports there's literally nothing to do on or around campus. Most of the people I've met are extremely rude and closed minded and there are way too many guys, most of which are assholes. If you're hoping to go somewhere that will give you memorable life experiences and where you'll actually be happy, do not go here."
College Senior,1,"There are no off campus dining facilities, unless you consider the typical restaurants made for the public. There is no discount for students, and no way to get there from the campus unless you walk or have a personal vehicle."
College Senior,1,"The campus is very strict, which is a good thing, but the administration itself is not worth the mud on their shoes. They tend to treat every student as criminals, unless you have rich parents or are a legacy student. I have seen a student stab someone and remain on campus, yet one student just lost a loved one and said they wanted to hurt themselves or someone else and they were kicked out. This school has no sense of community or family. It only cares about the money it rakes in. I would not attend this university if I had known this prior."
College Senior,1,"The students are given no choice in where they will be living, the only option is a possibility for roommates. That is dependent on the job/rank of the perspective room mates as well. Over all the rooms provided are tiny, with insufficient heating/ cooling systems (having no ac what so ever). Overall the room quality is not worth the price they charge, and there is no option. living off campus means you may not be in the Corps of Cadets, and you must find your own residence in a town the size of a large mall, or drive 40 minutes to school every day."
College Freshman,1,There is not off-campus housing
College Freshman,1,There isn't one...plain and simple.
College Freshman,1,Rough in a very small town.
College Freshman,1,Because we are a military college we do not have greek life.
College Sophomore,1,The school is in the middle of nowhere.
College Sophomore,1,A lot of paper work has to be done for visitors and to get off campus
College Sophomore,1,There are not many choices near by
College Junior,1,It is always cold and winter here in Vermont. Sometimes the sun is only out for a few hours each day and there is always that period of time in February that the sun does not come out from behind the clouds for several weeks. It makes it very depressing.
College Junior,1,The possibility of getting a ticket is extremely high here because that is all security does for this school. There are not enough parking spots on campus for everyone that has a car and it takes over fifteen minutes to walk to the parking lots. Also they are snow plowed very poorly in the winter leading to your car getting stuck or getting into an accident.
College Junior,1,There are very little fraternities or sororities on campus and the only ones that are on campus are attributed to the academic societies.
College Sophomore,1,COLD! Bitter cold and dry then in the summer buggy and humid!
College Sophomore,1,"A Dollar Store, Subway, Chinese and 1 pizza place. There is 1 tavern and a hardware store! Not a typical college town!"
College Sophomore,1,Subway does it for night life!!
College Sophomore,1,Its an expensive school and the financial offices are a nightmare.
College Freshman,1,there is no greek life in norwich
College Sophomore,1,"Public transportation is only in the mornings, you really need a car to go to places such as restaurants, supply store, and late night pickups. It is a 30 to 45 minute drive to go to these places."
College Freshman,1,There is nothing around Northfield. You have to go to Montpelier to get anything you might need
College Freshman,1,"There is a tavern, subway and pizza place you can walk to - if you are first year Rook until you are Recognized - can't leave!"
College Freshman,1,the girls are very limited. guy to girl ratio is 9:1
College Freshman,1,it snows all the time on a hill campus and class is never cancelled
College Freshman,1,There's one bar which closes at 2 on Fridays and Saturdays which has a 3 drink limit.  The campus is located in the dead center of VT (there's actually a marker on campus of the exact middle of VT)  and there is a 40+ min drive anywhere worth going.
College Freshman,1,"My program is way too easy and not even slightly challenging.  Also, during two semesters here, I've only taken two major orientated classes(which won't count as transfer classes anywhere) and all gen eds.  In my intro to programming class, my professor got fired half way through the year and they had a business professor teach us code that he didn't even know.  Ridiculous."
College Freshman,1,This is a military college - really go elsewhere if that is what you are looking for. Your time from 0530 until 2200 is controlled.
College Freshman,1,If you are a Rook there is NONE! Cadets are limited because there is really nothing in town and need a car to get anywhere.
College Freshman,1,There is almost no transportation avail. Ride shares and shuttles to airports are the only options.
College Sophomore,1,"Norwich is in Northfield, Vermont, which is far away from much of civilization. This being said, the nightlife you will find will include the people on campus, which won't be many. There are never huge parties, rather gatherings of friends usually remaining under twenty people."
College Sophomore,1,The Corps of Cadet program requires the student to live on campus in the barracks.
Recent Alumnus,1,No Girls – The guy to girl ratio is way off. Don't expect to find a girl here
College Freshman,1,Dead Town – There is literally nothing to do. The coolest thing to do is to go to the Knotty Shamrock and get the boneless chicken wings. We can't drink because most of us are underage. We tend to make our own fun. We're a military school...of course we're going to get creative.
College Freshman,1,"Nothing to Do – There is absolutely nothing to do in my school's town. We have bonfires on weekends which is always fun, but there is no source of entertainment in town. You have to drive at least half an hour to get anywhere remotely interesting, and most students don't have cars, and taxis are too expensive."
College Freshman,1,Mostly core kids. Some core kids are rude and think they are above everyone else.
College Freshman,1,"Violation of Alcohol Policy – Nightlife for students who are 21+ is pretty good - house parties, the Mill, along with a few Bars in town and down the road going into Montpelier. For those 21 and under parties with alcohol are hard to come by. There is no transportation aside from own car / taxi / foot to get off campus - the school does operate a ""safe ride"" program to help curb injuries while drunk driving.

This school destroys students (even those who are over the age of 21) who have alcohol outside of the Mill (Sodexo operated scam)and on campus - usually forcing students to take a semester off from college, or expelling them completely. 
The zero tolerance policy comes from the (majority) military background of the institution and the worry that hazing will come back with it.

In reality, this school must be more progressive with their alcohol policies on campus."
College Sophomore,1,White Male Military School – Norwich University is the nation's oldest private military school.  This school is predominantly white male.  The ratio of male to female is about 25:2.  Scholarship opportunities for non white males is very easy to obtain since the school is trying to become more diverse.   This is not the most ideal school if you want to attend a very diverse community of students.

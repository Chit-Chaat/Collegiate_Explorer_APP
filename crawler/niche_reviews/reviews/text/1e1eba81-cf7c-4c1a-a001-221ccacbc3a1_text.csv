Sophomore,5,I took one course that was partially online and partially on ground. The teacher was extremely good and the course was very interesting. Online study is not really my thing but at least in this one instance it turned out to be OK.
Sophomore,5,Harding is a fabulous university. I loved my experience there and made friends that will last me the rest of my life. The preparation I receive there prepared me to compete and be successful in my chosen career. I was excepted to many better known universities but I am so happy I chose Harding – – great decision.
Niche User,5,"I have attended ""Bison Days"" via the internet, and was genuinely impressed with the staff. They were so helpful and took time to make sure the answers to my questions were found. I cannot recommend Harding enough or sing their praises enough."
Niche User,5,"Harding University is a place of inclusion, opportunity, and just an all around sublime representation of the love of Jesus. The people there are genuine and passionate about what they do. It is evident they live out their faith. If you want to attend a University that feels like home away from home, I recommend giving Harding some thought."
Senior,5,"There was no other school for me but Harding. I fell in love with this school as a child and I love it today as a senior facing graduation. It is far from perfect, but it is full of love and good Christian servants who want to teach and help future leaders grow. I have learned so much about my chosen career path here and I feel more than prepared for graduate school and future jobs. But more than that, the spiritual education I have received here has been outstanding. Both in my Bible classes and through interactions with my fellow students, I have learned so much about faith and living a Christian life. It is not a school for partiers, but for people who enjoy learning and growing with people who will be there for you for the rest of your life."
Freshman,5,I like the christian atmosphere of the place and the professors really do their best to make sure everyone is included and knows exactly what to do in any situation.
Sophomore,5,"Harding is not just a school, it is a community and a family. The faculty and staff want to see the students succeed in their future careers and they are always willing to help in any aspect necessary. Most professors do not simply teach to a test, but they help the students understand and apply the information presented. The student body is close and friendly. The campus is beautiful and the entire Harding experience is worth the cost."
Freshman,5,"My online experience with Harding was excellent, especially considering the circumstances. Most of my professors using Zoom and Canvas, which complimented well."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Harding was incredible. The professors are intentional and care about the success of their students, the student body has energy like unlike any other, and the campus is so beautiful. There is rich history at Harding and I have deeply enjoyed attending school there. My learning has been challenging and enriching. I have not only grown intellectually, but I have also grown as a person."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Harding, I think everyone should at least consider the school. Online classes are not my favorite - but when on campus, school is great."
Senior,5,Wonderful christian college full of professors and students that care about each-other. The academics are very challenging and prepares us for our future careers.
Alum,5,There are a lot of things to love about Harding University. The students and faculty are always friendly! The campus is beautiful! There isn’t much of a night life but honestly when you are studying it doesn’t matter. There is a curfew at midnight that may seem restricting but honestly helps the students study and be ready for the next day.
Freshman,5,"The students and staff of this school have made the college life very easy to adapt to. Everyone hear are very nice, and all the things you learn here are just amazing. Great school with some great people. Harding allows for many experiences outdoors being located in Arkansas and, very much focuses on you getting involved in the community. Even though I live 13 hours away it's still a school after the time I have been here to keep on coming back to."
Freshman,5,"Harding University is a wonderful place! The people are very friendly and the campus is beautiful. I attended the Honors Symposium over the summer, and basically lived there for 2 weeks. The professors were so inclusive and challenged you to be independent in your thinking. I love Harding University!"
Sophomore,5,I transferred here in the fall of 2019 and the community here was just different the teachers cared about you physically and mentally. It was a different type of environment unlike the school I was at before. I plan on staying here for the rest of my college career and make the best out of it.
Freshman,5,The teachers at Harding are very kind and helpful. There is a good food selection. Overall Harding University is a great college!
Niche User,5,"My name is Lith-Amar Viciere,
I really like the way that Harding university treat there international student. I've just been accepted at Harding University for the the fall semester 2020 and I already feel that I will feel comfortable there even though I will be far from my family, but I know that I will have a new family at Harding University. The only thing I can say is that Harding University is the best and I am looking forward to start class in August."
Senior,5,The community and atmosphere is unlike anywhere I’ve ever been before. There is a unique bond and relationship between professors and students that allows us to receive the best education possible.
Senior,5,I have enjoyed my time at Harding University. The biggest problem I have is their requirements for living off campus and curfew.
Freshman,5,Harding University is amazing and I love that they teach us our majors and how to do that major and to maintain a Christian lifestyle.
Niche User,5,The professors and faculty are great! The people here are willing to work with you to get you anything you may need. They could use improvements on social life.
Junior,5,"It is a bigger Christian college with a small college feel. Everyone is so welcoming and desiring to have a real relationship with you. To Professors  you're not just another body in a class room. You're someone they desire to succeed and become friends with. When I told the department that I may not be able to come back because of financial reasons, nearly every one of them came up with ways to help me stay. Whether it's odd jobs, work study, living with them so as to not pay housing or a meal plan. They've become family. Just like everyone else you meet here. If you let them, they'll love you for the rest of your life."
Sophomore,5,"Harding University is a very good school. The professors here are phenomenal and I have had so many opportunities to learn and grow. The school is diverse, with students from all different countries. The people here are just incredible and the courses challenge you to get better and there are so many extra curricular to be apart of. There are some flaws, as there are with all colleges, but being at Harding is just a great experience. The campus is also beautiful which is a plus."
Niche User,5,"I love the atmosphere and how most people who work at Harding also attended Harding to get their degree. The people who attend Harding have really made it a community, the town is is attached to has coffee shops to do school work. The entire school is invested in the well-being of their students. The teachers creating relationships with their students and the students getting opportunities most students in college do not."
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience has been a blessing at Harding University. Social clubs are exciting, yet don’t cause too much trouble. Teachers reward hard working students with the needed tools to succeed even in the hardest and highest level classes. There’s many palaces near by for group hang outs. Not only that the dorm atmosphere is one of a time"
Niche User,5,"I can't speak from the perspective of a student, but I can speak from the experience of working on campus and having been surrounded by Harding culture my entire life, as well as a current applicant to campus. 

The faculty I've met are some of the nicest people I know. I hear so much from students about how great the staff is and how much they are willing to work with students to provide any assistance wherever possible. 

The campus life seems extraordinary. There are always events going on and the university takes great care to provide maximum entertainment without turning it into a raging party. 

I know several people who have graduated from Harding, and every single one of them enjoyed it immensely. I look forward to this."
Freshman,5,"I like how involved the staff members are with the students. Everyone is so friendly and involved in helping students succeed and get to where they want to go in life. This university has a beautiful campus, and welcomes everyone with open arms."
Sophomore,5,"Harding university is a very encouraging place spiritually. They really make an effort to get to know you and help you in any way you can no matter your background. While it is classified as a christian school, you don't have to be a christian to feel at home there."
Sophomore,5,"There is a saying, ""It's great to be at Harding"" and it is as true now as it has been for me, my parents and my grandparents. As a private institution, Harding University is a steal for the price of tuition with everything they offer, from a full free gym, to amazing technology services and more. The campus is so beautiful.  And the community of students and staff is amazing."
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Harding. I met incredible people that became my life-long friends, I made real and lasting connections with my professors, I was able to study abroad and learn about different peoples and cultures. It is funny because the school is in the middle of no-where but thats what forces you to really connect with the people around you. I think there are some things they need to work on but overall I had a wonderful experience."
Freshman,5,"Harding is a great Christ like atmosphere, it will allow you to grow spiritually and emotionally!! It is such a great sized campus, it’s very reassuring that you can always see someone you know! But you can always meet a new person! I just really like HU!"
Sophomore,5,the teachers here really care that you pass. they will act to reach out if they notice you might need help. the students are also willing to help you suffer through classes and will also hang out with you not doing homework.
Niche User,5,I am an incoming Freshman for Fall 2019.  Everything I have researched tells me this will be an amazing college.
Freshman,5,Harding University is great! The professors are very nice and concerned about you. Harding is a great place to grow spiritually!
Freshman,5,"I'm currently a freshman at Harding University.  It is a good place to be, the teachers and faculty are very friendly.  The school isn't a large school, so the students feel more connected to one another.  The classes challenge students to think, causing them to learn and get an education, not just a diploma."
Junior,5,I absolutely love Harding because of its off the charts social atmosphere. One of the most socially involved campuses that exists for sure.
Freshman,5,I LOVE Harding!!!  I began at Harding in the fall of 2018 and from the very first day I walked on campus before classes had even begun I have felt at home.  The faculty and administration are amazing and they have made me feel so welcome and important.  I have gained so many great experiences here so far and I cannot wait to continue to create lasting and loving memories.  Harding is a community that strives for the best in every aspect of life and they truly suceed.
Niche User,5,Harding has great recruiters! It is a great school with many options and courses to take. You can find anything you want but on a small campus. They will give you an amazing experience that is Christ-centered.
Junior,5,"I could not imagine spending my college career anywhere other than Harding. The students and faculty truly do form a amazing community full of love. The teachers really care, not just how you do in class, but beyond the classroom. Social clubs are a great way to get plugged in and find some people who you’ll be friends with for the rest of your life."
Sophomore,5,Harding has a great atmosphere that draws you in and makes you want to be a part of the great things taking place there.
Graduate Student,5,Harding is a frat school. I like the intimate setting for face to face format. Online the professors are excellent with responses.
Sophomore,5,"Harding is a great school with many fantastic professors in all departments. The campus is beautiful and the people on campus, both students and faculty are kind, helpful, and friendly, even if you don't know them well.  Our sports programs are usually in the top of our division every year, and our other competing teams for things such as debate and engineering have won many awards in their own respects. I think Harding is a great place for anyone no matter their field of study or background to come and study in a community like no other."
Junior,5,"I like the christian environment, which affects student life and the classroom. Most other students are kind, and teachers are always understanding and willing to help. The one thing I would change is parking space and the quality of most male dormitories."
Sophomore,5,I love Harding so much! I am so blessed to be able to go to this wonderful institution. I have made so many friends during my time here and now that it is Summer I miss them so much.
Freshman,5,Beautiful campus and nice people! Professors are wonderful! Athletic program is amazing!! Chapel is one of my favorite things to go to every day because I get to connect with god and become closer with him!!
Sophomore,5,It has been great so far. I was expecting it to suck cause of all the rules but it has been wonderful.
Sophomore,5,Harding is a fantastic place to be. All professors are respectful and genuinely care about not just how well you are doing in the class but you're well being. The other students and staff are also highly respectful.
Junior,5,"Harding University offers great academic programs. The professors truly care about their students' well being and want to see them succeed. There are always things going on at campus that provide great ways to meet new people and find some really good friends. The opportunities are really diverse, everyone has the ability to find a place for them."
Niche User,5,I loved it when I visited the college.  I have not actually attended it for a degree because I am in high school but the tour was very enjoyable and it is a beautiful campus.  The university has the major I want to get and I know a bunch of people who go there.  It just seems perfect!
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Harding! The relationships formed with professors have been a huge blessing in my graduate and professional career, as well as in my personal life. Academically, I was well prepared for grad school. The friendships formed last a lifetime!"
Graduate Student,5,People come here for the Harding experience! It is truly life changing! I wish that it was more available for others.
Senior,5,"I have absolutely loved my time here! I did not like the ""Advance"" Program which is for those who didn't make a 21 on the ACT are FORCED to be a part of. They baby you and they say the classes count toward your degree. THEY DON'T. You have to take several hours to graduate in 4 years. But aside from that your professors truly care about you. If you show them you care and they will bend over backwards to help you pass. They are also willing to make friends with you. My favorite mentors are my professors. I also have a diverse group of friends. I also participated in a club my 1st 4 years and I met some of my best friends in there. Great way to meet a lot of people. Connect with a local church too to build connections with others. I also met some people I would have never gotten to know if I wasn't involved in a church. Harding is what you make it."
Niche User,5,"Literally the greatest place on earth...there are students from all 50 states and over 30 countries. The only thing I rated ""terrible"" about HU is the party scene, because you're encouraged  by like-minded people to focus on the ultimate goal of getting an education and furthering God's Kingdom whereas the ""party scene"" distracts from that goal. But if you really wanted to party, you can find it anywhere."
Sophomore,5,Harding University has been a great experience so far. I love the classes I have been able to take. I enjoy being on the beautiful campus and getting together with friends. Harding also provides a fun environment for a christian inspired lifestyle.
Sophomore,5,"The way they push you to become something more than you could ever expect from yourself. They want to see you succeed in life they want you to graduate from here and make a name for yourself which I think is awesome. The professors here are so nice and they are willing to help you with anything, they take their time out of there day just to help you or just to be there for you just in case you need someone to talk to which is also the best thing about Harding University."
Freshman,5,"I have been at Harding for one semester and I already feel at home here. Everyone from students to staff are all polite, friendly and will go out of their way to help you in anyway your need it. I feel very safe here and do not worry about security."
Sophomore,5,At Harding everyone is one big family that helps one another. The professors love to help students and are easily understood because they do not have any foreign accents.
Niche User,5,"I spent 2 week during the summer at HU for the summer Institute. I had a fantastic time, learned a great deal and got college credit."
Niche User,5,"I am a high school senior right now, but i have been connected to Harding since before i could walk. To me, Harding feels like home and i love it! The area is absolutely gorgeous! It gives you a wonderful college experience and as they say, ""It's Great To Be At Harding!!"""
Sophomore,5,"Harding has a college environment that is like no other.  When people say ""It's Great to be at Harding,"" there is no lie when it comes to that!"
Senior,4,"I only took a few courses online through Harding, as online school is not my thing. But the classes that I did take were conducted well and the teachers were very responsive to any questions or concerns I had."
Freshman,4,"I prefer being in the classroom, but the online experience is good. The professors record, or do live lectures and we are always able to contact them if we need help on anything. The professors also try to respond to all questions promptly."
Sophomore,4,Teachers were very good about adapting to the material and the needs of the students. They made sure they had office hours available in a way that is convenient for people even in different time zones
Sophomore,4,Harding professors were very willing to do whatever it takes to help you to get the material and to understand the material. Whether that means sending out powerpoints or meeting by zoom one on one.
Sophomore,4,Harding University is a great Christian college full of wonderful professors who try to help you grow as a christian and as a person.
Freshman,4,"I mean I like Harding University, I would not really change anything about it. Although if I had to change something It would be the fact that there is a curfew."
Sophomore,4,Harding University is a school that genuinely cares about the students. The community is what makes Harding such a special place. The professors are kind and genuine in their concern for their students.
Alum,4,"Harding is a wonderful university! I really enjoyed my time there. It is by no means perfect but the administration, faculty and staff are always growing and learning to make the school the best it can be. I did not realize the level of academic challenge Harding provides until I entered graduate school. Leaving Harding will prepare you to enter your desired work force or postgradaute pursuits. WARNING: THIS IS NOT A PARTY SCHOOL. The school will remove you for certain handbook violations."
Senior,4,"Overall, I have had a very good experience my first three years at Harding.  I've loved the good community and well equipped staff of teachers that I have had.  I am surrounded by intelligent people who love the Lord and are headed to the same mission of making students better.  There are a few rules that I hope to see improved in the future.  However, I am pleased with my journey and school experience."
Sophomore,4,Harding University is a private christian college with a very positive atmosphere and a small town feel.  The professors care about their students and want them to succeed. Harding offers many opportunities for students to study abroad. The university president interacts daily with students making everyone feel welcome.
Niche User,4,I have been impressed with the assistance that Harding University has given me during my application to be a part of their school. The flexibility and availability of the staff has been a huge asset to me.
Niche User,4,"Grew up in the area with my father as a professor there, loved every opportunity to sit in during classes, college games, and plays/musicals. Everything about the Harding experience is worth it."
Senior,4,"Science classes are hard but will prepare you good for Medical related fields. The rules are strict, so defiantly look at those before attending."
Alum,4,"I loved my time at Harding, however there were some problems I had with policies due to its religious nature, as well as its lack of diversity."
Graduate Student,4,Great Christian environment. Very strict on program rules. Instructors are very approachable and most will work with you if you have an issue.
Freshman,4,"Beautiful campus, small classes, friendly professors who want you to see you succeed, great community on campus. However, the community that surrounds the campus is a poor, small town with some things to do, but not much as a big and busy city. The cafeteria is certainly not the best if you are used to really good meals at home, but it's still food."
Freshman,4,"Great for people who are Church of Christ. Daily chapel and bible classes. Even for people who are not Christians or not Church of Christ, it's still a great school for academics, sports, and community."
Sophomore,4,The policies regarding not allowing other Christian denominations to work specific jobs. I also want to see some radical bible professors out. No need for them to stir up trouble and bad feelings.
Freshman,4,"It's pretty good. Lots of Christian encouragement and stuff, but some of the rules are pretty dumb. It's certainly not for everyone, and the food is mediocre at best."
Junior,4,"I'm still currently at Harding University.  I loved it from the moment I went to Bison Days.  When I found my friend group, that was when it got even better.  I love my social club, and I love the campus.  There are things that can be improved, like parking.  The parking at Harding is the worst."
Graduate Student,4,"Harding university is a great school that creates a good atmosphere for learning. The teachers here are professionals in their field of interest and most of them have an open door policy. Class sizes are small which makes for a great learnimg environment. The city is fairly small and there is not much to do here, but it does help you focus on what is important (education)."
Sophomore,4,The small community is fun and it's easy to get to know everyone. It feels like going to school at church camp. There are rules and restrictions but they are easy to follow. The surrounding local area doesn't have much but most kids drive the 45 minutes to Little Rock on the weekends. The teachers care and there are always activities to be involved in. The dorms are on campus and the ones built for upper class men resemble small apartments with kitchens and living rooms. Food isn't too bad and neither is the weather.
Junior,4,"If you're going for a party scene and easy A's, this is the wrong school for you. The school is a private Christian university, so drinking, illegal drugs and premarital sex are right out the window. Everyone has to be in their dorms by midnight on weekdays, 1 am on weekends. Chapel is required, no coed dorms, and if you leave to stay elsewhere, you have to sign out and let everyone know where you'll be, including parents."
Freshman,4,"Harding is a beautiful community of mission-minded people with a dedication to their spirituality and education. When people say ""It's great to be at Harding!""..they mean it."
Freshman,4,"I like the Christian atmosphere, with a family-oriented community. The student body is unified and welcoming. The campus is beautiful, and you are able to form deep connections with the people you are surrounded by."
Sophomore,4,"Harding University is a small, private-Christian university. It's home to students the come from inside and outside of the bible belt. If you want college experience full go structure the it is a go to college."
Freshman,4,"Harding University is a great place for higher level education! The community is fantastic and the campus is stellar; especially for a smaller university. With being a smaller school we have smaller size classes which results in a more personalized experiences with each of your professors. Searcy is a small town; however, it is growing tremendously and there are many things to do that are fun with friends!"
Senior,4,"I've had a generally great experience here at Harding! The small-town environment was perfect for me to get my feet wet in the real world and it helped my grow socially, personally, and spiritually. I would highly recommend Harding to anyone looking for a great education and a great campus."
Freshman,4,I love being at Harding.  Social clubs do an okay job at replacing greek life. The people here are really great. I wish it was easier to live off campus.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Harding University has been a good one with many more memories to come.  The campus atmosphere is a great one with everyone smiling to others as you by, lots of activities to attend, and helpful teachers assisting you along the way. The academics are challenging and equip you for life. The campus is really safe and the dorms make sure of that. The local area is a small town so you can help out in the community. While the campus food could be better in the caf, the stu options are good. I am on the soccer team and it has become my family."
Senior,4,"Harding is a great place to spend your college years. The president, professors, staff, and students create an atmosphere that is so welcoming to all who step onto the campus. Even though there are obviously groups of different people who naturally draw together, as you will see anywhere you go, the student body sticks together through school-wide sorrows and celebrations. Since it is a Christian school, most professors try to incorporate the faith into their lectures. Not only does this give a different insight to the subject matter, but it also helps the professors seem more approachable. There are many opportunities to get involved in something around campus: band, sports, clubs, devos, etc. Harding offers multiple ways to meet people and grow in yourself."
Junior,4,The professors honestly do want to get to know you and will invite you for dinner at with their families.
College Sophomore,4,"They have varsity sports as well as club sports and intermurals, so if you want to play a sport it's really easy!"
College Sophomore,4,The professors are great. Some have devotionals at their house every Wednesday and that is how you get connected to them.
College Sophomore,4,Most students are able to find a job right after graduation and internships are highly encouraged.
College Sophomore,4,The campus has multiple 911 stations in case a student was in trouble and needed to call the ambulance.
College Sophomore,4,Harding has an absolute wonderful campus. Te campus looks like a winter wonderland throughout the month of December.
College Sophomore,4,"This topic overall was great. I haven't had much experience with this, but I know for a fact its great."
College Sophomore,4,"The housing on campus was great.The only downside to living in the dorms was the pranks that went on, and uncleanliness."
College Sophomore,4,"I love being at Harding. It's a great place, but not for everyone. I have met a lot of cool people, and I would choose this place over and over."
College Senior,4,It is really great to live on campus and bond with other girls in your dorm but I wouldn't suggest it after a few years. It is too expensive to be required to pay for the residence hall and a meal plan.
College Senior,4,There is a large amount of school spirit during sporting events. These events are great for students that are on the teams and for those attending. It has become a community activity for everyone to come support the teams.
College Freshman,4,I have not been in an actual college course but sitting in one was quite enjoyable.
College Freshman,4,"When I visited the campus they had little cars driving around at night to secure the safety of the students, which is what I liked about that."
College Freshman,4,"Staying in the dorms is a great experience, fun and a great way to spend time with your dorm buddy, and get to know others in the dorm."
College Freshman,4,"I have not experienced being on the campus as a real college student, but based upon my visit it was fun and encouraging to do a good job in college."
College Junior,4,"From others reviews it's a nice place to stay. Personally, I live off campus."
College Freshman,4,Public Safety does a great job of keeping campus safe.
College Freshman,4,Harding has a very high percentage of students that graduate with a job and I feel it won't be difficult for me to find one.
College Freshman,4,"The professors really care about you, and teach the classes well. I also really like the class sizes, they're nice and small."
College Freshman,4,"It was a really nice environment to live in, the dorm I lived in was kind of old, but still functional, however not very spacious."
College Freshman,4,"They're great, the intramural and club sports are really great. They also have good athletic facilitates that are open to non-athletes."
College Freshman,4,"I love my CLUB. We don't have Frats or Sorts. The deans watch over the club and make sure we're in line. If you like to party, I wouldn't recommend this greek life for you."
College Freshman,4,"Health and safety is relatively good. There are still some places you probably don't want to walk by yourself at night, but I think that is probably true of anywhere."
College Freshman,4,"Housing is obviously one of the most expensive things on campus. However, most of the dorms are very nice. I stayed in Sears Dorm my freshman year. It was really nice, most of the time quiet, and very easy to live in. The only downside is that it is the farthest away from everything besides Starbucks."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is different at Harding. We don't have actual fraternities and sororities, but we have social clubs whose main goal is to grow closer to God together. We also have club sports, functions, and Spring Sing that are at the heart of social clubs."
College Freshman,4,"Harding has one of the best ""pep squads"" in the country. The Rhodes Rowdies are the craziest."
College Freshman,4,Harding puts a lot of effort into their sporting programs. The facilities are very nice and are always being updated.
College Sophomore,4,The campus is very safe with public safety keeping a watch over the campus
College Sophomore,4,The cost of living at this university is kept at a reasonable cost for all students. The amount of options available for students is vast
Junior,2,My professors literally don't know how to work a computer it has been terrible. My professor have made zero effort to reach out during the pandemic.
Freshman,2,"FOR CHRISTIAN PARENTS the bible classes are sub par at best, churchian if you now the word, politically correct, PRO TRANS PEOPLE. (its my 2nd semester)
yes you read that right i am a current student that sat in a freshman bible class for a lesson on tolerance for there trans friends.
.told us to forget our past teachers
.use my bible 
.promotes theological questions, lets the students fumble, then moves on without answering the questions
. history was kinda milk toast"
College Freshman,2,No greek life. Just social clubs
College Sophomore,2,"Most restaraunts in Searcy close at 9 o'clock or earlier. Only a select few stay open later than that. Many, however, offer student discounts, even at fast food places."
College Sophomore,2,"I transferred to this college and they only offered one scholarship for transfer students. I had a 3.0 GPA so I received 2,000 for the year. That's it. I don't have my parents to help me out and it was a huge hassle trying to pay for my college education. The only other aid I received was grants and student loans, but even the student loans weren't enough to cover everything. It has just been a huge headache with financial aid here and the office hasn't been the best of help to me."
College Freshman,2,There are not a lot of huge parties represented on campus
College Freshman,2,"You pretty much have to live on campus till you're 22 or get married first. usually marriage is before then anyways, so just do that."
College Freshman,2,"Not much to choose from that gives student discounts. There are the same boring places like chilis, firehouse sub, etc

Many go to a cool quaint little Alaskan dumpling place that has live music"
College Senior,2,The campus is absolutely beautiful but once you get off campus the people and atmosphere are bland.
College Sophomore,2,"Curfew is such a killjoy, hence the rating. 

Dress code.... Which I actually appreciate because I don't want to see crop tops and booty shorts everywhere I go. 

I hate the fact that you are REQUIRED to take bible classes every semester, waste of money I don't really have in my opinion. I rather spend that tuition money on classes that count towards my major."
College Sophomore,2,We sign a contract when we attend Harding that gives us strict and specific rules that we must follow and if not there are disciplinarian actions.
College Freshman,2,"there are no sidewalks, city buses, no taxis, trolleys, etc..."
College Freshman,2,The rules to obtain off campus housing make it hard to get approval and the town being small make options limited if a larger number of incoming seniors want off campus than graduated seniors.
College Freshman,2,Financial aid is less than most other schools. The threshold to receive aid is substantially lower than at other schools.
College Freshman,2,The school provides golf carts driven by public safety employees during nights and you can call public safety to request a golf cart or ride in the car if you're injured or don't want to walk alone.
College Freshman,2,It's not as bad as an extremely crowded city but the tickets and fines happen almost immediately if you're in the wrong spot. People have gotten tickets from running an assignment to a teachers office in less than 10 minutes. There's not any good parking close to the dorms so there's always walking involved.
College Freshman,2,"There are 3 sonics, a taco bell, waffle house, and ihop that stay open 24 hours. Everything else closes between 9 and 11 each night."
College Freshman,2,"We really don't have anything other than Public Safety but they normally don't take you places unless you have to have it. 

At night there are golf carts that drive around to pick up people that are walking back to their dorms, normally after 9 o'clock."
College Sophomore,2,Not a good experience so far
College Junior,2,It is kind of a sketchy environment surrounding the school.
College Junior,2,They have lots of rules
College Sophomore,2,"Good Academics, Some friendly people but completely isolated and no major opportunities for International Students like Internships ...."
College Sophomore,2,The food is pretty bad and no variety
College Student,2,Arkansas weather is somewhat bipolar. Make sure you take an umbrella just in case! 
College Sophomore,2,"Harding's food options are quite limited. Though the dining hall choices have improved slightly this year, the repetition of the same foods becomes quite boring after a few months. The town itself has quite a few restaurants, mostly fast food, but several sit down chain restaurants as well. It is a small town, so considering the size it is decent. In addition, Little Rock is not very far away and provides much more variety in their dining options. As far as value goes, it is clearly a college town as most restaurants have a value menu/lower priced options. You are required to have a meal plan if you live on campus, but that can also be used in the student center. My recommendation would be to get the lowest amount of cafeteria swipes and the highest amount of DCB for your meal plan as this will allow you to eat at the restaurants in the student center more often."
College Junior,2,"-- VERY strict curfew (for all years)

-- NO alcohol (EVER) or smoking (on campus)

-- Getting pregnant will get you kicked out

-- Guys and girls can't swim together

-- Parking tickets are given without mercy, even though the parking is abysmal

--  Shorts aren't allowed during classes (even when it's murder° out)

-- When there's guys and girls in the same dorm room- ""both feet on the ground"" + ""doors open"" (seriously, or else they'll kick the opposite sex from the dorm)

++ The campus police are VERY helpful and have always been glad to assist me"
College Sophomore,2,I haven't been able to get as many scholarships as I've needed.
College Sophomore,2,"Harding is far too expensive to live on campus. And they make it nearly impossible for you to live off campus unless you're 23 or married. The dorms are far too strict. I understand the need to keep things clean, but we're not even allowed to light candles or have a pet fish!"
College Junior,2,"There's a bowling alley and an indoor climbing wall but most activities are outside.  That's fine if it weren't for the fact that it's crazy cold in the winter and blazing hot in the summer.  Shopping is limited to JC Penney's and Walmart with a couple of exceptional boutique stores.  Grocery shopping is limited as well. Cultural events are limited to on-campus with a some church events.  But you mostly have to travel to Little Rock (approx. 1 hr drive) for better food options, shopping and culture."
College Junior,2,"They dont have a huge selection of food on the dining area, though the have few restaurant in the common area that we xan go and buy some food from them. For me personally, i dont like the variety that they have in the dining area. It ok, but is not my type of food that i am used to eat."
College Freshman,2,There are golf carts at night but none during day.
College Junior,2,"White County may be the meth capital of the world, and drug deals (weed) may go on in the Walmart parking lot, but if you get caught then you're immediately expelled"
College Junior,2,This is not a college town. You have almost no options and it's a dry county.
College Sophomore,2,"had a problem in the beginning with car problems. Even though I thought I had straightened the problem out, I kept getting parking tickets."
College Junior,2,The meal plans are too expensive and nobody ever uses the whole thing. Options are slowly dwindling.
College Freshman,2,The computers are limited and block so many websites that I need to succeed. There are barely any computer labs. Printing is free..yay! Good network reliability and good speed. AWFUL wireless access..terrible!! You've gotta have a personal computer to get any work done..hours are awful in the labs!
Recent Alumnus,2,"Too Many Students, Not Enough Parking. If you don't have a car, you better hope you live on campus or close to it, because there is no way you're getting to class on time. Parking is a nightmare; the school doesn't limit how many students can bring cars. That being said, with the ever-increasing amount of students that are being accepted, there is never enough parking on campus. If there is a parking spot, it's sure to be far from your class!"
College Senior,2,"Could Be Better – Campus is an okay size, but very limited access, especially at night. HORRIBLE work out space, limited pool hours,etc"
College Freshman,2,"Sometimes Safe, but Unsatisfied – There was a recent mugging on my dorm's street, and things have been stolen out of nearby cars. Also, my car was involved in a hit and run in the parking lot, and Public Safety did nothing to find out who inflicted the damage."
College Freshman,2,"Social Life – Don't expect to get to spend too much time with the girls.  Guys are not allowed to go up to the girls' rooms at all.  In addition, there is no dancing allowed at Harding, unless it is choreographed."
Alum,1,"While attending Harding University, I attempted to take one online class during the summer semester, however I was denied this because I was currently enrolled as a full-time, undergraduate student and was not given the privilege of being able to take online classes. These courses were for graduate students only."
Niche User,1,"Full of Haters, White Privilege, control Searcy, all in the name of God. Which last I knew God is Love. Not hate. Hate is from the dark powers opposing God."
Niche User,1,What a joke for a university. Just an excuse to spread hate and cause division. Shouldn't even exist with its White privilege.
Freshman,1,"Individuality is suppressed here. If you aren't a believer, or if you think outside the box its highly frowned upon. There is no opportunity for growth outside of your religious life. The rules make you feel like you're being babysat all the time. If somehow someone likes your uniqueness, they exploit it. Like only including the Black Student Association in any announcements during the month of February."
Junior,1,"Harding University is a university that has too many rules for you to become an adult and mature the way you should in college. Harding takes away your free will not only while you're on campus but off-campus as well. While you are a student there they have rules and control over you and if you break one of the rules you get expelled from the university. Their motto is ""Community of Mission"" but all the students are too busy trying to get each other expelled from the university for anyone to have the ""community of mission"" mentality."
Junior,1,Students will be treated differently if they are not church of Christ and LGBTQ+ students will be bullied for sure. Spoken from experience. A lot of entitled people in clubs are rude and prejudiced. They will hurt you.
Alum,1,"Their ""break one rule and you're out"" policy is in direct conflict with the mercy and compassion Jesus taught. 
I would rather see HU offer help before kicking someone out. Go to the rule violator and say, ""This violates our rules and we can't accept this happening again. However, we also know that humans make mistakes and we want to help in any way that we can. What can we do to help you make sure this doesn't happen again?"" In this way, you hold the student accountable, but you also demonstrate mercy and compassion.
The adulterous woman in John 8 was about to be stoned because she had ""broken a rule."" Jesus COULD have said, ""I forgive you but there are still consequences"" or ""If I show you mercy, I have to show everyone mercy. So, what’s the point of having laws?""
HU administration needs a more compassionate and merciful side. In the real world, people struggle, Christians make mistakes and Harding sets a terrible example when it comes to how we respond to those who make mistakes."
College Senior,1,We don't actually have Greek life on campus so I don't know why I'm required to answer this.
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek life here at Harding University.
College Sophomore,1,"Harding is probably the most strict university I have every heard of. You can get kicked out for being pregnant without being married. Even if you live off campus you cannot have members of the opposite sex in your home or apartment. You have to get off campus housing ""approved"" by the university. You can't wear shorts to class. Even if you are of age, you can get kicked out for use of tobacco and alcohol."
College Sophomore,1,"Harding University is in a dry county and you can get kicked out of school here if you are caught with alcohol, even if you are of legal age. This school is extremely strict so it is very dangerous to party in town."
College Sophomore,1,Harding is not a party school unless you count hiking or nights in the dorm with a few close friends watching Netflix.
College Freshman,1,"What party scene? that's all I have to say

Hanging out in the dorm lobby is our idea of partying"
College Senior,1,Seems like you're always being watched...
College Senior,1,There is nothing open other than fast food after 10PM.
College Freshman,1,"no nightife curfew is at 12am, 1am FRI/SAT"
College Freshman,1,Undeclared students all have the same advisor who sends out an email each semester saying there's too many of us for him to meet with us individually so we receive no guidance or help in choosing classes or deciding on a degree path. The nursing and science programs here are very competitive and challenging but the other departments can be gone through without too much effort.
College Freshman,1,There's nothing that sets Harding apart from other schools as far as facilities go. It's a small town with not much to do and the buildings aren't state of the art or anything like that.
College Sophomore,1,"If you want a school to party at, do not come to Harding. Here we come to school for a Christian Education and do not allow that kind of behavior."
College Freshman,1,Because of curfew no one can go anywhere after midnight on weekdays or 1am on weekends. You can't interact with friends in different dorms. It's a dry county so no bar/club scene whatsoever. I don't think many people use public transportation besides locals. The nightlife consists of hanging out in friends rooms in the dorm.
College Freshman,1,There are pretty much no attractions and the few normally appeal to people who are used to southern/country activities.
College Freshman,1,I'm from Florida so I hate everything about the weather here. It snows/sleets/ice rains during the winter.
College Freshman,1,The rules are taken to the extreme meaning even activities that aren't illegal (drinking after the age of 21 or staying in a hotel room with the opposite gender) are completely policed and punishable.
College Sophomore,1,"The cafeteria is not very good unless you like pizza and French fries every day. There are other options, but they are usually either under- or over-cooked, and they tend to have strange, unexpected seasonings. There is nothing whole grain anywhere, but the omelets are good and relatively healthy. The Stu is a good option. We have Chick-Fil-A and Taco Bell, which are both great. There are other restaurants if you want burgers, coffee, or Chinese food. The most annoying thing is that you have to have a meal plan, even though there aren't really any healthy choices."
College Sophomore,1,"The food is awful at Harding! The cafeteria has very poor food choices, not many places to sit, and the service is horrible! I rate the food options at Harding as an F because it is truly unacceptable"
College Sophomore,1,There aren't very good facilities. There isn't anything that truly makes it stand out from other schools. maybe better and newer facilities would do so!
College Sophomore,1,"They are strict on curfew rules and drug use, they take the policies seriously"
College Junior,1,"The school is in a dry county, which means there is not alcohol distributed, thus no bars or clubs."
College Freshman,1,"Drug use on campus is next to nonexistent, however every once in awhile one will here word of light experimentation with tobacco products."
College Junior,1,"We don't have Greek life. Harding has ""social clubs"" and it's extremely restrictive."
College Sophomore,1,"Not many people at Harding use drugs. But this isn't to say they aren't present. People use them, but they just don't tell anybody."
College Freshman,1,"It's boring. The life on the weekend is awful.  I go home every weekend.  The RA's aren't cool.  The classes are for the most part good.  But Chapel and bible class are extreme burden every day.  If you miss chapel too many times they can make you fail all your classes.  Unless you're looking for a prison to go to school, I wouldn't reccommend it.  Too many rules for an adult."
College Freshman,1,"It's Harsh – I say it's discrimination, but they call it they're christian rules. No sex before marriage, no hanging with the opposite sex for that matter, no cleavage for women, no profanity, no drinking, drugs, partying etc. you're kicked out so fast if your caught doing those things. If you even have a child like me, you are not allowed to stay in the dorms, even if your a freshman and out of state, you have to, and let me repeat this loud and clear HAVE TO STAY ON A OFF CAMPUS APARTMENT WITH NO MEAL PLAN AND PAY FOR IT YOURSELF IF YOUR FINACIAL AID CAN'T. You also got to go to church and can't miss a certain amount of days. It's crazy strict, but you applied and pay for the school so you got to deal with it. it's not their problem but yours, so yeah...."
College Freshman,1,"Very Harsh and Restrictive Enviroment – Harding is, like I said, a private Christian school. This means that there are a lot more rules and restrictions that there are at state schools. Due to their status as a Christian environment, I do believe they have the right to be this strict."
College Student,1,"The town is so small there are no public buses or taxis. If you want to get around town and don't have a car, you need to get a ride from a friend. Thankfully, many people on campus, if not most, have cars. You could also bike to some places in town, but most places you need to go would mean riding along traffic-y streets, though there are sidewalks."
College Senior,1,"It's Not Even Real! Since Harding is a private university, the Greek life is not allowed to share national ties. Their solution: come up with knock-off fraternities/sororities and call them ""social clubs"" and then let said clubs dominate intramural sports and the whole social atmosphere. There is no Greek housing anywhere! And if you were to say your club's name to a friend at a state-school, they would look at you funny. (Secret: Harding ""Greek Life"" is a JOKE!)"
College Senior,1,"You Will Get Kicked Out – If they find out that you went to a club or went anywhere with alcohol you will get kicked out of school. Better to stay away from that, or go to a different school."
College Senior,1,"Upperclassmen Dorm Options – The thing that I hate about this school is the fact that girls have to be seniors to live off-campus. The prices of dorm rooms are high, so you are forced to pay the steep prices until you are a senior."
College Sophomore,1,"You Can Find What You Want, but Have to Search for It – The faculty is SUPER STRICT! But if your not dumb about it, there are definitely people who party and you can definitely find drinking, it's just more underground. Just DO NOT get caught."
College Sophomore,1,Parking is almost impossible at Harding! The lots close to the dorms are always full and you usually have to park far away and walk back to your dorm. Times when we have visitors it's even worse because every spot on campus fills up. They need more parking lots!

Freshman,5,"This university advertises itself as a private university with a public mission, dedicated to improving the health disparities faced by under-served communities. When I first visited, I knew that they stayed true to their cause. As a historically Black, Latino, and Asian university, the diversity on this campus is like nothing I have ever experienced. They made me feel at home and made me feel that I can truly do my best and fulfill by dream of having a career in forensics. Their devotion to helping undeserved communities by providing resources to teach and train more students in the healthcare sector is something that is important to me as someone who has had many health issues."

The campus is extremely small, and it’s something that I enjoyed being here. The hospital, which is across the street is my place for food lol. There’s politics where ever you go, and instead of getting myself involved in drama, and things I had no control over I went to class, and then I dipped. Overall you’ll meet and make lasting friendships with some dope people."

The class size is small enough to be submerged in conceptual academia while able to give an opinion and be truly heard. There is always some health related event on campus allowing students to be well aware of new breakthroughs, or changes before setting foot in a medical setting.

Senior,1,"This school was a major disappointment. They care very little for their students. I have one semester left of school and cannot afford it. Instead of giving me options, I was told that helping me find aid was not their job. Funny, since the people I was in contact with worked in the financial aid office. I want to finish at a community college, but cannot because they refuse to release my official transcripts. I do not mind setting up a payment plan, but they want the money upfront. I told the head of the financial aid department that I would be stuck with loans and no degree. I was told again that that was not their problem."

Sophomore,5,"Hesston is a great place if your looking more into going to college in a small town. Everyone is so friendly no matter who you are. Hesston was my best decision I’ve made and I learned so much. I also made a lot of friends from other countries because we are a international school, so I’ve learned a lot about different countries. The one thing I would change about Hesston is the cafeteria food, have them switch it up, instead of eating the same thing every week."

A home of great diversity, with students from across the country and around the world. The professors are always available and there are so main opportunities to seek help if needed.

They really care about producing great nurses and do really great work! "

College Junior,4,"It is a very great school and has very informative classes. I feel as if the program does need some organization help, but eventually every one figured everything out!"
College Senior,4,"Most of the classes I have taken have less than 25 students in them. In fact, one of my classes that I took only had 7 students. This allows for frequent teacher/student interaction."

College Senior,4,"Supportive friends, faculty and staff. they're ready to help and listen to you anytime"
College Sophomore,4,"My favorite experience at Hesston College was the community activities, meeting new people, and the feeling of always being welcomed. What is unique about my school is that the professor to student ratio is excellent and every one of the staff cares about you as a student and as a person. I would choose Hesston because they challenge students academically and it's another place you can call home."
College Senior,4,"A lot of resources, easily accessible"
College Junior,4,"The recruiting team calls many students and people from all around the world, so it's very hard to not be involved with little diversity in the school."
College Junior,4,"You don't necessarily get to decide what time your classes are, but it's possible to have a flexible schedule regarding your major, and college requirements to graduate. When I transferred my speech communication class over to Hesston, it was able to be counted for credit easily, and can be easily transferred to other schools."
College Junior,4,"My favorite experiences are interacting with other students, and having fun participating the events. The atmosphere, and how this college/community can bring people together, the diversity is very unique. I would choose my school all over again, because Hesston really is a great place to start, and will.may take you farther than you could imagine."
College Junior,4,"The professor's are really flexible. Average class size is about 12:1 student ratio, or some classes 20:1, but some have more regarding class type. Most classes are more laid-back, and flexible. Variety of the professor's offer at least 2 or 3 courses to teach."
College Junior,4,"A typical student, is hard-working, makes good grades, friendly, and fun. The student body is very diverse, Hesston's recruitment team tries to make sure of that.

If you come to Hesston college with an undecided major, Hesston College will help you find your strengths and interests to help you help make the right decision in choosing a major, and deciding what to do with your life in general. Hesston provides many on-campus jobs, which all students planning to attend or currently attending Hesston can apply for."
College Junior,4,"Well the program is great! I assume all the programs are great for any major here or great place to come and get general studies out of the way. The workload isn't always bad, but it can get pretty heavy, there is often writing in all if not most classes. Faculty and staff try to make sure the students are having fun learning and engaging in and outside the classroom."
College Junior,4,"The professors really show they care about the students by becoming more engaged with students one on one. Our advisors make the class registration process easier and faster, it isn't too complicated. The workload is somewhat heavy, or usually heavy but the professors want to give us our money's worth education, and actually ask for student feedback to see how they can improve as instructors."
College Junior,4,"Students receive a lot of help from faculty and staff, they really do care about the students."

College Senior,4,"It is a private school, so it is fairly expensive; however, they offer very good scholarships to students."
College Senior,4,The library is small but does a good job of getting what I need.  The library also subscribes to a lot of helpful databases.
College Junior,4,"There is plenty of diversity in terms of religion, political affiliation, and ethnicity despite being a Mennonite college, but it's not so strong in sexuality or economic standing. Although I can't speak for every student, the level of acceptance is high in terms of even those not well represented. The nursing and pastoral ministries programs are usually the only programs who have non-traditional students (older), but the typical student, is upper-middle class, Christian (although not Mennonite), white, and here for sports."
College Junior,4,"Everything here is great. Registration is easy and it's required that you register with your academic adviser so nothing goes wrong. There was a class that was already full when I tried to enroll, but they had no problem changing the class size to a bigger one to accommodate (although I wasn't the only one who needed in). The academics are sometimes not challenging enough for me (but that's obviously a personal opinion). All teachers give you their office, home, and cell numbers as well as their emails to contact them whenever, and the school is small enough that there's personal contact with them instead of a TA."
College Senior,4,There is planty of help for those who need it. You just have to ask.
College Senior,4,"I love this college. It has great community, and the teachers really care."
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone at Hesston College are very close and friendly and also very helpful to newcomers, which I believe from first hand experience this is not always the case with other schools. Also the faculity are always helpful and get things done for you in a record speed!"
College Sophomore,4,Computer labs are very good but I do not agree with having to pay to print out pages for assignments I think that should be included in tuition.
College Senior,4,"Hesston Colleget facilities are very helpful to students in their every day life. Education being the major thing, labs are ailable for students are open anytime during the day time to provide computers for the students."
College Senior,4,"Hesston College has a diverse student body. Even if it's not a distributed kind of diversity, it does contribute to the multicultural awareness of students. The students consist of individuals from different backgrounds of education and life experiences."
College Senior,4,"Since Hesston College is all about starting college carees of students, it's flexible in that we can start out by taking classes that will help us persue our majors."
College Senior,4,I am an elementary education major. Classes are great for theory. Sometimes I wonder about practicality but then realize the classes are just theory. It is really helpful to know the ideas behind why teachers teach the way they do and how students learn. The professors also are extremely helpful in finding area schools where I can observe classrooms or tutor.
College Senior,4,Professors are great about helping you out if you are struggling. There are also many study groups and tutors that help with classes. Classes are set in a way that challenge your thinking and make you find what you believe.
College Junior,4,Students at this college are very easy to get along with. Even though many of us all come from different backgrounds we still come together and can enjoy each others company. The main religion on campus is Christian although there is almost every other type of religion here.
College Junior,4,I think the education I am paying for is well worth it. The professors are very helpful and will work with you as long as you seek this help. Being a smaller college you get much more personal attention when it comes to classes.
College Senior,4,"Its resources are available to students however again depends on what kind of student. International students, when it comes to scholarship have less resources."
College Senior,4,"I have only taken a few online test at Hesston and no online classes but from what I hear from my friends, it's easy and you find help from your teachers."
College Senior,4,"The process of applying for financial aid at Hesston College is fairly easy. You will find people who will help you find the aid you need based on what kind of student you are. The only thing is it's not the same for everybody. For international students, athletic and musical scholarships are rare. And aid based on academic merit is limited."
College Junior,4,Academic Focus – My school would transfer in any college credits you would receive from high school which I knew from there they were really focused on the students receiving good education. I love how they do work around your schedule if you have conflicts with a job or for me they would work around my athletic schedule. There focus is on the students education and what is going to help them succeed.
Sophomore,2,I love my teachers. However the business side of things needs some serious improvement. I've had financial and scheduling issues with this school since the beginning. The administration doesn't communicate very well and questions aren't really ever answered.
Alum,1,"The people that go and work here are great. The facilities are improving.

However they are quite behind when it comes to technology. I went here in 2012  for CS and they were teaching ~2 years behind in regards to content. The teach was not a CS but someone from the aviation department who 'could' teach in this degree.

After transferring to Seattle, 1 credit carried over due to their outdated teaching.

If you're going for Nursing or Aviation it's more than worth it, if you're going for literally anything else, it's not."

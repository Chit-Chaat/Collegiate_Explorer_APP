Freshman,5,The online summer program has been a challenge for a returning student but all the staff at the college have been very helpful and understanding with all my questions. they really do give all the information needed for you to be graduate.
Freshman,5,"With covid 19 we are not having in class, classes at this time. everything has been online. It has been a struggle as the systems are new to me. That being said I have reached out to my instructors and they have all been willing to help me learn the system and how to work the sites correctly. They have been willing to help via zoom meetings, text, and emails."
Sophomore,5,I love my college because it is small and personal. It allows me to develop a better relationship with my professors and other students. Most of  us there are in the nursing program so we all relate on what we are going through and how to help each other.
Freshman,5,This is my first semester and so far I love it! Smaller classrooms so feels more one on one which is how I learn best.
Freshman,5,I like the college and wouldnt change anything. overall the college is very good because the staff is willing to work with you in every way to give you the best experience they can offer you.
College Sophomore,5,"If I had to do it all over again, I would choose this school. The teachers are great and the academics are top notch. My school is unique in the sense that it is a school completely devoted to my major, nursing. All classes center around applying the information we are learning to healthcare."
College Senior,5,"This school has the most helpful staff and caring instructors. They help you through the process of enrolling, and beginning classes and the instructors make sure you understand the curriculum and help you to succeed."
College Junior,5,Most students are non traditional. This school promotes people to come back to school after  having career experience. The school offers a variety of classes and the students are excited to learn. The small class structure allows for tight not student body. There is diverse group of students between gender and and ethnicity. There is never racial discrimination that I have found in my personal experience. The classes are very professional.

Junior,4,"Class times offered are flexible and offer day, evening, and weekend options for the working student."
College Junior,4,The hands on training you get I the labs as well as at the hospitals is great!

College Senior,4,We have resources available to prepare for nursing boards.
College Senior,4,Our school is healthcare geared.
College Junior,4,"Our college offers extern programs through the hospital. This allows for job opportunity when you are done with schooling. Also, this college offers a RN to MSN program."

College Junior,4,A large majority of our students are white and anywhere between ages 19-55.
College Junior,4,I really enjoy this institutions staff to work with you to get you where you need to be
College Junior,4,This institution is a little bit more expensive than others because it is a private. They do not have a rent option through the school for books which adds to the expense that is not necessarily affordable. Apply for scholarships!
College Junior,4,The academic counselor and professors work with your life schedule and want to provide the students with the best information.
College Junior,4,This Institution is in partnership with a local hospital offering several positions to graduated students.
College Junior,4,Most of the staff is enthusiastic and ready to help the students with anything

College Sophomore,4,It has been convenient in the fact that I have changed a lab to a different day so that I do not lose as many hours at work

College Sophomore,4,They have multiple computer rooms available. Not a lot of privacy.
College Junior,2,"The College only offers a limited number of majors. If you decide you don't like what you are doing, you aren't able to just pick and up change majors."
College Junior,2,"With our school being so small, we have little resources."
Niche User,1,"The school could care less if you succeed,  Jill Stroud will talk to you like you're a piece of garbage & Leon Book will do the same. The only instructor who's intelligent & cares is Dr. Brackett. The school also was paid by the government for all my schooling after they kicked me out for no legitimate reason,  so they are defrauding the government & not a professional school whatsoever. I wouldn't recommend this school to a dead rat."
College Senior,1,They don't guarantee helping you find work after graduation .
College Senior,1,I was kicked out of the program for a non legitimate reason & I wouldn't recommend attending this school because you will regret it.
College Senior,1,"Not flexible at all, don't try to help all they are worried about is getting your money ."
College Senior,1,The website only works half the time & when u email the instructor for help they take days to reply with help & it's usually after the deadline for the assignment .
College Senior,1,The only professor who acts professional & actually knows what she's teaching is Dr. Brockett. The classroom experience at SECNHS is very intimidating they have favorites & won't spend time to help. The only person there that wants you to succeed us Dr. Brockett.
College Senior,1,"All of the professors as well as employees do not behave in a professional manner. Jill Stroud, Rhonda Vandergriff, Debbie Howey, Mrs. Moses, & Leon Book treated me horribly & very disrespectful. Also, Jill Stroud pulled me into a room & talked to me like I was a dog. Margie Schwent claimed I Was never a student there & the college is paid up until next spring by my FAFSA , they are falsley getting my government loans when I haven't attended there since August."
College Senior,1,"The financial aid officer has no clue what is going on, she is often wrong and confused about what is going on."

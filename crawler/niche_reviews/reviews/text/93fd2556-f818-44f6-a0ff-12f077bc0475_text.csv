Sophomore,5,"I loved everything about Wilberforce, although it’s far From home it’s just like being home.

This University has molded me into a bright light that will shine, through any and every dark day the world has to offer.

Sophomore,5,I Love All My Professors. They Are Amazing. I Love How Small The Campus Is And I Love That I Have A Family Here!
Freshman,5,"I am a first-year college student and my overall experience at Wilberforce University is amazing. I enjoy the school very much. The professors are really hands-on with the students and really take the time to work with each student. I enjoy the fact that campus is really small and the classes being small because I get to have a closer relationship with my professors. Since I have been there I have gotten the opportunity to have better relationships with the majority of my professors. Academic wise I understand the criteria really well.  Athletics overall is great. I am living comfortably in the housing, I am always safe, Campus food is alright it could be better but no complaints and student life is great. I enjoy seeing different people from different areas and getting to know them."
Sophomore,5,"Wilberforce University may be out dated, but the history is there! Walking through the halls I just feel the connection with the students who first attended when Wilberforce University first opened back in 1856 and the historical power behind it, it makes he feel empowered like I hold my head high when I speak about it, People will ask me ""What school donyoy attend"" and I say ""Wilberforce University "" and they give me a look and I respond to that by saying ""what? My school was the first historical black private university in America, where do you attend?"" Many many amazing black icons have attended Wilberforce and have made an impact on the world and I plan on doing the same, Bulldog Until I die!!"
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at My University was wonderful, everything is free spirited, full of joy and comfort. My University is quite diverse and ver welcoming to all it shares its support and love with. Im grateful to be such a scholar that has a very high standard University that has my back."
College Senior,5,"Students have high career goals at my Historically Black College/University! This degree will be more important than any other one from any other institution, especially with a masters behind it."
College Senior,5,Professors are very passionate and helpful
College Senior,5,The school is very resourceful
College Senior,5,Staff and professor are caring
College Freshman,5,everyone shows respect and the upper classmen and  staff are very welcoming.
College Junior,5,Parking is great here. there are many parking spots
College Junior,5,Greek life affects the social atmosphere on campus because they take part in most of the campus activities. Greeks also put on most of campus activities and festivities.
College Freshman,5,"It's great. Everything can be accessed almost all day long. The printing is free, the wifi is good and the personal need for a computer or printer is not needed."
Recent Alumnus,5,The Climb program is an non traditional program designed to help students 25 years and older achieve academic goals while catering to an adult life schedule. I achieved my degree in about 18 months.
College Junior,5,"I have always had a car since Ive been in college. But i am always willing to taking freshman and returning students in town or where ever else they needed to go. There is also a van that takes students in-town, to the mall, Walmart, airport, bus station etc."
College Freshman,5,Wilberforce is not a very big school but everyone at Wilberforce is so loving. They make you feel safe and a part of a big loving family. Its a wonderful school that helps you become successful.
Senior,4,"I would say this experience has been all over the place one moment we are headed in the right direction, the next we are on the verge of closing."
Senior,4,"Wilberforce university is a good school but with and school there always room for improvement. The Professor are great ! 
The dorms are not. The students life is awesome! There is always something to do at the WU."
Senior,4,Wilberforce University is like a big happy family.  The atmosphere there is just like home and I would not change it at all.
Junior,4,"I would like to see more up campus activities and more upperclassmen involvement.  I would for there to be more clubs available and more teachers involved with students and their majors. I would like for there to be more sports for students to participate in.  besides those few things, i enjoyed my experience here so far and thankful for the connections that I have made."
Junior,4,"I like how Wilberforce University is very family-oriented. For instance, everyone whose enrolled there are very nice and they tend to help the other students with whatever they need. This help range by just giving someone a ride somewhere to helping them with their homework. Above all, this university prides itself on unity and inclusion."
Freshman,4,Wilberforce University is an excellent establishment. I have been there two semesters and seen the hard work and dedication they put into thier careers as well as our futures. The have a great organizational system from classrooms to school activities. I can truly and honestly say that I love my HBCU. #WU
Senior,4,"What I love about Wilberforce is the community of students we have, the whole campus is like a family. I also enjoy the teacher who really become like family, who not only help you academically, but personally when you feel like you have no one to talk to. One thing I would like to see, is more activities, as a school we should do more things together especially since the university is small."
Alum,4,"Love the overall encouragement of the faculty and staff.  Employment placement lacking. Unfortunately, many employers are not canvassing New graduates. You more than likely have to invest in Graduate studies in order to afford standard living. However, if your already connected with an employer in an established firm you will excel."
Sophomore,4,"I, all and all, have enjoyed the experiences and memories that I
 have come to acquired and made over the course of me attending this university in the last two year. This school has a positive vibe within the school campus, the faculty along with the student body operate as a family. Most importantly, people enjoy attending and indulging themselves within this intuition. Nevertheless, this university has major room for improvement in regards of campus life ranging all the way to student life. In any case, my stay at Wilberforce has allowed me to grow beyond imagine. I honestly can say I am a better version of myself prior to attending Wilberforce University."
Freshman,4,"I like the fact that we're able to communicate with are professors without them being to busy. I would like for the organization to change, in my opinion this school is very unorganized."
Senior,4,Based off my own personal experience with Wilberforce University I can truly say its been a constant improvement in the 3 going on 4 years I have been  there not only is it the first historical HBCU but a great one at that and very family orientated vibe and campus life to go along with its good academics.
Freshman,4,I loved almost just about everything at wilberforce it was like a family environment all my teachers cared all the staff cared made me feel at home i would just like to see a change in food in the cafe
Freshman,4,"What I like the most about Wilberforce University is that it's a small university.  Being that I have been in small private schools my whole life, I wanted to attend a university with that same feel.  The professors are easy to relate with and they show you how much they care about you by checking on you and making sure you are striving to do your best.  The students are easy to get along with as well."
Sophomore,4,"Wilberforce is a HBCU,  which means a HISTROCAIL Black College. The school its self is small but the education is amazing. The teacher's really do care about you and want to see you gradate.  The staff is very friendly for the most part, you will have your view who aren't but that is everywhere. The sport's well there isn't that mean but I would love to see more and hopefully more things to do on campus. Even though it is a small school it does come with it Task. One of those task is you will have to stay on top of things such as your Finical Aid, scholarship's and Homework."
College Senior,4,"Campus police are friendly, easy to get a hold of, and does a good job at doing whats best for students."
College Senior,4,"Wilberforce University allows students to become ambitious, driven, and motivated more than ever before by black greatness!"
College Senior,4,"Most students that participate in sports or events are highly supported by friends and student body, also the athletic facilities are good for students and athletes."
College Senior,4,Instructors take time to allows students to get to know them without being so closed off. Instructors make it comfortable for students to speak with one another by breaking the ice the first day of class and so forth.
College Junior,4,we havent had any issues yet
College Junior,4,i couldn't think of anywhere else to be
College Junior,4,i feel like we need more equipments
College Freshman,4,The athletics need work but were in transition so I believe soon enough our team will be good.
College Junior,4,This school has a lot of connections in the business and job market post graduating. The alumni really do give back to the University and do give many job offering to students.
College Junior,4,"I am just transferring to this institution, but have met some great alumni and current students that have had only great things to say about it. Coming from the school I was at originally, the campus and environmental is completely different and the atmosphere as welcoming."
College Sophomore,4,Wilberforce isn't all that bad . You can't go there and expect the best because they are not the best but you can go there and make great friends and receive a good education . Also professors are always willing to help you with anything you need .
College Freshman,4,They keep you busy and you can receive knowledgeable information about the campus and history of Wilberforce University
College Freshman,4,To visit someone on campus you have to give your student ID or state ID and tell them where you will be going
College Freshman,4,Everything at the school is pretty decent. No problems with the computers and the printers and if so the technology man is there to assist you. The wifi signal is very weak.
College Junior,4,It's easy to get around due to open family environment the campus share
College Junior,4,Not very appealing to the student body
College Sophomore,4,"Life on Campus – The student life at Wilberforce University is very great, and helpful. everyone on campus is friendly and everything is easy to locate. There is always something exciting to take advantage of on the campus, which makes it very difficult to become bored. The school receives an A because it has a wonderful student life on campus, the only concern is the life outside of campus. the outside environment of campus isn't that exciting, and it is difficult to find fun outside of the campus."
College Senior,4,"Always There When You Need a Shoulder to Lean on. I decided to go to Wilberforce University because it was highly recommended by my mentor Rev. Donald H. Jordan, Sr. for its cirriculum, special programs for  working adults which would allow us go to school in the evening and still have time for family.  The workload was very doable and not overbearing.  The choices of degree programs is structured not only for new freshmen students, but for persons from all walks of life.  A historical aspect is that Wilberforce University the oldest HBCU (Historical Black Colleges &amp; Universities) west of the Allegheny Mountains. I have always wanted to attend a HBCU just like my dad and the majority of my professors.  Look how well they turned out."
College Senior,4,"Profs Truly Care About the Success of Every Student. I am in a junior in Organizational Managment cirriculum, and I have learned what it takes to effectively be an integral part of an organization.  How to utilize my education in areas of human resources, statistical data, sociology, adult human behavior, etc..The majority of my professors are from the Cincinnati area and we share stories, laughter, sometimes we attend the same church.  My professors are all successful in their own right, from heads of state, to doctors, lawyers, President's of colleges and judges.  This lets me know that they had mentors in their lives to make sure they stayed on track and I know they have already shown me how to network, prepare a professional resume for each individual job, and how to never forget how important volunteerism is to our communities and neighborhoods."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, I absolutely enjoy attending Wilberforce University because of it's rich history as the first private Historically Black College and the atmosphere that fills the campus. I've learned so much in just my freshman year. I've learned about life and how to become more responsible and I've learned about school subjects and how to become a better student. Overall, I love Wilberforce University!!"
College Freshman,4,Greek life at Wilberforce is interesting. Each greek host events which involves the entire school. There isn't different views on non-Greeks and Greeks. They're just organizations to the non-Greeks.
College Freshman,4,The parking on campus is acceptable. There are always places to park and no problems.
College Senior,4,Wonderful dining experience by staff that appreciate the diverse collegiate population.
College Freshman,4,"Never a need to worry when it comes to computers, Wilberforce has more then one computer lab. The library on campus is also a great place to go,for computer usage but if you don't feel like going to the lab or library free WiFi is also offered throughout the campus. If you don't have a printer no need to fret Wilberforce has it covered giving up to 500 free print outs."
College Freshman,4,"The facilities here at Wilberforce University are good but could be better. They are what the students make of them. The Union is a place of life,worship, and appreciation. It is used by everyone; students and faculty. The Union is an asset to trhe school that really shows the potential of the University. Educational as well as fun activites are held there, and are always greatly supported by us all."
College Freshman,4,Buses Are the Only Option – My school offers transportation if you pay for it. If you don't own a car or license chances are the school transportation is the best way to go.
Sophomore,2,This university needs help recently I transfeeed because I was not sure safety.It need help from staff all the way down to the buildings and education.I would not recommend this college to any student.Barely any sports not a real college experience.
College Senior,2,"The year i attended this school was the year the school was not being remodeled or anyone really cared about anything. There might have been a couple of times were authority was properly taken place but living wise, dont think i would ever want to go back if the school was not remodeled."
College Senior,2,classes arent offered when they should be
College Sophomore,2,We only have two campuses now because the other dorms are filled with mold
College Sophomore,2,They try a be strict but a lot of things are gotten away with
College Sophomore,2,Safety and health? what is that? do we really have it?
College Sophomore,2,We have room advisors (RA) who try to stop students from drinking and smoking but it still happens
College Sophomore,2,The weather changes a lot and I get sick often
College Freshman,2,student health center is the worst by far. The nurse be clueless and the doctor is never there. I hate that the school is charging for health fees and the health center doesn't have all the supplies they need. Many students have go to the local urgent care because the doctor isn't present.
College Freshman,2,public transportation comes through the campus. but our school offers student transportation for no cost or just reasonable depending on where you want to go.
College Freshman,2,Finding housing near campus is very hard. the school is not very helpful. especially with the student with children. The cost is average but the process is very rough. Many landlords doesn't work with the students.
College Freshman,2,The Greek life is poor at the school. You really don't see them doing much on campus as other big colleges. Need more involvement with the students.
College Junior,2,These items are a must in a school it's what help create a positive environment 
College Junior,2,Need a lot of work done 
College Junior,2,"Very poor and the time frame is off because if u miss the last meal at $pm then you have to wait till 7am the following morning ,or if you want to spend your own money after hours"
College Junior,2,The food is not healthy at all. They put too much salt on things. There is no variety at all. They make the same meals every week.
College Junior,2,The only athletics we do have are basketball and they are threatening to shut down the teams. I have never heard of a university not having a football team.
College Junior,2,"Most majors do not have the funding they need, and aren't taught by the proper professors"
College Junior,2,"Off campus housing doesn't go through the school exactly. We fill out the form and go look for our own place to stay and inform the school of the location. The cost is cheap, right now i live in a 3 bedroom apartment with 2 other roommates and our rent is $165 between the 3 of us. That's very good because in my city where I'm from a 3 bedroom is 700 and up,"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Parking on campus depends on the weather and the events.  If it's a regular day and you arrive early, your guaranteed a parking space.  If there are events on campus or the weather is bad, then the parking is terrible.  You may have to park across the street in those instances."
Freshman,1,"To be honest I don’t know why this school is accredited. This school is beyond terrible, it is literal hell. I’m a freshman in college, and I already have a bad view of it. First off I’m living in a hotel(at the Ramada Inn in Xenia, Ohio) I should be on campus. The internet here sucks!!! How am I supposed to get my work done? The service here sucks too.They give us dirty sheets, the toilets are nasty, and there are centipedes and earwigs here. They treat us like we don’t know anything, like we’re stupid. The school is literal trash. The classes ceilings have mold, we have old boxed TVs. Ran down chalk boards, They don’t have a  bookstore, the computers in the library are all out of order, the computer labs printer is always out of paper or ink. This school teaches at a high-school level. Transportation sucks for people who don’t have cars too. TO BE HONEST THIS SCHOOL IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE."
College Senior,1,The people move so slow and aren't very much help
College Sophomore,1,There is only fast food near Wilberforce . Nothing healthy of worth the money we pay to eat .
College Sophomore,1,There is only one sport at Wilberforce and it's basketball and they don't receive anything ...  they have to volunteer at kings island just to get new warm up suits and uniforms.
College Sophomore,1,"Really poor, we have some hard classes but not really."
College Sophomore,1,It is an HBCU so it's not diverse at all.
College Junior,1,All last semester we were paying for medical insurance but the health center wasn't even open one day. They were also giving us expired medicine. This semester the health building is open but they have been mixing up students release forms. I don't even know how that is possible. So students are being prescribed with things they don't even have.
College Junior,1,"I received my financial aid but it was a complete hassle. I had to constantly go into the financial aid office and make sure there wasn't anything missing. They took for ever to pay my tuition. The financial aid workers had attitudes. They kept telling me my money was lost somewhere and when i asked how they replied ""we don't know."" Then I asked them what all scholarships I could apply for and they only told me the UNCF scholarship. They were basically no help. I still haven't received my OCOG grant as well."
College Junior,1,Only Male and Female Basketball are really in the forefront
College Junior,1,"BAD WI-FI, SLOW CONNECTION, LACK OF PAPER IN PRINTERS, SLOW RESPONSE TO PROBLEMS CONCERNING NETWORK IN HALLS."
College Junior,1,MOLD ARE IN THE HALLS AND OLD PIPES IN THE HALL BATHROOMS
College Junior,1,"Student Life on campus at Wilberforce University is not very good. The school does very little activities for students the dining is very poor, the housing is worst, and the campus is small. The thing that makes us stay at Wilberforce is there is staff here that care and will go the extra mile to help and make sure you succeed in receiving your. Also you meet people from all over the United States at Wilberforce, there are more out of state students than there are in state. Last the people that you meet and become friends with is what makes you stay here. Even the school doesn't offer alot to the students, we are all family it feels like. One thing you do learn is ""Life is what you make it""."
College Junior,1,Not Great – Its safe to say that this school needs to go under some serious renovations.
College Freshman,1,Snow Is Hectic – The weather here is a trip. the sun will be shining one day and the next minute it'll be raining. I haven't seen snow yet but it's definitely on it's way.
College Junior,1,"Slim to None – We don't have many sports at all. We only have basketball, cross country, and golf. Our varsity sports teams in these sports aren't very good collectively."

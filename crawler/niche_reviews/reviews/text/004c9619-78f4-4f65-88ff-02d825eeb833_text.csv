Sophomore,5,So far working being able to contact the professors has been really easy and they have been responsive and helpful when it comes to working with them.

Senior,5,I absolutely love the involvement of instructors and various choices of organizations to become a part of. Every member of the faculty is always helpful and supportive of my future endeavors.
Senior,5,I have taken several courses online for Cleveland State University. Professors are great at communication and want nothing but the best for each student.
Sophomore,5,"Very inclusive for all students. They don't cheap out on certain items or areas so they care about their image and their students. Being an engineering student, you can always find help in your academics. It's in the heart of Cleveland so there is something to do around campus."
Junior,5,I think CSU has handled the transition into online classes very well. The teachers have adjusted very quickly for students and for that I am very grateful. The university has also give us such great resources that the transition does not feel so overwhelming.
Junior,5,I have loved going to CSU for the past couple years and I hope to continue going next semester. My federal pell grant has run out and I am not sure if I can afford to keep going. I really love the school and I hope to complete my Bachelor's Degree in Business.
Sophomore,5,"School is very affordable that offers great quality of education, great diversity and lots of opportunities. Sports teams are good, clubs and organizations gives students a chance to expand their network and most professors cares about its students. Definitely recommend going to this school!"
Sophomore,5,Professors were more understanding and appreciates student’s work. Taught students well and great learning platform that helps students understand material easier. Love it!
Sophomore,5,I overall love CSU. The campus is beautiful and is in the heart of downtown Cleveland so there is always something to do! The rec center is gorgeous and offers so many cool classes not just work out equipment! They also have an olympic swimming pool that you can use when the swim team isn't practicing. The dorms are also really beautiful and have good safety protocols. The academics are great as well! I feel like I've learned so much in classes especially because of the engaged learning promise! I recommend CSU to anyone looking for a great on campus or commuter experience! There is something for everyone and it's a great experience!
Freshman,5,I have not  taken any online courses at Cleveland State University. I cannot attest to the quality of online learning that one would get.
Junior,5,"I am a new student so I have little experience in this school. So far, I feel like I made the right choice. Even in these tough times all of the staff is super helpful with introducing us to the school."
Junior,5,I love being so close to home and all of the resources CSU has to offer its students. The teachers are very supportive and the pre-professional advisors do an amazing job being realistic and preparing us for the real world.
Junior,5,I chose to take a few online courses over the summer. My professors were sure to stay in contact weekly and were also readily available to help us if needed.
Alum,5,"Beautiful school. Wonderful professors who care about their students and want them to learn. Easy commute from home to the school. Pretty affordable, and classes are in depth and interactive, very safe campus and I truly am grateful I got to receive my undergraduate degree from Cleveland State University."
Graduate Student,5,"CSU was the school I dreamed about as a kid. I was the first to go to college and it loomed large in a little inner city kid's eyes. My experience there was mostly wonderful, academically I couldn't have asked for more. The professors in my chosen field were top notch. Any issues I've ever had was administrative in nature which isn't uncommon in higher learning."
Senior,5,"Trandfering from Baldwin Wallace to Tri-C to Cleveland State, I feel like it was the best fit for me. Advisors were very helpful in helping me finish my college plan. No one gave me the run around or had me taking unnecessary classes. I had really the best time here!"
Senior,5,My online experience at Cleveland State was a lot better than when I took some classes at Tri-C. I feel like they actually cared and made things very easy by helping so much. Lessons were easy to follow and I could always email a teacher and get a fast answer.
Senior,5,"Online learning was great- the professors were very flexible and on top of it all. All my professors understood how hard the transition was and made every effort to make sure that we wouldn’t fall just because of the outside circumstances. Every class used a different program- BB collaborate, Zoom, Panopto- but all were easy to use."
Sophomore,5,"I love CSU, the professors are fantastic and the curriculum is great! The party’s suck but Kent is close so most students go to Kent parties or have mini ones with a few friends. Walks through downtown are fun and there are tons of great food spots to explore off campus."
Junior,5,I like the university because it is convenient and close to where I commute to work. The students really love the atmosphere as well.
Sophomore,5,"CSU has a very interactive, hands-on learning and provides first-year students with the skills and knowledge to be a successful college student. The campus is wonderful and the faculty is extremely student-oriented."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Cleveland State University. It definitely feels like home to me and I have met some of the best people there. I was very nervous on the first day because I did not know what it was going to be like in Cleveland. However, I fall in love with Cleveland more and more each day. Safety for the students and faculty is their top priority, along with engaged learning. The professors, advisors, and staff are amazing and so understanding. They answer emails very fast with a great response to all of your questions. Student life is amazing with so many activities to do. There are so many options for free food as well and the dining hall is not too bad! I will never forget my college experience and I am so glad to call Cleveland State University my home!"
Junior,5,I am an active current student at Cleveland State University. I am working on an Psychology degree program.
Freshman,5,What I like the most is the environment. The professors help you succeed in their classes and they are very friendly.
Niche User,5,"Cleveland State University is a beautiful campus weaved into a major city, and although staying within Cleveland may produce fears, the campus makes you feel individual, not cramped. The personnel are very pleasant, and all of my questions have been answered quickly and with dedication! The University even sends me opportunities and gifts through the mail to remind me of my acceptance into their community. I highly recommend Cleveland State!"
Niche User,5,As I finish my first semester as a freshman with a 4.0 I am very happy with the experience and comfort that CSU has allowed me for settling into college life and am glad I chose CSU
Freshman,5,Close to Home. The school continues to Grow to prepare me for my career.Being a 1st yr student very impressed by the Atmosphere of this college and the push of all the teachers to make my dreams come true
Alum,5,"Cleveland State University offers a wide variety of programs for you to choose from. CSU is located in Downtown Cleveland. CSU has ample housing, restaurants and easily accessible to the suburbs and flats."
Freshman,5,"Cleveland State University is like home. It has helped me to get out of my comfort zone and to improve my social skills. Proffesors are really nice and very professional. Cleveland State has very  interesting classes and some can even be seen as fun. Not to mention, the area is very safe and there is a lot of near places where you can study, eat, or just rest. The library is amazing, there are a lot of people that can help you, tons of computers if you need one, and printers. Every corner in the library is different, there are quiet places where you can study and group places where you can talk and study at the same time. Also, CSU has inner tunnels, you don't have to walk in the cold! 
CSU is amazing without a doubt."
Freshman,5,"Cleveland State University is a great college. The campus size is perfect, not too big, nut also not too small. It is located in a great area with many attractions near by, there is always something to do. There is an Innerlink that connects all of the buildings so you do not have to go outside, which is really nice with the crazy Ohio weather."
Niche User,5,"I am a dual-enrolled student through College Credit Plus. I have taken 7 courses there so far and the school supplies enough resources that, should a student encounter a bad professor, there are plenty of resources available to be utilized for academic excellence."
Freshman,5,I have been at Cleveland State University for a few months now and I absolutely love it here.  Cleveland Sate has so many great opportunities and ways to get involved for everyone in the school.  The atmosphere is so including and makes sure that everyone has a place in which they belong.  They offer a great education and prepare you for the future.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love CSU, I love the atmosphere and how diverse the campus is. CSU has numerous opportunities that students can be involved in, over the summer I was involved in a program called TRIO for first generation college students. I was able to meet new people that all had something in common with me and it was very helpful to get to know other students and the campus before I had even started college. CSU also has resources to help students if they are struggling in any classes or just need some extra help. Campus safety is taken very seriously at Cleveland State, about everywhere that students go there are people that look out for each other. The local area around CSU is amazing I love how I can just walk a few blocks and I will be in downtown Cleveland, there are a great amount of places to eat and have fun with friends while in the area. My first year of college is definitely what I had expected it to be and more."
Freshman,5,The professors are great; they strive to help you succeed. Many different activities around campus. Various parking areas. Good food. And plenty of exercise around the campus.
Junior,5,"I love the atmosphere of the campus! It is located in downtown Cleveland, which is very different from my previous schools. The student body is very diverse and is from various cities in and out of Ohio."
Freshman,5,"Cleveland State has been a new experience for me as someone who never grew up in a big city, it was terrifying at first but I soon found comfort within the campus! Everyone’s kind of doing their own thing and figuring things out, so theres little to no discrimination because they get that you’re just like them."
Sophomore,5,"My first year at Cleveland State University like many other freshmen, I was scared and nervous about what this school will bring. That quickly went away when when i meet some friends and gained connections with the teachers. The first day of school I will never forget, they were handing out muffins and donuts to all the students.  When i first started school I was afraid that I would not fit in, I would be too stressed and I would not have time to have fun and focus on my mental health, that quickly changed when I saw how open and friendly this campus is, as well as how caring and passionate the teachers are for everyone to succeed. My experience at on campus shaped me to become the best person I am, I love Cleveland State University."
Freshman,5,"The university staff and faculty are all very friendly, great food and public transport systems around campus. The interlink that connects all the buildings together is very convenient. A huge amount of resources like free tutoring and academic success plans and advising."
Senior,5,"Cleveland State University has given me the guidance and confidence I have always needed to push myself though schooling. I enjoy the professors, guidance, and overall staff at CSU."
Sophomore,5,"Cleveland State is an amazing university. Some majors have better opportunities compared to other universities. There is such a diverse community at Cleveland State. Plus, it is affordable."
Senior,5,Very friendly college. Lots of opportunities to get ahead. Supportive professors are ready to help you succeed. Would recommend other students to go there.
Sophomore,5,"I have met so many new friends here at Cleveland state University. I got into their Nursing program, so I am very excited to start my Nursing classes."
Sophomore,5,"Got in, no problem. Was not made aware of the Honors Program until after I began going here. Look into it, its a great opportunity that I regret missing out on."
Sophomore,5,I like CSU. I wish there was more diversity. Also wish there was more to do in student life. The professors are ok. the resources are great.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus, professors and students! Everyone is so kind and welcoming, there is always something new to do every single day!"
Senior,5,Been here an extra 2 years and it feels just as good as it started. The student body is very passionate and accepting of those around them. Very supportive and it's like one big family.
Freshman,5,Cleveland State is an outstanding college with a truly beautiful campus. The Innerlink is very convenient for getting to class in Ohio’s not-so-lovely weather. The professors and administration at CSU care about their students and push them to be their best. I am 100% proud to claim that I am a Cleveland State Viking. I currently feel as though I’m being properly prepared for a career in the FBI with CSU’s criminology degree.
Junior,5,I like that you get A+ education. The pofressors are knowledge and helpful. The campus is amazing and it continues to expand and upgrade it facilities.
Niche User,5,Cleveland State is such a great school. It is a great school for being a commuter school. Classes transfer easily. There is so much to do around campus and in the area. Not to mention the campus is very nice.
Junior,5,"I have just transferred to Cleveland State University, and I'm thoroughly impressed with the campus, academics, and activities. For an education that is a fraction of the cost of other universities you are given so much more than the rest. With a diverse campus and hundreds of organizations you can find a lot to do. Professors want to engage with students and do a lot to inform students of activities on campus and possible internships and job offers. Since it is a commuter school and has a lot of space there are many areas to study and socialize if you wish. I can not recommend CSU enough. Go Vikes!!!"
Freshman,5,"There was a lot that I loved about Cleveland State and some small things that were not too good. The dining hall food could be way better, it is always the same food rotated through out the week and it can get boring. The classes are all intriguing and I have learned so much from my first year here. Living on campus my first year was a great decision, because I was able to meet so many new people."
Niche User,5,Cleveland State University has a diverse campus with a lot of great things to offer. There are many opportunities within the Cleveland area that corporate with Cleveland State University so it is a great place to get your life started. Cleveland State has great professors and students who are always friendly and willing to help. The university is a great place to be with a great environment.
Niche User,5,"When I visited Cleveland State University I fell in love instantly. I enjoyed how most of the buildings are linked together so students are able to feel safe. The environment felt perfect, I felt safe and like I was at ""home."" I think Cleveland State University is the perfect fit for me!"
Sophomore,5,I love the Vikings! The campus and the education are excellent. I love driving to downtown Cleveland and seeing the beautiful city. The campus is huge and the classrooms are very comfortable. Every single teacher I had at CSU has been very helpful and did more than what was expected from them. Almost everything about the school is fantastic. The only thing I would change about it is how far away it is from my home. I am still willing to drive an hour in rush hour traffic to go to this amazing school.
Freshman,5,I am an incoming freshman for 2019-2020 year. I am interested in a degree in Business. I am also a soccer athlete. The business school is one of the best in universities across the US.  I also  love the women's  athletics soccer program. I am hoping to get a chance to be part of their soccer program.
Sophomore,5,I have had great experience studying at Cleveland State University because it is diverse and it has really friendly environment. It is not super expensive and I think most of the student will be able to afford to study in this college.
Freshman,5,"I'm thrilled more and more every day at how much I find myself loving this school. Cleveland State is outstanding where it counts. Professors are considerate and emphasize the importance of life application in education. You'll find a large range of levels of student motivation at every school, but, from what I've seen, the people who are here and who stick around are the ones who are working their way for school and who really want to be here. Students who care get involved and get involved a lot. There's ALWAYS some kind of campus activity going on- everyone talks about the fact. And that's to say nothing of the city surrounding the school. Originally, I planned on being a commuter student, but I love going here so much that I'm working to save enough to live on campus next year. I highly recommend Cleveland State to those who want to be surrounded by high-quality professors, high energy people and events, and peers who are working hard for what they want. You'll love it here."
Niche User,5,Cleveland State is the perfect school to get a taste of a big city and great academic opportunities.
Alum,5,I had my bachelor's of science in health science degree from Cleveland State University. I had some great memories and great experiences while at CSU. The professors were super kind and supportive and my guidance counselor was extremely helpful as well.
Freshman,4,I currently have 4 out of my 5 classes online and overall my professors are handling it pretty well. They make sure to be online at the time our class is scheduled. I believe they can work on giving out more group work so we can talk with each other instead of independent work.
Freshman,4,I like the atmosphere that is provided for the students. The professors are very helpful and are always looking out for the students. One thing that can be improved upon is the exchange between students. Although with the current circumstances people are not allowed to get close to each other I still believe there should be more opportunities for students to get to know their classmates.
Graduate Student,4,"Overall good school. Safety on campus is biggest concern, but have never had an issue. Professors in my program are great."
Sophomore,4,"I had 3 online classes before the pandemic and all were very well done. There was plenty of information given and prompt communication to make sure there was no confusion. I do wish there were more lectures for some of the classes though. We had mandatory lectures during the pandemic and I feel like I learned more when lectures were mandatory rather than optional. That's just my personal opinion though. If you don't have a way to get down to campus and still want to take CSU courses, online courses are definitely a good option."
Freshman,4,"Cleveland State provides a good overall experience. This is a commuter school so the party life is dry, but there are quite a lot of things to do in Cleveland. I enjoy the professors and I feel that most of them are good at their jobs"
Junior,4,This is my first semester taking online classes and I heard some pretty good things about the professors and the classes.
Sophomore,4,"My first year was a little rocky, but through that time I had my grad coach and my math teacher to help me out. When I had teachers that just weren't right for me, or help to make a schedule fit with my job hours, my grad coach was there. Or when I needed jus tf a little more time to finis hbk the math class my teacher was there. And there was always some event going on on campus such as, something to show middle eastern culture, a drag show, or a religious person talking talking on a speaker in the quad. So my overall review would be fun and helpful."
Junior,4,"The school is nice and the classes are good. However, it is a commuter school, and student life there is not the best. The school does what it can to make things fun given that the population of people that live on campus is only a small fraction of the total student body. So overall the only problem I have with the school is that it has been disappointing compared to the expectations students have about college life. the school is very nice though and very affordable compared to other universities around the state of Ohio as well as the country. Overall a good place to further one's education."
Alum,4,"I didn’t take any online courses through Cleveland State. However, I have had friends who have taken classes via online, and they really enjoyed it. They said that their professors got back to them right away about any questions/concerns they may have. It was more flexible for them because of work, etc."
Senior,4,"CSU is a great school for a quality education not far from home. It’s inexpensive, but the school is constantly renovating (new science labs, etc). They have a great premedical office, a pretty nice campus with interesting activities (goat yoga guys!). A big negative is cleanliness though. Although most of the school is nice, the seats in the hallways often have trash in the crevices, and some of the bathrooms sometimes look neglected. I like the professors and the relaxed atmosphere though."
Junior,4,The experience that I have had so far has been exceptional and overall great. The professors are very knowledgeable and helpful when you need them and they always encourage us to fulfill our potentials further.
Sophomore,4,I like the campus and all Cleveland State has to offer. They are always having gatherings to promote different groups or clubs at Csu and offer giveaways.
Senior,4,"Cleveland State University's location is convenient. So, commuting there is not that bad. Also, in the area there are places to dine in or to go. However, the parking passes are pretty pricey and finding parking is rough sometimes. There are staff that are very passionate about what they teach and they really do care for their students. Even though the courses there are at higher levels, the professors make sure you know the material well."
Senior,4,"Cleveland State is a very decent school. It feels less competitive than other schools, while also offering a good education."
Junior,4,"Cleveland State University is decent. They're not the best, but they do provide a decent education and faculty is very helpful."
Senior,4,Overall a good experience although the surrounding area could have better venues for college students.
Sophomore,4,"I have loved Cleveland State University since 7th grade when I decided I was going to attend. Cleveland State has become a second home to me. I enjoy the campus, the professors- for the most part, and I enjoy the diversity. If I were to change anything on the campus, I would change the advisers. From my experience, they are not offering the same experience to all their students."
Niche User,4,From my personal experience with Cleveland State University I have met many people and started friendships before I have even started my classes! The professors I have met are all nice and very welcoming!
Freshman,4,Overall Cleveland State University is a very well rounded campus from the small one on one classes to the concerts at the Wolstein Center there is a little bit of everything to do at Cleveland State University.
Freshman,4,"I like how Cleveland State University has so many faculty members to help you with internships, shadowing, anything you can honestly think of. They want you to succeed in your academics and also in life, as well. They are involved so much with their students."
Alum,4,"I am an alumnus of Cleveland State University. I started there the fall after I graduated high school. I lived on campus in the newer dorms and loved it. My freshman and sophomore year I stayed in a private room. My third year I was an RA. I like the culture on campus but my dream was to go to a larger university. I don't count that against CSU though. They have numerous campus engagement activities for both commuters and on campus residents. The food on campus is pretty good and for the size of the campus there are quite a few options. Downtown Cleveland is changing a lot which affects campus but overall it is a great university. And there are a lot of great professors, advisors, and TA's there."
Freshman,4,There's always something fun to do on campus at least once per week! The staff wants the best for their students and they are super helpful. Living on campus is also a great experience here because the rooms are quite nice for dorms. I feel safe living here at Cleveland State University even though it's downtown because the safety programs here are on top of their game and there are options out there for your safety. The only thing I have to complain about living here on campus is how expensive the parking is!
Graduate Student,4,It was great being in downtown Cleveland but it is a commuter school so on campus there isn’t much to do on weekends.
Senior,4,"The only thing that could change is the required textbooks; I would love to see some regulation. Some professors elect to have no text or a cheaper text, which is excellent. However, many professors choose expensive books. My texts for this semester cost $450 from third party vendors. 
Aside from that, the professors are fair, knowledgeable, and they care about students. The campus has a lot to offer because of the location, tuition includes a bus pass, tutoring is available, and the university has a writing and math lab."
Junior,4,Overall Cleveland State is a great University.  Their geography building needs updated and cleaned up.
Junior,4,"I have been going to Cleveland State for 5 years now and my overall opinion is it is a great school to attend. The school has been fixing and creating a more fun and accessible school which is a great opportunity for many people who live near Cleveland, Ohio. The more time you spend at the school the more you will fall in love with it and grow as a young student."
Freshman,4,"Cleveland State is one of my favorite places to be. There is so much to do both on campus and off campus. The campus atmosphere is quiet, and completly different from the city life surrounding the campus. No matter what day, time or season there is also something to do and new friends to find."
Junior,4,"I like that Cleveland State University has a campus that is modern with many commodities. I also like that all of the buildings are connected through a a walkway. Cleveland State also has a nice library and it is easy to find academic articles through the library website. The university also has many teachers that are great at teaching, but they also have a few who are subpar. I think that some of the teachers could change the way they teach the material. I have had classes where the teachers were not clear on their expectations and the way they taught the material was confusing and hard to understand."
Niche User,4,CSU is a beautiful campus and it is very diverse. CSU could increase in the safety area but this of course depends on the people as well.
Sophomore,4,Cleveland State University is a great school with professors that want to see you succeed. There are some problematic professors who are stuck in their ways and teach things faster or teach things in a more difficult way than it needs to be taught.
Sophomore,4,"I like the small classroom setting and how most classes are in the same building, i would add more outlets to the large lecture halls because if a computer dies then the student is missing out."
Freshman,4,"Overall, this is a really good school with nice and helpful professors.  My first year has been good so far.  It is very diverse and it's a place where one can feel safe."
Sophomore,4,"Cleveland State University has an excellent campus, one feature is the inner link system which is extremely convenient and helpful. This university has great professors, incredible diversity and provides you with a great engaged educational experience!"
Freshman,4,It’s in the middle of the downtown Cleveland so the energy is great! Cleveland is a very diverse and active city so there is always something to get into
Junior,4,I love it overall just not as live as I would like. I like the opportunities I have from being at cleveland state. I feel like it will help me as a further my educational carreer!
Graduate Student,4,"One of the best decisions I ever made in my life was to go to college and I am equally as happy that I went to Cleveland State. To me, this college helped to expand my mind and develop my viewpoints of not just education, but also how I saw the world around me and myself at the time. I had the opportunity to live on campus at the now gone (but never forgotten) Viking Hall, I remember when Main Classroom did not have the updated computer lab, and I remember spending my nights eating Rascal House pizza while studying through the noise of Peabody's nightclub. CSU will always have a place of positivity, growth and opportunity in my heart. Go Vikings!"
Sophomore,4,"CSU isn't too bad! Tuition is manageable, especially if you've received any GPA related scholarships (easy to get, but watch maintaining them). Living downtown is ok, I'd recommend an apartment over the dorms available (prices are about the same). It's for sure a commuter school, so take advantage of the events to connect with other students. Professors/ academics are average. You'll have to put a lot into it to get a lot out of it."
Sophomore,4,"I've been attending Cleveland State for 2 years, The professor's are good and they offer large amount of programs and activities. I feel like they need more focus on sports teams to bring more student involvement. The city is our campus and there are plenty of food places surrounding the campus and inside the main campus building. The University is good overall and has a good atmosphere."
Junior,4,"Cleveland State University is overall a good college to attend. Cleveland State University is downtown, the academics is good and they have good classes to take. I am a business major student. At first, once you take your first business course, it will be seem pretty hard and you are going to make mistakes, but eventually you will find the light and classes may get easier, it all depends on you. The people, the classmates are pretty nice and nonjudgmental from my perspective. Some professors can be mean, but there are some really great professors at CSU. The business major students are overall friendly, easy to chat with ( at least 70%). I finished my 2nd year and the fourth semester is the toughest semester to conquer. The college experience is awesome because in a sense you feel free and on your own and its diverse which is a great thing , seeing different people. There are people that are there for you if it gets stressful."
Graduate Student,4,"Cleveland State University is a progressive learning institution that values its students. There are always on-campus and networking events which foster a general sense of community. In terms of academia, CSU has solid program offering, however many of the courses teach outdated information. There are also many tenured professors that have structured their courses in the same way for decades, refusing to adjust changes in students' learning needs and behaviors. Some courses use materials from nearly two decades ago, which causes students to question the value of their investment. Academic advisors are not always best suited to guide students through a cost-effective path to graduation. A lack of communication between department chairpersons and academic advisor results in mishaps like students missing opportunities to take courses that are only offered once annually and having to wait an entire academic year to graduate."
Freshman,4,"Cleveland State is a diverse, and exciting college that is full of different opportunities to explore. Students have almost every imaginable resource provided for them to succeed in their selected majors."
Sophomore,4,"College life at Cleveland State University has been a great learning  experience. I have grown as a person, I am more independent and proud of what I have done so far. My career path is in healthcare and Cleveland State is preparing me for a bright future.  After completing my first year at Cleveland State I feel more confident in myself and I'm ready for the next semester of learning to begin. I am excited to continue on my educational experience and plan to use what I have learned so far to build on my knowledge and education."
Freshman,4,"Since I am an incoming freshmen, I went on a college visit to CSU a few weeks ago. The college has the lowest tution rate in Ohio. They have alot of majors and minors to choose from. Along with the location, you will never get bored at CSU."
Sophomore,4,"I love CSU--being downtown is amazing and there's always something to do. The professors I have had are all passionate and knowledgeable about their field. Although we are a commuter school, our student life is well...lively! Once you find your place, you'll feel at home."
Niche User,4,They are very friendly always trying to help you. I went there once for a tour and to pick my classes. I would definitely go to this college. In a major of nursing for fours years. They campus look nice and very clean no problem with that. I am looking forward for this college and have a future and new memories.
Freshman,4,"The school offers a lot of events for students to participate in on and off campus. Due to it being a commuter school though, only a portion of the population participate."
Freshman,4,"CSU has a great academic environment, however, the student life is not the most active. This school has a lot of commuter students, so it will usually be very empty and quiet after 3pm."
Freshman,4,Cleveland state is very nice they have 8 of the 9 devine nine sororities and fraternities. They donr have a football team but the browns are just minutes away. The dorms are very nice i just wish there wasnt a curfew
Sophomore,4,"Cleveland State University has changed my life forever. When I first enrolled I wasn't sure how I would fit into city life, but everyone was very welcoming. I soon joined a Greek Fraternity. From there on I have been very involved on campus. Cleveland State has events and activities weekly to get campus involved."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy attending Cleveland State because of the location and the classes are not only informative, but enjoyable as well."
Sophomore,4,Professors really care about you and seeing you achieve. There is a lot of additional help available as well.
Graduate Student,4,Cleveland State University is an excellent school. I attended Cleveland State University for the first time after I graduated from high school. I graduated in 1988 with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. My time in under grad was extremely beneficial to my self worth and identity. The student campus programs were relevant and diverse. I found out about myself while gaining knowledge. Twenty eight years later I found myself in need of higher education. I immediately thought of Cleveland State Universty. I was accepted into the Counseling Program in 2016. I was nervous going back to school. The professors and staff were extremely helpful and encouraging. I found the University even better then when I left it. Cleveland State University is a first rate school and I highly recommend it.
Niche User,4,"I have not attended yet though.  My brother has.  I will start there in 5 months, but I have spent a lot of time there."
Senior,4,"CSU is a great school because of its diversity, atmosphere, closeness and relationship with the city, and supportive professors and peers."
Freshman,4,"I am only a freshman at Cleveland state university, and my first semester there was great. I've made a lot of good friends, and met a lot of nice people. the staff is amazing. they were always there to help. they want to see you succeed. i wish there was more diverse activities for the students, or just more activities all together. also i wish there were dance groups, or clubs that could be for the students. The professor that helped me the most this semester was my english teacher. we created a bong, and i could talk to her about a lot more things than just english. over this past Christmas break, i received an email for the director of the dance department, saying they would love for me to take classes. the email ended with her giving me her contact information. i never told anyone about wanting to dance at school except my english teacher. and i strongly believe she played a part in the director of the dance department emailing me. wish is very sweet of her."
Sophomore,4,I have so far had a good experience with cleveland state. The professors seem very knowledgeable and are always willing to help. There is also alot of tutoring and extra supplemental sessions for the classes that I am taking. There is also an online tutoring which I have taken advantage of through etutoring.com
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at Cleveland State University. I will say that the school I was in was not up-to-date on social media courses which is already a pretty major part of the industry. They do have those courses now but I wish they had them while I was still a student. 

Other than that the experience as a whole at Cleveland State was very positive inside and outside of the classroom. There are many ways for students to gain teamwork and leadership experience due to the number of student organizations on campus."
Niche User,4,"My mother went to Cleveland State University for a little before we moved, she loved it. It gave her a flexible schedule because she was a single mother with a job and four children to take care of. She loved it because she met great people who helped her persevere and got her work, motherly duties, and school work done at a reasonable rate/time."
Junior,4,"I like the proximity to downtown, the dorm life, and how caring my professors are. The one issue that  is a day to day hassle is the lack of parking, and the expense of it."
Alum,4,I really enjoyed my time here.  I was in greek life and lived in the dorms for 3 years.  My nursing classes were for the most part really good and I don't remember any major complaints about my prerequisites and general education requirements.  The campus had an innerlink which allowed you to stay indoors when traveling to different buildings around campus which I think is a huge plus.  The dorms are probably above average for most of the college campuses that I visited particularly Euclid Commons and the Langston.
Senior,2,Teachers read off of power point slides do not give any examples on screen. They do not walk you through any examples. Not motivated to teach.
Senior,2,The teachers at Cleveland State University care more about their research than their students. Always remember you are their second priority and their research comes first. Most of the teachers I have had are not motivated and like to read off power points from previous years. They are only in it for the money not for teaching students.
Freshman,2,My online experience was due to covid 19. Cleveland State took very quick action but that transfer to online messed with the academic calendar and syllabus.
Sophomore,2,"Personally I do not thrive in online learning so my rating was entirely based on my person leading style. However, most professors were very helpful with allowing students extra time and makeup assignments."
Senior,2,"I felt as though the fact that Cleveland State is in the middle of a city is very fun and exciting. I enjoy the surrounding area as an experience overall. Our diversity on campus is amazing. However, the educational quality is not as high as I would like for it to be. I do not feel as though I have had that many remarkable educators, or top notch experiences with the staff at my college. I felt as though i learned a lot more back at my local community college before I transferred to Cleveland State."
Niche User,2,"Haven't taken any class yet at Cleveland State University, but I believe in the University so much that I am willing to commute 45 minutes to the school to achieve my dreams as a cinematographer or videographer. I will rate the school by customer service. The All-in-one team and the phone operators who are supposed to help with questions are horrible. They seem like they don't want to work there and give vague answers. It annoys me so much. I didn't get the answers I needed so I had to go to the school in person. Their customer service need to be redone."
Niche User,2,There is a lot of crime on campus and the surrounding area constantly has safety alerts. Not much opportunity for activity.
Freshman,2,"I just got to the school and i can't stand it. Cleveland state is extremely boring. There isn't much of a school spirit, the social life is definitely slacking and the atmosphere just stinks."
College Senior,2,Athletics are not given the attention they deserve.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I created this profile to state what a terrible lack of support I have had, except from their health professions advisor. Parking is absolutely terrible. They charge atrocious prices for permits, and the parking office will not work wih you to help you appeal tickets. Some really great professors that seem to be hamstrung by the administrations idealogy of making money instead of educating great students. The financial and parking services department hold you hostage as soon as anything goes unpaid. The university seems to be subscribing to the new idealogy that education is a business and not the culmination of the efforts of collective civilization. It is unfortunate that a lot of the professors suffer because of the new dean's trumplike dogmatic approach. The school has all the attributes of itss eponymous city.... a diamond in the rough that continues to invest in counterintuitive ventures to purport itself as something its not. But, hey atleast the Dean got a nice house... They needed it to remain competetive."
College Junior,2,It's pretty sketchy in the surrounding area at night.
College Junior,2,The athletics at my school is something to be desired for the simple fact there are only a handful of varsity programs such as basketball and soccer. Most teams are division 1 but are in a subpar low-level cnference. The one good thing is that the facilities are alway updated.
College Freshman,2,"Pizza, pizza and more pizza or subway. Nothing stays open past like 10:00 pm and most college students are awake still at that time."
College Freshman,2,There are barely any parties.
College Sophomore,2,Someone help me get scholarships
Recent Alumnus,2,I didn't see any scholarship options. There weren't as many
College Freshman,2,Do not give any scholarships and they are bad with giving out enough money.
College Senior,2,I don't live on campus
College Junior,2,I do not really party.
College Junior,2,A big issue on campus is theft. Many people are getting either their phones or laptops stolen
College Freshman,2,Not very big here. Some of our teams are very good though
College Senior,2,There are very few spots close to any particular college.
College Junior,2,The harsh winters are very difficult for a commuter school. The worst part is that the school admits they do not take the commute into consideration when closing campus.
College Sophomore,2,I wish there were more recognized organizations and/or a better Greek-Life on campus. I think that would promote more student participation and potentially provide great fund raising opportunities and community engagement.
College Freshman,2,"I got some scholarships for CSU, but not many."
College Freshman,2,I don't care much for sports
College Freshman,2,Too strict on attending class
College Junior,2,"I find the RTA dirty and unsafe. Many times that I am on there (when I have no other choice) I have witnessed fights and older guys making vulgar comments. I am not comfortable with riding the RTA at all. I have taken a taxi once which should have just been a five minute drive and it turned into a fifteen minute drive, 14 dollars later. I think that it should just be a solid cost per Cleveland State student. For example when I was at OU, each person who rode in the taxi had to only pay 3 dollars no matter where they were going and I think that it should be that same for Cleveland State."
College Freshman,2,I have to maintain a certain G.P.A in the courses like math and I just have to keep up with my gpa
College Sophomore,2,"There are many athletic opportunities at Cleveland State; however, events do not draw a huge crowd and there is very little team spirit."
College Sophomore,2,The College of Urban Affairs is great. Most others are not.
College Sophomore,2,"As an Environmental Studies major, it's pretty s****y."
College Sophomore,2,"For me, it was horrible. Hardly any vegan options. Very deceiving. Extremely expensive. Terrible customer service."
College Freshman,2,I don't hear anything about the Greek life here.
College Freshman,2,"I didn't really want to come here. Now that I'm here, I really want to leave. Nothing really happens here, it's a very boring school to me but that's just my opinion. The Euclid Commons dorms are amazing though!"
College Freshman,2,Parking is usually full so commuters have to find spots elsewhere. Some places downtown do have outrageous prices. It may be more convenient to park at a meter. 
College Freshman,2,It's not really diverse. The majority of students are Caucasians. There is a small number of Black students and Oriental students.
College Freshman,2,"There use to be flyers every week for parties, not that many people attended. CSU is downtown, you can find your own fun, just drive around until you do"
College Senior,2,I didn't recieve any financial aid for this and next semester... it was bad.
College Sophomore,2,The store by our store are usually priced good but there are some businesses who you can tell are just trying to scam you for the money
College Sophomore,2,"I think my school offers a good combination of activities to students. For example, they offer a study abroad program which if I get this scholarship I will be going on in January to study in Europe."
College Sophomore,2,"The printing at my school goes by how much paper you use, and you have a certain amount each semester that you could spend on printing so it sucks when all of your allowed money is spent."
College Sophomore,2,I think the Greeks in my school make the atmosphere of my school seem like everyone has their own cliques and cant really inter-mingle with others but that is the farthest thing from the truth.
College Freshman,2,"The weather isn't great. It's super cold as soon as it hits October and the winter doesn't get any better. If you're from the North East you won't have a problem with living here because weather in both these regions is very similar. If you're coming from the South, you might have a hard time adjusting."
College Junior,2,"One minute it will be bright, hot and sunny, then thunder pour rain and hail and within a half an hour its back to sunny.  But when its nice its really nice! The lake breeze and hot sun is great and it doesn't get as humid as I thought it would."
College Junior,2,"Off-campus housing can be difficult due the cost. Still, they are a valuable option compared to on-campus housing. The apartments in downtown can be quite expensive. However, if one desires for cheaper living, there is certainly options but the quality significantly drops."
College Junior,2,"Cleveland isn't the most beautiful city, but it is home."
College Junior,2,Scholarships are not readily available for out of state students.
College Sophomore,2,"Despite there being a full police force dedicated just for on-campus patrolling, there is a lot of campus crime. Bags get grabbed, cell phones get taken, but luckily nothing very violent."
College Junior,2,"There is not much nightlife here at CSU. The downtown area is closed rather early on the weekends. That is not to say that there is not any places one could go and have a good time. Even so, if one came to CSU for the sole purpose for experiencing the nightlife in Cleveland, then one would be disappointed."
College Sophomore,2,The food at CSU is alright. There is certainly plenty of places to eat around campus if you don't mind paying a little extra for convenience. There aren't many healthy options except for Thursdays when the food market truck arrives outside depending on weather.
College Sophomore,2,"I stayed at Fenn Tower my freshman year, which is one of three different dorms to choose from. Based on my experiences, I would say that it was too expensive. The food was sub-par and there was not much to do around campus. There wasn't a ton of communication between students, so friendships are few and far between."
College Senior,2,"I was not able to receive any academic merit scholarships because I transferred to CSU from a private university and the Transfer Scholars program is given to students that have completed 30 hours at a community college.
I have received a music scholarship last year and will be getting one this year.
CSU needs to offer more scholarships for transfer students and make the information about the scholarships they do have more accessible. Advisers should go over the scholarships that are available to each student they advise based on the student's circumstances."
College Senior,2,"I do not enjoy the program very much. I like the topic and the classes are okay, but I am very confused about requirements."
College Sophomore,2,"The rooms are very nice but the food on campus is not good. The dinning hall is terrible and only one of the restaurants is open on the weekends. Campus is pretty much dead all weekend. In Euclid Commons either the heat is on or the cooling is not. The heat was turned on way too early this fall and the rooms were well above 80 degrees. Laundry is a battle although it is free. I would recommend living on campus your first year, but would suggest Fenn Tower."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus police are always inspecting buildings to keep loiterers out.  It is a city school so be prepared to see homeless people outside some of the buildings.  I fell safe on campus, but I don't advise going off campus at nit unless in a group.  Theft emails are always being sent out.  People need to be more aware when they are walking in their own."
College Junior,2,"Winters here are not fun. The streets right around campus are full of pot holes, so they don't seem to work very hard to clear them when it snows a lot. Also, it's sometimes hard to find parking very close to your classes, so trudging through the snow is a definite possibility."
College Freshman,2,When i applied I got half of my tuition covered with grants and the other half was covered by federal loans. The process can be a pain and if you owe the school money and can't pay they tack on a $100 fee which is outrageous. The financial aid people are friendly and willing to help though
College Senior,2,Men's and women's basketball are competitive in their league (Men's team made the NCAA tournament in 2009) but game attendance is  generally pretty terrible. The baseball team was gutted last year so that should tell you how much the university cares about competitive athletics.
College Freshman,2,"I don't live on campus, but I heard it can be a little boring. And the food here is not good at all"
Freshman,1,"They purposely gave me bad advising in order for me to take more classes and give them more money, then some teachers you can't understand, so good luck trying to get a good grade."
Alum,1,"My experience with Cleveland State was extremely disappointing, disheartening, and disillusioning. I entered a program under false pretenses, as I was told that it would be a combination of an online and a weekly in-class schedule. The first semester, we only met once per month.  After that, we never met as a class again. We were promised for the next 2 semesters that the program would continue as we originally signed up for, which never happened. Halfway through the program, the director finally revealed (which she had known for some time), that the remainder of the schedule would be online. As I was already immersed into the degree, the last thing on my mind was to leave the program mid-stream. Therefore, I did finish out the program and obtain my degree.
Throughout my time there, with 1 exception in 2 years, I found the instructors to be unreasonable, unprofessional, and unresponsive, and unkind in their communications with students."
Freshman,1,"The housing at the school is fabulous, but that is about the highest perk you can find when attending this school. The lack of unity and motivation of Cleveland State University is very concerning to me on my academics and the overall graduation rate that the school has, which is dangerously low. Most of my peers considered this school to be an affordable college to attend for just a couple years before transferring to a more successful college such as OSU. 
If you like to party, CSU is not the place for you with dorms having extremely strict codes with eviction penalizations leaving only one tiny house fraternity to host parties that are barely attended. 
Affordable yes, but is it really worth it?"
Sophomore,1,"I hate Cleveland State University. It is basically a commuter school so the weekends are so boring. The academics and professors are okay, but nothing great by any means. There is no football team and there really isn't any reason to be excited about their athletic programs as none of the teams are very good. The worst part about it all? The parking. Purchase a $300 parking pass but good luck actually finding a spot. It's a joke!"
Niche User,1,"The first time my daughter attended CSU, the experience was good and she received her first degree.  The second time, unfortunately, the experience was horrible.  There is a website detailing the entire unbelievable story - www.NoJusticeForShana.com."
College Senior,1,Greek life is almost nonexistent at CSU. The few sororities and frats are kept low key and there is no specific attitufe towards members of greek life.
College Senior,1,Terrible education. Could be one of the worst schools in the country complete waste of money.
College Freshman,1,"Housing is very expensive for the quality of the rooms. Fenn Tower is very old, stuffy, smelly & small. I've never been in the Langston but from what I've seen it is small. The meal plan should not be included with housing because it makes the price very high & unaffordable. Housing was one reason I was considering not going to Cleveland State University. I really need a dorm on campus but I can't get one because I can't afford it."
College Sophomore,1,No scholarships for international students.
College Sophomore,1,The issues of students and maybe staff getting robbed.
College Sophomore,1,My admission was not the problem nor funding for the first 3 years. Now that my financial aid is at the full allotment I am having problems paying for my classes.
College Freshman,1,its boiling in the summer and the wind comes right down the street in the winter. Its terrible.
College Junior,1,The have consistently removed parking options while the price has skyrocketed.
College Freshman,1,Not many options unless you go to downtown.
College Freshman,1,Student life is extremely boring. Very limited events.
College Freshman,1,Idk what really goes on with that
College Junior,1,It is way too cold in Cleveland Ohio!!!!!
College Junior,1,Parking is constantly full and the security for the parking is never around when students vehicles are being broken into
College Senior,1,"TERRIBLE. I plan when I will arrive at school based on parking availability. I have attended CSU for the past 5 years. In 2008, permits were $160.. currently they are $236. I have no idea why the prices have gone up because the service and availability does not reflect that. The permits sell out within days of being made available and if you don't get a permit, parking services pretty much says oh well."
College Senior,1,There are never enough parking spaces even when you buy a parking pass. usually have to park 10 min away from my actual class which makes things a little stressful. They turned one of the parking lots into a dorm facility which makes it even more inconvienient.
College Senior,1,"CSU uses their Campus 411 system to assist students. The pre-recorded options don't easily allow you to talk to a live person, and the few times I have spoke with an employee, I felt they were rude and didn't display any interest in helping me. I have a finacial situation that is somewhat difficult, and I feel that there is no help being offered here. Several times I have made requests through the FA department and it takes days,if not weeks to recieve a response. Money is a major concern for most Americans, you would think CSU would make this process more personal and inviting, rather than go online and that's it."
College Senior,1,"I did not receive any amount of Financial Aid, from my college, Cleveland State University. I barely recieved any loan money. I was viewed as ineligible for Financial Aid, due to the amount of money my Dad currently makes. I believe that my college should look at how independent the students are, that apply for the college, and that should be a key factor to determining the amount of Financial Aid, one should receive. By law, students under the age of 24, must put in their parents and list as a dependent, these situations are not every students circumstances. Many students are supporting and carrying themselves through school, that are still under the age of 24. There should be a new procedure, on determining the many students that work hard, independently to get through college."
College Junior,1,Its not fairness at all on this campus and racially bias! Period! definitely NOT pro student or diversity as far as letting student be free and create social org's and being creative and expressive to help build the campus
College Junior,1,Our campus really isnt safe do to location. We need more foot patrol outside  especially during morning hours.
College Junior,1,"Off-campus dining is one thing I can gripe about. The variety of dining options  near campus is lacking. There are only a handful of options available to students and they are not really good ones. If availability of good dining options off-campus was adequate, then it would raise student satisfaction."
College Sophomore,1,Good luck getting any scholarships outside of the scholars program or the honors program. Any other scholarships are one in a thousand.
College Sophomore,1,"Unless you're 21, there is not much to do, outside of the occasional concert or sports event."
College Junior,1,"There's lots of money for new flashy construction even as the main building deteriorate and they neglect essential stuff. 

The new $10million student center is interesting in one respect, however. You could probably do an interesting engineering thesis on how so few students hanging out can create so much noise."
College Junior,1,"U better have a car and navigate the outragous and expensive parking if you live on campus at CSU. Otherwise you're stuck with the Viking Market place (they get fresh lettuce about once a week. After two years the thought of eating there makes me physically sick), or loading up on grease at a few of the chains across the street, and paying for it too. The whole city shuts down about 9 or 10pm, so after that your only options are Rascal House and Subway, I think."
College Junior,1,"They've totally screwed up the parking system with a new system of multicolored hangtags. You have to go through plans nearly as complicated as medicare to select the right one and understand what privilages you have with it. A couple years ago you could find street spaces for one or two classes and use the campus lots as a backup, but new construction has all but eliminated this option at the same time as they've made their lots some of the most expensive in Cleveland outside special events. Most lots no longer take cash, so you can't just use them when you need them; you're forced to purchase a plan."
College Junior,1,"Mostly commuter students working part or full time. Class discussions will not be interesting. Most courses do not have much depth and a few profs seem to have a tenuous grasp on their subjects, thought this varies widely. No one expects you to do much work or learn much beyond the absolute minimum. Professors are reasonably available if you can make office hours, but few other students will bother."
College Sophomore,1,"Cost for parking is insane! It's definitely not affordable to the average student. However, there are many garages on campus and of campus parking is usually pretty good. It's always smart to get to class early so that you can find a convenient spot for you that's closer to campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Cleveland lacks attraction, not many things go on in Cleveland its very quiet."
College Freshman,1,I didn't find the financial aid I received this year very helpful at all as only half of the total amount was dispersed and it was quite low. The process is also very tedious and confusing.
College Sophomore,1,The dinning hall is TERRIBLE!!!! They rarely have any good food. I pretty much just go there to make a sandwich.
Recent Alumnus,1,"its bleak and cold and gray most of the school year with a significant amount of precipitation. the only nice days weather wise are the first day of fall semester and the last day of spring semester. if you're going to be there during summer semester I suggest bringing a personal fan, and a water bottle."
Recent Alumnus,1,I'm terribly unhappy with my program and if I could do it over I'd probably do something very different like go to a school that knows what they are doing and can help students figure out what they want  out of a degree to help get them to a job in their field.
Recent Alumnus,1,"its pretty bad, they give you no real direction, and you basically have to figure it all out for yourself, and then your so-called advisors suggest classes you don't even need but apparently have to take to fulfill requirements that will have nothing to do with what you want to do concerning your life, or your future career."
Recent Alumnus,1,"there is a musty smell in most building that is probably asbestos. the general aesthetic is bleak, and uncaring. unless you're in a clique, expect to spend a good deal of your time by yourself."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Its downright terrible. There are never enough spots for everyone, the parking attendants don't really know what they are doing, and the cost is around 300 dollars a semester for a parking pass."
Recent Alumnus,1,"the scholarships available are substantial as long as you maintain your grades, however the financial aid process is atrocious, and there are fees for just about everything. Some of them I wasn't aware of until i had graduated. The people who run this system are money grubbing and nickel and dime you for a subpar college experience"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Its in downtown cleveland. unless you're 21 and a partaker of alcohol or gambling (which I am not) there really isn't anything fun nearby. its also very dangerous to walk alone on campus outside day or night, because of the weekly reported thefts and assaults that happen far too frequently."
Recent Alumnus,1,the Greek life is rather tiny and has little to no impact on the rest of the student body. I found that very disappointing compared to other schools I've visited in the ohio area alone.
College Sophomore,1,"Dining services on campus is the worst part of Cleveland State.  The food is gross and expensive.  Not worth the money, but it is a monopoly on campus and you have to eat, so they got you."
College Senior,1,There is just not enough parking available since the parking lots were demolished to build housing.
College Senior,1,"The Viking Marketplace doesn't make quality healthy food that fits the students taste. They should always have at least one ""safe"" option that students will enjoy."
College Freshman,1,"There is absolutely no social life here, not even in most classes.  Many of the students are commuters so, in turn, they have no desire to communicate with other students, let alone become friends.  If you're looking for any social life, CSU is not the place for you."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Take the bus, carpool, or ride a bike because parking is a joke."
College Junior,1,The Amount Is Never Enough – This is  my third year at CSU and each time I always had to pay out of pocket to stay on campus because I was never given a decent amount that would cover my expenses.
College Junior,1,"Once upon a time there was convenient and affordable parking at CSU. Then the university decided to build on top of all the parking lots and never build new ones. So now there is almost no parking, many commuter students, and outrageous parking fees. A parking pass for a semester costs $200. That doesn't include breaks or year-round parking. And good luck getting to class on time when you spend a half hour minimum searching for a spot that is at least a 20 minute walk from class."
College Senior,1,"They have been tearing out parking lots to add more buildings, which doesn't make sense because CSU is a commuter school. You'd better pray you live on campus or can get to school by bus. Otherwise, be there an entire hour before you have to be in class and make sure you absolutely can park somewhere, or you'll walk away with some insane tickets."
College Sophomore,1,"I can say that CSU has a diverse group of individuals from practically all races, backgrounds, etc.  Unfortunately, the public media doesn't display it.  The majority of the media concentrates on the caucasian students and very little other backgrounds. For example, there may be a picture up containing 9 students. 6 of the students are caucasian."
College Freshman,1,"For someone who lives on campus, it's easy to find parking because we don't have to leave during the school day. But i've heard many stories from commuters that parking is ridiculously hard to find. Even professors say it's irritating that there's almost no available parking spots at certain times in the day."
College Sophomore,1,Permit Cost – The cost of paring is continually increasing every semester and the ability to find a parking spot seems to get harder and harder everyday!
College Freshman,1,"There is no night life. If you are under the age of 21, you literally have to create your own fun.. or get a fake i.d."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking passes are expensive and limited in quantity.  Street parking is also limited and cops are always in the area checking meters.  CSU requires you buy a $25 RTA pass with each semester's tuition that will get you on any bus or the Rapid in Cleveland for free, which is an exceptionally great deal if you can work your schedule around public transportation."
College Freshman,1,"Downtown Nightmare – If you don't live on campus not only is parking very expencive but you'll still find youself walking to class from a few blocks away.However Cleveland state is right in the heart of downtown, so the students here get the same nightmare as people who work downtown"
College Senior,1,"Housing Is Okay Unless Your Gay – dorm options are totally limited, and neither are amazing, but they are college dorms. I ended up being endlessly harassed by a homophobic roommate that the office didn't seem to care about at all when i complained. not very social. It's as expensive as any college, but no chance for financial aid to cover it. Easy enough to move in, but it's expensive to live off campus so that's what you get"
College Senior,1,"Pretty Much Not Existant – this isn't a school for sports, but I'm okay with that. we hear about basketball occasionally but otherwise no pep rallies for us"
College Senior,1,"Dramatic Arts Major- Bad Unless You Want to Act or Write – i wanted to do the technical track in the dramatic arts program, and was pretty much told they dont care aboutme as much as the actors and playwrights. its to bad, since their starting work with the playhouse square soon"

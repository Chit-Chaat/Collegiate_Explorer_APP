Junior,5,"PLU has been an amazing school, especially considering the current problems going on.  They care about student health, and are very flexible with their classes.  Although they were not online-heavy before the pandemic, their classes have seamlessly transitioned to functioning well online.  Even in such short notice.  If a problem comes up financially or with housing, they are quick to help you and are kind the whole time.  Definitely an awesome experience, and I definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a wholesome, caring university."
Graduate Student,5,"Amazing community, academics, faculty, and extracurriculars. Put in the effort, you will have a beautiful time at this school. Hard work is rewarded with opportunity. The support I felt while at PLU was like a warm hug for all four years. I seriously cannot recommend becoming a Lute more. Do it! You won't regret the choice. Attaway!"
Junior,5,A great community to learn and become who you are meant to be in. They give you guidance while allowing you room to grow.
Sophomore,5,I love PLU it's an amazing community. My professors all know my name and work so hard to ensure their students' success.
Graduate Student,5,I absolutely loved PLU! A liberal arts education is definitely an amazing opportunity to learn from several different fields and find what you are interested in. The small class sizes help facilitate learning and engagement between students and faculty. I couldn't have picked a better school to earn my Bachelor's degree and future Master's degree!!
Freshman,5,"Excellent sports program, beautiful campus,  friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Extensive course options."
Freshman,5,"Very welcoming, diverse, and supportive. Someone is always able to help me with whatever I need- whether that be answering my questions or pointing me in the right direction to someone that can."
Alum,5,"Amazing experience. There are so many different activities, clubs, and opportunities for students to partake in that my 4 years felt like 10! I was soooo busy, but I made incredibly close friendships. Like any school, there are some judgmental, close minded people, but just ignore them and find your community of kind and accepting friends. You will, easily! The music department is first class, as are all the departments in the humanities. Can't speak to the other programs at PLU, but I've heard wonderful things! My professors have become my biggest support system at PLU and in life. COME TO PLU! It's a beautiful place."
Sophomore,5,Pacific Lutheran University is the perfect school for any student who wants a great education while feeling as if they are part of a family.  During my first year I already felt a part of the Lute family.  The professors are very caring towards their students’ education and the classes are small where everyone is able to learn the material and get to know their classmates.  Student life is also focused on involving the campus and holds many events and activities.  For the most part the student body is friendly and their is a comfortable aura around the school.
Senior,5,"Honestly this school was a perfect fit for me. I love the community, I built relationships with professors, and dealt with an expected amount of drama for being in one of if not the largest schools on campus. I had very few bad experiences with professors, most of whom were either new or about to retire (i.e. didn't care anymore or were problematic). I feel at home on-campus. The academics are generally very rigorous, but you couldn't ask for a better school to prepare you for being a hardworking and thoughtful employee, community member, or person in general!"
Niche User,5,"Though I did not graduate from PLU, I thoroughly enjoyed my three years of attendance. This school has a great track record of academic quality with fantastic academic support and counselors. The professors are kind and caring and many of them display a high level of enthusiasm and love for both their topic and their students. On top of all that, it has an amazingly beautiful campus with a clear view of Mt. Rainier."
Freshman,5,"I really like PLU very much. going to school there I  think is the best choice I never made because people there are so nice, people to help you. they have good program. I love campus."
Freshman,5,A very inclusive community with great people and faculty members. The dorm life is very nice with great people to communicate with and the class sizes are small for people looking for small class sizes.
Junior,5,The class sizes is small therefore professors are invested in you. The fact that you have to see your advisor to get a code for registration is really nice. You are able to stay on track because someone is there to guide you every semester.
Junior,5,I like the diversity and financial opportunities they offer to all students. They make you feel welcome and support academic challenges. It's a great 4 year university near home with accessible to different things around the community.
Senior,5,"PLU is a great university. It is small, which is very nice because it allows the professors and the students to get to know each other and connect on a more personal level. There is never a fight to meet with the professors. The course load is spread throughout 15 weeks. Although it is a long time, it helps not cram information into student's heads all at once. Their nursing program is amazing and the faculty is superb. Overall, PLU is a great university with lots of diversity and great people."
Sophomore,5,"A very welcoming place with nice people. I like to be there, I feel like home. The teachers are very supportive and are trying their best to help you succeed.  A lot of centers where you can go to get help with homework and to understand better. I like all the good opportunities we got here that helps us to be a better person in future."
Freshman,5,"I love the professors and the campus. The library is my favorite place to both chill and do homework, but there are plenty of other cool places to check out. The professors are kind, caring and do their utmost to make themselves available to students. There are opportunities to get tutoring and get help if needed. As a commuter,  I don't know much about the dorms or anything about living on campus, but others seems to like it."
Freshman,5,"I grew up in the local area of Pacific Lutheran University in Parkland Washington. I have always been on the campus, in have always wanted to go to P.L.U to major in nursing. When I was accepted too P.L.U. I got the job from my admission counselor, and the incoming freshman counsel. I was welcomed with joy and appreciated the way the school welcomed me. They not only sent me an acceptance letter but called me and showed up at my school with lute accessories. The campus is so friendly, beautiful, and always has security off, around and on campus it makes me feel very safe while walking on campus. You  don't have to go to Pacific Lutheran University to see the security, or diversity. The minute to you step on the campus you see the diverse welcoming and the security around the school."
Junior,5,"The campus is just the right size, and with a student body of around 4,000, it's easy to get to know people on campus and stay connected with them. The class sizes are great, ranging anywhere from 5 to 30 in a typical class, and a bit more in large lecture classes. The campus is beautiful and easy to walk."
Freshman,5,"At Pacific Lutheran University, you feel at home. They do everything they can to help their students feel comfortable by creating a happy and ""homey"" atmosphere. PLU coordinates lots of activities and fun organizations and clubs on campus, so you never feel bored! The professors are committed to helping you and want to be sure you graduate feeling confident and excited to have your degree and be stepping into the real world!"
Junior,5,"I am currently a junior at PLU and have had nothing but great experiences with fellow students, faculty, study abroad, participating in different on-campus activities etc. Out of all the college campuses I have visited, the PLU community is by far the friendliest. Beautiful campus, so many ways to get involved, lots of work opportunities, easy to make friends, accepting and friendly community, etc."
Alum,5,I loved my four years at PLU.  The faculty and student body are engaged in both the local and global communities.  Plus the campus is beautiful!
Freshman,5,Everybody here is so kind and I love the small class sizes. The professors are very invested in your success and your learning and make sure you have all the necessary materials to succeed.
Freshman,5,"I feel loved, supported, and safe. Faculty, students, and even alumni are available and more than willing to be there for you however you need."
Sophomore,5,I love PLU. Its my perfect fit because the small campus allows for a tight community! My classes are challenging but completable.
Senior,5,Attending Pacific Lutheran University has opened my eyes to my future and has given me amazing opportunities to build the skills needed for myself and for working with the public. The professors that I have had a pleasure in meeting have cared about my success and accomplishments. I am very proud to be graduating this year from PLU.
Junior,5,I love how it is nestled in a small community and that the peace atmosphere helps calm anxiety and how diversity contributed to all kinds of kindness given.
Niche User,5,"I love the welcoming environment, as if they want you to succeed and they want to help you in every way as possible."
Sophomore,5,"After having taken a gap year between my senior years of high school and freshman year of college, I felt extremely nervous about transitioning to college. I had a great concern over whether or not I would fit in with the other students and also whether the professors would be deeply invested to my education. Quickly, I learned Pacific Lutheran University is the most welcoming of schools. Never in my life have I felt so involved and dedicated to my education."
Junior,5,"Love the small class sizes, students are very helping, live on campus if you can, professors are very helpful, and a beautiful campus."
Freshman,5,"I love it here at PLU! I'm so happy, and it is definitely my home away from home. It was hard adjusting to the weather, but I have grown to love it at PLU. The diversity and sense of community is what makes PLU stand out from any other college."
Freshman,5,"The university provides a very inclusive community of students and faculty aimed at helping you to succeed! With a lovely campus and campus life, I would recommend Pacific Lutheran University to all students! Although I myself am not of a particular religion, I was initially concerned about the faith aspect of the college however came to find that the campus is extremely open when it comes to differing views and as an LGBTQ student, was even invited by the school's pastor to attend any sort of event that would be held regarding the spiritual elements of the school. Overall, a wonderful experience thus far."
Freshman,5,Professors actually want you to succeed! They’re always happy to help and there’s plenty of outside options for help. The staff and fellow students are also very welcoming.
Sophomore,5,"I find PLU to be a great school. Everyone comments on the location but on campus, safety is never an issue. Take precautions and learn to love the community in which your campus is engulfed in. PLU is great for introverts and extroverts, athletes and non athletes, liberal arts majors or stem majors. It is a very accepting community and if you are considering attending PLU, I would recommend!"
Senior,5,"PLU feels like a close community. I think we all share a certain set of values to make the world a better place. The size is perfect; I like that I am likely to see people I know in multiple positions; my classmates working at the Old Main Market; My catering co-workers writing magazine articles; classmates participating in sports; professors heading various clubs.  Although the surrounding neighborhoods are not the greatest, I have never felt in danger on campus. And,  I know that in the rare case that something did happen, I would be fully supported by student services. PLU is very clear that it will protect victims of any kind of harassment. 
   The school is incredibly focused on vocation and preparing us for developing a skill set, not just gaining knowledge. I feel confident that I will be able to have the career I want after I graduate."
Junior,5,"PLU offers something that is not in any college description: a feeling of inclusiveness, a community. The community at PLU is connected, positive and loving. The professors are passionate about the subject they are teaching, they help you discover your interests and talents. The students make you feel included, happy and experience a wide array of opportunities. I came to PLU wanting to play soccer and be a nurse. I found my passion for exercise, nutrition, and wellness, captain the Men's soccer team, ASPLU Vice President, and a community that loves and accepts me for who I am while pushing me to grow."
Junior,5,"Pacific Lutheran University has been the best education choice that I have made. It really focuses and encourages me to find my vocation and discovering the path that I want to follow in life. With its small class sizes, we really obtain the one on one interaction with our professors whom care about our education and our well-being as well."
Junior,5,"As an incoming freshman, all staff and students have been extremely welcoming and helpful. They are transferring my credits with little fuss (aside from making sure I'm getting appropriate credit), and they have an amazing study abroad program."
Freshman,5,"The staff makes great connections with their students, they really care about them, the organizations are great, lots of school spirit, high demanding classes but not overwhelming!"
Junior,5,"The 302 Engineering Program brought me to this school in the first place, but everything else that I've been able to get involved in while here and made it completely worth it and assured me that I chose the right place to be."
Freshman,5,"When college site visiting, I found that this was my number one choice for my choice of where I want to go to college. When I went on tour at PLU, everyone was extremely kind, the academic rates were high and the food in the cafeteria was home styled, which is amazing!  However, it is very expensive and their scholarship award system is not the best. For example, if you get a new scholarship, they tend to take a away or downgrade another one you have. Overall, PLU is a great college and made me feel like I was at home"
Sophomore,5,"PLU genuinely and truly cares about the well being of its students and exhibits this in the near constant campaigns that they run to engage students and determine ways to better service them. PLU provided me with rigorous and engaging classes taught by highly qualified and friendly professors. If I had to do it over again, I would pick to be a Lute every time."
Niche User,5,"At Pacific Lutheran University, everyone was nice. It truly felt like home. The campus is beautiful and not to mention, it's a private university so classes are smaller! Which means you get to interact with your professor one on one. Staff and many programs are dressed there to help students whenever they need it, whether it's financial or academic."
Freshman,5,Pacific Lutheran is such a great place for those looking for a small private college. There are lots of clubs and sports to be involved in and not to mention developing close relationships with the staff and friends. I've made my closest friends here and I couldn't imagine going anywhere other than PLU.
College Sophomore,5,"PLU has given me more of a better experience than I expected and I am excited for my 2nd year and the two to follow after that. This is my home and I feel happy, safe and encouraged here."
College Sophomore,5,I have always heard great things about PLU as for preparing students to excel after college and during.
College Sophomore,5,I love where i lived last year and this year. The halls are welcoming and enjoyable. Everything is clean and a nice space to call your own.
College Sophomore,5,"PLU has given me the perfect welcoming experience that is backed up by multiple missions to secure my future, secure the environment, and help build a community fit for other students, the city around us and the social world we all live in."
College Sophomore,5,There are plenty of opportunities for internships.
College Sophomore,5,"Living on campus is like the real deal college experience. It can get a little boring but after a break, it's the most relaxing thing ever. It's nice to liv close to class."
College Freshman,5,Pacific Lutheran University is a very welcoming school that makes students feel at home and supported.
College Sophomore,5,My experience in one year at plu has been outstanding. The students and faculty are much nicer then one might find in everyday life. It is a culture built upon acceptance and discussion aimed toward the betterment of the university and the community surrounding it.
College Freshman,5,"PLU really cares about preparing you for your future career, and helping you get one in your field of study. The career connections center helps you prepare your resume, for interviews, and there are I think a lot of internship opportunities through PLU as well."
College Junior,5,Professors intelligent easy to talk to interesting
College Junior,5,"My school is great, education is greatly valued which makes it easy to do well in school. The campus is beautiful and the students that attend are there for the right reason."
College Freshman,5,"Our alumni network is incredible and from the get-go, first years are allowed to contact previous Lutes to learn about their education and the path they took to reach their careers. There are lots of on-campus jobs for work study programs but also many internships offered within and outside PLU."
College Freshman,5,I'm a really big fan of Pacific Lutheran because of the class sizes. My choices were between PLU and UW and I ultimately chose PLU because the class sizes are small and you get to know the professors on a personal level. I don't regret my decision at all and I'm please to say that my professors know my name and face and I have many opportunities to talk to them about my education.
College Freshman,5,Just very accepting!! That is it!!
College Sophomore,5,I don't know a lot about it.
Junior,4,"PLU wasn't built for online classes.  They were very reliant on that good, old fashioned in-person learning.  However, when we had to switch to online learning within two days, my professors did their absolute best and almost seamlessly transitioned.  Even my lab-based classes were successful."
Sophomore,4,"The school itself is full of friendly people. They are very diverse and I appreciate that they show respect for every individual. Some of the teachers care a lot, some do not care at all."
Graduate Student,4,"Your professors will try their hardest to accommodate you in every way possible. It's a transition for many of them as well, so patience is of course necessary as we all work through this. PLU has been VERY forgiving of its students, offering pass/fail options for online learning."
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus, and all the activities they provide. The education is stimulating, but somewhat expensive for a poor student. Is it worth it? I sure hope so."
Sophomore,4,"Though I don't like learning online, the professors made it possible to still get an education and still feel like I'm somewhat part of a group."
Junior,4,Have not taken many online courses bu the two I have were done nicely and the professors were willing to accommodate any problems that arose.
Alum,4,I was very lucky to have had professors who were considerate of the challenges of moving to online learning during a global pandemic. They each changed their syllabus completely and graded more leniently. Although I did hear of other students have a much worse time than me during the transition. The professors have the resources to teach classes online in creative and engaging ways.
Freshman,4,There is such an overwhelming feeling of acceptance all around the campus. I know several people who didn't feel like they could come out as homosexual back in their hometowns but were completely comfortable with it at Pacific Lutheran University. The ability to communicate one on one with professors is also a big plus and a great reason to decide on this small liberal arts university.
Niche User,4,I really enjoy PLU's campus. The environment and people are amazing. I feel at home on PLU's campus. I have a brother that goes there and he loves it. He has made so many God-loving friends for life. I have visited there and the guide was so sweet.
Freshman,4,"PLU is an outstanding school focused on academic and the involvement with the community. They have a really strong competitive nursing school, social work, and education school. One thing I would like to see is more diversity, more people attending people from different racial ethnic groups."
Junior,4,"I enjoy attending school and working here. The majority of the professors are excellent and are very passionate about what they are teaching. I have learned a lot while attending.On the other hand, I believe the university costs more than it should and does not do a great job creating a campus community. I also think that the university should not claim to be sustainable when a lot of their practices do not reflect that."
Junior,4,"Everyone at PLU is very caring and the advisors stay with you on your journey through the years. I didn't rate the college with 5 stars is because of the website, it's so incredibly disorganized and it's hard to find the correct information."
Niche User,4,Pacific Lutheran University is a highly respected university. I adore the campus structure and buildings along with the atmosphere of success.
Sophomore,4,"In my first year at PLU, I have had a generally positive experience. Most of my teachers I have gotten along with and I learn well from them, but some are either too hard of graders, do not treat their class like adults, do not explain things well enough, or a combination of all three. The food is really good and available pretty early and late in the day, allowing students to eat when they please. I will say websites connected to PLU are a bit confusing and may need some updates or full replacements."
Junior,4,"PLU is a wonderful school, it has challenged me the last three years both mentally and emotionally. This university is a liberal school, so they require a handful of classes be taken that have no relation to one's intended major. Also, each professor that I have encountered challenged me to think with a different mindset. At PLU, part of the university's statement is, ""seeks to educate students for lives of thoughtful inquiry"". I have personally experienced this in the requirement to take religion courses, even though I am a nursing student. However, taking these classes encouraged me to understand the spirituality of people and how that may impact my ability to offer adequate care for my future patients. If this is the type of education you are seeking, then PLU is the place for you."
Senior,4,Pacific Lutheran University has very small class sizes hat allow you to connect with both the professors and your fellow peers. As somebody attending their Elementary Education Program I hope to see a larger variety in class options for that specific program
Sophomore,4,"My favorite part of PLU is the home that it provides to students. I've had many friends speak on how our school provides a safe space for people to live in. Most faculty show that they care for their students, and work to ensure that students receive individual experiences that benefit them. One thing that I think would improve my school more would be for it to become more accessible. There are many areas on campus where a student would be unable to access due to a lack of wheelchair access routes or elevators."
Sophomore,4,Good school but expensive. Medical services failed to accomodate me when needed. Not enough financial support.
Senior,4,"I've loved my time at PLU. If you are looking for a small liberal arts university, I would highly recommend checking out this college. The professors are supportive and helpful, the campus looks nice, and the athletic teams are very competitive."
Alum,4,"Although the sticker price is high, the quality of education is top shelf. I felt genuinely prepared for the workforce from my major and enjoyed the courses along the way. My biggest challenge was the distribution of funding throughout the school - it would be great for students to see more of their tuition money at work in a way that directly impacts their experience."
Niche User,4,The overall campus was pretty decent. It is defineelty better than alot of other college campus's I vistied. The rooms can be a little bit cleaner
Graduate Student,4,"I love the reputation and the campus. Professors are amazing and great to work with. Tuition is too high, especially since the professors' compensation does not reflect it and the building is super old."
Niche User,4,Great school that offers many different programs. The college campus is easy to navigate. The teachers are great and knowledgable and they truly care and want you to succeed.
Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful and I love the small class sizes; it helps me to learn and stay engaged the best. The professors are dedicated to students's education and are decent with availability outside of class. Overall, I love it at PLU and reccomend this university to everyone."
Sophomore,4,I have truly felt 100% welcome at PLU. The school made the transition easy after completing my first year and everyone on campus is so nice and helpful.
Sophomore,4,"I like the small campus style, and I like how available my professors are when I have questions about course material. I enjoy the ability to participate in athletics at the DIII level and how it doesn't get in the way of my academics"
Sophomore,4,"The faculty is amazing and super nice and with the small campus, there is a growth of a community. The professors are great but they can tough and there is a big push to strive on campus."
Alum,4,I loved feeling welcomed and all my classes broadened my perspective. Really helpful staff and friendly atmosphere.
Sophomore,4,"I love the small classroom sizes, I have the chance to communicate easily with professors and ask questions whenever I need. Access to help is very easy."
Senior,4,"PLU is well known for its commitment to social justice issues, as well as care for the environment through sustainability. There is a very strong study away program, and all students are encouraged to study away at some point in their time at PLY. The arts program is very strong as well as the nursing program."
Sophomore,4,"I love it here in PLU, I have met and been supported by so many people, it made the transition from highschool to College easier. The staff in the student financial service and anywhere are amazing at answering questions and making sure to help you out as much as they can. As a first generation student, it made the process of applying and paying for PLU tuition less complicated because they helped me every step of the way!"
Sophomore,4,This is an very good private liberal arts college. Class size on average is small and the community is very progressive and friendly. Residential life on this campus is exceptional. This department works hard to plan events on campus and is dedicated to social justice learning for everyone on and off campus.
Niche User,4,"I love the fact that the average class size is only about 15 people, and their biggest class is about 47. It would definitely help students that need one on one help with professors, and don't do good in big lecture halls. The school is very big on education, so if you're looking for that to be your career path, then this would be  good place. It's A very unique school, and you wouldn't find one like it. The dorm rooms are also very cute, and some are split off into language majors."
Freshman,4,"This is a pretty small school which lets you maintain close relationships with fellow students while still meeting new people everyday. The school is mostly Caucasian, with a lot more females than males on campus. There is at least one party every weekend but they can be a bit hard to find, but when they are big they are fun. There is all you can eat dinners every week night and the food in general is pretty well prepared, with a lot of options.  Everything on campus is a pretty close walk from the residence halls, which aren't very well updated but they suffice."
Sophomore,4,"Pacific Lutheran is a great school. Everyone is very nice and including. Since the school is rather small you get to know so many people on a more personal level then you would at a state school. I can walk around campus and say hello to at least two people. however, sometimes the weather and location of the school is not the most amazing but you can work with it."
Junior,4,I really liked the campus and all my professors were very well educated both in and outside of their areas of speciality.
Sophomore,4,I graduated from a small high school and was slightly terrified at the thought of colleges being a lot bigger than what I was used to. When I chose PLU I didn't know what to expect. After my first semester I was pleased to learn most classes are small which gives the opportunity to have good relationships with peers and professors which was what I was used to due to going to a small school. The campus is easy to navigate and the community is great.
Junior,4,"I've loved PLU every step of the way, I haven't always gotten along with all of my professors, but most of them are dedicated to helping you with your academic career(s) and much as they can. The campus is beautiful and the safety is amazing. I'm so glad to be a Lute!"
Freshman,4,"If you want a school where you have a community that is very welcoming then PLU is definitely for you. Not only is the campus beautiful, the students are amazing along with the teachers. PLU is definitely a place where you can work hard, and play hard. If you still do not know what you want to do with your life then PLU is definitely the place for you, especially with all the resources available to help you with your future."
Sophomore,4,"I like the small campus and how you feel like you know or at least recognize almost everyone on campus after your first year here. Overall, I would like to change the weekend activities here because most everyone goes home on the weekends leaving it like a ghost town."
Niche User,4,"I like the vigorous music program. However, I have heard there are financial issues in dealing with tuition."
Freshman,4,"The campus is a perfect size, it's small enough that I will constantly see my friends walking around yet big enough that I know I can meet many more people. Campus is full of people with different gender, ethnicity, and cultural backgrounds creating a largely diverse social setting. The classroom setting is amazing because the professors can spend hands-on time with each student. However, my only problem with the college is the location. The surrounding areas can be a little sketchy, but I suppose it builds character."
Niche User,4,Pacific Lutheran university is a beautiful small Campus. I have gotten multiple tours of the school and it always was a very welcoming place with lots of diversity and students were able to express their individuality. I would be beyond grateful to be able to attend the school. The food I have bought their has always been great and fresh also amazing customer service.
Freshman,4,"Pacific Lutheran is a very nice, modern, and quaint college. Its considered in the area to be very high class and the small classrooms is what makes it so admirable. Diversity is strongly encouraged and there are always events going on for students at the college. The campus itself is very beautiful. I do however wish there was more parking for students and restaurants and things to do in the surrounding area. Athletics do exist here at PLU but only as either Division 3 or clubs. There isn't a stadium and usually not much of a turnout for sport games and what not. 
  The party is scene is present much as it is a Lutheran based campus. But the students do have their own parties off campus and its just a matter knowing different people and going."
Freshman,4,"I loved off campus my first semester and I still enjoyed college. PLU professors seriously care (at least my biology, writing & psychology did) about your grades and how you're doing in the class. I appreciated the small class sizes and I am so thankful and glad in my decision of attending PLU."
Freshman,4,"During my first semester here at Pacific Lutheran University, I have enjoyed the campus life and the relationships with staff. I appreciate that we can have a one one one relationship with our professors. I also enjoy the food, how all the dinners are ""all you care to eat"" except for Saturday.  The dorm I currently live in is very warm and the heater is unable to turn off."
Freshman,4,"The campus environment is safe and welcoming with an array of interesting classes. I currently live in Harstad, and it's alright. Everything creaks, and the bathrooms could use some updating but overall it's really nice."
Graduate Student,4,"Beautiful campus, great teachers, prestige, small class sizes, small number of students. Wish that there were more on campus activities for graduate students and that PowerPoint wasn't the go-to for all the staff.  Some complaints from myself as well as other students and teachers about our online learning management system, Sakai."
Alum,4,"I love, love, love PLU. Amazing, challenging, intelligent, and kind professors. Beautiful campus--in all seasons, but especially fall. Great coffee and food options. This place challenged me in every way and gave me more than I could ever imagine!"
College Sophomore,4,PLU takes strong action to inform and protect students.
College Sophomore,4,I am not an athlete but I appreciate what PLU has done for those students.
College Sophomore,4,All of my courses have been relatively easy with a good amount of work. Loved all my profs.
College Sophomore,4,My school is very liberal. There are a lot of chances to connect with people of my ethnic group. I find it easy to connect with my professors and advisors. I dealt with some mental health issues and all my professors were willing to help me and understand what I was going through. I felt like that was the biggest thing is that a professor who I barely met was able to connect me with help on campus and really looked out for me even though he had just met me that semester.
College Sophomore,4,"While the buildings may be very old, the atmosphere is what every college kid dreams about."
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe with the circle of eight (blue lights), and campus safety."
College Freshman,4,I live in the all girls dorm on campus and I believe that it was fine for my first year but I was not impressed by the little amount of social events or interactions between residents.
College Freshman,4,"As I previously mentioned, my school is extremely welcoming. I instantly felt at home when I toured this campus. It was really important to me that I felt comfortable at whatever school I chose, and that I could see myself living there, thriving. I have made many meaningful friends and have gotten so much out of each class. I wouldn't change a thing."
Recent Alumnus,4,Small class sizes and open opportunities to speak with a professor and build a professional relationship. They do want you to succeed but it is still dependent upon your effort.
Recent Alumnus,4,Financial aid is a core value at the school that otherwise costs a lot. I have significant loans now but I would have had even more if I didn't have a school that worked hard to give me as much help as they could.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Let's be honest, a DIII Lutheran School isn't going to be a mecca for sports but it still has it's relative success and legacy here. It's part of the charm and the familial feeling at school to support the awesome athletes that attend and also those who play, but it's never going to have the fanfare of a DI school. Overall, it's pretty sweet."
Alum,2,"Most of the professors here are White and ignorant. Most of the students here are White, ignorant and sheltered.   Save your money and go to the University of Washington (Seattle campus)."
Alum,2,"Graduated in 2012. School had turned into the typical jackboot licking SJW haven. I started noticing this cultural change towards the last 1-2 years of undergrad. Coupled with the high stocker price and terrible locale, I can’t recommend this school despite having some awesome profs."
Sophomore,2,"I have lived in the parkland area, where PLU is located, most of my life. Seeing PLU from an outside/in perspective as a middle and highschooler is very different from how I see it now as a student there. It is a conpletely different society that lives within PLU’s borders when compared to the outside community. Many PLU students feel entitled and have had many things given to them without having to do much work because of how rich their families are. The society directly outside of PLU encourages the opposite. PLU is a decent school, but a lot of people there are snobby and not down to earth."
College Sophomore,2,im not too sure about it
College Sophomore,2,We let loose on the weekends. Not a party school.
College Junior,2,"The surround area (Parkland) is pretty bad. You can't go a day without hearing sirens of some form. I can now distinguish every type of siren now though. If you've got a car, there are some better places a little further away."
College Freshman,2,Barly anyone goes to football games or any sporting events
College Freshman,2,There is only a couple restaurants in walking distance of the school.
College Senior,2,"There are not many restaurants directly surrounding the school. There is minimal diversity in food and most of the restaurants are fairly low quality. Although this is nice in terms of price, some slightly better quality, exotic restaurants around campus would be appreciated."
College Sophomore,2,PLU is surrounded by a poor area of Tacoma called Parkland. I never feel safe to walk around off campus.
College Sophomore,2,"When I first applied I got two scholarships, then last minute right before I was going to school they took away one of my scholarships when my FASA was updated. I wish I still had that scholarship and I wish I was granted more financial aid."
College Sophomore,2,We only really have fast food restaurants around us and a few good restaurants.
College Junior,2,"The city that the school is technically part of is pretty big but the area the school is in is somewhat out there, there is not much around the campus but food places and even then you have to drive, can't really walk. Walgreen's is the closes and you can tell by the prices they charge, it's a twenty minute drive to get to Safeway or Fred Meyers. To get just about anywhere the fasts way is by taking the highway, after you go through part of town. Other then a few museums in downtown, the mall and froyo there isn't much to do around here."
College Freshman,2,On rainy days the campus floods and had big puddles everywhere
College Freshman,2,The community surrounding my school is not that great. People have warned me about being cautious when riding the bus and also just walking around the area in general.
College Freshman,2,Mostly white people on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Menus have hardly any variety at all, food is mediocre and often has little to no flavor. Questionable at times. TERRIBLE value for the incredibly high amount we pay for food! Half a sandwich that I could make myself for probably 25 cents costs 4 dollars! Outrageous!!!"
College Senior,2,PLU is only unique in how terrible it is.
College Senior,2,"The quality is ok, but the meal plans/ any food at PLU is way too expensive."
College Senior,2,Basically the only diversity at PLU is due to sexuality. 
Junior,1,"The School of Nursing is beyond disorganized. My experience has been worse than I could've ever imagined. They're extremely desperate for instructors, so it seems like they'll take anyone they can get. Passionate professors are few and  far between. I feel extremely dissatisfied with the quality of education relative to the cost. The students who start their nursing education (pre-reqs) at PLU don't have anything else to compare it to, but my prior college/university experiences were far better than what I've experienced here. My biggest regret has been not applying elsewhere and attending PLU."
Alum,1,"The university seems to be diverse online, on their online profile. Their nursing programs to include their graduate ELM and D.N.P programs are not very diverse.   The minority ratio is 1%, compared to their Caucasian population. If you are a minority of any sort, this may not be the school for you. If you apply and are accepted, you may not graduate from their programs. You are advised to do in depth research. Find other minorities who have been in the program and listen to their experiences."
Junior,1,"After losing my scholarship due to getting a multitude of teachers who either can't teach or don't care, I left the university only to be fined additional money FOR leaving."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have a Greek system. I feel like Greek life is overrated and all Greek life does is party.
Recent Alumnus,1,No greek life here. Plenty of bros though....but they're all good.
College Sophomore,1,I have never been to a party
College Sophomore,1,We don't have a Greek system.
College Sophomore,1,The school does not allow people to live off campus till they are 20 which is ridiculous. They do not help with off campus housing.
College Senior,1,Really bad in every way.
College Senior,1,Complete waste of four years of my life.
College Senior,1,Don't go to PLU if you want to have fun.
College Senior,1,"Only good bar is The Haven, and that's only because of their drink specials."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no Greek Life. Never has been. With the exception of Phi Psi or other similar ""fraternities"" that merely serve as honor groups or community service groups to various majors."
College Sophomore,1,absolutely nothing to do on the weekends and the only thing safe is the campus..the surrounding area is way too dangerous to feel comfortable
College Sophomore,1,All of the nightlife is about 10 miles away. Parkland is not known for its nightlife.
College Sophomore,1,PLU is a drug safe school. I don't know anyone who sells or uses drugs.
College Freshman,1,Don't Go to Clubs – I wouldn't recommend going to clubs around PLU because there's always reports of fights or even gang activity. The best thing is to keep yourself away from the clubs to prevent harm to you or your friends that you're with at the time. Go bowling or find someother nightlife entertainment.
College Sophomore,1,Parkland is very drabby and doesn't offer much to do. If you were to take PLU and land it in Tacoma where the UPS campus is it would be a lot better of a scene. 
College Sophomore,1,VERY HAR – Don't really reward students who actually need the aid.
College Freshman,1,"School of Acting – This school has a lot of art, music, and theater students. Most are very friendly but sometimes you don't exactly get to know the real them because they could just be acting friendly. I don't quite feel the realness of the school and a homely feeling here. I wouldn't choose this school again because everyone already has their own cliques before coming to the school because they are from the same area of town or went to high school together. I rather have a variety of students who welcome all types of different people."

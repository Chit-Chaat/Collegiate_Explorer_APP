Sophomore,5,My overall experience with Indiana University-Northwest was excellent. All the professors and staff help the students with no hesitations. I am proud to be called a student here.
Sophomore,5,My online experience was great. I have been taking online classes ever since I started college in 2018. The big change to having all classes online was no challenge for me.
Freshman,5,"I will be attending IUN next fall and I am very excited! The academics are great, the sports are rising in quality, and the art department offers so much. The only downfall is the location, but once past that, it has everything you need to prepare for future jobs."
Freshman,5,This is my first semester at IUN and it has been a very good one! I never really did well in High School and I was worried it was going to be like that here as well but so far my grades have been really good and I have really enjoyed my time here so far.
Sophomore,5,"I like that all staff members ranging from teachers, librarians, student support services, advisors, admissions and more were very hands on and willing to help you out in any way possible. I also really enjoyed some of the extra study sessions that the school provided to its students. I think the only thing I would change is the prices at the cafeteria. They tend to be a little pricey and a lot of the students are already paying a lot of money to attend IUN. Overall, I am very glad I chose IUN and that IUN chose me."
Freshman,5,I am a freshman in college here and I am loving it already. The staff is so nice and very helpful. I have met new people and have made new friends. IUN creates an atmosphere where you feel it's okay to be yourself and I absolutely love that the most.
Freshman,5,"I have always had a great experience going to the campus! I've only been there a few times but each time staff and students are friendly and are a huge help, especially with the incoming freshmen."
Sophomore,5,"I like Indiana University Northwest quite a bit. The campus is nice and well-kept, and there are always several campus police officers walking or driving around, keeping an eye out for the students. Plus, there are emergency call buttons strategically placed around campus for students to press to alert police officers of an issue. I enjoy the classes offered, and I appreciate the ample amount of online classes offered."
Junior,5,I received a great education. It had my major. The teachers really cared. It was the right price. There isn't much social life. The pre-med and actuary programs are some of the best the Chicago area. Actuary Science has a national ranking.
Freshman,5,I currently am enrolled here. I will be starting my classes in August. I took many tours and have visited many times. I absolutely love everything about the school. Everyone also is so welcoming and very nice.
Freshman,5,"Low tuition, great programs!!
Easy class scheduling
Lots of choices, online and at university!!!
Close to home, so I can live at home and work and go to college!!!"
Sophomore,5,I love how diverse IUN is and how dedicated the professors are to insuring you are successful in your college career.
Senior,5,"Juanita Thomas

August 20, 2018

Indiana University is a great school to attend. The professors are awesome. They work with you to help you achieve your goals. The professors care very much about their students. They don't brush you off and they will work with you at a moderate pace to help you succeed in passing your class. 
One thing I would like to come back is a vender that sells cold sandwiches as well as hot foods,  for instance; tuna salad sandwiches, turkey and cheese and so on.
 You can't go wrong choosing this school as a college to go to.

student,
Juanita Thomas"
Sophomore,5,Its a very diverse school! It is easy finding classes and everything is in one area. Most teachers truly care about your education. Cost is reasonable. They even have a Starbucks!
Freshman,5,"The Indiana University Northwest is a very fun, safe, and affordable! The have an excellent staff and even have their own police on campus."
Freshman,5,"I haven't started college yet, I start on August 20th. I have visited a couple times and I can say I am quite impressed with the staff! Everyone is kind and do their best to help you!"
Sophomore,5,The food is ok but could be better. Most of the professors that I have had so far have been pretty good.
Alum,5,"I never knew how the world really worked until I experienced the many classes of my major (general studies) and my minor (business administration).  Now I feel informed and confident about my place in the world.  The professors were professional and humane.  The staff was helpful and the students were engaging and friendly.  Even though I struggled through Algebra, I loved all of my classes.  In spite of my initial concerns over location the Gary Indiana area is safe and its inhabitants are friendly and well mannered and welcoming.  Even though there is no night life, Chicago, a large metropolitan area is under forty miles away."
Junior,5,I like going to IUN because of the small class sizes and the overall education you receive from there. I have grown as an individual going there and the professors are there for you every step of the way.
Niche User,5,"Very beautiful new building, nice professors, and very nice meeting areas to study and work on academic work."
Freshman,5,Every time I go on campus everyone is nice and welcoming! Advisers a extremely helpful in every aspect! Glad I chose to go to IUN!
Junior,5,teachers and staff are very supportive overall great education facilities are great and students are very friendly
Junior,5,I love attending Indiana university northwest. The instructors are very patient and helpful. This college has a lot of diverse students attending.
Freshman,5,I have only been at this campus for a short time but I already love it! The campus it self is so beautiful and not that hard to navigate around. The students are also very kind along with the teachers. I have been shown the different resources they have that could help me succeed in my college career.
Sophomore,5,I like how the school is smaller. Class rooms are not huge lecture halls. I have met and connected with a few teachers that I know i can go to for help anytime if I'm in their class or not.
Freshman,5,"Indiana University Northwest is a campus where students can feel they are at home where as on other campuses, students may often feel a bit lost or alone. Although it is a commuter college, there are many ways to get involved in the school such as sports, clubs, and work! Indiana University Northwest is committed to its students and faculty. Students have many opportunities to work with professors and coordinators on large projects that teaches students how to think critically. No professor, coordinator, or advisor will turn a student away if he or she needs help with anything. Everyone there wants the students to succeed and give them a sense of confidence when they leave IUN."
Junior,5,"Indiana University Northwest is an awesome school. They celebrate the differences in students on campus, and the staff really tries to help students achieve their highest potential."
College Junior,5,"I honestly believe that I will have an advantage using my degree from Indiana University Northwest to obtain a job.  IU is a recognized school throughout the nation, and I know that my GPA will remain high.  A high GPA from a recognized school will give me an advantage over others when I am looking for a job and eventually applying to Masters school."
College Sophomore,5,I have reasonable class sizes. I always feel I can ask a question at any time. I can get to know my professors easily
College Sophomore,5,"Although my campus is located in a relatively unsafe area, as long as I do not leave campus, I feel very safe. Police officers are security are always present."
College Sophomore,5,IUN is close to home and more affordable than other options
College Freshman,5,"Graduating from this school will help me a lot in the job force, or when applying to graduate school."
College Sophomore,5,"You have to live off campus to go to my university, so there are plenty of options"
College Sophomore,5,"I go to a commuter campus, so there are a wide variety of restaurants in the area!"
College Sophomore,5,All of the staff and administration are strict about following the rules
College Freshman,5,Everyone lives at home.. it's free.
College Freshman,5,Drive wherever you want. It's a commuter school.
College Sophomore,5,The campus clinic provides many important services for affordable prices. Vaccines are also administered fit free on certain days at the beginning of the semester. The caps police is very effective at protecting the students and providing assistance with any vehicle trouble and even escort students during late hours to their cars for their safety.
College Freshman,5,We have a very diverse campus due to the area where it is located.
College Freshman,5,I like the administration as far as I am concerned. But half the things on the list do not apply to IUN.
College Senior,5,I love when we celebrate different people cultures
College Freshman,5,This University is top noche
College Sophomore,5,We dont use drugs on my campus
College Sophomore,5,"Campus police are every where, even though  the school is not in the safest location I have never felt unsafe on campus."
College Freshman,5,"The library and student resource centers are amazing. They help us students so much, we can collaborate with classmates or study quietly in an corner."
College Sophomore,5,It is so easy to access computers here and to print the necessary information you need. I would highly recommend a laptop so you can do your school work on the go or even in class. I don't think a printer is necessary with all of the printing networks available at the school.
College Sophomore,5,This school is basically the melting pot with the ethnic and racial diversity.
College Sophomore,5,My major is criminal justice and the program is great. The workload is at a manageable capacity and the opportunities available are good you just have to listen to what they tell you.
College Sophomore,5,There is so many majors and programs at this university it makes you second guess if you want to continue with your own with all of the opportunities available at this school.
College Sophomore,5,The financial aid is available to those who apply and they will notify when the deadline is approaching so it is a equal opportunity for everyone.
College Sophomore,5,The health and safety on campus is great. The police force there is visible and the health sights are available to the people at the university and the community.
College Sophomore,5,There are many clubs and activities available at the university you just have to find what best fits your personality.
College Freshman,5,"The computer labs on campus are extremely up to date and fast. Printing policies are easy to navigate, and the reliability of the network is second to none. I can always connect with my personal laptop and phone."
College Freshman,5,"Like I said earlier, the campus police are extremely nice and always around the students and talking to us. Everywhere you look you see a campus police officer, and they are always patrolling the surrounding area. Unfortunately the surrounding area can have potential danger. Even though there may be crime and violence near the campus, it feels extremely safe around campus because the presence of the police is always there."
College Sophomore,5,"Because the class sizes are smaller, students would get more face to face recognition with their professor. This is to their benefit because their professors would get to know them on a more personal level. By this, the students would more likely be able to receive excellent recommendation letters. Most of the professors are very challenging, and they make you work for your grade. To increase your grades, the supplemental instruction sessions aid the students understanding of a topic. These sessions take place on the second floor of the library. Also, the third floor of the library offers great places to study because silence is required."
College Freshman,5,If it snows a lot or is to cold or severe storms the school is very good about canceling classes.
College Freshman,5,"There are computer labs and computer stations all over campus, tech support is always helpful."
College Freshman,5,"Campus parking is great, it's cheap and easily accessible."
College Freshman,5,I like it a lot because i am able to work and still get a education.
Recent Alumnus,5,should be bane in schools.
Freshman,4,This specific campus goes above and beyond for their students and staff. They remain patient and compromise with students to try and accommodate their needs. I wouldn't want to attend any other campus!
Freshman,4,"From what I've experienced so far, the professors are so nice and understanding. They make themselves available to students in many ways and always encourage questions"
Freshman,4,The school was very nice and helpful during a tough period in my life where I did not know if I could get back into school! They are great!
Freshman,4,The professors really push the students to their academic limits! They challenge the students to think for themselves and the students are able to learn critical thinking skills at the same time.
Sophomore,4,I love how all the teachers are really nice and try very hard to help you succeed in college. Many of the teachers have office hours and will give you study tips for their class.
Freshman,4,"So far attending Indiana University has went great for me! it is situated in Gary - which i could certainly see driving people away from attending there. For those who don't know Gary was formerly murder capital of the United States  - The reason i chose to go here for college is because its near home for me , so i don't have to drive far to get there.  i wouldn't want to go off campus at all unless you want to run the risk of losing your life.
  Now as a school IUN is amazing for the opportunities it brings the area. The school ."
Junior,4,I love how small and intimate this campus is. It's always easy to find help when needed and easy to meet and get to know people who are interested or pursuing the same things you are.
Sophomore,4,"IUN is a commutor school, so you do not get the experiences you may get if you lived on campus at a different school. I love the professors, they try their hardest to work with you."
Sophomore,4,I believe student and professor involvement on campus should increase. Student life is extremely poor. The surrounding area is abandoned without any sense of security.
Senior,4,"Good teacher-to-student ratio. More hands-on interaction with professors than at IU Bloomington. With so many students at bigger schools, students are not always given the amount of attention and focus they need. At IUN, though, the professors are very invested in your success and professional development. In particular, the geology department head, Kris Huysken, goes above and beyond her obligated duties. Not only has she and other professors helped students find and apply for internships, but if the student is in good academic standing they will also go with you to visit a college campus to check out a graduate program you may be interested in. Overall, although IUN does not have the widest spectrum of majors, the ones that are offered are taught by faculty that are genuinely concerned with your success during and after your time at IUN."
Junior,4,"Over all, I have been pleased with my experience at Indiana University Northwest. The campus is very safe and i personally have never had an issue, my only complaint about the physical aspect of the campus is parking. With such a large, and growing student body I think there needs to be some sort of solution."
Sophomore,4,IUN is a good school for those trying to earn a bachelors degree and make a start into the world. It is a comute college however so there is a drive and the surrounding area is not the best
Freshman,4,"Professors are very helpful and reluctant to help you succeed.  Although the campus is not in the best location or is the newest, the staff makes up for it.  There is a lot of versatility throughout campus.  Many different events take place every week that highlight different cultures.  These events include food, sometimes dancing, and even movies. Overall, IUN has been a pleasant experience for me."
Sophomore,4,I like how helpful the professors are. I would not change anything. I have been going to IUN for two years and it has been great.
Sophomore,4,"Indiana University Northwest is a really good school. The professors are not overloaded with larger numbers of students, so there's plenty of time for student-teacher interaction. One thing that i would like to see change is the overall diversity of majors at the school."
Graduate Student,4,Indiana University provides a great atmosphere for those who want to go to a university locally. They have very welcoming professors and staff.
Freshman,4,This university is very easy to get involved in. It also feels like a larger school even though it is a commuter college.
Graduate Student,4,"The school was nice, clean, and the professors were always willing to go above and beyond to help. The only bad thing about this campus would be the parking situation, however, it was cut down for a good reason. The new Arts and sciences building is absolutely beautiful and worth the trouble of finding parking now."
Freshman,4,"I honestly love iun. Everyone is very nice and willing to help if you don't understand something. The advisor are really good help, they make you feel like you are at home so that you can gain trust. I would recommend this college to everybody."
Alum,4,"Indiana University Northwest is a great school for science and preprofessional studies including Dentistry, Medicine, etc as well as career programs such as criminal justice, nursing, and radiology. 4 stars for the lack of student amenities on campus and surrounding activities, which leave students with little to nothing to do on campus after class."
Freshman,4,This is a great school and all the help you get from everyone is great as well. I was well taken care of from the very beginning. The campus is well put together and is quite appealing too.
Junior,4,"My overall experience at Indiana University Northwest has been great so far. I have been attending school here for three years now and I haven't had any problems. I thought at first it would suck because I stayed home and didn't go away to school, but honestly I regret nothing. I have met some amazing people and awesome professors. Everyone on campus is there to help one another and its a great environment. There are many different clubs to join, classes to take, and people to talk to!"
Freshman,4,"The Professors are nice, and willing to help whenever you need it. The campus police are always there to keep watch, and it feels safe overall. The student services help ease the stress, and keeps you focus."
College Junior,4,I've only ever heard of people getting hit while crossing the road at IUN.
College Junior,4,"I'm not really too sure about this topic. I couldn't find squat for a job with my Art degree.  At the same time, I don't think that was because of the quality of the name of the school I attended. I think that's a bunch of crap anyways.  It should really be about the quality and intelligence of th eperson with the degree. I just believe it was because it was an Art degree."
College Junior,4,I went to IUN from 2009 - 2013 and got a Bachelor's of Art in Fine Arts.  I am not returning to the same school to get a Bachelor's of Science in Geology.
College Junior,4,I really enjoy being a student at Indiana University Northwest. I feel like the professors really care about their students and challenge us to learn. It also saves me a lot of money and is very convenient so that I can have a job while I go to school.
College Sophomore,4,The athletics at school are great because the coaches really stay on top of the athletes and push them towards great success.
College Sophomore,4,I would have to say that my experience so far while at school has been one of a kind even though I have not been there along time.
College Sophomore,4,"So far, I have had a great experience attending Indiana University Northwest. The staff including counsellors, teachers, tech help, office workers and cafeteria staff are all so friendly and very helpful. When i felt overwhelmed or confused about finances or homework or even how to work my laptop, there were always helping hands in that building who showed genuine concern for my future success."
Recent Alumnus,4,"We have campus police officers walking around the campus all the time, there aren't any dorms so I haven't really heard many issues about sexual assault."
Recent Alumnus,4,I have had a great experience at my school thus far. It's close to home and most professors are doing a good job teaching what should be known. I have gained lots of knowledge from my professors and I hope to gain more. I will be returning to this school for my Master's degree because these professors want nothing but the best for us.
College Sophomore,4,"A degree from this school is still an Indiana University degree, although it is a satellite campus from the main campus in Bloomington. It is a better value"
College Sophomore,4,No complaints so far.. My friends and I do get a bit nervous at night.
College Freshman,4,"Gary, where Indiana University Northwest is located, is a rough town. However, the police have made the area around campus very safe."
College Freshman,4,The athletics at Indiana University Northwest are great. Everybody loves to get involved in the  intramural s they have to offer..
College Freshman,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at Indiana University Northwest. It is easy to get to from my hometown, and the campus is beautiful. The professors known the subjects they are teaching, and really care about the students."
College Freshman,4,IUN has its own police unit on hand at all times and are willing to walk people to their cars late at night if they don't feel safe.
College Freshman,4,Most of the professors I've had at this school are very friendly and accessible and eager to help their students.
College Freshman,4,We have a great career center to help hook students up with internships and also campus jobs.
College Junior,4,The professors are passionate and knowledgeable about the subject they are teaching.
College Junior,4,It is reasonably priced and convenient. The professors are very passionate about what they teach.
College Freshman,4,"The classes are interesting, yet the online system our school uses is difficult to navigate."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I was able to attend a COAS conference and had to extend research during my Psychology Lab Course, that was pretty neat and very interesting. Most of my professors are wonderful and I have enjoyed the four years attending. I am definitely considering going back for my Master's degree."
Recent Alumnus,4,I do not attend athletic sports due to my disability but I know that they are a good part of the school and those who join enjoy the sports there.
College Junior,4,The academics offered are great. IUN is always expanding the types of academics that they offer.
College Junior,4,Most students find work after upon graduating.
College Junior,4,I have had pretty good experiences with most professors. Only one professor sticks out to me that I disliked. Class sizes are small.
College Junior,4,I am in the Radiography program at IUN and I love it. The program does such a great job at giving students the best education and gives us a lot of clinical experience.
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy most of my professors, because they have helped me grow educationally and personally. My school has high student spirit and involvement, as well as taking a stand against sexual assault and violence. IUN has a beautiful campus and I feel safe there."
College Junior,4,"I would choose this school again because its small and most of the classes are small but then i wouldn't because there isn't a whole ""college experience"". There are not any dorms to stay at and not many activities to do."
College Junior,4,My school is unique because its a big University and a lot of majors to choose from.
College Senior,4,"The professors at Indiana University Northwest are amazing! They truly care about their students success and understand the population and region in which they work. The professors are understanding of our schedules and are willing to work around our needs as long as we make the effort to communicate with them. The students are friendly, and although I have yet to join a student organization I have had a great social experience"
College Sophomore,4,"IUN has a great curriculum and the teachers are all very helpful and motivated to do their very best for their students. a lot is dependent on you test taking skills and the teacher gives plenty of detail for you to study for the tests. the campus is beautiful and everyone is so friendly, I have met a lot of my good friends at college and I wouldn't want to go back and change anything."
College Sophomore,4,We have a catering service who caters and makes all of our food. It's great!
College Freshman,4,Living at home and commuting to school is one of the things I enjoy about college.
College Freshman,4,I feel safe when attending classes.
College Sophomore,4,The restaurants near the school are great but i wouldnt know about the bars since im under 21.
College Sophomore,4,I got the Special Academic Scholarship for IUN
College Sophomore,4,"There are quite a few different classes to choose from, but not many people take classes outside what is required for their major. Career Services sends the students emails about potential job openings in the area. I also receive emails regarding various classes that I may be interested in."
College Junior,2,"You don't really hear anything about the teams that IUN has or about tryouts for the teams.  The gum membership is a separate cost and, thought I've never been to the campus gym, I've been told that the equipment is always broken and is old and ratty."
College Sophomore,2,I haven't personally seen any athletic activities but it is a small school and not one of my focuses. I do love to workout and would much rather work out at my gym than here.
College Junior,2,I don't know anything about Greek life on campus. I don't know where they have housing or what options are available. It doesn't seem to play a big role on campus.
College Freshman,2,There are barely any sororities or fraternities if we even have any.
College Sophomore,2,"My school is located in a city that is bad with crime, but the campus is very safe. I would not live here after graduation."
College Junior,2,"No options available near campus. Simply due to the location. However, easy access to highway leads to more off-campus options."
College Junior,2,"Financial aid office is of no help. Worst office of the school. They lack in actually ""helping"" students. The counselors are not helpful, when asking questions regarding aid its a one way answer. ALWAYS a problem every year."
College Freshman,2,In downtown its dangerous in late night
College Freshman,2,They don't do much to get other people to join. I never really hear about their upcoming events and such.
College Freshman,2,It took forever to get back to me.
Recent Alumnus,2,"No much Greek Life on campus, this is the first semester I've seen a sorority on campus actually."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The gym is small, and not many people go to this area."
Recent Alumnus,2,"People don't party much, the school is typically small circles of friends."
Recent Alumnus,2,Not very many choices for an off-campus meal.
College Junior,2,We're an ugly area of the country. You have to try and find beauty in their personalities and even though are as horrid as their faces.
College Junior,2,It seems like high school cafeteria food - you know what I mean.
College Junior,2,One main cafeteria and a small cafe in the library. Closes early so plan to bring food if you have night classes.
College Senior,2,"The people who work in the financial aid office does not want to help you sometimes. Especially the lady who works at the front desk.    There was a time that I came in, and I asked to see someone and she said one of the advisors has someone in her office.  And their was not a student in her office.    I decided to wait for her for 20 mins and she didn't want to see me."
College Sophomore,2,it is too much crime in this area
College Sophomore,2,Not enough for all the students I have had to skip class before cause I couldn't park anywhere.
College Sophomore,2,We all drive cars and struggle to find enough parking.
College Sophomore,2,No one really pays attention to sports here as we don't live on campus and we have a small gym.
College Sophomore,2,As a commuter school there is not much of a nightlife around campus but if you make friends you can still have fun.
College Freshman,2,"Nothing to do, very crime ful city"
College Freshman,2,"I love my school, but the surrounding area can be a little intimidating. The campus is safe, but after dark roaming off of the campus could possibly be a bad decision. Other than that, the attractions are mainly on campus and so are most of the activities. I haven't gone shopping anywhere nearby, and I'm not sure how dining is either."
College Junior,2,"Some teachers are awesome, but others made me dread going to class."
College Junior,2,I think there are only two frats/sororities and they are both African American ones
College Junior,2,This school is filled with sexist male teenagers. I've had multiple teenagers approach me with disgusting sexual comments and I feel like I've been violated by the time I leave the school.
College Junior,2,"You pretty much need a car to attend this campus, but the parking is usually terrible, so you'll probably have a long walk to the campus."
College Junior,2,"nothing for the students, we have to live at home"
College Junior,2,Not enough variety of healthier options. Mainly fast-food. No ethnic cuisine.
College Junior,2,"When it snows it is difficult to get around. When it rains, it floods. When the weather drops below 10 and 0 degrees school is closed. When it's too hot sometimes the AC is not enough. When it is too cold sometimes the heat is not enough."
College Junior,2,area around campus is bad. dont stay passed 7pm on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Northwest Indiana weather has horrible winters, and decent summers."
College Sophomore,2,"The only parties that take place are usually at someone's house.
"
College Sophomore,2,Dining options off campus are very limited.
College Sophomore,2,"Although the process of upgrading the local area is gradual, there is much needed improvement."
College Junior,2,I personally wouldnt be caught dead around this area at night. Too many shootings and robberies. 
College Junior,2,We have no Greeks on campus
College Junior,2,"The atmosphere of this college blows. I hate when I visit my friends college with a actual campus and enjoy myself, just to come back to lame IUN. This school needs improvements (in every area)."
College Junior,2,"IUN does not have a campus. This is not a traditional college. Being in the Gary area, you are better off living in a differnt town nearby and making a camute to campus."
College Freshman,2,I don't think there are that many internship opportunities available
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, I am not that happy, and I wouldn't do it again, that is why I plan on transferring, because I feel that I would enjoy that major, more than I would enjoy my current major"
College Senior,2,"The athletic events  on campus are attended, but not often."
College Senior,2,"Since we are branch of IUB, the things to major in are very limited."
College Senior,2,The workload as being a psychology major is not very difficult.
College Senior,2,It's very banal on campus and everyone seem to do their own thing.
College Senior,2,"There are issues with crimes because we live in Gary, but police are always around."
College Senior,2,"Although parking permits are very inexpensive, it is hard to find a parking spot on campus. I find it easier to park off campus and walk to the campus."
College Senior,2,I have never used the public transportation so I personally don't know how good or bad it is. I would hope it was good and convenient for the students especially the ones without their own transportation.
College Junior,2,Facilities are OK for the type of school it is. The campus is small but has a nice space. The Fine art program allows for more of a community atmosphere among students with studio spaces for advanced painting students and hours that encourage students to come in and work during non-class hours.
College Junior,2,"Not enough parking, and I cannot believe that faculty are even required to pay for a parking permit."
College Sophomore,2,At Indiana University Northwest there are not any dorms so you have to go back and forth everyday for classes so they really isn't reason to know much about the scene because Im not here long enough to find out.
College Sophomore,2,"I've never personally run into problems, but I just don't feel that others are happy with it."
College Junior,2,"Weather can be absolutely terrible when everyone's commuting to school, and campus is usually never closed due to weather. You just have to leave early and drive carefully!"
College Junior,2,"Unless Im just not paying attention, it is very confusing as to where the students can park, and it is also kind of far, with the exception of the parking lot across from hawthorne hall."
College Senior,2,"IUN is average, it is a short drive away from chicago which is the best part about it. It is not really surrounded by a lot of riveting entertainment."
College Senior,2,"My school has great educators who have lots of real world experience and bring that to the class room. However, the non-education related faculty are not extremely helpful. Whenever you have a question, they just send you from department to department until you are back to where you started with no information. It gives the impression that they don't really know what they are doing and you are just left to figure things out by yourself."
College Freshman,2,I am currently a Pre-Nursing major. It is very difficult to get in contact with any of the advisers for the Nursing Program. All though it is an outstanding program.. it is hard to know what to do to get in if you cannot talk to anyone.
College Freshman,2,I think it was very difficult to get a hold of the financial aid office.
College Sophomore,1,Gary isn't the place you want to be housing for IUN. I'd much rather travel 20 mins to my house in Scherervile.
College Sophomore,1,I have no idea what greek life even consists of. Absolutely no interest as well as many people I know.
College Junior,1,We don't have campus housing. It would be great if they offered it.
College Freshman,1,There are not many places to choose from to dine off-campus. I have trouble finding places in this area. They need more variety around the school. The only place that is semi-close to the campus is Denny's. That place is somewhat cheap in its quality and cost.
College Freshman,1,There never really are parties at all.
College Freshman,1,There is no party scene. It is a commuter college.
College Freshman,1,"I go to school in Gary, Indiana. I do not expect off campus dining options."
College Freshman,1,"I go to a commuter college, so there is one sorority and one fraternity on campus and that is it. They weren't even aware we had any at orientation."
College Sophomore,1,"I've never seen it from the inside, but exterior was enough to make people not want to live there."
College Sophomore,1,"Driving through Gary was the worst because of all the potholes. The roads were hardly plowed. Therefore, it was very frustrating to try to get to school on time. Because of all the snow, the parking spots shift."
College Sophomore,1,"Considering the location of the university, I wouldn't recommend living in these buildings for safety reasons."
College Junior,1,the program itself is ok but the staff and faculty are horrible.
College Junior,1,"I hang out with people I've known, never anyone I meet at school."
College Junior,1,"Gary, IN is in the hood."
College Junior,1,The people in the financial aid office don't care to take time with the students and rush in & out
College Junior,1,I was charged $60 for parking and it is terrible. The school either needs to except less students or add another parking lot.
College Junior,1,I was very hopeful about my major before applying to this college. The advisors and instructors at this school have been very unhelpful and I am starting to feel very discouraged.
College Junior,1,Houses are cheap. But most are either burnt or very worn down.
College Junior,1,"This is the worst possible place for a school. Crime rates are very high. I had a man try to grab my purse at a gas station outside of the school at the beginning of the semester. There is a Rally's outside of the school, but I found a chunk of hair in my burger, so I will most likely never eat there again. There is nothing good about this school or the location that it is in."
College Junior,1,There has been at least a weeks worth of missed classes because of the weather. And the bad weather has created terrible potholes in the street in front of the school.
College Junior,1,I don't think there is any.
College Junior,1,Having to hurry out of the school and the city to avoid being killed.
College Junior,1,I've been to other colleges and so far this is the only college that has given me a difficult time with financial aid.
College Junior,1,"This campus is in a very unsafe area and I am afraid even when on campus. The other day there was a fight inside the school that went  on for a long time and no one came to break it up. There are a few police officers, but they mostly patrol the area outside of the school."
College Junior,1,"I'm taking three classes that are all scantron tests, there are no papers, homework, or quizzes. Some people may like this, but I need the extra work to help with understanding the materials. I also think this shows that the instructors are lazy and don't want to grade any extra work. I can't explain how much I regret coming to this university. The people are rude and the courses are ridiculous and a huge waste of time and money."
College Junior,1,we don't have anything to offer. just small groups and clubs
College Junior,1,there isn't one at all
College Junior,1,only way to campus is to drive yourself. campus isnt big so transportation isnt needed.
College Junior,1,i dont eat off campus. i go straight to campus and leave. its not in a nice area.
College Freshman,1,The surrounding area is very dangerous.
College Freshman,1,"IU Northwest has been a horrible experience for myself. I went in not knowing what I wanted to do, and when I thought I knew what I wanted they had very little to offer me."
College Freshman,1,I'm not currently in a program my school doesn't really offer anything in my field I want to study so I am transferring schools.
College Freshman,1,It's not a good area so off campus housing is not a good option
College Freshman,1,"We dont have dorms like every other college, we dont have fraternity"
College Freshman,1,"There is no party life on the campus, it is located in a bad area."
College Sophomore,1,There is no campus housing.
College Junior,1,"There is nothing local around. The closest thing to fun, is Chicago."
College Junior,1,There is no on campus housing. That really sucks.
College Freshman,1,"The atmosphere is awful, there are abandoned buildings here and there, safety is a concern, but the campus police do a good job, there are malls and professional sports within 20 miles so it is not that bad"
College Senior,1,The housing is restricted to medical students only.
College Senior,1,"We are in Gary, with much history, but not the safest environment."
College Senior,1,"Many of the faculty are really cranky and do not fully disclose what a student should do, when in time of need or asking help.  Usually the faculty will have an abrupt attitude or talk down to you like you should've already known the in's and out's of financial aid."
College Freshman,1,Sports aren't very big on the IUN campus life. I personally have never been to a game and they don't do a good job sponsoring the games of different sports. 
College Freshman,1,I would not recommend going off campus to eat. The food on campus is great. 
College Freshman,1,There aren't many  fraternity or sorority on campus. 
College Freshman,1,"the financial aid office is not a fun, inviting place to be. They are very rude and never seem to know any answers. Every time I go in the office I always get a different answer and it is very frustrating. "
College Freshman,1,They suck. They only have three sports teams at IUN.
College Sophomore,1,its not safe and not reasonable at all
College Sophomore,1,There is never any parking. We're forced to park on the streets and then we get traffic tickets because of it. Absolutely ridiculous
College Junior,1,"Again, IUN is a commuter campus. With the majority of its students working  and living off campus, it is a challenge to engage students in activities."
College Junior,1,Not very attractive people go here. Most people are not very friendly
College Junior,1,Absolutely nothing. Nobody would want to be seen in Gary
College Junior,1,The most of the professors are crazy and can't even teach.
College Junior,1,At certain times finding a parking spot is impossible to find. You just have to try having your classes early to get a good parking spot.
College Senior,1,"My school is located in a very bad area. I go to school, stay on campus, and leave right after classes. There is not much to do around campus because it is a commuter school. There are no dorms, and people travel from all over northwest Indiana to attend classes here."
College Sophomore,1,"To be honest, I never hear about any games going on at Indiana University Northwest. I am aware that we do have different sports teams. Some of my friends are on the cheerleading team, for example. However, there are never even any posters or flyers as to when games are around campus. There are flyers for just about everything else in the library and other school buildings. I do get e-mails from time to time asking people to join the intramural sports teams."
College Senior,1,"IUN is a commuter college, there is no on campus housing. It would be nice if there were apartments affiliated with the school to offer some discounted student housing."
College Freshman,1,There is not much of a social scene at my school. As a commuter school we are mostly here for an education and that's it.
College Senior,1,The school is located in gary and safety for students is a constant concern
College Senior,1,"I love criminal justice. Some of the staff are very helpful. Some will make your education a living hell. Been there done that. You have to pay for everything. You   are required to take too many classes. The cost of an education is expensive, yet the  unecessary classes and the mood swings are the pits."

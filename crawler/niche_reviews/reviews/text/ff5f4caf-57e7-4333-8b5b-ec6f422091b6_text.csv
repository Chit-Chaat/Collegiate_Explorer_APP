Senior,5,"Manchester is a great university because the teachers are really invested in your learning. I had many teachers give us their personal phone number and they always told us that they could contact us, even if it wasn't school related."
Senior,5,"Yes, I took classes online due to COVID-19. I was not used to online classes so it took a little bit to adjust. But I think the adjustment went as smoothly as it could considering everything. I know they tried really hard to convert their classes to online and I appreciate that."
Niche User,5,I would like the transfer application process to be easier! It was so hard to transfer and ended up wasting so much time trying to get all of the documents together. Now I am half a year behind!
Sophomore,5,"I loved all of the people that I met because they became my best friends. Everyone is so close and you cannot go anywhere on campus without seeing a friendly face. I love the relationships you develop with professor s and coaches and they truly do care for you. I love the small knit community because it makes it feel like home. I always wanted to go to a small school and meet amazing people, and Manchester University has just that!"
Freshman,5,"The small class size and availability of help. There are many resources like tutoring, asking professors questions and the writing center where they will proof read and help develop your papers and other assignments. Although the campus is very small there are a lot of things to occupy time here, like sporting events and other clubs and volunteering options."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy Manchester University due to the small community and various opportunities to get involved with the school. Some students dislike the school due to the fact that North Manchester is a very small town, but I feel MU does an excellent job at creating fun and exciting activities on the weekends to participate in if you'd like to spend time with friends or get out of your dorm for a little while. The sports events at Manchester are also opportunities that ensure a great time. Although I am only a first-year student, the staff and professors I've encountered seem to genuinely care about their students and are passionate about the topic they are teaching. For the short time I've been at this school I have never once felt left out or lost because I know they have multiple sources available for help and several people that are constantly their for each and every student."
Alum,5,Professors were well-trained and knowledgeable in their areas of study. Campus always had an activity going on. It's a close-knit community.
Freshman,5,Manchester University is a very good school and gives off the sense of community. All of my teachers are excellent teachers.
Freshman,5,This university is a great place and it feels like home which most universities don't have the home feeling.
Sophomore,5,"I loved Manchester! It is smaller than your traditional college, but that is what makes it great. I like when things are personal and Manchester is like a tight-knit community and everyone knows everyone. You will definitely feel like somebody and everyone will notice you! I have met several of the faculty and believe me when I say that they want what is best for your education. Manchester University offers so many resources to whatever major you choose. I would not change a thing!"
Niche User,5,"I rate this university five stars because when I visited this university, the campus was amazing. I feel that this school has many things to offer, One thing they have to offer is their Masters of Accountancy program that allows you to get your Bachelor's and Master's Degree in a total of 4 years."
Sophomore,5,"I love my school! I chose Manchester University because it was a small town college that felt like home the minute I arrived for a visit. After attending the school myself for a year, that only rang even more true. There was not a single class where I felt that the professor did not have my best interest in their mind. I had a personal relationship with each one, which really helped me keep a positive outlook on my academics. I learned a lot at MU, and being surrounded by people who wanted to help me learn is very encouraging."
Freshman,5,I really enjoy the environment on campus. People are always willing to help you be successful. The professors are able to spend time one on one with students. I like how there are different food choices on campus. The study abroad program is definitely something that drew me to Manchester. I have enjoyed expanding my education here and being exposed to different subjects.
Freshman,5,I liked Manchester University because it is a small university and everyone is very friendly and helpful. They have a beautiful campus and the atmosphere is outstanding.
Freshman,5,I plan to attend this fall.  I have made multiple visits. I have also had several over night visits.  Everyone is very friendly.  The campus is small and pretty.  The class sizes are small so I will be able to get the one on one connection i want.  I also plan to participate in athletics and extra curricular groups.
Freshman,5,I am so excited to become a Manchester student.  The professors and students feel like a family away from home
Freshman,5,the college is amazing and the community is close so everyone is willing to help each other with anything
Sophomore,5,Great school. Great accounting program. They do a lot of out reach with companies that make it easier to get interviews with them.
Junior,5,"It is a small school, but has a fun atmosphere. There is always something going on! The classroom sizes are small and the professors are always friendly and available to help students."
Freshman,5,Manchester University is a very welcome environment. Students from all backgrounds get together to learn new things about each other and the world. The school provides a diverse atmosphere while feeling like you are at home. The classes are difficult and require a lot of work but they are rewarding and help further educate you. The school has decent parking and dormitories with friendly faces. The RAs and advisors help you get adjusted to the school and become part of the community. Professors always have open office hours and if they are not available they will make time to see you. The food isn't very good and can take awhile but there really are not many other options. The college is expensive but  you have to pay the price for such a good education. The campus is perfect sized with around 2600 students and classes who in my experience all have less than 30 students. Overall it is a very good school that makes me proud to go there.
Freshman,5,"I love Manchester University because it feels like a home away from home. Whenever you first visit, there are many people there to welcome you. From the faculty, professors, and students, everyone is so kind. Since its a smaller school, it is also easier to stay on track and talk to a teacher one on one of you need any help."
Freshman,5,As a fist year student adjusting to a new atmosphere was certainly a challenge. Having such a wonderful community has made my first year absolutely amazing!
Junior,5,"Manchester University is a smaller school, so the opportunity to get to know your professors and fellow students is much greater than a bigger university.  The staff and faculty have been wonderful.  Manchester was not my first choice, however we took a tour and by the end of the day I knew this is where I was meant to be. I can't imagine going anywhere else!  I would certainly recommend Manchester University to anyone who doesn't want to get lost in the crowd and who really wants to be involved with the college campus life."
Niche User,5,I absolutely love Manchester. The small town location and the feeling of family overcomes all doubts! Manchester is a great college and suites everyone.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Manchester University thus far has consisted mainly of two things. One being, the immense amount of work that is done every day. Here at Manchester, I tend to find myself studying a lot more than I normally would, reviewing a lot more, and taking a lot more notes. In doing these three things, I find college to be a lot less stressful, although it is still extremely time-consuming. The second thing being, the community as a whole. I have never been inaugurated into a more diverse, loving, or friendly environment. Manchester has an excellent way of making you feel like you are home and for me, that is extremely important because I tend to get homesick more often than most."
Freshman,5,It is a small campus and your professors actually care about you! Everyone knows everyone and its like a family. The Academic advisers and counselors really care about you and want you to feel at home at MU!
Freshman,5,"My very first time at Manchester University really was interesting. It was scary, but I felt like I was at my second home. The students and the professors here really try to teach what they know, unlike other colleges. I do not think I would change my decision to attend here because I feel like I can be who I really am here. It may be a decent sized university, but I smell the opportunity here to do things I have never thought of."
Niche User,5,Manchester is an absolutely beautiful school with an excellent staff. Everyone is extremely nice and welcoming. They offer all students an equal opportunity.
Niche User,5,"I attend to a college visit at Manchester University, and I felt like home at the school. There is a good ratio of students and teacher at the university and they have nice dorm rooms. The campus is very beautiful and well diverse"
College Sophomore,5,"I have not had a professor that I dislike yet, all professors are extremely helpful and want each student to succeed. Classes can be difficult, but there is a variety for students to choose from."
College Sophomore,5,"The prospects for a career are excellent. Manchester promises that if you don't get a job, you can come back and take more courses to hone your skills more for free."
College Junior,5,"Everywhere i go, someone has heartd of Manchester University."
College Junior,5,Manchester has a very clear stance on Title 9 and it is very well supported.
College Freshman,5,Manchester really cracks down on drug and alcohol use. The campus is a tobacco and alcohol free campus.
College Freshman,5,"Our school has a 98% placement rate, which is incredibly important for me. I plan to go onto grad school, and I know that a Manchester degree will adequately prepare me."
College Freshman,5,Being on an athletics team at Manchester University has given me the opportunity to learn how to work with people and manage my time with sports and school work.
College Sophomore,5,There is very little to no crime on campus. All of the crime on campus is either drug or alcohol related.
College Sophomore,5,Living on campus is one of the best parts about attending college. Everyone is super friendly and amazing.
College Sophomore,5,"There is a very friendly and welcoming atmosphere, which it made it easy to make life long friends. Professors will do almost anything in order for their students to succeed."
College Freshman,5,"There is a buffet, a place to order wraps, and a place to get hamburgers, so there is always variety.  Flex dollars tend to go quickly, but that's because there is so much you can spend it on."
College Freshman,5,Honestly it took no time at all to get all the information that I needed or the information they needed either!
College Freshman,5,"Campus Administrators work very hard, I feel safe at campus. Job well done."
College Freshman,5,I have no complaints I love going to Manchester College
College Freshman,5,100% of students receive some sort of financial aid. This is a private school so all the money you can get helps. Manchester University really goes above and beyond to make sure that their education is affordable to everyone.
College Freshman,5,Sometimes sports are taken more seriously than acedemics
College Freshman,5,The food is amazing try actually take the time to make it and it's not sloppy either!
College Junior,5,I love all the different people that you can meet.
College Junior,5,Everything here is the best. The professors are the most helpfully I have ever seen.
College Junior,5,I enjoy being in my program very much. I love all the professors and they help me out whenever I need it. The workload is something to get used to.
College Junior,5,I had no troubles what so ever. I just got my paper signed and I was in my program.
College Junior,5,I love that every student get financial aid here.
College Freshman,5,helped through the whole process
College Freshman,5,"some classes are more time consuming than others but not overwhelming, may ways to looking into internships and jobs"
College Freshman,5,very strict on staying a smoke free and dry campus
College Freshman,5,"very friendly, Resident Assistants very helpful and friendly"
College Freshman,5,apartments very close to the school
College Freshman,5,"campus is a dry campus, definitely not a party school, if there is a party it's nowhere near campus"
College Freshman,5,Athletic events are awesome. I'e gone to every home event for every sport so far.
College Freshman,5,Campus living is very sociable. You make plenty of new friends in the residence halls. The RAs are awesome and very helpful. And the dorms are built outside of the class building so that all you have to do is leave your building and take a direct path to the building where your classes are being held.
College Freshman,5,"I don't have a car, but my friends that do have cars and permits says spots are relatively easy to find and permits are affordable."
Freshman,4,"I liked Manchester University while we still had classes and were still on campus. I feel like the professors did there best to accommodate to online courses, but could’ve done better."
Alum,4,"Loved the relationships I built with professors. Had wonderful opportunities like traveling during Jan term, being in the symphony orchestra, and running on the track team."
Freshman,4,Manchester is the best school to go to if your looking for a small school. Because of how small it is you are able to get way more help.
Freshman,4,I really enjoy being at Manchester University. It is a good place for students who enjoy small class sizes and a small campus. The small class sizes allow professors to really get to know their students. There are many events for students to attend during the week and weekends.
Freshman,4,My Experience At Manchester Was Very fun i connected with a Lot Of different People and They Did A great job At Getting Everyone Active during the vist . As Well as Getting Used to the Campus and moving around It
Junior,4,"I love the atmosphere of Manchester University! All staff members of this college make the transition of the next chapter of your life very less stressful by how welcoming and kind they are . Manchester has now became my home away from home and I could not be any more thankful. I would however, like to see the budget plans be used more wisely ."
Junior,4,I really like Manchesters small campus. It allows you to meet a lot of new people and to make a lot of friends. The professors are all very nice and they make time to make sure that you understand what is going on. The food on the other hand is not so great. If we could get rid of chart wells that would solve the problem with the food. Other than that the school is pretty good just very expensive
Sophomore,4,"It's a really nice University over all. The professors are there when you need them, the classes are small, and it's very welcoming. Only compliant would have to be the food. The food is not great at all."
Freshman,4,Everybody knows each other for the most part. Everyone looks at each other like family which is why there is very little violence of any sort happening.
Freshman,4,"My experience here at Manchester is great. It is really easy to connect with the professors here on campus. Everyone is friendly, it makes me feel like I’m at home! It’s wonderful seeing everyone work together to accomplish anything They would like to do."
Senior,4,"If one wants to go to college solely for a great education, Manchester is the place. Through Manchester, I have had multiple opportunities that has not only  broaden my education but has helped me to grow as a person. Some of these opportunities included becoming a Resident Assistant, landing a graphic design internship, and studying abroad."
Sophomore,4,Manchester is a tight community! You know everyone and everyone gets along. The classes are small so you get to have one on one time with your professors and they get to know you more than first name bases! The staff care about the students and are a big role in creating the welcoming environment.
Sophomore,4,I just finished my first year and it was pretty good. I think the best part are the friends that I made and the connection you make with your teachers.
Sophomore,4,I love that they have a success center where if you need help someone is always there for you. I wish they offered more on campus jobs.
Sophomore,4,"Manchester is my home away from home. The moment I stepped on campus I knew I needed to go here. It has helped me strengthen myself physically and mentally. Coming here was no easy task, but I know that I have plenty of resources to help me."
Freshman,4,I really like how it's a small college so you get to know people on a more personal level. I like how the classes aren't too big so you can sometimes get one on one with the professors. I like how even though we're in the middle of nowhere they are always coming up with fun things for us to do
Freshman,4,I love that I don't have to walk very far to get to all my classes especially in the cold weather! I also love the new friends I've made! They have taco Tuesdays and burrito bowl Thursdays which I love! All the professors I've had so far have been amazing. They are very willing to help you whenever you need it. You can tell that they really want you to succeed and not fall behind. I love how this school isn't too big and you can get familiar with people around campus. Everyone here has made me feel very welcome.
Freshman,4,"It's a small school with a good staff, but if you're looking for a quick and cheep education look elsewhere."
Sophomore,4,"I love the classes here at Manchester University because you are able to get one on one time with your professors if you have any questions. The class sizes are small also, which is a bonus. The food is not that great though. The campus is beautiful especially in the fall and spring."
Freshman,4,What is great about manchester is the small campus and town. It's very calm peaceful and quiet. What I would like to see change is the amour of things to do on campus such as better clubs or more school events.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful, but some things can change. The resident halls could be improved greatly, definitely the East and Garver Halls. All of the diversity and friendly faces makes a great environment and a good way to make friends. When I was considering colleges, it was either this school or University of Indianapolis. Those two schools gave me the most financial aid. UIndy was closer to home, but I wanted a different environment. I do not regret the faces I met during the time I spent here. The food in the cafeteria could have a better taste overall though. The fun activities the school does makes up for the food. The activities are fun and exotic, just like traditions the school has."
Freshman,4,The community is very small and very welcoming. The professors are all very helpful and are always willing to help you when you need it. The only down side is there is not much to do on or around campus.
Freshman,4,"I liked that they have multiple options and sources to go to if you are in need of assistance. The only thing I wish was better was the communication. The information is there, but it sometimes doesn't make it to the student and can lead to confusion."
Sophomore,4,Manchester University is a small private school in northern Indiana. The school provides excellent academics and a family away from home. The department of the subject I'm majoring in challenges me in every course and outside of my classes. Manchester allows me to have field experience in my major. I'm being set up for my success after graduation.
Freshman,4,"I started Manchester University in the fall of 2016 as a freshman. I met my roommate on a website that the school provides for us to meet other incoming students. When I went for orientation, the food was good but definitely has degraded over the time that I have been there. The student life there is great. Everybody is very friendly and accepting of one another. I have a new family away from home at Manchester with all of my friends. One thing I really like about the dorms are that there are not curfews and the quiet hours are not very strict on most floors. I live in Garver, which is the most convenient building with air conditioning and being placed right by everything. Many of the buildings do seem old and run down though so I do recommend going on a visit before you commit to the school."
College Sophomore,4,"I have loved my time at Manchester University so far. The staff is amazing and genuinely care about their students and their successes, both in and out of the classroom. Although we are a small school, our athletic teams are still really great to watch, giving many students a break from studying. One of my favorite experiences so far at Manchester has to be Mayday Weekend, which is a huge campus-wide celebration on the last weekend of the semester before finals. During Mayday, staff and students are able to participate in a large variety of events, such as a trike race or mud volleyball. If I could do it all over again, I would definitely choose to attend Manchester University again. The faculty, the students, and the overall atmosphere of campus is absolutely amazing, and I wouldn't change a thing."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus safety has been prominent on campus with many seminars on how to stay safe, and if something bad does happen, how to report it, and if desired receive counseling."
College Sophomore,4,"I live in one of the suite-style dormitories. Not only are the rooms larger, but you get 4 people to a spacious bathroom instead of an entire hall of people to one bathroom."
College Sophomore,4,"I love Manchester University.  The professors are friendly, helpful, and very easy to get along with. The school overall does wonderfully to give back to the community, and offers many volunteer opportunities. Not only that, but professors often help students to find summer internships both paid or unpaid depending where at."
College Junior,4,Almost all professors are willing to work with you to make sure you are on track for what you need done. classes are around 30 students for core and can very for majors.
College Junior,4,"If you live in Garver, life can be very convenient, except some of the the laundry machines have a break-down once every few weeks"
College Junior,4,"Manchester has been willing to work with me from day one to help me succeed, from financial aid to ccourse scheduling and everything in between."
College Freshman,4,"In all honesty, I feel that it is the professors, class environment, and the connection students make with their peers that keep them coming back to Manchester. The courses are challenging but the professor will take time during the day and even after office hours to make sure students have what they need. Professors welcome debate and honesty on an and all topics to encourage exposure of student's view points which to me reduces the possibility of narrow-mindedness."
College Freshman,4,A degree from Manchester to me shows employers that the prospect comes from an environment that allows for students to work well together. A Manchester degree shows that the prospect is guaranteed to have had hands on experience at on time or another which lets the employer now that they are going to receive and experienced applicant.
College Freshman,4,"Because our core is demanding, students get to experience a wide variety of courses."
College Freshman,4,"There are people here from all kinds of faiths, backgrounds, and locations."
College Freshman,4,"Some of the facilities such as Schwalm need updating, but overall the campus is a healthy place to be."
College Freshman,4,Manchester really makes sure that their students will be able to graduate and find a job. They hold the internship fair every year and have great counseling about applications for jobs and mock interviews.
College Freshman,4,I've really enjoyed my time thus far at Manchester. I've learned a lot and connected with not only fellow students but faculty as well. The professors really make sure that students understand what is going on. Most classes are taught lecture style with outside reading.
College Freshman,4,Manchester offers me opportunities that I would not have any where else.
College Sophomore,4,The safety is great and I always feel safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Course quality is great and all of the professor here work hard to help the students be successful.
College Sophomore,4,The career services are great and will help you with everything toward finding an internship or career.
College Sophomore,4,Housing is great with awesome RAs.
College Sophomore,4,It's great to be apart of a team where coaches care for their athletes.
College Sophomore,4,Professor are personable and there for the students.
College Freshman,4,"Our campus police officers are very dedicated to their jobs and make me feel extremely safe on campus. North Manchester is a safe community, but it is nice to have the reassurance of campus officers."
College Freshman,4,"Probably my favorite thing about MU is the professors. They are so passionate about their fields, and they thoroughly care about students. Most have an ""open-door"" policy and encourage students to stop by their office hours to chat. The variety of courses is also impressive. Almost any student can find an interesting course in a discipline. The class size rarely goes above 30, which is very important to me. Most classes are lectures and are not taught by TA's."
College Freshman,4,"I love Manchester University. The small campus, the friendly professors, the community."
College Freshman,4,At Manchester University there is many safety officers around and even students work with campus safety to keep the campus life fun and safe.
College Freshman,4,Jobs and internships are very common to get after the receiving a degree from Manchester University.
College Freshman,4,"I love the campus; however, the cost to go to Manchester University is a lot and in order to continue to go to the school I will need to find more money to be able to pay for the tuition."
College Freshman,4,The housing at Manchester University is excellent. The dorms have a good amount of space and are closely located to the buildings where the classes are.
College Freshman,4,The campus of Manchester University is very welcoming and classes are very educational.
College Freshman,4,Students have become more involved in sports this year than they have in the past. Always huge crowds at almost every sporting event.
College Sophomore,4,"Not that many people, atleast in my friend crowd, do drugs."
College Sophomore,4,"We have people from over 30 countries that come to school here and/or have studied abroad.  I have had several classes where there has been an exchange student, and I think that is important to have them in classes so I can learn more about their culture."
College Sophomore,4,"There are many opportunities to study in your hall or outside of your hall.  The professors have many study sessions, so if you have a problem with a certain class, you can get help.  Professors email back very quickly, which allows for questions to be answered."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus safety makes me feel very safe because the patrol officers will pick you up if you feel unsafe or uncomfortable.  I've never had a problem with being unsafe, and neither have any of my friends.  But I am aware that there are some students that may feel unsafe on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm an athletic training major, and they make it very important that we get a certain number of observation hours each year.  They assign you a sport every year so you can get hands-on experience with the team.  It is a great way to learn.  With the observations, it makes you more prepared and confident when you actually get a job in the real world.  We have a very excellent career service center.  When I was questioning my major, they gave me the right tools to figure out if it was really what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  They made me feel like it was important to them that they could help me."
College Freshman,2,"For me, living on campus is great because I get to be around everyone I know and being able to attend campus activities is done with ease. However, the building I reside is poorly built with the celling's plaster peeling from what seems to be water damage and issues with having hot water every other day."
College Freshman,2,"Students don't come to Manchester for off-campus restaurants or off campus night life, it is nonexistent in North Manchester, and that is just fine!"
College Freshman,2,I have yet to see a party scene at Manchester University.
College Sophomore,2,Almost too accepting of gays and lesbians. Very accepting
College Sophomore,2,"Because its a small campus, campus security is always looking to stick their nose into anything they can find. It feels as if they sometimes go out of their way to bust people"
College Junior,2,"No one really likes the food, it doesn't taste very well. Some of the places are better than others. "
College Freshman,2,The town of North Manchester is pretty lame. The McDonalds doesn't even stay open late.
College Student,2,"Most of what Manchester has is the usual fast food: Mcdonald's, Hardee's, Taco Bell. There are some family owned restaurants and one good Mexican place, but if you want variety, you better be willing to go elsewhere."
College Sophomore,2,Transportation is ok I guess you can say. Only the multi cultural club takes student's to Wal-Mart in Forte Wayne about twice a month. If you don't have a vehicle or a friend of yours doesn't then you are going to have a taught time getting around to places.
College Sophomore,2,The main problem at Manchester is trying to get all your paper work taken care of every year. For the 2 years that I have been there it has been a headache during the summer while trying to get every thing sent in. Every time my account is empty some unpaid expense pops up which is a real pain in the bottom.
College Sophomore,2,"You may get lucky and get a spot near the building but, if you don't then you have to park at the back of the lot which is like 100 yards from the building."
College Student,2,This school honestly isn't much of an athletic school. I would say it is more strong academically. I was surprised by how small our football stadium is when I first moved to Manchester because my high school stadium was much larger and seemed to have more school spirit and support from the fans.
College Junior,2,"There is not enough spots for all the people living on or off campus. The campus security is obnoxious when it comes to giving tickets, even for visitors. Also since the campus has recently become smoke-free, you can receive a ticket/fine for leaving your cigarettes out (in the cup holder or on the seat). However, because the campus is so small, and there is a shuttle bus that comes occasionally, there is not a strong need for a car on campus, unless you live far from campus."
College Senior,2,"Just like any school, it is what you make it. But as for bars/clubs--there are none"
College Junior,2,"Only seniors can live off campus and almost everyone in a dorm has a roomate - in a ridic small room it is not typically ideal to have a roomate. I have lived in Garver for 3 years and have found it the best place to live because of the community and it is cheaper than some of the nicer dorms. If you are a freshman, I would def reccommend Garver because in the nicer suites it will be hard to make friends because they are so secluded"
College Junior,2,"North Manchester is in the cornfields so you definitly need a car! The nearest Walmart is 20 minutes away! Parking availability depends, it is arranged unefficient interms of commuter vs resident, but it is such a small campus we are lucky compared to big state schools. The security get ticket happy and give them often for ridic offenses, good thing is at least they are usually only $10."
College Junior,2,Small Town – North Manchester is a very small town so there is not much to do. The is a bowling alley and a few bars but that is pretty much it. Everything thing else is about 30 minutes away.
College Junior,2,"Its Cafeteria Food/ – MC's Union food is mediocre, but on campus visit days (Spartan days), the food can be pretty good. they have a pretty good variety, and there is a Starbucks on campus as of Fall 2012."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a Whole Lot, but It's Still Great – The closest movie theater is 15 minutes away and there's virtually nothing to do in town but the school's activity council puts on a lot of events almost every weekend"
College Sophomore,2,Registration Sucks for Sophomores – My first year I didn't have any trouble scheduling classes but trying to register for my classes for sophomore year was a nightmare. It was the same for almost all sophomores
Alum,1,Don't waste your time or money. Please please please go somewhere else. Anywhere else. I spent 4 years there. Don't make the same mistake I did. They don't care about their students (except some of the professors) and it's blatantly obviously that they don't. Raise 100 MILLION dollars for a STUDENTS FIRST campaign...next year cut all on campus activities and refuse to pay your welcome week staff. Just PLEASE GO ANYWHERE ELSE!!!!
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life at Manchester. Every one either lives in the dorms or off campus.
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life on campus.
College Freshman,1,There's only a few options in town and they're usually not the best. 
College Freshman,1,There is no public transportation. You drive your own car or use a bike.
College Student,1,"There is no campus transportation. There is a bus from a different city, but you have to call to make an appointment and then they will come get you for a fee. Most people keep their car on campus or have a friend who can drive. North Manchester is pretty boring, and to find something to do you have to go out of town. The walk to Main Street is a far walk along blocks of creepy houses."
College Sophomore,1,"Financial Aid at Manchester is a nightmare. They don't give out a lot of money unless you join clubs or have a sky rocket GPA. In just 2 years at Manchester I have had to get loans in the amount of $27,000 which is a parents and students nightmare after only two years."
College Sophomore,1,The housing in Schwalm is horrible. The rooms are very small you have to stack the beds to make more room. There is no A/C in the summer so the building is hot 24/7. The walls are very thin you can hear anything which isn't good especially late at night.
College Freshman,1,"you can have a car on campus., but if you don't you really have to rely on friends"
College Senior,1,No public transportation. College provides vans to churches on Sunday morning and one of local bars runs a van back and forth SOME nights
College Sophomore,1,"We have a dry campus, and therefore greek life does not exist. however, it does not stop us from having a social life, because we have a club for anything you enjoy. new clubs are being created constantly."
College Junior,1,Manchester College only allows seniors to live off campus and this makes for a very costly three years paying the on campus housing rates.
College Freshman,1,VERY Strict/Unfair – Campus security often likes to get state police involved for very small/ not problematic crimes.  Sometimes they let people off the hook for things and sometimes they don't. Its very unfair.
College Junior,1,"Need More to Do – Very small classes, almost no social scene or things to do"
College Sophomore,1,There is a large parking lot that is located on the opposite side of campus from the resident halls. The parking lots close to the resident halls are always full.

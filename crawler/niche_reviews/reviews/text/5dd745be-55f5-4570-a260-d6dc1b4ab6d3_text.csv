Freshman,5,"Very friendly and amazing college with Professors that care and really want to see their students succeed and go on to excel at their chosen field and to be a service to their community and others.   College is the perfect size to allow you to not just be a number or a face in the crowd.  They encourage their students to not only to excel at their chosen studies, but to also serve the community and give of themselves to others while in school and beyond. Professors offer lots of help and encouragement if you need it.  The school offers free tutoring to help students succeed."
Junior,5,"I attended years ago (in the 1980s), and I loved it then. Since then, it has expanded immensely and is 10x better than before! I love the options such as the online program, because if the flexibility with family and work.  The student to teacher ratio is excellent, and the professors truly care about the students. The reason I rated the party scene as poor is that drinking is not part of the campus atmosphere. It is a Christian University. That works great for me, and I find that Christians know how to have good, clean fun and the loving support of one another, without the vices common to most college campuses. But it wouldn't be fore everyone. My desire is to get a quality liberal arts education with a worldview that embraces the timeless truths of the Bible, with God as our Creator and sustainer, and to live out my faith in a way that seeks to benefit all people of the world through my vocation."
Freshman,5,"I enjoy being a student at Southern Wesleyan University. I enjoy the faith based side of the college and that my degree program is online, which is convenient for me as I work full-time. 

I would change the tuition rate, so it wouldn't continue to increase. The tuition rate would only increase every 3 years, not every year. I would also change things to make importance mandatory and not a choice for students; such as, attending finance and budgeting classes. Getting a job and holding a job, so they would have some skills and training. Attending resume writing, and interview skills."
Niche User,5,"I am a senior in High school and applied at Southern Wesleyan, wanting to get a BS degree in Biology, to go toward a career in Cancer Research . I toured the campus with my parents, and then set up another visit at the college, where my parents and I had lunch and talked with a Biology Dean as well as sat in on some of the actual classes of my intended major. Every staff member at SWU went out of their way to help my family in every way they could and even worked around our schedule to meet our needs as far as touring the campus and etc. All of the staff were spectacular in every way. After touring four other colleges, in my heart there is no other choice for the college I want to get my degree from. My parents and I  loved everything about SWU. This was truly, a life changing experience for me and  I look forward to hopefully attending the school and becoming a part of the SWU family. Thank You to everyone there, especially Bradley and Susie. God Bless everyone at SWU."
Niche User,5,I am currently an dual enrollment student.  But have been to campus several times.  It is a small college with tons of character.  I am currently working toward a Special Education Major and love the one on one that you get from teachers.  It is a safe place will a lot of student activity.  Smiling faces and defiantly a comfortable place away from home.
Sophomore,5,"If you are looking for a small, Christian college this is definitely the place for you. It is a very close knit community and with the classes being of smaller sizes, the professors are able to make the classes more specialized to each person. The people are very friendly and there is always someone to speak to if you are in need. With also being an athlete, the professors work great with getting in grades and helping you make up anything you may have missed due to games."
Freshman,5,This is a great Christian college. Students and staff are so pleasant. They have a range of courses to help you succeed and further you chances of getting a great job. It is located in such a beautiful area
Graduate Student,5,Excellent school rooted in Christian values.  I love the curriculum and the instructors.  The courses are challenging and it prepares students to be transformational leaders of today.
Senior,5,I started at SWU in 2006 but had to take a break because of financial obligations. I returned in 2015. I like the flexiblity of my classes and the help I recieve from the main campus team to help me make right decisions concerning my courses.
Senior,5,I started in the adult program to finally get my bachelors degree and have been very pleased with the overall process. One of the best things was the amount of help with getting started and being able to maintain communication throughout my college career at SWU.
Senior,5,Southern Wesleyan University offers both a traditional onsite experience for traditional students and evening online/courses for non traditional students.  I am receiving my degree in Early Childhood and Family Studies in an online program.  All of my professors and students service coordinators have been extremely helpful and knowledgeable. They operate with the integrity and characteristics of Christianity at the forefront. I have had an awesome experience thus far.
Junior,5,I like how they but God before everything else. Also I love how everyone on campus is treated equally and there's no discrimination.
Sophomore,5,Southern Wesleyan University is a great school. The professors are very understanding and they really support you throughout the process.
Niche User,5,"I like Southern Wesleyan University because the Faculty, Staff, and Students put God first. They treat everyone as an individual and not a number. Their class sizes are small, which enables the professors to personally engage with all of their students. They prepare their students for the workforce by training them with the most current technology. They use all aspects of their facility to give back to the community and to the world. They also accommodate to people with physical disabilities by making sure their campus is up-to-code with American Disabilities Act and ensure everyone is provided the experience whether it's during a campus tour or being a student. I would like to see more universities like SWU."
Niche User,5,One of the factors that led me to explore Southern Wesleyan University is the social atmosphere. I love that SWU is a place where I can continued to grow in my faith and meet people that have the same interest as I do. Another factor that led me to explore Southern Wesleyan University is how much my admission counselor cares. Caleb Southern has helped me tremendously in my decisions and tips for Southern Wesleyan. No other college has showed that much interest in me and my plans for the future. There are more reasons but my last factor that led me to explore SWU is the student involvement.
Junior,5,"I have attempted Brown Mackie, Anderson University , Forman adult classes and Grand Canyon University to complete my degree; however SWU has been the best choice best fit! I am graduating this spring and excited to complete my goals finally!"
Junior,5,I wouldn't like to see anything change. SWU is perfect the way it is! There is an automatic caring feeling when you step on campus; it feels like home. The professors actually care about your academics and help you when you need it. It is also nice to be on a campus where you can feel the presence of God everywhere.
Freshman,5,"Southern Wesleyan is a fantastic school for working adults who are going back to school to start working toward their degree, finishing their degree or wanting to get a higher degree.  They understand that as a working adult, and sometimes parent, you need a little more time to get through classes and just need to work on one at a time."
Freshman,5,"I love everything about SWU. The campus is the perfect size, the professors are receptive, and you will be friends with most of the student body."
College Sophomore,5,The advisors always help you find things like internships and Job opportinities
College Sophomore,5,Never had or heard of any issues
College Sophomore,5,"I love Southern Wesleyan University. The professors are relatable and generally care about the success of the students. They are encouraging and pray before each class. Classes in general are tolerable, usually with an average workload. Courses are beneficial to students' success in each major."
College Sophomore,5,"Southern Wesleyan University has always felt like home to me. The community is small but growing, and one can almost always feel a sense of belonging."
College Sophomore,5,Love SWU and SWU athletics!
College Freshman,5,"I really love the fact that everyone in our program are hard working individuals. I have had a member of clergy in one of my classes and a husband and wife. There are professional people, as well as blue collar workers. There are differences amongst us, however no one would know."
College Sophomore,5,We recently became apart of NCAA division 2!
College Sophomore,5,Being a ministry major means being a leader!
College Sophomore,5,"Alchohol, Drug & Tobacco free campus"
College Sophomore,5,"SWU is located near Clemson and Anderson, SC. A variety of restaurants are available."
College Freshman,5,The   school is very small and everyone knows what is going on at all times.
College Sophomore,5,SWU is a very small college. The majority of the student that live on campus at the Central campus are athletes. The athletic coaching staff and administration are very involved and supportive with all sports events.
College Sophomore,5,It is beautiful here. It can get pretty hot in the summer time but not unbearably. It did not even snow this past yeat
College Sophomore,5,I have never encountered someone asking me to participate in illegal drug activity while attending SWU. The campus is a non smoking campus.
College Sophomore,5,"When you are attending SWU, you never feel alone because the instructors care about your well being, your spiritual well being. The students who chose to attend SWU, do so because of the Christ centered focus while obtaining their education."
College Sophomore,5,"The food is like eating at home. The dining hall is beautiful, and SWU has flexible menus."
College Sophomore,5,"SWU campus is a Christian campus, and the crime rate is near to none. I feel very safe when walking alone. SWU provides great security measures."
College Sophomore,5,The faculty make this campus home away from home with caring attitudes.
College Senior,5,Great.  No problems.  Student Advisors are helpful
College Senior,5,"Near the SWU campus we have a variety of places in which to dine.  Cracker Barrel is a favorite hangout.  There is also Wendy's, Bojangles and Waffle House.  If you are willing to drive for 5 or 10 miles down the road, there is Pizza Hut, Applebees, Papa John's, Taco Bell, Subway, Ryans, Olive Garden to name a few."
College Senior,5,Parking is very sufficient.  There is ample room to accommodate the students.  We do not have any issues with parking.  The school provides a well -lighted area for students to park.
Senior,4,"It is a positive Christian-filled atmosphere for the right student. There is a real opportunity to be part of a supportive community here. The only down-side is that there is not enough diverse options for extracurricular activities for more students to be engaged. If you're not an athlete, you're not striving for a near-perfect GPA, or you're not a music or religion major, you are often overlooked and left out. For those who are interested in any of the above categories, there are a plethora of activities for you to participate in and teams for you to be part of. In addition, there are nearby attractions that make this place a truly special place. Some of these include the close proximity to Clemson, SC; the Potters Place, which is a group of cabins each with Bibles, journals, and supplies for communion within walking distance of the dorms; and the Freedom's Hill Church, a historic place that was part of the underground railroad as well as the first Wesleyan church in the South."
Freshman,4,"I like that southern Wesleyan is small. I know a lot of the people on campus, and it makes for a great community.  I would like to see Southern Wesleyan update some of their buildings."
Junior,4,"Southern Wesleyan is a university that cares about its students. All of the professors at Southern Wesleyan choose to be there because they love what they do. Likewise, most students choose to be there because they want to be there and because they love it. Southern Wesleyan is more than just a school, it is a place of community where everyone encourages each other and wants to see everyone do well."
College Sophomore,4,I love the small classes and professor interaction with the students at swu!
College Sophomore,4,"Swu is a great school and environment. Some people hate it because of things like the rules and things like that but it is a Christian school. I have no clue why people act surprised of rules. I'm sure they knew that when they applied. BUT, if you can get over that, and learn to enjoy the experience, it's a great school. But only if you like smaller schools. Everyone knows everyone"
College Sophomore,4,"Although some of the gen ed classes are mediocre, the classes pertaining to my major are informative and challenging."
College Sophomore,4,I'm pleased with what I have experienced so far.
College Sophomore,4,I'm using this education to further my already existing job/career.
College Sophomore,4,The adult campus meets in a business building.  I feel safe and facilities are suitable for what we need
College Sophomore,4,"The location is convenient and I like how the adult schedule is structured.  Some required classes offer little to me personally, but my core classes have been very informative and challenging."
College Sophomore,4,"I believe that career prospects are fairly good for a graduate of Southern Wesleyan, though some graduates apply for and receive jobs/internships on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus housing is pretty good at Southern Wesleyan. Some of the dorms are a bit older, which shows, but the majority of buildings and housing on campus are well-maintained and are perfectly fine for living in."
College Sophomore,4,"Southern Wesleyan University has a good fan base of the soccer and volleyball teams, but some of the other sports can be overlooked. There is often a rift between athletes and non-athletes, but the university is generally very supportive of its athletic teams."
College Freshman,4,"Southern Wesleyan University is a small Wesleyan christian school in South Carolina. The area is beautiful, and this campus has a true sense of community. Sometimes weekends can be dull, since a lot of the students live around here and often go home on the weekends."
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience of my collegiate career has been more wonderful than I could have imagined. Not only have I loved the community centered atmosphere that the school displays, but I also treasure the amazing courses offered as well as the tenacious professors that help guide us through the material; knowing us not only by name or our major but by our individual selves.Southern Wesleyan University and their staff does a fantastic job at making students feel comfortable and safe, much like a second home. If I had the chance to do it all over again I would stick with my decision of Southern Wesleyan University."
College Sophomore,4,"My school is great because we have some amazing staff and faculty members. Every morning I'm on campus, all  the teachers I pass greet me either with a smile or a ""Good morning."" Also, we are unique because we have devotions and prayer before classes. I would choose my school again if I could do it all over because it is a great environment to be around. Everyone is so nice, and the chapels are wonderful."
College Junior,4,I am happy with the school's policies.
College Freshman,4,Its pretty fun. You can get encouraging help if you want to change your major too.
College Freshman,4,Most students love to come out and support
College Freshman,4,Everything is pretty chill at SWU. Not really much trouble
College Sophomore,4,I have not heard of any serious campus crime at SWU.
College Sophomore,4,I think the people at SWU are great and will be my life-long friends.
College Sophomore,4,I really like the town of Central and the busyness of Clemson.
College Sophomore,4,There is a lot of diversity on campus when it comes to cultures and backgrounds.
College Sophomore,4,I think SWU is great and the enforcements it puts in place so that everyone on campus reflects Christ.
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's small enough to learn many of school mates, but large enough that you always have something to learn and embark on. I have learned a lot about communication but also about myself as individual. My school has done  every effort to make me successful in my field now I must do the rest ."
Recent Alumnus,4,I have thoroughly enjoyed my program of study. I find myself learning new things. I can appreciate the  teachers and study matter more as I get closer to graduation.
Recent Alumnus,4,"There many places to go to eat, to the movies, shopping, and socialize. Clemson campus is less than five minutes away."
Recent Alumnus,4,"We have students from all over the U.S. We have also have a lot of students from different countries such as Serbia, Columbia, and so on."
Recent Alumnus,4,I am guy and there are a variety of us from all backgrounds of life. It was easy for me to make friends when I got Southern Wesleyan. They promote positive  fellowship among students.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The school wants to provide a healthy and safe environment for all students. Our school has a ceremony called""Passing the Mantle"" this is when parents present their kids with a medallion stating that they entrust their students to the administrators, teachers, and staff of Southern Wesleyan. I feel that the Southern Wesleyan doesn't misuse the trust given and does all possible to live up to parent's expectation."
Recent Alumnus,4,"My school not only offers core classes, but religion courses to teach us the importance of ethics and character. I think this helps build an overall balanced and well established employee for a company.  The students have learned the importance of accountability, quality, and providing their best effort."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I love sports and want to be a broadcaster or sports agent. My school affords me the opportunity to learn vast knowledge of communications not just in front of a camera, but within the business world also."
Recent Alumnus,4,The courses are relevant to the subject matter. I struggled a little at first in the beginning trying to balance my time. The professors have often worked in the fields that they teach and this provides insight  for students.
Recent Alumnus,4,I did an internship at local radio station last year. I look forward to working for a local television station this year.
Recent Alumnus,4,I was the student sponsor for the basketball team. I was the score keeper for the soccer teams. I currently run track.
Recent Alumnus,4,I love sports broad casting. I love the ability to communicate with others and learning new things.
Recent Alumnus,4,My professors make learning exciting and new. They are concerned about each student being successful in their major as well as assisting with help or tutors. They also sponsor trips to visit broadcasting conference.
Recent Alumnus,4,Our school does a great job at campus renovations and upgrade. We recently got a new soccer  and track field. New communications studios.
Recent Alumnus,4,Our dorm rooms are nice compared to most schools. The dorm atmosphere makes it easy to make friends. We have wi-fi and laundry within our dorms. One freshman dorm has the school nurse office and student services underneath.
Recent Alumnus,4,We have a small campus everything is easily accessible and security  is visible. Everything is close proximity.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I am an out- of- state student so along with Pell grants, student loans, and work-study most of my expenses are covered. Books were out of pocket."
Recent Alumnus,4,I stayed off campus my junior year and thoroughly enjoyed the freedom. There is more freedom and some expenses such as food and utilities are added expenses. I was able to have company of the opposite sex to visit as well. Limited on campus.
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are variety of eating places  from Chinese food, subs, Barb Q and deli, Take-out restaurants. Something for everyone and every price range."
College Freshman,4,The program is challenging and informative.
College Freshman,4,There are great guys and girls at my school.
College Freshman,4,I feel I am getting quality academics.
College Freshman,4,It's a nice college area because there is a larger university close by so there is a good amount of activity.
College Freshman,4,Our campus is very strict because our mission is Christian.
College Freshman,4,It's a really neat Christian atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,I am enjoying my classes so far but have not gotten into all the specifics of my major.
College Freshman,4,There are students from lots of different backgrounds on campus.
College Sophomore,4,We have many different races and nationalities.
College Sophomore,4,All classes are taught by caring professors!!!
College Sophomore,4,Agreeable rules and forgiving and lenient leaders!
College Sophomore,4,I have always felt safe & secure on campus. Campus security is available at all times.
College Sophomore,4,"It rains a lot in Central, SC! Get your rain boots ready!"
College Sophomore,4,"There is plenty of parking on campus, though it might not always be where you want it to be. Registering for a permit is a free but one can only park in certain places, and you are guaranteed a ticket if you park in the wrong place. However, it is free and there is always plenty of parking in your designated lot, and you definitely need a car here"
College Sophomore,4,"The only complaint I have about the safety services is that they really enjoy giving parking tickets. The campus is incredibly safe, I have never had any problems and I don't know anyone that has either."
College Sophomore,4,The food at SAY is very delicious. It has changed tremendously.  The dining hall has been updated and so has the food.
College Sophomore,2,"For a school that has over half of its students as athletes, the athletics here are not that great. Soccer and Track are the sports team that perform the best here, but both sports are not very interesting enough to watch in general. The school just moved up to Division II, which is good but most other D2 teams that swu plays are way more talented and higher skilled so the teams at swu are not too entertaining to watch. The facilities are not very good here ether, which makes it hard to want to go games. The baseball field has the most decent facility, while softball, track, soccer, and basketball is ok but the stands are no better than a rec game. The weight room at my high school was 10X better than what swu has. Compared to what other small schools have, they blow swu out of the water when it comes to facilites"
College Sophomore,2,"If I could do it over, I wouldn't choose swu again. It doesn't feel like you're getting the full experience of being a college student here. The campus and classes are so small that you see the same people everyday as if you're still in high school, depending how big your high school was. After classes and on weekends, there's nothing and no where fun to go on campus. You can drive about 15 min to Clemson and find something there, but you'd wish there'd be something cool to do that's closer after awhile. Being a private Christian school, there are lots of rules here that a normal college wouldn't have, so you can get in trouble for a lot of little things which makes it annoying. Most of the students and teachers are pretty religious and it can feel overwhelming if you're not super religious. You are required to take religion classes each semester that have nothing to do with your major and they affect your GPA the most. So it basically feels like you're at church camp rather than a university. It is also expensive to go here so you're gonna need to consider opening loans for your first few years even when applying for scholarships. They make you live on-campus so you'll have to pay the full room & board and meal plan, even though the cafeteria is only open certain times of the day and the food is pretty crappy. Other students may be happy with this, but I'm not settling for that as I'm already planning to transfer."
College Junior,2,My overall experience at Southern Wesleyan University is okay. The professors are somewhat helpful but we do not have enough resources that aid students and student-athletes.
College Junior,2,Not many options and hardly any student discounts.
College Freshman,2,"Unless you're an athlete or a devout holy Christian, no one gives a crap about you."
College Freshman,2,"Freshman dorms: Between not having heat or air half the time, the washers and dryers always being broken, and the hot water being off or no water being on at all..... It's really frustrating to live in the Freshman dorms. At least the upper class men have newer ones I guess?? And their answer is always, well you should be thankful for what you do have. But I'm paying thousands of dollars to have human necessities."
College Freshman,2,They are very strict on silly things like late curfew for freshmen and everything can cause you to get a fine. It sucks
Recent Alumnus,2,What do you call a hot chick at SWU?  A visitor! haha
College Freshman,2,I tis pretty strict where rules ar concerned but alot of it is for safety reasons.
College Senior,2,The athletics are terrible. No one pays them any attention.
College Senior,2,"The weather in Central,Sc is not bad. The weather changes often very quickly."
College Freshman,2,They recently let people start to dance on campus so that pretty much says everything. They are pretty strict about everything.
College Junior,2,There is no night life. There is a curfew and everyone is too busy studying their brains out to have a social life or engage in extra curricular activities
College Junior,2,"Could Have Better Options – The only places to eat at Southern Wesleyan are the dining hall and the snack shop, both run by Aramark Food Services. Generally the prices are too high for the quality, but students living on campus are REQUIRED to purchase a meal plan, regardless of whether they will ever eat there or not; even those with severe food allergies who literally can not eat the food served at either place. There is virtually no level of accommodation in this area, despite receiving complaints from students every semester."
Alum,1,For a school that is supposed to be faith based the leadership needs to practice what they preach. Leadsership at this schools should be held accountable to the students that pay their salary and instead think they can tell everyone what they expect while not living it themselves. The academics do not prepare you for a career and instead after four years young adults are working in a grocery store bagging groceries a year after leaving than working in their desired career.
College Junior,1,SWU does not endorse the party scene.
Recent Alumnus,1,The only greek is the academic courses for religion majors.
Recent Alumnus,1,I cannot state clearly enough. This is the worst school for academics.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The academics are a joke. If you want to study ministry, go to community college and then transfer here."
Recent Alumnus,1,Southern Wesleyan University is where athletes who can't play for good teams come.
Recent Alumnus,1,You pay more and you get less. That's unique compared to other schools.
Recent Alumnus,1,Overpriced and terrible yet required plus a 21 meal plan.
Recent Alumnus,1,This school is notorious for over promising and under delivering.
Recent Alumnus,1,The prisons in the area supposedly had better food.
Recent Alumnus,1,Internships are a JOKE.  Obviously not paid and my profs never even contacted my supervisors
Recent Alumnus,1,The people who taught youth ministry weren't ever youth pastors. My missions profs had never been on a missions trip. My preaching profs were the worst preachers at the school.
College Junior,1,I do not think my school is very diverse as it should be. The schools main race that attends are Caucasians. It is hard for minorities because they are usually stereotyped everyday for what they look like (skin color and etc.) It is supposed to be a Christian University be the attitudes of professors and faculty  does not show Christ like features.
College Senior,1,There is no night life at Southern Wesleyan University.
College Freshman,1,If you don't have a car you are pretty much stuck here on campus. There is not much to do here.
College Freshman,1,They use a public bus with Clemson university that dose not go to many places. If you want to go somewhere you have to ask someone for a ride.
College Sophomore,1,"Personal Whatness? Recently SWU changed their curriculum to include a required set of four, one-credit-hour seminar classes called ""Personal Wholeness"".  For being one hour classes that meet once a week they have a hefty amount of course work.  In one of the four sections, one of the goals of the class was to revisit our troubled pasts and recount things like sexual abuse and traumatic experiences.  We then had to write essays based on that stuff which were graded. In another section we had to record our weight at different times during the semester and commit to vigorous exercise routines outside of class which everybody lied about actually doing.  These classes are a violation of my private life and were a very bad idea.  They should be done away with. I was OK with going to chapel twice a week, but this is ridiculous.   "
College Sophomore,1,"My Karma ran over your Dogma – Dear Lord, Save me from your followers."
College Sophomore,1,Go to Clemson – There are a few teachers here whose sole aim is to turn knowledge acquisition into a wild goose chase.  If you want something incredibly simple explained to you in ways that obfuscate meaning and turn learning into a grueling experience which leaves you borderline suicidal then sign up today.
College Sophomore,1,Don't come to this school if you enjoy thinking outside the box.

Sophomore,5,"Allegheny College is a unique, liberal arts community focused on supporting the students through their goals. The teachers here are spectacular and provide a one-on-one experience unlike any other."
Sophomore,5,I loved Allegheny College for its many opportunities that are present. It also has room for everyone to express themselves.
Junior,5,I have not taken online classes however some of the online portals we use for assignments are very easy to use and submit assignments
Freshman,5,"Allegheny College has been one of my favorite experiences so far. Not only is the campus diverse but it is also very inclusive of everyone that attends. The college has plenty of resources on campus to help the students with any need. I was only on campus for one year, but you can feel that the professors and staff that work there want you to succeed in every way possible."
Niche User,5,"Visiting Allegheny, I felt like I was at home away from home. The student interaction is very good. I have been given nothing but a warm welcome while I was on campus. I believe that everyone should look into the school!"
Senior,5,"Allegheny is a prestigious college.  The people are welcoming.  The professors want to help students succeed and are available during weekly regular office hours.  Overall, it has been a great three years so far.  I am heading into my Senior year and anticipate being very sad come graduation because this place has felt like home."
Freshman,5,"I am an incoming freshman student for Allegheny College. With me only living about an hour away from the school, I have already visited the school quite a few times and have gone to the summer orientation before classes start in August. Every time I have gone up to visit or ask questions, I am met with only kind and helpful people. They all seemed like they really enjoy their job or had an amazing experience at the school that it makes me only more excited and hopeful about my future at this school."
Alum,5,"I just graduated Allegheny and it was an amazing four years. I learned so much while I was there, both inside and outside of the classroom. The profs really care about the student's success and well-being. It's such a tight-knit community that you really get to know all your classmates and professors."
Sophomore,5,I personally love Allegheny. I feel as though it has so much to offer. The social scene is perfect as everyone is accepting of whatever you are comfortable with. Everyone is so nice and caring. The professors truly care about you. The academia is rigorous but it is preparing the students for life post graduation.
Alum,5,"Allegheny set me on a path to reach my goals!  I met people who challenged me and broadened my perspective.  I was able to participate in a variety of activities that fostered my own interests and leadership skills.  The academic rigor, focus on service to others and community spirit set Allegheny apart.  The faculty are true scholars and are they are truly committed to students.  The small town environment makes Allegheny feel like home.  The campus activities, international students, and diversity make it feel a little bigger."
Niche User,5,I love the people at Allegheny and how good the faculty takes care of their students. They have such a great environmental science program too.
Junior,5,School is small but can be made to feel big. Teachers are very personable and willing to work with you during and outside of their office hours.
Senior,5,"Best 4 years of my life. That set me up for life in the best way possible. If you take advantage of your opportunities, you'll thrive."
Sophomore,5,"I love my experience at Allegheny. Allegheny has taught me to make connections in my community as well as keeping myself busy and involved on campus. If I could change anything, I would improve the area around Allegheny. I love the school, but the surrounding area is the most detrimental aspect of the college."
Sophomore,5,My experience at Allegheny is incredible. I have been open to such a diverse and amazing environment. I have met people and professors who will do nothing but help me excel. Allegheny has opened me to world of opprotunities in my field of study and as a college student in general.
Junior,5,I like that in Allegheny College the professors are always available to help you. The campus is very nice and quiet. I would like it if Allegheny were to invest a little more on lights throughout the campus. The administrative office is always there to help and are very polite. When you have any questions or problems with your financial package they make sure to help you to the best of their ability.
Alum,5,"Allegheny College transformed my life -- dedicated professors and coaches, opportunity for every student to perform high-level research, and administrators that care deeply about the liberal arts experience."
Sophomore,5,"Allegheny is an incredible school with a surprisingly long list of majors and minors, and all the Professors here have PhD's. Classes are rigorous but not meaninglessly so, and no matter what you want to do the faculty and staff will work with you to make it happen. The Social scene here is actually surprisingly good-unless its almost finals you can expect there to be a party every weekend, and if parties aren't your thing, many clubs activities you can participate in instead. I don't think you'll find a better education!"
Niche User,5,"At Allegheny College, there is a strong sense of connection with your peers from the moment that you step on the campus! it feels like home."
Alum,5,"Allegheny teaches young people to think creatively, express themselves effectively, and engage constructively in multi cultural diverse environments.  It’s the Swiss Army knife of undergraduate educations."
Freshman,5,I am very happy with my decision of choosing Allegheny College this is my first year and I really enjoy and love the stay here. Th campus is rich in history and the academics are hard but the professors and staff are always there. The private college was a great fit for me as all of my classes are very small and personal. I am excited and can’t wait to go back this spring 2018.
Sophomore,5,Allegheny offers such a high level of education! There are so many things to be involved in and so many opportunities.
Alum,5,This school was the best choice I have ever made. It prepared me for life while providing me with an excellent education and fantastic research experience. The school does truly provide an advantage for all future endeavors.
Freshman,5,"I love Allegheny College for its beautiful campus. The brick roads and trees creates a homely, comfortable environment that is simply unmatched by any other college that I have visited. In addition, the updated sciences building is a perfect example of sustainability on campus."
Sophomore,5,"The moment I stepped on the campus I knew I was home. Several people reached out to me during my orientation period before moving to the campus. During an open house, I was greeted by several staff members and they all asked me about why I became a Gator. My first week of class I will have to have surgery and had several students reach out to me to let me know about their organizations (and also if I needed any help). I have never felt more welcome or loved in a learning environment. This was a huge step for me, and the community made it so much easier. I knew I made the right decision."
Sophomore,5,"Allegheny College is the perfect school to attend if you're a little confused about what you want to do in life, but you know you need to be in college. You do not have to declare a major for two years and graduation requirements are generic that multiple classes can satisfy many of them. The teaching environment is always open and friendly with the smaller class sizes, so it truly feels like your teachers get to know you. Getting involved is also super easy, because we have Greek Life, Varsity Sports, Intramural Sports, Clubs, and many jobs on campus for students to be apart of."
Alum,5,"Allegheny is a place for good students to become great people. I went on from Allegheny to get my Masters degree from an elite school. While Allegheny may not be an elite college, you will get a top-notch education. Comparing the two experiences- Allegheny students are just as intelligent and hardworking as elite college students, often more so, but without the pretension. Allegheny students might not have had the test scores or GPA to get into an elite school, but they have the curious, intelligence, and work ethic to. Allegheny students are kind and accepting. They are open. They are caring. I wouldn't trade my Allegheny experience for any other."
Sophomore,5,"Allegheny is a great school for academics, but there are definitely some things that could be improved. Underclassman student housing, general amenities, and the surrounding area are definitely downsides."
Niche User,5,I recently went on a visit to Allegheny and I really loved their unique combinations requirement for majors.  I would like to seem them be a little more selective in admittance.
Alum,5,"Allegheny is a hidden gem to American private liberal arts colleges. It has truly changed the ways that I interact with academics, people, and view the world. You'll build connections across disciplines while adding new, challenging, and diverse experiences from faculty, clubs, sports, music, the outdoors, art, and finding your own path. It's easy to run with a passion that you hold and just as easy to tap into the passions of others with more than 120 clubs represented on a campus of ~2000 students. Prepare to be amazed and changed!"
Freshman,5,"fantastic school, great professors, good party scene for school of its size , only minor defect is the Meadville area is very sub par."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Allegheny isn't as well-known as it ought to be. However, you're able to see how valuable your education was only after you've left campus. Despite the lack of a prestigious name, once internships and employers see your Allegheny work-ethic and how diverse your interests are you are help in high-regard."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Allegheny College isn't for everyone. Everyone has broad, diverse interests that one wouldn't expect to naturally go together (rugby, poli-sci major, drummer, volleyball, ASG consultant, etc.). But, these interests are honed with enthusiastic admins who want to see their students succeed. You can truly take an idea and run with it knowing that faculty/staff are in your corner."
College Junior,5,I love attending Allegheny College. The people make it a home and the classes make it rigorous and stimulating.
College Junior,5,"There's no hazing and I've only had good experiences, even as a non-Greek. I would try and join if it weren't so expensive."
College Junior,5,"My college challenges without belittling or condescending. Everyone's value is seen and respected and from what I've seen, my peers and professors only want me to do better each year."
College Junior,5,"Professors are highly educated and incredibly challenging. This is not a school for a student who just wants to get by. They expect high quality work at all times, but are more than willing to help students and provide guidance as needed."
College Junior,5,Being that the school is so small and old you have a long standing history of high performing alumni in the work force who are often willing to vouch for students. When companies hire students from Allegheny they know that they are getting someone hardworking and motivated.
College Freshman,5,"Allegheny College is very diverse where for example, it had a drag show in April and it was fantastic! The majority of the students are intelligent and open-mind to many things. The professors do challenge the students and are very knowledgeable in their subject. I know that Allegheny College is a good start since it is a small, undergraduate school and when I graduate, I will go to a big school for my Master's degree."
College Freshman,5,"I have had an amazing first year at Allegheny -- the campus is beautiful, the classes are challenging and engaging, and the community is fantastic!"
Recent Alumnus,5,"Allegheny is known for its heavy workload, but as long as you learn how to manage your time, homework is more than manageable. The Freshman Seminar is designed to help students break down their workload and learn how to approach a variety of assignments, and is very helpful for incoming students. The Pelletier Library also has an excellent staff of writing, speech, and technology consultants trained to help students who need feedback or advice about assignments. Professors are always willing to help students during office hours, and treat you as if you are a fellow colleague and friend - not just a face in a crowd."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Class sizes are small, and individual attention and support from professors is easy to come by. There are a huge variety of courses, and Allegheny encourages students to take coursework in various fields before committing to a major field of study."
College Freshman,5,I feel very close to my professors and they're all extremely helpful.
College Freshman,5,"Joining a sorority changed my life for the better. I have made lifelong friends, been able to do amazing things for our philanthropy, and create great events for the students here on campus."
College Freshman,5,"It's like home here, the people and professors are amazing. I've learned so much for my two majors and had many opportunities to push myself. Go to Allegheny and you won't regret it."
College Sophomore,5,"In terms of academics, Allegheny is excellent!"
College Freshman,5,"The Security are always on duty. When something happens, they always send an email to all of the students to report what happened and to be cautious."
College Freshman,5,I do love this college as expected and the reason why I came here. I still feEl the same as of right now.
College Freshman,5,Career services will go out of their way to help students.
College Freshman,5,The professors re always there to help when I need.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Allegheny encourages a service ethic and challenges students to develop a strong sense of community involvement - both locally and globally. It has one of the best environmental science programs in the country. The campus is absolutely beautiful, with gorgeous 19th century buildings and plenty of open green space and trees. Professors go out of their way to get to know you and personally support your individual learning goals and aspirations."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The school valued diversity in experiences, and I was able to try out various interests."
College Freshman,5,"The academic workload can be very rigorous at times, but its worth it."
College Freshman,5,"I'm sure that I'll find a job after I leave Allegheny, or find a internship by using the alumni network."
College Freshman,5,"I'm very happy I chose Allegheny, you will find your place if you be yourself."
College Freshman,5,Greek Life is cool and pretty easy to get into. Be yourself and you will find your place
College Freshman,5,"I have to work hard. Proffesors expect us to do so, not for their own sake but for the students' sake."
College Freshman,5,I am very happy with being an Allegheny student.
College Freshman,5,"Many happy surprises waited for me.  Very caring professors. Strong music programs. Encouraging environment for exercise and sports. 

It is almost 6 hours drive, and when I use public transportation, it is a very long trip home. This is the only thing I don't like, but it has nothing to do with the college itself.

I love Allegheny."
College Sophomore,5,"Allegheny College has truly become my home away from home. Not only is the student body warm and welcoming to all, the professors are incredibly knowledgable and leave lasting impressions beyond the term of their classes. Each and every student knows just how hard we have to work in order to get good grades when faced with such rigorous coursework. This adds to the atmosphere of comraderie and acceptance we have for one another. 

I have met lifelong friends at Allegheny. From the court, to the classroom, to the sisterhood I joined, there are so many unique personalities that I am so blessed to have encountered. Allegheny College has made me a more well-rounded, knowledgable person, and I feel I am being completely prepared for when I start job searching after graduation! There is not one thing I would change about my school."
Sophomore,4,"Before the Pandemic, Allegheny did not have any online classes. Due to the new circumstances, they have adapted the curriculum to be done in a hybrid format. While there were some bumps along the way, the professors adapted as well as they could and are very supportive on the online students and are open to all criticism."
Sophomore,4,"What I love about Allegheny College is the community that it creates, it thrives off of diversity making each section of campus different. The professors show genuine care when it comes to the students, willing to stay up with them past midnight to simply help them understand the concept in the class."
Junior,4,"Given how fast students were forced to convert from on-campus learning online I believe that the professors at Allegheny did their best.  Most students had a positive experience of learning online. Professors used tools like zoom, PowerPoint, and Google Duo to help students with the transition. The professors' adaptability and flexibility allowed the transition to have very few bumps. Many students like myself have decided to continue online learning for the Fall semester."
Junior,4,"Allegheny College is the heart of the community of Meadville, Pa. This college has created a special relationship between Meadville residents and college students.  The professors at Allegheny do their best to value and push their students to reach their academic potential. Allegheny has recently undergone a change in presidential leadership which will hopefully allow the administration to better relate to the students. Our new president seems to be more in touch with our students' needs and desires. I believe that this change will allow the administration and students to strengthen their relationship and overall help students have the best college experience they can have."
Junior,4,"Allegheny is not for those with low drive, or reduced standards. In my experience, the classes are rigorous and take the full year to understand why you did what you did to understand where you are now. Allegheny is not for the close minded, stubborn or judgemental. It has been a space for me to explore and collaborate with a litany of resources I never would have been able to use."
Junior,4,"Among the covid outbreak the online classes were prompt and to the point. Honestly, I couldn't tell if the professors were freaking out or not. Regardless, they did their job in the best way they knew how and that is what mattered to me. The academics are tiresome but they are always accompanied by someone willing to show you the way."
Sophomore,4,"I took my fall semester classes online after we left campus. None of my classes had set Zoom meeting times, rather video lectures, homework, and assignments were given. I feel that my classes continued with a fairly smooth transition to online classes."
Sophomore,4,"Allegheny College is an amazing school for anyone looking for a small community of good people. It is easy to know a lot of your fellow classmates, and all the teachers remember your name. There are many resources on campus that help with academics, mental health, physical health, etc. There is also a wide array of clubs and activities to join in on, and the Student Government initiates many fun activities for students to do. Most Allegheny students are deeply devoted to their academics, but at the same time enjoy having fun. Allegheny isn't the busiest of campuses, but if you know you want to feel a connection with your school and your people at it, Allegheny is the school for you. I've personally experienced great times held with my teammates, my friends, my classmates, my fraternity, and more."
Junior,4,I really enjoy Allegheny College. The faculty is always willing to work with you and truly want you to succeed in every possible way. The professors are understanding and the small class sizes promote a positive learning environment.
Freshman,4,"The atmosphere at Allegheny is very welcoming and there are a lot of resources for students and events that promote a sense of community and with other students. So far, with all the classes I've taken, the professors are all willing to help you if you ask and show that you've been actively participating In their class."
Sophomore,4,"It is definitely a great school, but sometimes the environment sucks. I don't like the way they are handling the current cover-19 situation but it is definitely a good place for an education. The small class size is really nice  and I have good bonds with my professors. The food is ehh, sometimes the chicken isn't cooked but sometimes the burritos are amazing. It's 50/50. Campus is beautiful though, and they are super open to support animals!"
Sophomore,4,"The academic experience and professors are great for the most part. There's not a lot to do on campus and it can be hard to make friends freshmen year depending on who is in your hall and classes. People are pretty nice and there are sometimes fun events. The administration is your typical college administration more worried about looking statistically good and politicing than the actual students although I think they're starting to move in the right direction. Not everyone is super serious about academics, and it can be hard to get involved in your academic departments freshmen year but overall, if you're looking for a nice college experience with a good education, you will find it."
Junior,4,"Professors care a lot about their students; they make classes worth attending. However one of the biggest problems is How they handle sexual assault cases, financial aid issues, etc. They do not know how to properly help these situations."
Freshman,4,I have been challenged by the rigorous academics at Allegheny College. I would like to see the college provide more resources for commuting students.
Freshman,4,"As a first year, I have limited experience with the academics. However, all of my professors have had a decent amount of office hours. There was a consultant that I went to for my chemistry class regularly which was motivating and helpful. There are opportunities to get involved on campus through the involvement fair at the beginning of the year and different events hosted by clubs. There's a variety of employment on campus and it's not hard to balance a job. Campus is pretty compact which not feeling cramped. It is a small campus but does not feel small. I like that it does not take long to get most places on campus, especially from class to class. The food options are decent/pretty good  for beginning in college but I will definitely get a smaller meal plan when I can so that I don't have to rely on campus food as much."
Junior,4,"The professors at Allegheny truly care about helping their students. Class sizes are small, so it is easy to ask for help and get the attention that you need."
Senior,4,"With a few exceptions, I really loved my professors at Allegheny College. Plus, the campus is beautiful and very green and picturesque. The only downside besides the frustrating administration (though that is probably most bureaucracies) is that the surrounding town of Meadville doesn't really leave the students with any kind of pressure valve to relieve the stress of a demanding school."
Sophomore,4,"Allegheny is good school to come to if you want challenge yourself. The academics can be very rigorous, but the school offers you many resources such as private tutors, group study sessions and every professor has required office hours for their students. The school itself is very lovely, it is on a hill and is surrounded by nature which makes the walk to class very scenic. The school has a lot of history to it so there are a lot of historical  building here such as Bentley Hall. Academic and Dorm Halls may need upgrading though as some buildings do not have air conditioning which can make the fall heat unbearable at times. The people here a very friendly and willing to help you as well and make the school atmosphere much more lively.  Overall the school is a great school."
Senior,4,"Allegheny College is nestled in the small, rural town of Meadville. This encourages more interaction among students within the campus since there are limited activities to do elsewhere in town. The bonds created among students is unlike any other. Allegheny has taught me how to be a leader, a friendly peer, and helping hand."
Junior,4,Over all very good. Small classes and professors that really care. Not much to do around campus though.
Niche User,4,"Allegheny is a family first private college that puts the students first rather than the money. Although, something that they love to do is give away money, they have a system where when you apply and take the tour. You qualify to  a $10,000 dollar scholarship. Where I come from, every penny counts, and that is a pretty penny to account for."
Freshman,4,"It's a good college depending on what you're here for. If you don't like being confined to a town where everything is closed by 4:30 pm and on sundays, I wouldn't recommend Allegheny. But it's a nice community where you can get to know many people including staff. Great school for Environmental Science majors."
Niche User,4,"I had a wonderful time on my visit to Allegheny College. The students were warm and welcoming regardless of whether or not they work for admissions or were just passing by. The professors I met are very passionate about the classes they teach. Coming from a bigger city, Meadville is not the ideal place to be, but the college makes the experience ten times better."
Alum,4,"Allegheny College is a great place to learn and pursue interests. Although I did not enjoy the cold weather, I made great friendships and felt that I was surrounded by intelligent students."
Senior,4,"Allegheny is really what you make it. The academics are very rigorous so if you expect to get a 4.0 on your first try good luck. You do get help from career services with resumes and internships. I do feel like they help certain majors more than others ( like political science and economics majors ). Most professors are understanding and helpful, but they expect perfection. Since I came there I have seen a rise of POC populations, but how they handle issues like sexual assault and racism they still have a long way to go. Meadville is okay but don’t have a lot options for things to do unless they have  events. Some students on campus are fake and not the most welcoming people in the world. It’s a beautiful campus. The food is okay but not the best.  For how much money we pay the dorms should be better."
Junior,4,"The academics at Allegheny College is definitely a five star. The campus environment is pleasant. However, since it is an old historical college most of the dorm need to be heavily renovated. The town that Allegheny College is located in, Meadville, is predominately white. As a minority, I have had racist encounters."
Sophomore,4,"I love campus and the faculty are super nice and really dedicated to helping, however there are issues, particularly with class scheduling, housing, and public safety."
Senior,4,"Academically, I am very pleased  with Allegheny College. Most professors are great at what they do and genuinely care for their students. Additionally, the resources for students are vast in terms of career education, international education, community involvement, and student organizations. The idea of the statement of community is inspiring, but there are occasions when I wish the administration would enforce this more."
Alum,4,"Classes and rigorous, however you will learn a lot. Most professors have office hours where you can ask questions if needed. The professors genuinely want their students to succeed, and are willing to help in any way. Tuition is expensive and off-campus housing is not available unless you are from the area."
Alum,4,"Allegheny College is a great place. The people there are great if you make the right friends. The party scene is all what you make it. You can have more fun than a huge school, but you can also have no fun at all. It is what you put into it. Meadville is a great little town. The local bars are awesome as well as the food. If you enjoy the outdoors you cannot beat the area. Hunting, fishing, hiking; Its all there. The education itself is very hard and rigorous. It is not an easy school. But you get one of the best educations you can get. The professors are great and truly nice people. They want you to succeed but will  push you at the same time. Allegheny College isn't for everybody. But if you decide to attend you'll be sure to leave with some great memories, a great education, best friends, and a constant craving for Market House. #gatorbounce"
Sophomore,4,"Allegheny College is a great four year college with a beautiful campus and amazing staff. The academics at Allegheny are highly ranked with the school being a liberal arts school. The college takes the safety of their students seriously to help improve student life on campus. Allegheny offers a lot of opportunities for internships which help to build connections for jobs after college.  Living at Allegheny is comfortable with cozy dorm, housing, and apartment options."
Junior,4,"Allegheny is a rigorous school that expects a lot, but the professors are invested in helping students succeed and most are role models and good instructors. The overall atmosphere is also a very friendly and welcoming one. However, costs are constantly increasing while aid stays the same, so I'm always feeling like the administration only sees dollar signs, no matter how much I contribute to the school's success. The drinking culture on campus is quite prevalent and annoying. Residence Life does not know how to pick it's RAs properly."
Sophomore,4,"The school has rigor and a variety of classes, but is in a small town that doesn't have much to offer."
Sophomore,4,"Allegheny College is a small liberal arts school in Northwestern Pennsylvania, 'liberal arts' meaning that students much study multiple fields of study. I find that through doing this, I am able to make connections across disciplines and it has been an eye opening experience.  Allegheny is academically rigorous but truly rewarding, and I have been able to develop meaningful relationships with many of my professors. There are opportunities for students to join greek life, however there are also over 100 student run clubs and organizations to participate in. There is even an equestrian team, which I am apart of. Allegheny does not have the best dining halls and some of the academic buildings and dorms are outdated, however the experience as whole is life-changing."
Senior,4,"As a small liberal arts college relatively few people have heard of Allegheny, but this does nothing to diminish the value of the education or experiences I've gained from it. The professors here are enthusiastic about their subjects and it shows in their teaching. Because Allegheny's small size classes are not over packed and you actually get one on one time with professors. They care more for their students than professors at large universities do. There's a ton of clubs and sports teams to join and your dorm mates can become fantastic friends. However it's not all perfect of course. The party scene is pretty weak though and housing can be a huge pain in the ass. There is also a large sticker price but Allegheny gives a lot away in financial aid, everyone I know here has some kind of financial aid. Also the main dining hall isn't the most appetizing. Still, Allegheny College is a fine institution that is worth at the least visiting."
Freshman,4,"I love Allegheny College! However, the courses here are rigorous and challenging. If you are planning to come here, be ready for the overload of work given."
Freshman,4,"Having a great time so far. Classes are tough, but teachers encourage the use of office hours. Athletic teams aren't the best, but we all support each other. Greek life is pretty big on campus, but it doesn't control everything."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Sexual assault will unfortunately be a problem on every college campus. Allegheny mains, students, and offices supported students who were victims of sexual assault through informing the community of safe practices, helping victims, and taking appropriate action in cases of sexual assault."
Recent Alumnus,4,"If you're looking for marble staircases and oak bed-frames then SERIOUSLY reconsider why you want to go to college. Allegheny does a great job at bringing together students fro diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. As such, money that might otherwise be spent on the latest and greatest drops/amenities will be bypassed to ensure a quality education where diverse opinions, experiences, and interests intersect in the Allegheny community. As such, the dorms here are average, sometimes a little under-par. But, the college-owned apartments are FANTASTIC and the houses are a lot of fun. There's a place for everyone."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Greek life here is big. But, it doesn't fit the typical ""Animal House"" stereotype. I personally felt indifferent to the greek life merely because of the imprint Greek Life has left on American higher Education. However, that being said, many of my closest friends were greek. They were a fun bunch o hangout with but didn't dominate the social scene. You're able to find the comradely that comes with the Greek system on other avenues of community (club sports teams, ensembles, from halls, etc.)."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Fantastic, state-of-the-art gym that is open to varsity and non-varsity athletes. There is never any judgement in the gym--regardless of whether you are a pro body builder or are simply trying out this new ""working out"" thing. Having visited many similar DIII gyms, Allegheny's is one of the best in the NCAC conference and certainly one of the best among similar schools across the country."
College Junior,4,Professors email regularly about internship and job opportunities and usually post them on their office doors. It's hard to miss.
College Junior,4,"You're never far from where you need to go, whether it's for food or classes. Each building has their own community and everyone mixes. It's comfortable."
College Junior,4,"I just wish Womens' Rugby was more than a Club Sport, since we put in just as much effort and have better results than our Football team."
College Junior,4,"The campus is very small and very safe. Everyone knows everyone else, and if there ever is an issue all you have to do is ask for help and someone will be there."
College Junior,4,"Huge and accepting community on campus! There is a lot of camaraderie between the fraternities and sororities and friendships are formed all across Greek life. The system is very supportive, and creates one big family on campus!"
College Junior,4,"Allegheny provides students with a truly wonderful experience. The small size helps professors to really focus on the students needs, and gives students the opportunity to grow. The classes are challenging, and the school prepares students to be hard working and high achieving. Overall, an excellent and rewarding experience!"
College Junior,4,The majority of professors are wonderful and very approachable.
College Junior,4,#2 in liberal arts colleges for environmental science in the country!
College Junior,4,Pretty safe. Academic buildings are checked and locked at midnight every night
College Junior,4,Pretty nice options. The bathrooms are cleaned every day for dorms. and the hallways are taken care of properly. Upperclass dorms are so nice with air conditioning and more private space and bathrooms.
College Freshman,4,I'm more than happy at Allegheny College -- my courses are challenging but professors are beyond willing to assist struggling students; they really want students to succeed.
College Freshman,4,"It's okay, I guess.  Dorms are old but in relatively good shape.  Can't speak to the lotto process since I have accommodations in place that put me in a single room."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Allegheny's career services does a great job reaching out to students, but I think your strongest asset is in networking with alumni and professors."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I never felt in danger or threatened in any way on Allegheny's campus, even walking around at night. There is a small-town vibe to the area, and you feel relatively safe at all times. As a woman, you'd probably be in more danger of being assaulted at a party than walking around campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Attending Allegheny has been pretty great so far. Every professor that I've had has been very helpful, engaging, and caring. All of the course I've taken have been rigorous, yet manageable."
College Freshman,4,We always get emails of information about opportunities and there are always opportunities coming.
College Freshman,4,"The courses are challenging, but that is expected and professors challenge us because it helps us learn and grow. The classes are intimate and small which is nice. The professors always check to make sure everyone undersrands the concepts."
College Freshman,4,It's a dorm and a decent one.
College Freshman,4,I always feel safe when I walk alone on campus even in the dark.
College Junior,2,Security and the counseling center are known for being biased against races and sexual orientation. Sexual assaults are swept under the rug. It is easier to get a hold of another student if you are in trouble than it is to get a hold of security.
College Junior,2,"The housing process is very difficult to go through after your first year. A lot of the buildings are in poor condition, with rattling pipes, poor plumbing, mold in some bathrooms, and the walls and ceilings are cracked and damaged more often than not. It is not worth what is paid."
College Freshman,2,"When it comes to the students at Allegheny they will be some of the most well rounded amazing people ever. However this does not go far. Allegheny is a school that on the outside seems like a respectable college but this is sadly not the case. For starters, Allegheny boasts constantly about how they were rated the ""20th most rigorous school in the nation."" However, that rating came about from a 2012 online article that currently leads to a broken link on a site less credible than buzzfeed. The school constantly does thinks like this to make it seem like more of a respectable institution when in reality it is a run of the mill liberal arts school with nothing really to offer. The work at Allegheny isn't necessarily difficult, there is just a lot of it and I find myself feeling like I am back in high school simply trying to remember facts in order to cheat the system. Allegheny's main flaw comes from the administration. The admin is very adamant about containing the ""party scene"" at Allegheny, to which they are now forcing every entering class to live on campus for all four years. For me, off-campus housing is where 90% of all social interactions happen, and because they are taking it away the school really doesn't have much left to offer. Allegheny is very expensive and can easily lead to quite a bit of heartbreak, one slip up and the school that had such open arms in the beginning will be more than ready to kick out and take your money."
College Freshman,2,"It's too small filled with small school drama. The school is not well known and although the professors are good, I feel unchallenged in my classes, I am also shocked how many of my classmates got into a so called ""good"" school. People who go here range from very smart to straight off a farm dumb."
College Freshman,2,"Most students live on campus. It would probably be cheaper for the student to live off-campus, but the college owns most of the houses in the area. The college has strict policies on living off campus."
College Sophomore,2,Not allowed to live off campus and options are limited
College Freshman,2,"there's about one good restaurant, timber creek tap and table. The rest is mostly just fast food and chains. Though it's cheap, it's obviously not good. sometimes it beats Brooks, but it could be better, especially given the college students willingness to spend money on better options"
College Freshman,2,"McKinley's has pretty good food, but there never seems to be enough munch money to go there as often as I would like. Brooks has a lot of food, but it's all pretty gross and because it's the same stuff time and time again, it gets really old really fast."
College Freshman,2,"You definitely do not come to Allegheny for Meadville. I think the town is pretty boring, but it's definitely got a bit of a small-town charm to it. I don't really go into meadville, but when I do, I enjoy strolling through the park. I think it could be worse."
College Freshman,2,"The only parties that are held are by the Frat houses. Although I do have a good time when I go, they usually get shut down by security by midnight or just get ended by that time. I believe my night is just starting at 12, so it kind of sucks. The amount of parties is really bad too, with only having two or three on a weekend."
College Junior,2,"I rather live on campus. You don't have to worry about monthly rent, bills, and laundry."
College Freshman,2,"Campus shuttles to work are convenient, campus shuttles to the airport are at the worst times and are too expensive for students to use frequently. Also, public transportation is very inconvenient and basically non existent."
College Freshman,2,"There are no restaurants within walking distance and none of them delivery, except for chain places, like pizza hut. We get a discount at places like applebees, but you need a car to get there."
College Freshman,2,"There is no school spirit and no fan support. We have a great gym, but it's mostly used by athletes."
College Freshman,2,"The dorm rooms are really small, unless you live in the upperclassmen apartment buildings. There isn't a lot of social interaction in the dorms. The best ways to meet people are at campus events and in class. I think the cost of living on campus is high given the small rooms."
College Freshman,2,No one goes to the sporting events that aren't football or basketball and even then the attendance is very poor. The sporting facilities are lacking as well.
College Freshman,2,"Meadville is a very, very, very small town. You have to drive a long way to get to ""civilization."" But, this makes the students so much closer because everyone is together on the weekends."
College Freshman,2,"There is little to no racial diversity on campus. But, if there is any diversity it is completely accepted."
College Freshman,2,The facilities are great but the success of the teams are another story.
College Freshman,2,"hopefully, you know someone with a car."
College Freshman,2,"I do not love my school I attend;  it just was not the right choice for me, but that may not be the case for you. My advise is to choose your school wisely, and do not let anyone else make your choice. Do what is best for you!"
College Freshman,2,People drink a lot! and by themselves.
College Freshman,2,It taste gross but that's college for you.
College Freshman,2,"Cold, snow, wind, rain, clouds. Enjoy September while you can."
College Freshman,2,"It's pretty white, but there are plenty of minorities here. You can't expect much in Northwestern Pennsylvania."
College Freshman,2,The one shortfall of Allegheny is the food. It's not the best but at least they have implemented eco friendly aspects to dinning. 
College Senior,2,"It is a pain in the ass to get off-campus housing.  The college keeps trying to implement a 4-year mandatory on-campus living situation, but they keep having to repeal it because they take in more freshman than they have housing for.  Off-campus housing is leaps and bounds more cheap than on-campus living, and totally worth it despite the distance from campus.

I only gave it a poor rating because it's so incredibly hard to get it."
College Senior,2,"The city of Meadville is extremely poor, and one of the most depressed areas of Pennsylvania.  There is a huge disconnect between the local population and the college students.  The Downtown Mall is a joke.

There are some pretty reliable bars, one of the best being Voodoo Brewery.  However, some people find Voodoo too hipster for their tastes.  Mickey's and Penny Bar have great karaoke nights that are always jam-packed with students.

The most popular restaurant seems to be Grace Asian which opened fairly recently.  It's got great Thai, Japanese, and Chinese cuisine.  Other big hits are The Whole Darn Thing, a great sub shop, and The Market House Grill--which is my favorite.  They specialize in breakfast and lunch and are pretty cheap."
College Senior,2,"Bring your own computer.  There are very few computers on campus, and the library computers are almost always taken.

Do NOT bring your own printer--it would be a waste of money.  You get an incredibly high number of printing points and there are a lot of printers on campus."
College Senior,2,"At Allegheny it is rainy and/or snowy from October until March.  If this is something you don't think you can handle, don't even apply.  It is impossible to live here without a pair of rain or snow boots, an umbrella, and a parka.

However, if you have a summer job or internship on campus, it is absolutely beautiful and sunny and flowery."
College Senior,2,"Parking costs are expensive here, and bringing a car on campus is pretty much obligatory if you want to go anywhere fun.  If you park in the wrong spot and you don't have a permit, you are basically guaranteed a fine."
College Freshman,2,There should be more options
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't a whole lot of diversity as most people are from the surrounding PA area, which is primarily Caucasian.  There are a decent amount of international students and students with various religious beliefs though."
College Sophomore,2,"We have two places where we can go to eat. One serves buffet style food and is never pleasing. The other dining place, is more restaurant styled. The food is better there."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The wireless at Allegheny is such a pain, especially if you have a mac. It can sometimes take a long time to connect, and depending where you are it will randomly disconnect over and over."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Public transportation is pretty limited. The bus is free with your id card, but it only runs on wednesday, friday, and the weekends. If you want to do things you should probably have a car."
College Junior,2,"The dining options on campus are rather limited, there is Brooks, the formal dining hall, and McKinley's, the al la carte dining hall. Brooks is all-you can eat and paid for as a meal credit (how many meal credits you have is dependent on your choice of meal plan), the food there is made by Parkhust and is okay. There are many options: pizza, salad, burgers, pasta, stir fry, and a sandwich bar are available every day. As well, the main dish changes daily and is generally something like chicken parmesan or tortellini. The hours are limited, which is probably the biggest drawback. McKinley's is the campus favorite dining option as it is open from 7:30am to midnight and until 3am on weekends. It has a salad place, a vegetarian section, a grill, a cantina, a pasta station, and a sandwich station. Food here is paid with Munch Money (you are given a certain amount per semester based on your meal plan)."
College Junior,2,"The weather is pretty unpredictable, but you can expect a good amount of precipitation. On the plus side, when it's nice out, everyone appreciates it a lot more because we aren't used to it!"
College Sophomore,2,"There is public transportation. The CATA buses are free for student use, however they are never on schedule and do not run every day of the week. If you need to go to Walmart to pick up one thing, you will be stuck there for 2 hours."
College Senior,2,"While the upper classmen dorms are pretty nice, they're already showing wear, are expensive, and difficult to get into. There isn't nearly enough housing on campus for students, but the college still wants to get rid of off campus living. Most of the underclassman rooms are very small, and some of the bathrooms are old and moldy."
College Junior,2,Allegheny is expensive and is a little out of my budget range. The distortion of aid my freshman year after my mom got laid off has still negatively impacted my aid package even to this day
College Sophomore,2,"The food at McKinley's is good, but overpriced. $4.25 for a cup of fruit is beyond ridiculous. Brooks is pretty much disgusting any time you go there. It's been rumored that the school puts laxatives in the food. They also lack good vegetarian or vegan options. Only having two dining hall options makes eating frustrating."
College Senior,2,It's pretty average. If they catch you they will confiscate paraphernalia. Most of the time they don't catch you though
College Sophomore,2,"There is not much to do in this town at all. There is a bus that will take students around town for free which is nice, but aside from a few grocery stores, a few small restaurants, and two movies theaters, there isn't much."
College Freshman,2,"Parking is pretty okay. I don't have my own car on campus, but I do have many friends with cars on campus. The only complaint I hear from them is that there isn't really any assigned parking... you have to have an Allegheny College parking pass, of course... but as far as where you park goes, you basically have to search for a spot every time you leave and return to campus."
College Freshman,2,"The dorm I'm in is smaller than I thought, and the bathrooms aren't nice.  Our showers don't have a changing area and there is mold in them (hopefully they clean that out soon).  I heard upperclassmen get dibs on the better rooms though."
College Senior,2,"ALWAYS CLOUDY – Classes here tend to never be cancelled due to snow (everyone is within walking distance - including professors). The weather can be somewhat dreary, but when it isn't cloudly, Meadville is beautiful."
College Sophomore,2,"Sports Are Not a Big Deal – Since Allegheny College is such a small school, sports aren't on the top of the priority list for students.  The homecoming football game is the big highlight of the sports but that is about it.  As a student who is not personally involved in sports, I do not hear much about the sports teams."
College Senior,2,"Don't Come Here If You Want to Live Off-Campus – Allegheny recently instituted a 4-year on-campus living requirement for all its students. The class of 2015 will be the first to be affected. Before, that requirement was 3 years, although many students were granted exceptions as the school simply does not have enough on-campus housing currently for all its students. Parking on campus is not awfully expensive, but it is not readily available. There is a high chance that even if you purchase a parking permit for the semester, you may not always be able to find a place to park near your building. A popular alternative to avoid buying a permit is to park along the streets, which count as city property."
College Junior,2,"Even though the school pushes these things under the rug , prescription drugs such as Ritalin and Adderall are widely abused on campus as is cocaine. So, if you get caught with drugs at school, don't worry, the school is too embarrassed by it to actually punish you or admit it."
College Freshman,2,"Quite simply, there is not much diversity on campus. The vast majority of students are caucasion and straight. However, there is little to no discrimination on campus. Everyone is every accepting and welcoming to students of all races, genders, orientations, religions, and cultures. The school absolutely prohibits acts of discrimination and neither is it tolerated by the student body. We also have very active extra-curricular groups for everyone on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Allegheny is working towards becoming more diverse within its student body. However, most students are white and come from Pennsylvania/Ohio area."
College Sophomore,2,Meadville Is Meadville – Meadville is not exactly the most exciting place. There is very little local atmosphere. We tend to make our own.
College Junior,2,Personal Responsibilty Is Taken Seriously – Allegheny has its own honor code that is enforced by the students and agreed upon by the faculty. Any violation of the code is taken seriously and has strict/severe ramifications. Social conduct is a little less severe. Most incidents are documented but students are often given a warning before serious action happens.
College Junior,2,Many Computer Labs and Terrible Printing Services – There are plenty of computer labs dispersed around campus. The difficulty lies in finding a printer to use and not be held up for a significant amount of time. Wifi tends to be slow. The college hasn't extended their bandwith and the larger amount of personal computers on campus keeps the internet slow.
College Senior,2,Drugs and Alcohol – Almost everyone that goes here encounters it at some point while they go here.
College Freshman,2,Need to Change Your Standards – The girls at Allegheny are for the most part really nice that are pretty easy to meet and get to know. On the down side there are just not a lot of jaw dropping sexy girl on campus. The typical scale of 1-10 is not a good tool to use here because well it has to be modified for the Allegheny scale. A 5 on the normal scale is about a 7.5 on the Allegheny scale. The ratio is good but more hot girls would definitely be nice. Luckily though the girls that are here are all a lot of fun though.
College Junior,2,"The school has really tried to cut down on underage drinking. They would like students to live on campus for at least 3 years if not 4.  The price of living off campus is pretty cheap, and the houses are fairly convenient to find, if you can get the school to let you off campus.  The housing for the most part is safe, but with little parking.  Most of these houses throw parties, so if you are looking for fun, head down to one of them."
College Junior,2,Plain and simple there is not enough parking.  There are too many people with cars and not enough spots for them.  The North Village parking lot is a nightmare as it is gravel and cannot be plowed during the long Meadville winters.
College Freshman,2,"Overall, Allegheny College is decent but it's not for everyone.  Allegheny College is located in Meadville which is a small town and if you are coming from a small town, its PERFECT! But for me, I'm coming from a large suburban area and it's been a challenge. But if you are looking for a quiet, small, somewhat isolated campus, Allegheny fits for you.

Here's a few other insider tips:
-It's easy to not spend any cash for a week. 
-Walmart is the largest store in the area
-There is a large frat/sorority atmosphere here
-Parties start at 11 and end around 1. :(
-Allegheny's definition of diversity is 60 black students, 20 hispanic students and 20 asian students plus 5 exchange students out of 2200 students. 
-There is a pre-law, pre-health and pre-education track 
-There is always free stuff!
-Even though Meadville may seem boring, there are things to do in town (movies, food, bar)
- Allegheny's campus is much larger than it may seem...
-There is a sense of community.
-GFC is one of the best places on campus to get coffee.

"
Freshman,1,There was very poor communication and the professors didn’t put a lot of work into teaching theirs students after we left campus.
Niche User,1,"Ah Hellegheny. The worst turned best decision of my life. If you are bullied and threatened by your assigned roommate, they will make YOU move to another room. In the process you may be assigned to a temporary “safe” room that doesn’t even have a lock. Administration LOVES bullies. Thankful that I withdrew after five weeks and got most of my money back. Now the same money I would’ve lost on a no-name Hellegheny education has paid for undergrad and graduate school at top state universities. Steer clear if you value your safety,  mental health and money."
College Junior,1,The weather has been really bad this winter.
College Freshman,1,"The school owns many houses and apartment buildings in the town, so students who want to live off-campus usually just get a campus-owned house. There are some for-rent houses in town for students, but you have to be a senior to live in a house that is not owned by the school."
College Freshman,1,"There is a public bus that students can use for free, but it only runs 3 days a week at certain times and it only goes to Walmart, the grocery store, and the movies. It's a really small town with no clubs. The best entertainment is on-campus at Greek parties and the weekly Friday events that happen at the student center, such as comedians and live bands."
College Freshman,1,People can do whatever they want it is not the best thing.
College Freshman,1,The weather literally changes every 30 minutes.
College Sophomore,1,"Don't come to Allegheny expecting to find good parties. At the beginning of the year the parties were a B+ but as the year went on they got more and more horrible. Many weekends I found myself taking hours to get ready and then come back to my room an hour later disappointed. BUT, don't get me wrong, there were definitely some good nights that I had as long as I was with a good group of friends. OH and one more thing, the thing that sucks the most is having to pay for cups. Only one place that I can think of gives out free drinks and everywhere else you have to pay anywhere from $2-$5 which sucks."
College Freshman,1,"The weather is very unpredictable. The only constant is the wind. Winters are pretty cold, and we get a lot of snow. Some years (much like this one) spring can come very late. It's mid April, and the weather is just beginning to hit the 50's-70's."
College Senior,1,"Allegheny gives a decent amount of scholarship money, but tuition increases every year (aid does not.) Most students have their parents pay the difference, but if that's not an option for you, don't go here. The tuition cost compared to other schools is outrageous."
College Senior,1,"Not Available – Off campus housing will soon no longer be available to students. While there are several campus owned apartments and houses, the experience isn't the same."
College Senior,1,The health center is awful and security treats you like a child. They never take anything you say seriously. However some of the security staff are friendly.
College Senior,1,There are very few spots that are available unless you pay 150 for a parking pass and even then there aren't that many spots. Security is ticket crazy.
College Sophomore,1,"Parties suck, bar/club scene is ok if you're of age, underage nightlife can be fun, transportation is great."
College Sophomore,1,The people of downtown Meadville don't like the college students. It is very uncomfortable (as a young female) to walk around downtown.
College Freshman,1,"I don't mind the cold. And I don't mind the snow. But if there is one thing I can't stand it's how often it rains here in Meadville. You'd think you went to school in Forks, Washington..."
College Freshman,1,"Meadville is depressed, poor, and can be dangerous at times. Allegheny offers many clubs--just make sure there are some that you are very interested in before you come here. Otherwise you'll be extremely bored."
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is a nightmare. Although all of the parking lots are close to the dorms, security releases too many permits so that there is not enough room for all of the cars to park in the assigned lot. When you don't park in your assigned lot, they.will.find.you.and.ticket.you. It is really annoying especially because you pay around $150 at the beginning of the year for a pass, the least they could do it provide you with guaranteed parking. Therefore, I just opted not to buy a pass and just park on the streets which has worked out better actually."
College Senior,1,I live off-campus this year. But the college turned to 4-year residency so new freshman and no longer move off-campus.
College Senior,1,"An Awesome College in a Boring Town – Allegheny is a great school featuring an exciting nightlife among its students... surprising, especially considering the school's small size. However, the positives of the school are not reflected in the town of Meadville. Over half of the town's residents live in poverty, and especially recently there have been instances of crime in the town. The residents are not generally friendly toward students, although of course there are exceptions. This is not a college town - Meadville is farm country and has not made much of an effort to adapt to the interests of the students. There are tensions resounding between the school and the town, especially as Allegheny purchases more and more houses from Meadville."
College Junior,1,"Do Whatever You Want, If You're in With the Administration – Certain groups on campus never get punished for anything and others always take the fall. The administration is completely unfair about how they distribute punishment and if you're one of the unlucky ones you're screwed. The administration doesn't care about anything but their reputation and would much rather pretend things never happened then punish people who have done something harmful ."
College Junior,1,The serve spoiled food to unknowing students and overcharge them.
College Junior,1,Don't Impact Campus – A large portion of the student body does atheletics but there is no sense of school pride in supporting the teams here. Cross Country and Track are the only two programs I'm aware of that have any consistent success.
College Junior,1,"Cold and Wet the Majority of Year – The majority of the year is filled with rain, snow, and cloudy skies. The fall semester has a couple of weeks with nice weather, but it changes rather quickly. The spring semester is filled with days fluttering above freezing and by the weather turns to nice spring days the school year is over and everyone leaves campus."
College Senior,1,"It's always sunny, oops I mean rainy or snowy, in Meadville."
College Senior,1,The school limits off campus housing more and more each year.
College Sophomore,1,"School is 85% white, and its mostly kids from the greater pittsburgh area or nearby ohio and rural ny. they work hard to try and attract token colored students and people from far away but understandably they are few and far between."
College Sophomore,1,Were a D3 school so athletics are a joke. And theres a ultimate frisbee team but no wrestling team.
College Sophomore,1,This is the worst thing about the college. WE get the lake effect so when its warm its literally raining about 75% of the time. And the winter is lonnnnng and brutal. It snow seriously 90% of the days and we didnt get nice weather till 2-3 weeks till the end of the year(but it still rained just didnt snow). Also they havent cancelled a class in 40 years although is nows in feet. But it really makes you appreciate a sunny day. At the beginning of the year when theres some sunny days everyone is outside doing something.
College Sophomore,1,"Well there are only 2 options. Brooks or Mckins. Brooks is a buffet and the food is slop, but you can find decent things to eat. unfortunately its only open very limited hours during the day. Mckins has better taste but very few options and is very very overpriced. Mckins is open a lot more. Bu if your hungry at 12:30 on a monday night youre beat because nothing is open 24 hours."
College Sophomore,1,"Oh My – Our college is 25% greek because theres not much to do. the kids that join are the kids who cant make friends in their freshman year. so like at other schools the frats are selective and there are some standards but here its the opposite. frat guys are like overweight, odd, like socially out of touch kids whose egos are inflated when they join. the sororities however are ok- its just girls who are friendly but bored and only a bit airheaded. But our greek life is so overbearing and its a bit of a joke on them."
College Sophomore,1,"Our school is tiny and secluded so theres 2 options: go to a lame frat, pay a few bucks for a cup for access to maybe 2 kegs 3 if your lucky. And if youre really lucky there will be a small dance party where you can grind on a hideous allegheny girl OR if youre old enough or have a fake then go to the bars- slightly better option but its expensive and there are degenerate townies there. but a decent pressure free atmosphere"
College Junior,1,"On campus housing is becoming terrible.  Only 9 north village 1 apartments offered this year.  Unless you have a medical excuse or roomdraw number under 130 you have no chance of NV1, Allegheny Commons, College Court, or College owned houses.  Juniors didn't even get any North Village 2 quads which are terrible anyways. Also next year Allegheny will have a four year residency requirement.  "
College Junior,1,"Lots of whites.  Your average student is going to be white.  While there are many kids of other races, they tend to stick together so there isn't as much interaction as there should be."
College Student,1,Welcome to the Tundra – the weather is really bad. its snows alot and its really cold and windy.
Niche User,1,"Parking Nightmare – Parking on campus is a night mare. Students of all classes are allowed to bring their cars to campus, but good luck finding a parking spot. It costs students $150.00 to buy a parking ticket. You are given a color coded pass, and you can only park in lots labled with that color. If you park in another lot, you are ticketed. Professors and staff park for free, in special gold lots. There are more gold lots on campus than any other lot, and, despite this, professors, with their special gold passes, like to park anywhere - taking up spots in student lots. We recently took out three lots to build a new residence hall (which is super nice), but did not replace those lots. Security does not have a quota on passes they give out, so they might give out 100 pink passes, even though there are only 50 spots available, hence, you have to fight for your spot. Or, dare to park on the streets, and the city police ticket even more rigorously than Allegheny Security does."
College Freshman,1,Ugh Yeah I Said UGH! It sucks because so many people have cars and like to go home or out of the city often.
College Senior,1,"Paraplegics Are Pushed Aside – The campus is not very handicap friendly. Because the majority of on-campus buildings/housing are considered historic landmarks, they cannot be altered or brought up to code. Only the newest buildings are handicap accessible, so anyone wheel-chair bound who wanted to study here would be limited in the choice of their major/where they could stay. So if you do have a handicap that limits your mobility, you will probably not be happy here."
College Senior,1,"Shouldn't My 43,000 Tuition Be a Permit Enough? They charged me 75$ for parking at a school building without a permit.  I am a college student, loans and all, not super excited to deal with the incredible and increasing cost of tuition, while being slapped with ridiculous fines for parking outside class."
College Senior,1,"The Worst Part of My Education: My Education – So, many departments in Allegheny are good, reliable, credible.  The video production dept. is not one of these.  I made videos for the morning announcements in high school, and to this day, I learned more from myself in those experiences than the course selection offered here.  the com arts student body is filled with a few people that care a lot, a few that care enough to get by, and a majority of unconcerned ding bats."

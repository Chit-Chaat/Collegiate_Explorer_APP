Freshman,5,"In today's society, online courses are widely used in colleges providing easy access to course materials, classroom discussions, and feedback to instructors. The course materials and activities may be accessed from any computer, whether it is from the University or from the comfort of your own home. I've taken two online courses since I've been in college and have benefited from those classes. There are a few reasons to why I'm drawn to an online education course as opposed to taking courses in a traditional classroom setting. First of all, I have a full-time job, which limits my opportunities to attend classes scheduled during normal school hours. Also online classes allow me to work on my own and move at my own pace. Finally, these classes offer more of a one-on-one teacher-student relationship rather than a teacher having to spread their focus amongst thirty other students."
Freshman,5,"Having a full time job makes it very difficult to schedule your classes. The hours I have scheduled at my job conflict with the times that most classes are offered. The use of online courses has made life at work easier, since my manager refuses to work around school schedules. Since I don't have to meet on a regularly basis, I don't have to leave my job to meet on campus. It is very convenient for me not having to meet on a regular basis. When a person has to work full time, it is hard for that person to successfully juggle their job responsibilities along with homework and study. A person can always take an online course to deal with the time constraints that a job will put on you. The use of online courses allows you to cover the material needed in school while maintaining your workload."
Freshman,5,Morris College is an amazing school. The Faculty and Staff are wonderful. also at Morris College you are known by your name and not by a number and that's what I was really looking for when I was searching for a school.
Sophomore,5,The College Is a very numbered of people. The college is very good academic wise and everybody is like a family to each other. You will feel just like home and very comfortable
Senior,5,"My HBCU is an amazing 4 year private school. My school offers a great deal of programs to study and major in. We offer a variety of sports from cheerleading, baseball, softball, basketball etc. Our faculty and staff are very helpful and attend to our needs as students. Our campus as a whole is like one big family, if someone has a problem academically or personally we all think of it as our problems and try to come with ways to help and solve it, we help each other with everything. Our homecomings are even more family oriented, every year at homecoming we always have a big bonfire where the alumni come back and share past experiences and have a good time with friends and family. We also have a wide range of organizations and clubs starting from Omega Psi Phi, Alpha Kappa Alpha, Sigma Ghama Rho and many clubs to name. When you join a sorority or a fraternity they make you feel like a family."
Sophomore,5,Hi my name is Nikaeshia Bussey. I attend Morris College in Sumter S.C.  My experience at Morris College has been a wonderful experience being here taught me how to be more responsible and flexible with my schedule. Morris taught me that I can be anything I want to be in life if I just try and believe in myself and that was what I did I believed in myself for the first time in 18 years.  I would like to see Morris College change the rules a tad bit give us students more freedom let us learn how to be adults.
Senior,5,"My 4 years here at Morris College have been great. Great teachers, administrators. Everyone is friendly"
Senior,5,"My experience with Morris college is going to stay with me for the rest of my life. Everyone is friendly, school work is very understandable, and the campus life is well organized. The only minor thing that needs fixing is the extended hours for the library and more staff so more of our resources can be open to the school."
Senior,5,My experience at Morris college have be great. The teachers are great and student life is good. We have a lot of activity to do on campus. It's real exciting to be here at Morris College and I hope others attend as well.
College Sophomore,5,The athletics at Morris College is great. The student involvement is out the roof everyone loves to get involvement. School spirit is great every event you see students buying new clothes and props.
College Senior,5,The campus is always protected
College Senior,5,I would definitely choose my college again if time was to go back to deciding where I would continue my eduction. Morris may not be what most people want it to be but for me its everything. I've had a lot of mentors and people by my side willing to pave me into the wonderful woman I am at this very moment.

Freshman,4,Morris College is a private four year historically back college in the city of Sumter South Carolina. My experience here at Morris has been amazing. Morris staff and faculty really cares about their students and makes sure that their are more than successful when they leave their campus and start whatever profession they so chose to go in. There are many cubs and organizations to join here at Morris and a number of Greek life groups. Attending Morris college as a student has been one of the best decisions i have ever made.
Freshman,4,"Im not sure yet. Im an incoming freshman in Fall 2019. When i arrived at Morris College for a campus tour, the students their was very helpful and kind. The environment was clean and well organized."
Freshman,4,My experience with Morris College really wasn’t a bad experience. I had my good times and some bad ones. The food is terrible and the cafeteria people are terrible. But Morris College itself is a good School. I enjoyed my freshmen year . I Learned it’s a time to play and a time to be serious. I entered Morris College To Learn And I will depart to serve.
Senior,4,I like that the professors really strive to instill knowledge in their students and push students to succeed.  I would like to see the school make changes in the form of technological advances.
Freshman,4,"Morris college is somewhat of a great school to go to,I say that because they are eagar to help you with your school work ,they want to see you do great in the future .Some of the classes are at a great ratio for the student and some of the time they are not .i think Morris college should change the hour of ""quiet hour"" I think it should be in the late evening when class is still going on not at night time.but other than that its a great learning atmosphere"
Freshman,4,Professors are very helpful are rarely miss or cancel so you're getting your educations money worth. Great school if you wanna attend somewhere small for better focus 
College Junior,4,"While at school, you meet new people and try different things.  But here at Morris College, it is small and nice.  Everyone is here for the same thing as me."
College Freshman,4,There is basically some on watch every night.
College Freshman,4,its simple and can be a hassell at times.
College Freshman,4,It seems like it is taking very seriously.
College Sophomore,4,My personal experience with professors at the school has been great every time i needed help they was right there hands on. I never had any problems with getting help or anything.
College Sophomore,4,I am a sophomore in college i really don't need an internship right so i don't know anything about this. Student have talked to me and they love it and told me they have recieved a lot of help from the school to get the job.
College Sophomore,4,On campus there has been no crime. I feel as if everyone feels safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Greek life on campus is great. Most people in greeks are very social love to make students feel welcomed. Non-Greek students love the greeks because they help you when needed. I don't really know anything about greek housing.
College Sophomore,4,"i enjoy games at school the karaoke nights, the mic nights in the girls dorm, and also the probate nights. What makes my school so unique is every student strives for their best and try hard to help their community. I would choose my school again because the people i meet are not just friends their family now. We all help each other when needed uperclassmen try to help as much as possible. The professors will stay after just to help you, they will go out their way to help each student."
College Sophomore,4,The courses are taught well at a steady pace.
College Sophomore,4,The weight of our President Dr. Lunsford C. Richardson's name assures a bright future with a degree from this school.
College Sophomore,4,It's great from what I've seen.
College Senior,4,The Greek life had died down at one point in time. Now they are up and thriving. Me personally I would join a sorority just to embrace my willing to become a better person than before.
College Freshman,4,Some girls have broken the rules in the past so They have ended up payng for thrconsequences
Junior,2,"Morris College is a 4 year private institution. Its particularly small but that didn't bother me in fact it was another reason why I had chosen the college itself. The cafeteria setting, staff, and food was a little more than degrading if you'd ask me. The Professors were very knowledgeable about their subjects which was great they stuck to the school policy. The dormitories were an absolute disaster! Mold bugs and not secure enough security. Activities were on recycle spin meaning the same things we had last week for fun were the same things to do the following week. Student who stayed on campus over the weekend were introduced to a limited food choice and everything would be boring. The students got along very rarely you'll spot fights. Dress code needed to be enforced a little more aggressively because we are young women who are achieving greater things and life and guidance was truly needed. Tutoring was a plus great resources to help you achieve. Wifi needed to be stronger."
Senior,2,I like the one on one interaction you can get with the campus being so small. I appreciate it because if I was somewhere with 300 students per lecture it would be harder for me to get the help needed to understand the material.
Freshman,2,"Upon entering Morris College I thought it would be a great experience. I was sadly mistaken when it came to student life, and the dorm environment. There were so many things that needed to be fixed that went unattended to. After several student complaints and a protest some needs were met. I honestly feel that students are paying for five star quality living, and are receiving two stars.  I personally would go back to finish my freshman year then transfer. However, if some much needed changes are made such as: The President, the Dean of Students, and the Dorm Director then I may consider returning all 4 years. When it comes to professors and academics there are no complaints. If you invest in your education as you are supposed to at Morris College, then academic excellence is not very hard to achieve."
Sophomore,2,The dorms need to be done over. Its mold in the girls dorm which is making them sick. Morris is good school to go to if you want to build up your gpa but i wouldn't stay all 4 years. You get almost the same thing for lunch and dinner. & The class work is almost like high school work all over again.
College Freshman,2,The athletics at my school looks like there is only one dominant sport that everyone pays attention to and its basketball.
College Sophomore,2,The freshmen dorms are disgusting.
College Freshman,2,"I hated the dorm rooms, they were nasty and did not get cleaned very well. We have a roach, spider and bed bugs."
College Sophomore,2,Financial Aid office is slow.. really slow.
College Sophomore,2,"You might as well go grocery shopping before eating at the cafe because all they're going to serve you is HOTDOGS and HAMBURGERS. But, we have an ""okay"" meal on some occasions."
College Junior,2,"I apply for financial aid every year and I have yet to receive any. Even though I do not qualify, the financial aid office does not communicate information well with me and my parent regarding awards,"
College Junior,2,"There isn't much unique about Morris College other than it's still run in an old fashion way. The website does not have any upcoming events posted, any thing as far as upcoming events are posted on flyers or on social media. There is no online application, I had to go into the admissions office to apply for admission. If I had to do it all over, I would not do it all over."
College Freshman,2,there transportation but not to get off campus whenever.
College Freshman,2,"I dont go to parties. If there are parties off campus, you would have to find your own ride."
College Freshman,2,"When it rains it gets very messy, due to the amount of mud dirt and sand outside, and its gets in your room also."
College Freshman,2,Campus dining is TERRIBLE! The only time students really like to eat is when our Pizza Hut in the student center opens.
College Freshman,2,"At my school, if you don't smoke or drink, you're most likely going to be called a ""lame"". Me, don't really care about what people say about me. I don't participate in these kind of activities. Most kids at my school say the only thing to do for fun at my school is to smoke and drink. I think that stuff is so lame. "
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are very old. Students have been living there since the 1920's. Campus is so small, everyone know each other. It's not that bad, but it could be better."
College Junior,2,"To be quiet frankly, I really don't know exactly how the off-campus housing at Morris College is because I always lived on campus."
College Junior,2,"Although I have received the decent amount of help for financial aid for fasfa, the employees are rude. The financial aid loses my documents sometimes and they have to mail me another one."
College Junior,2,The weather affects the campus here at Morris when it rains because the campus is muddy and the landscape looks bad.
College Senior,1,I would definitely rebuild the dorms and make it more modern. Being that it's a community dorm different females come from different households and act accordingly. It may not be how the next person keeps up with themselves.
College Freshman,1,You can get it from anybody
College Sophomore,1,"mold is in the boys dorms heavily, my friend killed a mice inside the student center where the pizza hut is located"
College Sophomore,1,You can never get hungry in Sumter. They have EVERTHING to eat. Better than the cafe food. Paying for it is worth it.
College Freshman,1,There is nothing to do on and off campus.
College Freshman,1,"We do not have Greek life on campus, that I know of."
College Freshman,1,Have not party yet !
College Freshman,1,The weather is weird here. One day it would be hot and then next day it would be really cold. Sometime i would go to class and it hot but when i leave it would be raining well the sun is still out. I don't like the weather here.
College Junior,1,Greek Who? you will see the greek life ever now and then but not often
College Freshman,1,You will find all kind of boys at Morris that do not care about anything. All they really thing about is having sex with different girls and smoking. The girls at Morris care about their grades and the way they look everday
College Sophomore,1,Sucks ! The people and staff are really closed mind .. you get treated as a dumb student rather than a young adult. your opinion doesn't matter. favoritism is rapid . the cafe suck. serves the same food up to 3times a week. and forget being there on the weekends the crap they serve should be iilegal.
College Junior,1,"Its Terrible – The food is horrible, barely even warm, have to spend money on fast-food every single night. The food they have is the same stuff over and over, its not good at all. I would defiantely not choose this school if I could do it all over."
College Junior,1,"The weather is always continuosly, day by day. One day it's raining, two days later it can be raining again."

Sophomore,5,So far at Gardner Webb my experience has been amazing. I transferred from an community college to Gardner Webb so they were very responsive and quick. If you are having a hard time there are counselors and staff that will talk with you and pray for you.
Sophomore,5,So far I've had 3 online classes and as long as you do the work and let the teacher know of any question you will be fine and do great things.
Niche User,5,So far its been a good experience at GWU overall. Athletically and academically its been a pleasant experience and gratifying experience.
Freshman,5,I really enjoyed learning about the entire program. They were very helpful with the tour and they told me where everything was.
Freshman,5,It was pretty easy to sign up on the website. I enjoyed talking to the staff. I really can't wait to attend this college.
Freshman,5,I heard through my sister that online classes are very understandable and easy to maneuver. I haven't personal been online. I will be starting my freshmen year on August 17 2020.
Freshman,5,When I came to visit the campus it felt so warming. Everyone was nice and really cared. The campus was so beautiful. My sister is in her senior year and she talks about how her professors are understanding knowing your needs of growth to achieve high standards.
Freshman,5,"A very nice school with amazing teachers. Every teacher learns your name, and you feel like you have a personal relationship with them. Each teacher is amazing at their job, and is very open to helping you with whatever you need. Additionally, the student body is generally very nice, and easy to make friends!"
Freshman,5,"Gardner-Webb is devoted in putting their students first and making sure each student is taken care of while in college. They will put everything aside and go the extra mile to make sure the one kid gets help, and makes everyone feel at home."
Freshman,5,"I love Gardner-Webb University, it is beautiful and it is a great experience especially coming from a young man that has never been to North Carolina at least to Shelby, North Carolina. This first semester has been amazing, I have learned a lot including adapting to living with a complete stranger, dealing with classes and scheduling, getting acquainted with the new environment of Gardner-Webb, and creating new connections with professors, classmates, and coaches. It is all just a fun experience."
Junior,5,"Amazing school. Christian school with amazing values and academics. I don't know anything about their sports programs, but their academic and degree offerings are top notch."
Freshman,5,I love the campus and the people. I am applying for scholarships so that I am able to stay here and go to school.
Niche User,5,"I love Gardner-Webb! The professors make you feel welcome and loved. Here, you are a face, not a number. The campus is gorgeous and the Christian services are enlighting. Student activities are plentiful. Gardner-Webb feels like a home away from home."
Sophomore,5,"I have had an amazing experience so far at Gardner-Webb. They make you feel right at home, and my instructors truly want to see me and my classmates succeed. I am there for nursing, and that is a really hard major. My teacher have been nothing but helpful, kind, and encouraging. Everyone I have encountered at GWU has been awesome to me, and I can't wait for the next few years at Gardner-Webb University!!"
Freshman,5,From the moment I moved in I knew I was going to love GWU. It felt like home right from the start. I know I am going to love my time here!
Junior,5,the best part about Gardner-Webb is that everyone is so friendly and helpful. It's like everyone is one big family! The professors are dedicated to help you succeed if you are putting in the work!
Junior,5,"I am an online student, but have visited the campus before. It is a beautiful location and the online professors are great."
Niche User,5,"I went to visit and my brother goes there and it was very pretty and such an amazing experience. I applied and got accepted and cant wait to be a freshmen this year. I got to sit in mock classes, and it was absolutely great."
Junior,5,"So far I’ve been nothing but pleased with Gardner-Webb. The campus is beautiful and very accessible. I didn’t want to attend a university with a larger campus, so it’s a good size for me. I also really like the staff. They’re always friendly and eager to help me when I have questions. Another major reason I chose Gardner-Webb was because of their Christian background. I was raised in a christian household, so it was very important to me that my beliefs continued. It’s also very relieving to know I’m around others who share my beliefs. I would highly recommend Gardner-Webb to someone who also share these beliefs and prefers a more compact campus!"
Freshman,5,"This school can give you hands help due to the fact they have approximately
4,000 students.   Dorms are great, the students friendly and professors are great."
Senior,5,"GWU is by far one of the best places for community! I would not change my undergraduate degree and time for anything. This place, staff, and its' students have helped me reach my goals and have helped shaped who I am."
Sophomore,5,I like that the teachers are really supportive and want you to succeed. They will help you figure out the way you need to study to pass their test. One thing I would like to change is that we get Labor Day off other then that the school is amazing.
Freshman,5,I love Gardner-Webb University! I love how friendly everyone is on campus. I love how everyone in concerned about each and every students safety here on campus. I love the environment!
Sophomore,5,"I love Gardner-Webb. The professors here truly care about students, and I've met a lot of wonderful people."
Junior,5,My overall experience with Gardner Webb University has been exceptional. The teachers are prepared for the lessons being taught and they are knowledgeable about what they are teaching. The students are willing to collaborate with each other and even with the distance learner students. The small town in which Gardner Webb is located is friendly and very welcoming to all Gardner Webb University students.
Freshman,5,"Gardner Webb is your school if you are looking for a small town feel, small school and family like community."
Junior,5,I like that this University is a Christian community. I also enjoy the teachers who are willing to share the information they know. I feel comfortable going into the teaching field with what I learned.
Sophomore,5,I transferred to Gardner Webb from a community college and that was a big adjustment for me.  Everything was so much different but I could tell the biggest difference in the faculty and staff.  Everyone there is so eager to help and they actually want to see their students succeed.  It was my first experience being a part of prayer before each class started.  At this time I have no suggestions for change.
Niche User,5,I love the atmosphere and the comrade that the school has. You are just a part of a big bulldog family while growing in your faith.
Sophomore,5,It’s a loving and beautiful college! Everyone knows each other on campus. The environment is safe and definitley has a loving atmosphere. The teachers make sure you understand the material and break down material very well.
Sophomore,5,I love Gardner-Webb.  The people and area have become home.  It is a quiet campus where everyone is family. I love the beautiful campus in a small town setting.  It is close enough to larger towns to enjoy going out on the weekends with friends. The professors care about you and your education on a personal level.  There are planned activities on campus for students to become involved.  there are a lot of opportunities for students to be involved in groups and extra curricular activities. I enjoy being involved in the Campus ministry and hope to become more involved. I love the dorm. Everyone on the hall feels like family. It's a cozy homey dorm. There are many options for food on campus.  There is the cafeteria and places in Tucker as well as Chic-fil-a.  There are also restaurants close by if you choose to eat off campus.
Freshman,5,"GW provides various aspects that make it appealing to everyone who learns about it. Their graduation rate is 98%, so there is excellent academic programs. I'm personally in the nursing program, both in the BSN and ADN. No other school would let me do both. I'm doing both to allow me to get a year of work experience before graduate school. GW encourages their students to further their education to graduate school. Additionally, GW has huge diversity within the campus. We have many students who live across the world just to come here, a lot of them for sports. Another benefit about going to GW is the security/safety. We have an actual police department on campus that consists of about eight to nine officers on call. Overall GW is one of the best colleges to go to whether you are looking to play sports, all about academics, a safe place away from home, or looking for a new environment!"
Freshman,5,"One thing about Gardner-Webb is that the people on the campus are very nice, and welcoming. It almost feels like home when you're meeting new friends, joining clubs, and even athletics. Also, Gardner-Webb is a religious school, and we love the Lord with all of our hearts; that's what keeps us going in our classes and throughout the community around Gardner-Webb."
Junior,5,"Gardner-Webb University is a Baptist-founded University where Christian values are highly respected and imparted to the students during the program. The faculty is equipped with professionals highly educated with moral values that will help students to grow both academically and morally. The university is located in a peaceful and cozy rural area, a perfect environment for the students to learn. I really enjoy attending Gardner-Webb University. However, I think the buildings in general need some updates and innovations. Overall,  EXCELLENT university!!!"
Niche User,5,Just visited Garder Webb a couple weeks ago and plan on attending in the fall. Great community and administration. Lots of major and minor options.
Sophomore,5,Very caring environment created by instructors.  I felt like fellow students were all  there to learn.  It was a very well organized nursing program planed out to provide students with adequate study time and efficient learning.  Many study tools and equipment were available to use.  The simulations created a real life experience of patient nurse interaction similar to a hospital setting.
Freshman,5,Gardner-Webb University is a beautiful campus filled with fantastic people. The professors are phenomenal and are always there to work with you when you need them. There are lots of activities planned for students to do all the time!
Junior,5,I am returning to school as a working adult and find Gardner-Webb University very user friendly and easy to navigate. I have always been able to get help when I needed it. The professor have been very flexible and easy to work with. Although expected to have work turned in by due dates I feel they provide an easy atmosphere to work in and are supportive to all students. The course work load is not to much even for working adults who have families. I would definitely recommend this university to anyone.
Freshman,5,"Gardner-webb is a very home-like environment, the professors are always there when you need them no matter what time of day it is. Very clean, and awesome all around!"
Freshman,5,This is a very nice Christian college to attend to that I would definitely recommend to anyone else.
Freshman,5,"Throughout the admissions process, someone was always checking to see if I had any questions pertaining to any events on campus even through my orientation weekend. The Gardner-Webb community is one that makes you feel at home as soon as you step foot on the campus."
Niche User,5,Excellent place to attend and academics are excellent. Learned a lot when I attended there! Would recommend to anyone who wants a quiet feel when attending school!
Junior,5,"I have truly found my home here at Gardner-Webb University. I am a student in the Degree Completion Program, so all of my classes are online. This program has allowed me to continue to work full time to support myself and help my family, while also saving for the future. Even though this program is online, I feel that my professors have been extremely thorough in their teachings. After transferring from another university to Gardner-Webb, I feel that this is where I am meant to be learning. I am even looking into MBA programs for after I graduate! I am so proud to be apart of the Running Bulldog community!"
Junior,5,"I have enjoyed my time at Gardner-Webb. The people and staff are very friendly! I love the Christian environment. You will meet some of the best professors here at GWU!
However, I believe the school should improve with activities over the weekend and not close everything down (including the food choices). Yes, a good majority of people go home on the weekends, but if the school offered more variety over the weekends then students might choose to stay. For those who have no other option and must stay on the weekends sometimes find difficulty in finding something fun to do. 
Overall, I love GWU, the family atmosphere, Christian base, and professors who care."
Freshman,5,"I am loving my experience here at Gardner Webb University. The school is located in a small town, surrounded by loving people who care about the school and it's students, even sometimes as referring the students as one of their own! The campus is not too big, so it is very easy to get around to where you need to be. And the students here are the greatest classmates I have ever had. Everyone is here to excel in their education, and will help and encourage you throughout your journey here. The professors, as well. Every professor loves what they do and are very passionate about what they teach, as well as having very good office hours. The student activities are always fun and exciting. The school truly makes you feel at home."
Freshman,5,When I visited Gardner Webb for Dawg Day everyone was so welcoming they really felt like family. I loved how involved the staff was with the students and trying to get to know us .
College Freshman,5,The athletics at my school care about school just like they do about sports.
College Freshman,5,Gardner webb is really the best school all around!
College Junior,5,They are so helpful and understanding. They help you with any questions that I have.
College Freshman,5,"the athletics are good, fun, and encouraging to everyone on campus. I look forward to game day and spending time with friends."
College Freshman,5,"I love my University. The students, Professors, and staff all take part in making Gardner-Webb feel like home. I am so blessed to be here and I can not wait to see what this amazing college has in store for me."
College Sophomore,5,This college has really been the best option with my working two jobs and helping me to be the most successful in my academic career.
College Freshman,5,"Campus police are actual police officers, not just security guards, which makes me feel extremely safe and they are also really approachable."
College Freshman,5,The professors know you by name and the courses are fairly average on difficulty wise. There are plenty of classes to take. I love the small class size as well!
College Freshman,5,Housing is readily available and pretty easy to get in where you want to live.
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love it here! Everyone is so friendly, I love the atmosphere, and it's so student oriented!"
College Freshman,5,Most people may not like dorm life. I love dorm life. My roommate and I have become great friends. The floor I reside on is extremely clean and quiet. The housing process is very user friendly. Sports and athletic fields are in excellent condition from my point of view and the overall convince is great.
College Sophomore,5,"As an education major, I have to go out into schools and meet teachers and I think that helps me get my foot in the door for my future as an educator"
College Sophomore,5,The quality of the professors is what means the most to me and small class sizes.
College Sophomore,5,"As a cheerleader, the student involvement is amazing, we get emails every day about a sporting event going on and at the games we throw t-shirts to the most spirited fans. Our athletic facilities are amazing compared to other schools I have seen."
Niche User,4,My son is a freshman this 2020 fall semester as a student athlete enjoying his first year of  college at GWU.
Freshman,4,"Like the smaller classes offered and the small town setting.  Tucker Center is a nice addition to campus with dining and recreational activities like pool, ping pong and rock climbing wall."
Freshman,4,"I really like that they have smaller classes and I like the small town atmosphere.  The teachers are willing to take time with their students.  The Tucker Center is a great addition to campus life.  It has a food court with different dining options. There's also activities like pool, ping pong and a rock climbing wall."
Alum,4,Loved the friendly atmosphere. My classmates were excellent. Loved the Christ-centered approach. Deliciously small classes meant that I got to know my professors and they knew me.
Sophomore,4,The College is pretty good I must say. The education and teachers are good. The campus is pretty to look at. And student life is good as well
Sophomore,4,"I loved GWU the moment I stepped foot on campus. I never really thought that I would be much of a small school person but Gardner-Webb is the place for me. The school is not only full of students, faculty and professors but its a community that intends to help everyone. Gardner-Webb is like a home to me and an overall great school."
Graduate Student,4,"The academics is rigorous and time consuming but, the professors are willing to provide assistance however they can."
Sophomore,4,"Gardner-Webb is a wonderful private school. Although it is on the small side, this gives the opportunity for tight nit connections with professors and other students. The class size is small, giving each student the ability to be known in and heard in class. Gardner-Webb also allows connection and networking on many different levels."
Junior,4,I like the fact that it is easy to have working relationships with your professors. I wish the sports as a whole would be better. School camaraderie seems very low at times.
Freshman,4,"Gardner-Webb is a beautiful campus. The academics are highly rated, especially in the nursing program. I feel that Gardner-Webb offers a great place to learn and a lot of campus activities as well."
Freshman,4,"While Gardner-Webb is a dry campus in small town Boiling Springs and does not fit the typical party scene college, it gives a comforting friendly environment. The professors and students you will meet make everything worth it. The education is average, but if you care and you make a relationship with your professor it becomes incredible. The only downside is every shop and restaurant is closed before midnight, except for the gas station."
Graduate Student,4,"Gardner-Webb is a great school that is just missing a solid identity. The only solid identity that Gardner-Webb stands by is that it is ""not Liberty University."""
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my time at Gardner-Webb, but I wish I had decided to live off campus earlier than my senior year because a lot of money is taken off tuition. And living off campus was not really given as an option and was not easy to do. Most of the professors are awesome people who I’ve grown close with. The campus is beautiful and a great size. The Boiling Springs community is quaint and quiet, but bigger cities are just a short drive away. So, it’s not difficult to drive to a mall or an area with more food options. Safety is really emphasized on campus. Overall, I have enjoyed my experience at Gardner-Webb!"
Junior,4,"Gardner Webb is a great school if you are looking for a small, tight-knit community. There are many opportunities to grow in your faith. I take over 18 hours a semester and the academics are fairly easy if you put in the time. The professors are truly helpful, kind, caring, and personable."
Junior,4,"After transferring from a community college to Gardner Webb University, I will say it was the best decision. I'm taking a online program to complete my bachelor's degree. The experience so far has been great. The professors are really helpful when it comes to making sure you understand the assessments."
Alum,4,Gardner-Webb was a great school but oftentimes it felt like I was still in high school. The small town is great but definately a bit frustrating at times. The University rules are a bit strict too but overall its a wonderdul place. I will say that all the professors are AMAZING. They really do care about the students lives even outside the classroom and are always willing to give extra help if it is needed.
Sophomore,4,"My experience with Gardner -Webb University has been good and very educational for me. It is a nice place to get your degree, teachers are very helpful and will make sure you get the help you need."
Sophomore,4,"Gardner-Webb is a second home for me; it has allowed for me to better myself and become more educated about my place in the world. All of the staff are wonderful and they try to help you succeed as much as they can which is accomplished with small class sizes, which allows for one-on-one help from professors. There are endless opportunities on campus and in the community to volunteer and help others."
Junior,4,I liked that the school was not a party school. The cafeteria food is not the greatest food but better than some other colleges. There is not much to do in local area but it has a at home feeling.
Sophomore,4,The campus is gorgeous and everybody is very friendly. The staff want to help students and there is always something to do.
Freshman,4,I love the atmosphere and all the professors. One thing I think should change is the cost to attend the university.
Junior,4,"The thing that I love the most about Gardner-Webb is the community. The faculty and staff truly love the school and the students and want to see you succeed in all areas. Because of the small class sizes, professors not only care about you as a student in their class, but they care about you as a person and what your life looks like outside of class. They will do their best to meet you where you are and work alongside of you to get you where you want to go. The community among students is also phenomenal as this campus is full of students who love Jesus and love others. Because of that, there is an abundance of opportunities to get involved with things on campus and make a bigger impact in the world at large. A downfall of Gardner-Webb is the tuition which is pretty steep, and a lot of the facilities need updating/renovating."
Junior,4,"I love the small size of the campus, the student body truly feels like a family. However I dislike the mandatory Old and New Testament classes, and the lack of things to do in the area."
Freshman,4,"Gardner-Webb University is one of the best schools nationwide by far! The people are incredible, the classes are exciting with professors who take time to know everyone's name and favorite music genre (literally). Some of the facilities could use some more funding, but overall an outstanding university."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful! Lots of friendly students, faculty, and staff! Dedicated to helping you develop who you are, as well as getting you prepared for you classes specific to your major!"
Junior,4,So far my experience at Gardner-Webb has been very good. I am a junior at Gardner-Webb and I am still learning new things about Gardner-Webb. From my first semester I have had very helpful professors and have made each course easy to learn and interesting.
Junior,4,I am a current student at Gardner-Webb university and I think that we need to overhaul most of the sports teams and start over to build a brand that people will want to be apart of. The biggest current issue is the town being dry I believe that allowing stores in the Boiling Springs area to provide and service alcohol will bring potential growth to the community.
Sophomore,4,I love my professors and how they take a personal interest in my success. The classes are small and challenging.
Senior,4,They are great with the community. Plenty of helpful job information. Isn't a well known school. Small town and student body.
Sophomore,4,Gardner-Webb has been a good experience to begin my college career. I've met many nice people and the staff is extremely helpful. It is a Christian college with many opportunities for service.
Sophomore,4,"Gardner-Webb University is a liberal arts school that holds it's academics in high esteem, along with opportunities for spiritual growth.  The smaller campus promotes a tight-knit community where you can always count on a friend being close by."
Freshman,4,"Gardner-Webb is a great private Christian college.  Being a smaller school, it fit with what I was looking for located outside of Charlotte and close to the mountains.  They have a great admission dept and a newer nursing facility that appealed to me. I have made several good friends while here and I love it."
College Senior,4,"I have never had an issue with safety on campus, and am largely unaware of issues that do happen on campus."
Recent Alumnus,4,Its a division 1 school.
Recent Alumnus,4,So far my experience has been great the school is beautiful and in a good location.
College Junior,4,"Overall I love this place. While it wasn't my top choice I'm glad I've got to experience college here. The classes are relatively small enough for you to develop relationships with professors. There's plenty of majors offered, and broadening you horizon is always encouraged."
College Junior,4,We have plenty of opportunities for internships and possible career starts. We often have plenty of alumni in high places and they are always more than welcome to open up doors for upcoming grads. We have a number of career fairs throughout the year to help with career opportunities as well.
College Junior,4,"Housing here is great. The staff is friendly and easy to work with. They help as much as best they can with students wants and needs. The places on campus to stay would be the Apartments. As far as dorms, from a guys point of view the best one would be Mauney."
College Junior,4,There's a lot done for us as students since we are located in a small quite town. The people on campus are fair and friendly.
College Freshman,4,We don't have the best teams in the world but the fans are so supportive and school spirit is big!
College Freshman,4,"My experience with professors have been great. I love how small the class sizes are, and how they take the time to sit down with their students one-on-one. They do everything they can to make sure you succeed. I believe most courses are fairly easy if you put your mind to it, and efficiently work."
College Freshman,4,"I am a freshman, and I personally have not had a chance to really explore many of those opportunities. Many fellow students have talked about them with me. From my understanding we have excellent internship programs. The staff does whatever they can to help you kickstart your career, and keep the students motivated to achieve."
College Freshman,4,"What makes my school great is the friendly atmosphere. At Gardner-Webb, students are surrounded by a caring faculty, and staff. They welcome everyone in with a smile on their face. I love the acquaint feeling you get as you walk across campus. Overall it is a welcoming school with a lot of compassion to follow."
College Freshman,4,"It is a private campus, so it's very secure"
College Freshman,4,"I like the small class sizes, people and professors"
College Freshman,4,The rooms can get better furniture in the future
College Freshman,4,The only intramural team I have done is softball
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy my classes and the friends I've made
College Sophomore,4,I never worry when walking by myself on campus!
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoyed living in Stroup hall my freshman year, it helped me make a lot of friendships and become involved in some activities within the dorm."
College Freshman,4,"I have a variety of different classes and professors I can choose from, and that is extremely helpful to me. The courses challenge me in a way that I am still able to learn, but I have to put in a decent amount of work for it. The class sizes aren't large at all, so I still have the ability to learn and have one-on-one time with my professor."
College Freshman,4,"I haven't fully taken advantage of these resources, but I hear they're great and very accommodating to students."
College Freshman,4,"Some of the older dorms need some work done to them. For example, repainting the doors and closets, fixing the community bathrooms, and the heating/air unit. The dorms are convenient because they are in the middle of campus and everything is a short walk."
College Freshman,4,"School spirit is what brings the student body together, and I feel that we do a good job of that. There is always a crowd at a game and they support a team whether they win or lose. The facilities are great, however, I feel as if some of the practice fields are dangerous for ankle injuries."
College Freshman,4,"I love Gardner-Webb. I wish there were more extra-curricular activities and more faith-based activities for people who want to grow in their relationship with the Lord. Even though it's a small school, I still find things to do and have fun. The teachers are wonderful and always take time out of their schedule to help me understand something. I have a lot of resources available, and I'm still waiting to take advantage of those."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel extremely safe on campus. On orientation day, the chief of campus police gave us all his cell phone number to use if we needed him...which was extremely helpful in making me feel safe here."
College Sophomore,4,"This is an amazing school. I honestly couldn't imagine myself anywhere else. The classes are the perfect size, the teachers genuinely care about their students, and everyone is extremely friendly."
College Sophomore,4,My adviser is constantly sending out emails to the students in her major program (myself included) about job opportunities for our major. It is extremely helpful in keeping me hopeful about finding a job in my field.
College Sophomore,4,Fan support is great at the football games. I have not been to a game that is not a packed stadium. There is a huge sense of school spirit at the sporting events.
College Sophomore,4,"My school is great. It honestly wasn't my first choice, but I am so glad that I chose it. I have made amazing friends and I am in love with the whole small town feel that the school provides."
Junior,2,"Before you go to school here, make sure you are aware of how much money you will owe. It's absolutely insane the tuition to go to this school. I was told in the beginning from financial aid I would be allotted a certain amount of money left over from my student loans to live off of...It was not what they told me, and when school started and they gave me 950.00 to live off of for a whole semester, it was insane. This school gets over 33,000 a year from students, charges 15.00 fir a transcript, charges you for them to return your book back, etc. This is supposed to be a Christian school, wow. This school is money hungry and nobody recognizes who this college is. You mine as well pay for an education at Duke, Harvard, but this.. Good Luck my friends and just know if your parents arent helping you, you are going to be in a world of debt. That equals to, $132,000 for four years of school! Think about it."
College Sophomore,2,There is no party scene.
College Sophomore,2,"I have received no help in financial aid. I have had family members passed away that were helping me pay, and the financial aid office will not cut me a break."
College Freshman,2,"I think many rules like visitation hours, doors cracked and alcohol on campus if you are above age is a little ridiculous. We are old enough to make our own decisions... It feels like camp."
College Sophomore,2,Few options. Hours are limited. No discounts.
College Sophomore,2,This school should be considered a boot camp.
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, I am not a partier. I don't attend parties here. To me, college parties are just bad in general."
College Sophomore,2,"The school throws dances from time to time, but they're more like middle school dances, if anything"
College Senior,2,"Because the surrounding area is small, there just isn't a lot of choices. I commute over an hour to school every day."
College Freshman,2,The classes aren't very major specific at Gardner-Webb since it's a liberal arts school
College Freshman,2,I am a member of the Varsity Soccer team at Gardner-Webb and I believe that the quality of facilities is not high and the number of fans is not high.
College Junior,2,The school is strict on alcohol and drugs. The campus is tobacco and alcohol free. Depeneding on where you live and who the RA is the strictness changes. The suites and apartments have many parties and many things can be gotten away with. But in the dorms the visitiation hours are strict and opposite genders cannot stay the night easily. The RAs usually are chill and let things slide. The housing and residence officer however will charge for every small damage however.
College Junior,2,"Most people cannot move off campus till senior year, or when theyre 21. The school makes it hard to move off without losing aid."
College Junior,2,There is nothing open besides the gas station after 11PM. GWU is in a small town with a handfull of fastfood and local eateries. Shelby NC and Gaffney SC are both 15 min away where many more options exist.
College Junior,2,"Gas is going up, we have to use our own cars to get around"
College Sophomore,2,"The professors aren't the best. They are unorganized and sporadic. They have a lot on their minds and plates, but if they can, they will find time to spend with you and talk with you personally."
College Student,2,"There is none, therefore your own personal vehicle or great friends that has cars is needed. I have not brought my car down here as of yet, I needed to get adjusted and focus on my classes, therefore I depend on people that I have meet or I just walk to the closet drug store to purchase items that I need.  My mother is also helpful and doesn't""t mind taking the two hour drive to bring me items that I may need."
College Freshman,2,Most people go off-campus to party. Parties on campus aren't really all that.
College Freshman,2,"The only things close to us are KFC, Taco Bell, McDonalds, and Hardee's. Most people go to Shelby or Gaffney to get food. And everything in the town closes at 11."
College Junior,2,Commuting means having to find a park on campus. Not helpful with on campus students with vehicles. They get first choice of local parking.  Parking is not closely available to classrooms. Must park down the hill and walk back.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Nightlife at Gardner-Webb consist of people coming together and creating there own fun. You really can not party on campus because this is not a party school. On weekends there is a sport event going on. After the event, everyone goes to Shelby, Charlotte, South Carolina, or a house party off campus. Most people has a DD when they go to parties and people travel in big groups. Underage people do not drink at the parties because they do not want the older age people to get into trouble."
College Junior,2,There have been a few crimes on Gardner-Webb's campus and theft is a well-known and experienced crime for most people. Lighting around campus is also lacking thus causing personal safety to be lacking when walking around campus at night. Living in the dorms is definitely a better choice than living in a suite or apartment when dealing with the safety of students.
College Sophomore,2,Food is NASTY. Seriously. Prepare to have the runs 24/7 for your entire freshman year.
College Sophomore,2,the weather is tolerable. When I listen to the weather report before classes I am able to dress accordingly
College Senior,2,every student in the nursing program have to make 80 and above which is a C in order to be in the nursing program; and this has really been challenging.
College Freshman,2,It rains a lot.  Be sure to bring your rain boots and rain jacket!
College Sophomore,2,"A little variety, the cafe pretty much sucks. Wow has it moments, but mostly is overly greasy."
College Sophomore,2,"Mostly run of the mill Southern Baptist, very strict."
College Freshman,2,"parking sucks,lol. But everything is no more than five minutes away from wherever you are atany given time"
College Junior,2,"In order to receive any financial aid I had to be the one to look through the available scholarships and apply for them. The school did not let me know which ones I was eligible for, I had to figure that out for myself. The application processes was not too difficult for the scholarships. One of the scholarships I applied for they lost part of the application information and I had to re-send it. One thing I do like is that if I need help or what to know if there is anything else I can do to get more aid, all I have to do is go talk to someone in the financial aid office and most of the people who work there are very kind and helpful. I also like that they have a facebook page where they post any available scholarships outside of the university that you can apply for. Unfortunately the University itself did not give me hardly anything in financial aid, despite the fact that I have a 3.89 GPA."
College Junior,2,"The truth in its eternity is that due to the new additions, there has been a lack of attention due to needed repairs in the dorm. There was a broken alarm system, a few students had damages in their rooms which took them either weeks or months to get to. Also, the housing planner is good but not great when having to compare roommates. The planner did a horrible job on my junior year which caused a downward spiral on my GPA from 3.15 to a 2.58. As for the janitors, they do a great job cleaning and sanitizing the bathrooms."
College Sophomore,2,I attend a distance learning program. So there really isin't much of a life on campus. I have to attend a distance learning program because I have to work full time while I attend college.
College Junior,2,"I do not think there is much to choose from as far as off-campus housing goes in this area, because most of the students live on campus."
College Senior,2,Everyone is average in looks and dress. Casual is best.
College Junior,2,"No Discounts – There are mostly fast food restaurants near the school, like McDonalds, Taco Bell, Hardees, and KFC. There are also two Italian places that are really good. The problem is that they do not give any kind of discount to students. There prices are good and they're convenient and have variety, but there is no discount for students, which I think is ridiculous"
College Junior,2,"Punishments Usually Involve Fines – The punishments on campus are very strict I would say.  There are rules about when people of the opposite sex can be in your dorm, suite, or apartment if you live on campus.  If you break these rules, you will pay a fine (usually start at $75).  Gardner-Webb is a dry campus so any alcohol or alcohol paraphernalia is not allowed.  Very severe fines are given to students who break these rules and the penalties are even greater if you are an athlete."
College Senior,2,"The Burden of Musicians – As a musician, we are often overworked and under appreciated. People just don't truly understand the difficulties of being a music major. Though it is very fun being able to play instruments as a college major, so much work goes into it that one wonders at times if it is even enjoyable anymore."
College Senior,2,If I Could Choose Again – I love music but it's so frustrating. I would've definitely made it my minor instead of my major.
College Sophomore,2,Not Enough and Expensive – There isn't enough parking on campus for commuters and those who stay on campus. The permit is extremely expensive.
College Freshman,2,Food Isnt Too Good – The food here is not what you would think it would be.  For it to be a private school you would think that the food would be up to date and appealing.  The best things that I have eaten is the Rib eye steaks.
College Junior,1,We have no real Greek Life on campus whatsoever.
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,It is mostly fast food restaurants mixed in with a few local places.
College Freshman,1,"I do not like living in the middle of no where, I'm used to a more suburban lifestyle."
College Freshman,1,There isn't greek life at Gardner-Webb University.
College Freshman,1,Only a few students live off campus because the university does not encourage students to live off campus.
College Junior,1,it is nonexistent. It does not exist and never will
College Junior,1,"We are in a dry town. The closest bars are in Shelby, but then if any fun wants to be had you must travel the hour and 15 min to Charlotte."
College Sophomore,1,There are lots of places to eat and some have dollar menus.
College Senior,1,I'm online not on the campus
College Senior,1,"Parking is extremely close to classes and dorms. However, parking spaces are very hard to find during the day."
College Sophomore,1,"Everyone is mega-religious. If you're not a fundie (fundamentalist), prepare to be ostracized and have no friends. If you're a Democrat (or even a more moderate Republican, prepare to have no friends. And if you're LGBT and plan on being out, do not even THINK about going to Gardner-Webb. Please take my advice-- spare yourself the heartache, bullying, and trauma. Go somewhere else. You can't be LGBT and happy here; you're lucky if you even survive your four years."
College Sophomore,1,"You do NOT want to live on-campus here, but there's nowhere off-campus to live, really, unless you live 15 minutes away in Shelby."
College Sophomore,1,"I mean, basically, all you need to get in is a pulse. Academics here reflect that."
College Sophomore,1,"NIGHTLIFE?? In Boiling Springs, North Carolina?! Surely you jest. The only thing open after 9 pm is the super-sketchy Mini-Mart."
College Sophomore,1,Any openly LBGT student who makes it four years in this place without committing suicide deserves a medal.
College Sophomore,1,"I don't have a car, so I wouldn't know. Most of my friends say the parking situation is pretty much a nightmare, though."
College Freshman,1,"The cafe isn't good, but there are other options on campus."
College Freshman,1,"There are a few students that are of different races and religions, but not many"
College Sophomore,1,"They lost my w2 multiple time,It was almost a month into the semester before I got any type of results."
College Freshman,1,There's rarely any parties on campus. The closest most exciting thing to do is go to the Shelby movies which is twenty minutes away
College Sophomore,1,There are a few options but the options available are often limited or not as good as expected. Sometimes they can get a bit pricy. The only good thing Gardner-Webb has done as far as dining is having a Chick-Fil-A on campus. They need to bring back the longer hours that it is open because students would really take advantage of the opportunity.
College Junior,1,"The reason is that they rarely talk about the scholarships they reward. They leave it up to the student to read the course book and apply for them. The department dealing with the details only talk about Perkins loan, loans, and Family Plus."
College Student,1,"Beautiful campus and really nice people. Great ideas, academic options, and core values. My biggest disappointment lies not in the school but with Financial Aid. I graduated high school a top 15 and 4.0 student. Plenty of community service and even volunteer activities in at another college I wasn't even a student at. They still wanted me to take out loans. As an individual I do not believe in going into a black hole of debt for the rest of my life to try an pay for something I'm not sure is worth it. Instead I chose to work full time until who knows when. It's sad, because I could've been a great student but the money just isn't there. Guess it's a bad time to go to college in this country. Oh well, beggars can't be choosers."
College Junior,1,"Not Enough and Expensive – I think the parking situation is AWFUL! They do not have anywhere near enough parking. Now I understand that the faculty and Staff have seniority in getting the parking spots near the classroom and administration buildings and such. Pretty much there is no option of driving to class because all the parking spots up there are for faculty, but that is fine with me, though kind of a pain if its raining. The problem I have is that there is not enough parking at my dorm, really there is only enough parking near my dorm for about half the girls that live there, which means when all those are full you have to park way out in no man's land and walk a long ways back to your dorm. One reason this is such a problem is because they charge you $100 a semester for parking, and then do not have anywhere near enough. Where's all that parking money going too, if it's not going to making more parking availability?"
College Senior,1,"No Requirements – There is no process of elimination of being a music major at my school. If you want to be a music major, then you're a music major. It doesn't even matter if you have no experience whatsoever."
College Senior,1,"Parking is very terrible because you pay a high amount to be able to park, but there isnt that many parking spaces to park. Most of the parking spaces are dedicated to teachers."
College Senior,1,Night Life – At gardner-webb there really isnt no where to go during the night life. You have to travel 30 mins away to have fun.
College Sophomore,1,"Gardner-Webb is located in a very small, dry community, so I suppose the reason for campus police to always be on lookout is something to do, to them. Every campus party gets busted and shut down, almost every campus get together gets busted and shut down. This mainly occurs in the apartment area. The apartments have the same rules as the dorms; no noise after 10 pm, no guest after midnight, etc.. All of these rules have punishments however the fines are even crazier. Anything found or documented is a $40+ fine, and alcohol fines can also be severe."
College Sophomore,1,Transportation at Gardner-Webb University only happens when you need a ride to the airport during Exam week. Other than that you have to depend on your friends that have a car or to walk every where if you need something. Here in Boiling Springs you are on your own when it comes to transportation
College Freshman,1,I received little financial aid and it was a hassle to get. Took a long time to get any kind of financial aid. Also the financial aid I receive didn't really help with the cost here. It still leaves me struggling to find a way to help pay for school.
College Freshman,1,We have no form of transportation system around here.
College Freshman,1,"Strict on Little Things – The school, gives you little to no freedom. If you have a party its going to get shut down no matter what. Even if you are of legal age to drink you will get fined and have to appeal. We even have a policy for the cafe. If you get caught taking more than two pieces of fruit out then you get arrested and charged for stealing. Its just crazy!"
College Freshman,1,Dorm Life – I expected fun activities and meeting alot of cool people but its not like that at all. I am living at the suites next year.
College Freshman,1,"Punishments Are Sever – Alcohol & drugs on campus are completely restricted. If you get caught more than twice, you are expelled from campus. You have a pa a huge fine everytime you are caught as well."
College Freshman,1,"Enjoy It? There is no actual ""fun life"" at Gardner-Webb, there is nothing around for multiple miles if anything at all. The only way to survive is the people &amp; that's if they choose to be social with you. Because it is a private ""church school"" people are overly judgmental and easily intimidated;; adults are strict but there is still a sense of freedom. Getting a job is rare, people aspect the students parents to pay for everything, while others do not have that luxury."
College Senior,1,"In my opinion, parking is handled poorly here. Parking tickets are ridiculously overpriced (because all you get is the privelege of parking in a gravel lot behind Hardees, basically) and campus and town police are unreasonable. I have gotten various tickets and fines for violations that I didn't even commit, or that could not be helped. I have even had professors tell me where to park, only to find a $50 parking ticket lying on my windshield. The town simply does everything they can to get money."
College Junior,1,"Gardner-Webb is located in a very small town, Boiling Springs NC. There aren't any clubs in the area, the closest ones are in Charlotte, which is about 45 minutes away. Boiling Springs is a ""dry town"" so no alcohol is sold there, but the neighboring city, Shelby is not. There are a few parties on campus or in off campus apartments every once in a while but getting caught with alcohol is really bad, since 1-it's in a dry town and 2-it's a christian university."
College Junior,1,Living Off Campus Is Cheaper – Rules are less strict. The cost is cheaper than living in the dorms.
College Junior,1,Very Boring – The dorms have not been updated since the 1970's. Everyone goes home on the weekends. It is a pretty dull campus

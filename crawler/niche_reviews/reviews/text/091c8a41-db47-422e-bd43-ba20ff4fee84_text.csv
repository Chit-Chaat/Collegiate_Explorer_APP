Senior,5,"Because of COVID-19, my entire nursing class was switched to online the middle of the semester, as the rest of the colleges were in the country. However, the transition was almost seamless. There were some ups and downs like there are in any school setting, but my professors were very understanding of the extra stress that we, the students, were under as a result fo the switch. They constantly prayed for us in and outside of class, they made sure to keep in contact with us as much as possible, whether that was a personal text message, phone call, or group email with the other students. The success of the students is their number one priority. It is such a great school!"

Alum,5,"I loved every facet of my education at this university. This university helped and matured me in many ways. While attending, each course had a Biblical reference intertwined into it. Instructors really care about each and their walk with God. Therefore, while I attended chapel each week, I realized that my spiritual life was flourishing. I began to pray and spend more time with God.  In addition, I begin to listen more spiritual music. Moreover, the profound education that was afforded to was exceptional. University of Mobile’s education helps students to go further and to be prepared for Graduate School.

There are so many events that happen so often and they offer a variety of Intramurals. The teachers are wonderful and there are so many opportunities for musicians. The school is music and heavily nursing based.
Senior,5,They understand working adults and understand our need for a fully online platform for us to be able to take classes our our own time when we have it between work and school.
Senior,5,"I am currently a senior at the University of Mobile.  I have had an amazing experience so far, but I am sad to see it come to an end next May.  There have been both ups and downs throughout my time at the University, but I would not trade those times for anything else.  I have made so many friends because of being on the basketball team and also because it is a small campus with a lot of different opportunities to meet new people."

Sophomore,5,This is the most amazing school ever. I am happy that I am able to receive my education all while serving and learning about the Lord as well.
Junior,5,"The university of Mobile is like a breath of fresh air.. What school can you attend that actually has a chapel where you can hear the word of God twice a week. I love it.. when you're feeling tired, frustrated, overwhelmed, happy or just need someone to talk to, you can always depend on them to give you the word of God that can get you back on your way/on your feet.. It's a joy of fulfillment, that's unexplainable and I'll recommend this University to anyone!"

Sophomore,5,"The University of Mobile is a fantastic school with a great staff!  The students there are easy to talk to and get involved with, the staff seems to have a genuine care for you and your success, and the professors are all passionate about their work and want to see you succeed.  My only complaint is that the President places so much of his attention on the Nursing and Music programs that the other programs seem to be placed on the back burner.  Otherwise, it is a great school and an amazing experience that I would recommend to anyone!"

Freshman,5,"I visited the university when I was 12 and knew it was where I wanted to attend college.  I love everything about the school, especially as it pertains to my major.  The professors in my degree program are wonderful, and the students and associates are like a family.  I feel like I am a part of something that matters, and I have been given opportunities as a freshman that I would have never dreamed possible.  I don't yet have a read on investment return since I'm in my first semester but I believe after 4 years I will be able to give it 5 stars. I would encourage students to seriously consider UM."

All events are morally wholesome and never once have I felt uncomfortable or unsafe. The campus life makes sure that people are being responsible and rules keep the students in line. The people at the University of Mobile are a unique breed. We are accepting of people who might be rejected else where. Since it is a small campus, most people know each other and are very friendly. People will go out of their way to help and make sure people are having a fantastic college experience. The classes are fairly easy, unless you are a nursing major; we have one of the best programs in Alabama! I cant imagine being on any other campus. Best of all, the cafeteria food is actually good! I don't dread going to eat at the caf!!! This is the best place for me, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to go to a safe, Baptist school with a positive environment for growing in your christian walk."
College Freshman,5,The administration is fair to the students and will look over small things that students have in their past to allow them to still persue their college career
College Junior,5,"Living on campus is the absolute best! Living on campus keeps me in the loop of what's going on at all times. I know when events are and have the ease of getting there.

Living on campus has a very social atmosphere and makes it so easy to get to know others."

I transferred to UM last fall (2019) for Nursing and will be a graduating with my BSN in May 2021. The faculty and staff are very supportive of their students and will do anything they can to ensure their students succeed in college. The professors will pray for you, counsel with you, love on you, and make you feel less stressed if you are at the point of being overloaded with assignments. The University of Mobile has been the greatest thing that has ever happened to me and I can't wait to be there again this next school year!"

Senior,4,"Overall great experience. Counselors, staff, and professors are very accommodating and a pleasure to work with. Enrollment process was easy."
Sophomore,4,"I am a sophomore at the University of Mobile, and this far it has been an amazing experience. The values of the school are based in the Bible, and all the professors I have encountered genuinely care about the students and their work. There are tons of campus activities throughout the year and it is a very inclusive school. The only thing I would want to change is expanding the arts department. I believe they are slowly working toward that- but it is something I would like to see more of."
Freshman,4,"University of Mobile cares about each student and care about our spiritual growth.  I am in RamCorps, a traveling percussion and brass band, at UM.  We travel on weekends and many times get back late on Sunday night or the wee hours of Monday morning.  We are still expected to attend 8 am classes on Monday.  Something needs to be done about this problem."
Sophomore,4,University of Mobile is a great college if you are looking for a place to get an education and not have to worry about the distractions of being at a huge party school. It has great academics and athletics and if you are looking for a party scene there is a party school 25min down the road.
Freshman,4,I love this school! I am about to finish my first semester here. I have been involved with this school for about 4-5 years and I'm glad to go here. One thing I would change is more dining options for the weekend because we all now how broke us college students are. 
Freshman,4,It's been absolutely amazing. It's a small campus so everyone knows everyone. The teachers also get more of an understanding of the students and get to know them. If I could change one thing it would be the amount of food choices we get access to. 
College Sophomore,4,I have learned so much about selected subjects and about life from my professors.
College Sophomore,4,Student succes is always trying to let us know about job opportunities
College Sophomore,4,"I feel very safe on campus. As far as health, we do not have a nurse who is always available."

My classes are also spread out so I have time to study, relax, or do something else that needed to be done. My class are also not very long but long enough to learn something new and understand what needs to be known. All the teachers are nice and they have plenty of events so your never bored while on cimpus. Students can still leave the cimpus because there are restaurant, parks, And place to go out and have fun. University of Mobile is a good educational school to be a christian or just regular student to be at."

College Freshman,4,I own a house off campus that was fairly priced and is also very close to campus

College Junior,4,"Scholarships are great things and I am very grateful for them, but I do wish there were more scholarship opportunities here. Rather than paying full tuition for athletes who party too hard and could care less about the school, it would be nice if the school provided other scholarship opportunities, even if they have a small monetary value. Every bit helps!"
College Junior,4,"The ""party scene"" at UM isn't your typical scene. It doesn't involve drinking, drugs, and sex. Instead, we have a rockin' campus life that hosts several events throughout the year. These events are fun for everyone and if someone doesn't enjoy it, it is likely that it is their own fault."

College Junior,4,The campus is small and all the buildings from the residential halls to the academic buildings are within walking distance from each other which is wonderful.

Senior,2,"This school is ideal for students who seek to be in a close minded, right winged, small university. As an open minded, progressive, empowered woman, this certainly was not a good fit for me."
College Sophomore,2,"The security guards rarely really do anything, but sit in their post and do not really check half of the cars that come in the gate."
College Sophomore,2,"An alright school. If you're okay with being judged ruthlessly as well as sub-par academics, food, housing, and especially people, UM is probably the college for you! In my opinion, it is definitely not worth the high tuition."
College Freshman,2,"At the University of Mobile, because the population of the school in so low in comparison to other schools, at approximately 1,700 students, on campus the only places to eat is in the cafeteria or Java City (coffee shop).  Students meal plans can be used at Java City once a day to replace going to the cafeteria."
College Junior,2,"The campus has recently built new apartment style dorms, but the parking in the dorm area is still bad. They have opened a new lot behind the girl's dorm, but everywhere else is cramped and unless it s the weekend there are no spaces available. Every other parking lot on campus is usually full as well. The best time to look for a spot is between classes. The parking is not based on grade, so it is first come first serve."
College Sophomore,2,We Drive Ourselves – There is no transportation at the school besides the people who have cars.
College Junior,2,"There are plenty of restaurants.  We don't have many vegetarian options, but we do have a few.  We have more southern soul food, than we do anything else.  We have a lot of fast food and buffet style restaurants.  Drinks and fries are oversized, but thats what some people love most about the South."
College Junior,2,"I personally have had a hard time adjusting to the weather in mobile. My voice teacher told me once, If I could sing in mobile, I could sing anywhere. It wasn't until I moved to mobile that I developed allergies and asthma. The weather is so unpredictable and you can just about guarantee it to rain everyday. It is a very damp atmosphere which causes sickness for lots of students."

College Sophomore,1,Worst coaches in the country.

College Sophomore,1,Im not from the area so i dont reall now muc but there really isnt much around the univerty. there re some houses in a neighborhood by the school and someapartmets about 2 miles away but it really isnttht much cheaper than living on campus.  I also do notave a car so thereforit would be impossible fr me to live off campus because there is no public transperation to the university.

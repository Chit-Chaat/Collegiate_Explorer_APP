Junior,5,Online classes were a lot easier for me because I could do my work on my own time as long as it was done in time.
Niche User,5,"I would not like to see anything change, I went on a tour there and it was awesome. Everything about it made me feel as if I was at home. Very good food, small classes, nice facilities."
Sophomore,5,Martin  Methodists  College is a very good college.  The professors and the staff care about the wealth fare of the students.  My sister in  law went to Martin.
Alum,5,"My experience at Martin Methodist was very memorable! From playing golf, to research trips, to the close knit feel on campus I would recommend MMC to everyone!"
Niche User,5,I love Martin Methodist all around. The school is very beautiful and in a very small town. I love that the school is very small and they have the exact major I want. I plan on playing softball there so I am very excited about that. I love how small the classes are and how close everyone is. Everyone is there for you and it is a big family. I would like to see change in some of the athletics so they can have a football team. I love the school and everything all in all. I also love how diverse the school is. The campus is also very clean and safe. Everyone is very caring and I can not wait to major in Nursing and live out my childhood dream of playing softball in college at a school that is the perfect fit for me.
Freshman,5,"Martin is a great place, full of joy and smiles from everyone, martin is the type of place you go to if you don’t like big schools and you want to build a family with the people there. Martin isn’t an easy college but you can tell with the employees/professors  and alumni’s they try to help as much as they can and make it fun at the same time."
Sophomore,5,"Instructors are great and really want to help you get your education. Class time variety is great. You have the option between online, day or night classes which can help out someone like me who has to work full time."
Sophomore,5,"So far my experience at Martin has been great in the classroom. The professors work with the students very well and the help offered through the school is great. The social options of the town are not very great, but you learn to make do in such a small town."
Freshman,5,"Martin Methodist College is not like most universities. MMC is a close-knit school where one-on-one with professors is possible and encouraged. The teachers are well educated and know how to relay the information well to students to make it easy to understand and comprehend. There are things around campus that could be improved in order to make the school better, and currently we are trying to do something about such things as getting purified water fountains in the dorms. These things are possible because of the size and power of our small student body."
Sophomore,5,I like that the campus is small and I can get help from my teachers whenever I need it. It would be nice if tuition didn't go up every semester. I'm thankful for the location of the school because it's close to my home.
College Freshman,5,I love Martin Methodist College! Martin was the only college that I was really interested in. I feel like if I went to a bigger school I wouldn't be as happy as I am right now.
College Freshman,5,"I love my professors, and everyone is like a great big family. The small class sizes allow a one on one relationship with professors and peers. I enjoy having everything within walking distance of the dorm, and being able to make friendships that will last a life time."
College Freshman,5,"I love my professors, they are easy to talk to, make class enjoyable and are very personable with each and every student."
College Junior,5,I absolutely love MMC and I wouldn't change my experience for the world.
College Junior,5,"We have spring flings, homecoming week and dance, winter formal! It's awesome!"
College Junior,5,It's incredible. We have so much going on all the time. There is never a full moment. Everyone is always involved and having an awesome time.
College Junior,5,I feel safer on campus at Martin than I do at home!
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus and the use of drugs and alcohol is strictly prohibited
College Freshman,5,"Great selection of housing, from apartments to dorms"
College Freshman,5,MMC has a gorgeous campus that is well groomed and taken care of
Junior,4,"It has been pretty good so far I have a lot of friends I know I will have for years to come. Overall, athletics I don’t recommend, academics I definitely recommend."
Freshman,4,This college is one of the best in Tennessee. My first year was great at Martin Methodist College. all the professors made my first year great. I will recommend a local student to attend Martin Methodist College.
Sophomore,4,"This college gives the hometown feel, everyone knows everyone, professors are personal and helpful, and everyone is extremely welcoming and kind."
Freshman,4,"I like the fact that the college is small and made it easier for me to get to know plenty of people, including professors. I also enjoy the sports program here and how involved most of the students are in sports. I would change some of the entertainment activities that occur on campus. I would try to get student more involved in coming out and participating in the activities and letting the students have a nice time in college."
Freshman,4,"I love Martin Methodist. The atmosphere is great. I love their athletics department their sportsmanship is amazing. They offer many different scholarships. Everyone at Martin Methodist College is like family. The staff really do care about you as an individual. The campus is beautiful and so are the personalities of people there. The food and dining is not the best. If you can help it, I would avoid the cafeteria. Unless you like eating chicken constantly. It's livable food but it's not something you want to eat all the time."
College Sophomore,4,"Academics at Martin Methodist college are very highly rated. the professors are really nice and understanding, and if something is not understood they make sure that by the end of the class everyone is on the same page. The workload at Martin is as you would expect at college. There is a Student Resource Center on campus where students can go and get tutoring and any help they might need to prepare for classes. There are not specific study areas on campus, but you can study at picnic tables around campus or anywhere you feel most comfortable. Lots of people like to hang hammocks around campus and study on a nice day."
College Sophomore,4,"The diversity at Martin Methodist College is very broad. We have students from all over the world. Although our name entails that we are a Methodist affiliated school, we have many different religions. We also have people from different backgrounds come and find a feeling of safety and friends that they have tons in common with."
College Freshman,4,We have security around campus and I feel relatively safe walking around campus.
College Freshman,4,Im interested in something dealing with Religious Life but I haven't fully set my heart to anything yet.
College Freshman,4,"Athletics are a big part of the Martin Methodist Community. Intramural sports are a great quality that the school has, that gets students involved in Campus life."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is located in a small town, the school helped build the town and the citizens are fond of the students. There are not many campus police officers roaming around however the cities police do all the time"
College Freshman,4,Te degree programs are looked highly upon and interships for the school are fairly easy to find. Career search after graduation is fairly easy to find.
College Freshman,4,The housing is extremely good for as old as the buildings are. The rooms for the most part are cleaned upon arrival and the floors are cleaned daily. Overall the environment is great.
College Freshman,4,"The school itself is a great and friendly environment. The professors care about their students and I love the smaller class sizes. The campus is taken care of and the dorms are not bad especially for being as old as they are. I am able to walk from class to class with no problem and office hours are convienent to me. The food for the school is not the best; however, there are plenty of choices to eat."
College Sophomore,4,Most of the places to stay off campus are pretty close in distance to the college and are fairly cheap and affordable.
College Sophomore,4,"The campus food is quite delicious. The variety is great, something new everyday , and you have many options."
College Freshman,4,Girls dorms are close to the cafeteria & classes.
College Junior,4,I actually play soccer and I love the program
College Junior,4,"Typical Tennessee weather, a mix of warm and cold."
College Junior,4,"I don't know much about sports, but MMC appears to do well in all areas."
College Junior,4,Professors strive for excellence in themselves and their students. A lot of study abroad and a great honors program also enhance MMC
College Junior,4,The rules and regulations put in place here make MMC so wonderful. I feel very at home and safe here which would not be possible without these guidelines
College Junior,4,I have not noticed any illicit activity and feel very safe and secure on campus
College Junior,4,Parking is great and maintained well
College Freshman,4,"Weather is pretty typical for TN, southern heat and unexpected winters:)"
College Freshman,4,Parking is assigned and handled very effectively/effieciently
College Freshman,4,"The campus has rules and expects you to follow them, if you do, there is no problem. They are able to keep order and safety on campus so I appreciate anything they do!"
College Freshman,4,The small town atmosphere makes it very friendly and contributes to my feeling safe on campus
College Freshman,4,"They offer multiple scholarships that cover the costs of tuition quite effectively. With good grades, one can get well over half of the tuition paid"
College Junior,4,"There are plenty of great activities on campus, there is a Relay for Life team, student government and many other clubs to get involved in. The drama students put on amazing plays and I have heard that concerts are great too. Chapel really brings the campus together as well as athletic events. Everything is kept in order and in shape. It is a very clean and orderly campus."
College Junior,4,"There is an honor code that each student is required to sign and a ceremony they get to partake in as well. The campus is small and intimate. But the green is what makes Mart Methodist stand out. Nearly an acre of green space lies in the center of the campus where students can relax, play games and eventually ""cross the green"" at graduation."
College Junior,4,"The admissions program is taken very seriously at Martin Methodist in terms of the education program. All applicants have to complete the course Intro to Education, a background check (by TBI), an interview and a writing prompt as well as membership to STEA. School success is very important any grades below a B in education courses simply will not do. Compared to other schools I looked at (MTSU, etc.) this process seemed pretty normal to me and very organized. I have no suggestions as the process has been easy to understand and easy to go through."
College Junior,4,"The professors at Martin Methodist take education seriously, the professors within the education program are no exception. They crave to develop teachers that instill a passion and drive for learning."
College Junior,4,"I would say that there is definitely availability around the school area to live off campus. Many places that are close landlords will work with students if they may be late in rent or whatever because they know they are going to school. I like living at home, off campus because it gives me a break from school and helps me focus on studying."
College Junior,4,"The Restaurants on the strip which is the main road on the right side of the campus give students discounts when students show their student I.D. The general fast food is the normal prices, but if you want a good meal at a good price I would recommend Common Ground Café. It is really good and has a variety of options and not if at all more than getting a meal at a fast food place."
College Freshman,4,"I found the major I wanted, and although I've struggled a bit this past semester, I'm really enjoying working toward a degree in music."
College Freshman,4,"I love the tight-knit campus, it gives opportunity for more one-on-one help and it makes it so much easier to make new friends."
College Freshman,4,"I don't really know that much about the sports. I'm in the music program and spend most of my time around the other ""music nuts""."
College Sophomore,4,"It all depends on you. If you are willing to put forth time and effort to the commitment, no acceptance is necessary. Only you accept the fact you want to commit to being a future physician."
College Sophomore,4,"Biology/Behavioral Science is a unique field and it is definitely two that I equally enjoy. The mind and anatomy of the human body are absolutely amazing. Since I do take 20 hours, the workload does get intense, but it will forever prepare me for medical school course work."
College Sophomore,2,There is only one place to eat on campus.
College Sophomore,2,The school I attend is the only attraction to the city.
College Junior,2,"I do not party, I only hear stories."
College Junior,2,It's extremely hard to get any help from anyone.
College Senior,2,Some of the houses around campus are nice but all of downtown is a rough community so be ready to live next to trailer trash and drug dealers.
College Junior,2,Students have to drive anywhere from a half hour or more just to get to school.
College Junior,2,Students on campus may not need cars because all the classes are within walking distance. However since the school is far away from most of our homes alot of us have to drive a pretty long ways to get there.
College Freshman,2,"When it's cold or rainy, everyone has to walk in the cold or rain for a good distance.."
College Junior,2,"We have the cafeteria and a small coffee shop on campus.  Both of these are ok food-wise, but the prices are high...especially the coffee shop.  We are college students not working professionals with plenty of money.  Cut the prices and lower the tuition, because with a tuition like you charge, the food should be included in the fee of tuition, room, and board!"
College Freshman,2,The usual college life parties. Not very many clubs in the area.
College Freshman,2,once you find a space don't ever move your car. very bad parking
College Sophomore,2,Fast Food – there are about 6 fast food restaurants and only 2 sit down.  there isn't much of the town.
College Sophomore,1,You have to drive at least 30 miles.
College Sophomore,1,We only have one chapter that isn't even considered Greek life.
College Junior,1,"Pulaski, Tennessee is a small town located 45 minutes from Nashville. There is nothing to do in Pulaski but at least there is a city close by."
College Junior,1,Our library is open to the public so it's hard to get an open computer any time during the day.
College Senior,1,Computer labs are never available and Internet service is a joke.
College Senior,1,Several classes were in rooms full of storage and had looked unused for decades. Everything is outdated.
College Senior,1,Extremely strict and completely hypocritical. I can't believe these people call themselves Christians..
College Senior,1,I wouldn't let my dog stay in one of these dorms!!
College Senior,1,Martin is like going back to high school.... A very under-funded one. Which you think wouldn't be a problem charging 20k a year but I suppose most of your tuition lines the pockets of there extremely wealthy higher up staff.
College Senior,1,If it rains or storms get ready to get soaked and have your shoes ruined. To get across campus is a lot of outdoor walking.
College Senior,1,On campus is one security guard who is long past retirement and would have enough trouble protecting himself. I lived off campus and was solicited for money or cigarettes almost daily by people walking the streets. A swat team circled my neighbors house and busted a big meth lab just across from the gym several months ago. There was an armed bank robbery less than two blocks from campus last semester and the school didn't lock down or anything!
College Senior,1,"On campus are no nightlife activities. Pulaski itself is a dead town with a Walmart, a few fast food chains, and several dive bars I wouldn't dare go in if my life depended on it!"
College Junior,1,"The parking is great AS LONG AS YOU DONT ALLOW MORE STUDENTS TO ATTEND THAN WHAT THERE ARE PARKING SPOTS!!  The overflow is at the top of the hill and is difficult for students when it is bad weather.  If my truck breaks down and i have to drive my daughter's or parents' vehicle, I get a parking ticket unless I park at the top of the hill.  I work full time and go to school in between my work hours.  During this time I get as many hours as possible in so I can graduate on time."
College Sophomore,1,"Small Town With No Extras – MMC is located in Pulaski, Tennessee. There are a few chain fast food restaurants (KFC, Taco Bell, McDonalds, Sonic, and Hardee's) and a few dine in places including ( Legend's Steak House, Mexican, Japanese, and home country cooking). There is a cute downtown with a play theatre and a department store with all new brand name shoes and bags and clothes but that's it for shopping other than Walmart... One park which a lot of homeless people spend time at, and everything closes by 5 downtown or 10 otherwise, leaving Walmart as the only outlet for students late at night."

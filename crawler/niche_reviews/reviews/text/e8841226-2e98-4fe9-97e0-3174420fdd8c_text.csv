Alum,5,"Bard is one of the most rigorous and life-changing schools in the country. Going to Bard gave me a phenomenal education and connections that landed me a high profile social activism job after graduation. Going here was like a dream–natural splendor, beautiful ancient buildings, stacks of books, the sunset over the Hudson every night. I feel immeasurably lucky to have been gifted with my experiences, and I wouldn't trade them for the world. I went to college to learn, to better myself, to grow and to find ways of changing the world. And I did. It's the perfect school for interdisciplinary thinkers who are willing to find their own path and expect their education to change them. Expect to work, not only for yourself but for others, and to design your education to work for you. And if you're here now, enjoy it. Look at the sunset from Blithewood, go exploring in the woods. Live out the strange, beautiful dream that is Bard College."
Alum,5,"I did not attend while the college was remote, but from professors and students I have heard that the college continues to be an excellent and inspiring place"
Alum,5,"Bard is an absolutely incredible place. I write this review very honestly, as someone who did not want to come here initially but chose it for financial reasons. If you're looking for a big party school, this is not the place for you. But Bard has so, so much to offer. The professors are absolutely incredible & the access that you have to them is unparalleled. I referred to most by their first name. Bard's liberal arts approach is single-handedly responsible for saving me from pursuing a career path that would've made me miserable, because it allowed me to explore a wide variety of fields in in-depth ways. There are all kinds of students at Bard, & you will definitely find your people, even if the overall stereotype of the school doesn't fit you to a tee. People have a deep respect for each other's passions and scholarship. I also am very proud to be an alum of a school that is so civically engaged, and a school with such a wide network & variety of campuses (google the Bard network!)"
Alum,5,"Only part of the semester was online. When classes switched to online in March, the transition went smoothly. Professors truly care.  In person is always better, but Bard made the best of the situation."
Alum,5,"Excellent education. If you want to learn to think, this is the place. You can meet a lot of wonderful people here, both students and professors. No one that I have met on campus takes themselves too seriously. There are genuinely smart and creative and caring people here.  Lifelong connections made here."
Alum,5,"No online courses for me. I am unsure if online classes are offered at Bard, although I understand that this might be different during the pandemic."
Works Here,5,"Because of Bard's extensive network there are chances to share the classroom virtually with students from West Point, Al Quds University and other places in the network or who share partnerships with Bard. I haven't had these classes but others I know have and say they are a wonderful experience."
Works Here,5,"Bard is a beautiful campus, on the Hudson River, in the heart of the Hudson Valley. Great location and the local area has a robust cultural scene, including many historic sites to visit. Small local towns like Hudson, Kingston and Rhinebeck have lots to offer when you choose to venture off campus. There is always lots to do on campus too.

The liberal arts traditions at Bard allow for well rounded and diverse academic experiences.  The structure of the academics promotes regular interaction between students and professors, building important and valuable relationships that last beyond your years at Bard. Advising is a key component of the Bard education and helps ensure student engagement and success."
Works Here,5,"I don’t take any online classes (traditionally they are not offered, with the exception of learning in this pandemic). There doesn’t seem to be an option to opt out of this question and zero stars would not be accurate."
Junior,5,"We have a blended learning semester, with some classes online and some offline. Students who can safely come to campus are allowed to do so at this time."
Junior,5,"Idealistic place that puts its money where its values are, does not just pay lip service. Huge local and global impact, from its prison program to international campuses in Germany, Russia, Palestine, Austria and Kyrgyzstan. Would definitely make the same choice second time around."
Junior,5,"I am a current student at Bard studying American Studies & French. The campus is gorgeous, the faculty are eminent scholars in their areas, and the student body is a diverse and wonderful mix of students from all areas of the globe."
Works Here,5,"The students are really amazing. They are attracted to Bard because they, like Bard, are civically engaged and daring. They also love learning. What they learn, they live, and it becomes useful in a job and for life. Bard faculty are engaged with students also in real ways. As their professors are excited about what they teach, their students become more and more curious. The campus is beautiful and inspiring. Campus life is full of things to do and an opportunity for students to express themselves artistically and intellectually."
Works Here,5,"I know what has gone into online learning at Bard. (Although their classes are so far in person, they have also developed hybrid classes.) I also know that Bard is experienced at remote teaching, because they have conducted joint, remote classes with the colleges in their network for years, from East Jerusalem to Berlin."
Alum,5,"Bard is one of a kind. My experience as a student helped me to feel valued and to find my voice while also being challenged to grow and question. Bard taught me to always think critically and with nuance. I attended an ivy league university for graduate school and was put off by how the name brand was often used as a smokescreen for mediocre teaching and academics and a lack of care for the students - something I wouldn't have known if I hadn't received a superior academic experience at Bard. The Bard community and social scene is very eclectic and authentic and gives students autonomy and ownership. Bard gave me genuine, meaningful connections to my faculty, my peers and to my academic work. And the campus is otherworldly beautiful, and the Hudson Valley (for better or worse) is truly burgeoning."
Alum,5,"Bard doesn't typically offer online coursework, though this may change temporarily as a result of COVID-19. There are some classes that are online because they are co-taught with the international campuses, which is a great/unique initiative and opportunity."
Works Here,5,"My spring term fiction writing class finished online, but the professor's enthusiasm and mentorship never flagged."
Works Here,5,Faculty advising and student/teacher relationships are what set Bard apart from other schools. This fosters a collaborative/supportive academic environment that encourages each student to succeed.
Alum,5,"We didn't really learn online until COVID-19, and at that point professors were very understanding and adaptable to students schedules!"
Alum,5,I got the best education I could imagine at Bard. All the components and resources they have here come together to make well rounded students into well rounded people
Alum,5,The attention that is given to each individual student and their unique learning path is something that sets Bard apart. I especially appreciated the ability to seriously study in both the sciences and the arts. It is also easy to find support for new initiatives and research as an undergraduate student.
Alum,5,"My classes were in person, however, as a student worker I was able to work online with the web development office and this was a positive experience."
Senior,5,"One of the best aspects of Bard College is the supportive environment that is fostered on campus. All faculty and students are extremely encouraging and want everyone to succeed. No one is left behind. Living in a place where a student feels loved and valued is extremely important, especially when they are living away from home. At Bard, students are able to have incredible personal relationships with prestigious professors."
Alum,5,"I had a wonderful experience at Bard. Bard is truly a place that places priority on  academics, but also on community engagement and allowing students the opportunity to do great work in the world. The campus is beautiful, as is the surrounding Hudson Valley area and there is no shortage of outdoor, artistic, and historical activities to engage with in the area. The faculty is fantastic and supportive and you have the freedom to explore various interests while engaging with curious and interesting fellow classmates. Bard is a place that that allows students to take ownership of their educational and extracurricular experience and I will be forever grateful for that."
Alum,5,"I did not take, nor did Bard offer online classes at the time I went there. However, I have heard great things about virtual classes being taught between campuses with in the Bard Global Network."
Senior,5,"My transition to online classes was very smooth, mostly because my classes were all discussion based (no labs or art classes). The classroom experience definitely declined, because very few students would participate in class discussion online as compared to in person (despite good efforts on behalf of professors, some student's home situations were just not conducive to online learning). Overall, it wasn't ideal, but I appreciated the holistic response that each professor had to going online. My professors really wanted to hear our ideas and concerns. Going back this fall will be frightening, but Bard has been very clear about the precautions they are taking."
Senior,5,"I've always been obsessed with Bard, but I don't necessarily think it is for everyone. I think Bard's classes are rigorous and require a large amount of participation from students. The classes are small and professors will know when you are not there or not participating. The classes are very applied and many of them have real-life components where you can put theoretical knowledge out into the field with hands-on experiences. My professors have really been my favorite part about Bard. Having two faculty advisors has been an amazing support system. They've also found me internships and helped me get awards and scholarships. I do think the campus is pretty cliquey, but there are so many cliques that you're bound to fit in somewhere. The social scene is very low-key with a handful of parties happening in the local towns and some music shows on campus on weekends. The housing situation is pretty hit or miss, but I've liked all of the dorms I've lived in, and I love the food."
Senior,5,"I love Bard! It's on a beautiful campus and offers a high-quality liberal arts education. But what I think makes it truly unique is the people. Everyone at Bard is passionate about what they do, driven, and dedicated. Student work is everywhere and is really the cornerstone of the Bard education. The people really make the experience."
Alum,5,"I found Bard from the best teacher in my HS, who had taken pedagogy classes there and told me I'd fit, as ""the academics are rigorous, but kids don't have sticks up their..."" I chose Bard after touring UofChicago, Brown, Macalester and Carleton (and appreciating my teacher's point). Bard was truly transformative place for me, both intellectually and professionally. Coming from a great public education, I was still stunned by internationalism of the place, the intelligence of my peers, and caliber of professors. The campus is stunning and both just far enough from NYC to be immersive, but close enough that you can easily shoot down to the City for the weekend. Bard is certainly a place full of individuals, but that is a large part of what makes it so incredible. My classmates when onto all the best investment banks (I studied Econ thanks its large policy think-tank, the Levy Institute), but also to start businesses, non-profits, and overall just pepper the world w/ change-agents. A+"
Alum,5,"There were no classes online in my time, but I know Bard is the central pillar of the Open Society University Network, which connects students experiences across the world and has built a large online presence to facilitate this. You come to Bard for the small seminar experience and amazing access to your professors, but connecting that experience to a global network of learner from Berlin to Palestine to Budapest can only serve to enrich the experience I had."
Alum,5,"Did not learn online - heard the transition to online learning as a solution during COVID-19 in the spring was incredible - a play was performed remotely and picked up by an off-broadway theatre it was so good! Bard is open for in-person classes this fall and those are going smoothly, too. There are some amazing new common courses designed especially for the new students coming in this year that focus on themes such as the imagination, empowerment, inclusivity, the environment and some other critical concepts."
Alum,5,"Bard College actually does what other colleges say they do but don't really do. It put its money where it's mouth is and spends on programs the world needs to make sure high calibre education is accessible to all. Bard runs seven high school early colleges across the United States designed to provide strong public school education to high school students and an associates degree tuition free before enrolled students graduate from high school. It also runs the largest college degree granting prison education program in the U.S. and some of the most progressive international campuses and partnerships in the higher education landscape at the moment. The faculty are open, collaborative, innovative and the staff design personalized systems of support and creative pathways to engagement and confidence building. Bard is quite a remarkable place and an exceptional trail blazer. I am extremely lucky to have attended a place that takes intentional action. It has served me well!"
Alum,5,"I arrived at Bard in the early 2000s from Tennessee and my experience at the College changed my life. Bard introduced me to the Hudson Valley, some of the most interesting students and faculty I have ever met, and taught me how to think and learn for myself. I had never been in such an open-minded and free-thinking environment.  I'm still active in the alumni/ae community, keep in touch with my professors, and I continue to be proud to of Bard, especially given the College's dedication to serving the public good."
Alum,5,"I have participated in a number of virtual talks and webinars offered by Bard and I continue to be impressed. The College did not miss a beat when it came to making arrangements to move forward through the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike many other colleges and universities, Bard allowed students to stay on campus if they could not make it home safely. Bard values their students' needs above all else, which is incredibly uplifting and refreshing during a global crisis."
Freshman,5,"Professors adapted very well and were able to effectively relay information while being flexible. Despite being sent home amid the pandemic, I felt that I got an good education given the situation."
Alum,5,"Bard is an incredible place for anyone willing to find their own way. As a Bard student I was able to meet amazing friends, study in Berlin, practice my art, explore other interests, and experience one of the most beautiful campuses in the country. While the towns nearby are not bustling cities, NYC is only about 2 hours away via train and Poughkeepsie is alright."
Sophomore,5,"If you are an interesting person you will love Bard. the professor's are amazing, the campus is beautiful. the students are intelligent gent and creative and nice."
Freshman,5,"Bard College is a wonderful choice for students who thrive in dynamic, innovative environments where classes are based on discussion and the student's ideas are valued just as much as the teachers. The small classes have allowed the professors to really focus on each individual student and it makes the learning process incredibly immersive."
Alum,5,"I graduated from Bard as a double-major a few years ago. My experience socially and academically was life-changing, exactly what you look for in a college experience. I learned from professors that are experts in their fields and peers from all over the world with different opinions and views. The campus setting was incredibly beautiful with access to NYC by train.  People go to Bard that want to learn and share knowledge. While this seems like an obvious trait a college should have, I will always be amazed at the community Bard fostered that made for interesting students and exciting classes."
Freshman,5,"Bard College is a really interesting community. It's a nice school because it's a small community so you're able to acclimate pretty easily and find some familiar faces. The class choices are for the most part diverse as long as you explore a bit, and a lot of the professors are really good sources for information. The food is extremely oily and salty and the weather can be hard to acclimate to if you're not used to it."
Works Here,5,I found Bard to be quite an enlightening campus as I worked there. I would often overhear academic conversation outside of the classroom which would make my day. This is a great campus with great students who have a passion to learn.
Alum,5,"Academics are on par with Ivy schools, and if you can translate the critical thinking from the liberal arts it’s very easy to do extremely well in any professional field. However, this school will make your social skills far worse."
Sophomore,5,"I am at the Holyoke Campus, and I like that it gave a woman like me, in a non-traditional circumstance, a chance to attend college at no cost. I am graduating this month, and and I am continuing on to pursue my Bachelor's degree this fall."
Alum,5,"The campus itself is stunning--center of the Hudson Valley, ample access to all things out-doors, and the architecture is a mix of modern and old.   Blithewood is a must-see for all visiting students.  However, I will say the dorms leave much to be desired as does the spacing of campus.  Most students live off campus after sophomore year anyways and living in the crappy dorms becomes somewhat of a bonding experience among students (Hud-Cat for life!)

Diversity is lacking (majority white, upperclass, hipster, liberal students).  However, it is possible to find your ""niche"" on campus beyond the hipster ideal. 

Overall, Bard is a great academic institution with a quirky social scene set in the heart of nature.  While I had a 5 star experience, I understand that the vibe of this college may not be for everyone, but approaching Bard with an open-mind makes it a great university for the undecided to find their academic passion."
Niche User,5,A super underrated liberal arts school! If only they knew about Bard. This college attracts high achieving students with a passion to change their community. The professors are great and really care about their students. Bard is just great.
Niche User,5,"Very diverse for a pwi. The campus is large despite the school having approximately 2,000 students so having a bike would be ideal."
Alum,5,"I loved Bard! In fact, I ended up marrying another Bard grad and most of my best friends are the ones with whom I bonded at the very start of my freshman year. I'm also very involved in alumni events because I miss the school so much. It  really is a wonderful college with incredible professors, a beautiful campus (and surrounding area), and a brilliant, creative and unique student body. My sister now goes to Bard and loves it too."
Alum,5,"Bard is an incredible academic institution. Both professors and students alike are brilliant, curious, and creative, and classes are intellectually stimulating."
Niche User,5,"Small and great college. Elite in its own right and attracts intellectual and artistic types. Benefits from and contributes to New York City culture in art, literature, social science. Bard Fiction Prize annually awards $30,000 and semester-long residence to acclaimed, up-and-coming young novelists. Large, beautiful campus. Eclectic architecture. It's also a college in the service of humanity, as it has satellite programs all over the world, like the Bard Prison Initiative, Bard Early Colleges, and college programs in underserved regions in the world."
Alum,5,"Constant schedule of excellent events and speakers. Bard College is a magnet, host, and producer of major forces in art, literature, and music, with strong faculty in every discipline."
Niche User,5,"My Daughter is a thriving Sophamore at Bard.My daughters classes and professors have been amazing! The Campus and surrounding area is absolutely gorgeous.She has made a lot of wonderful friends, great place to visit too!"
Senior,5,"Most of the negative reviews on here are from athletes or people who are unsatisfied with the living arrangments. I hated the dorm I was placed in freshman year, and I was a member of the cross country team, but I still made plenty of friends/pleasant memories. It's ridiculous to rate an entire institution badly for one aspect. I've learned and grown so much at Bard. I often feel connected to my professors (who are usually extremely accomplished/connected/intelligent). Bard  offers AMAZING abroad opportunities. I've lived in Costa Rica and Nicaragua through abroad programs and clubs through Bard. You'll academically work hard here, but it's absolutely worth it. Bard is also very generous with financial aid. The people here can be fascinating if you're willing to engage with them. As with anything else in life, the experience is what you make of it. I'm extremely grateful that I was able to go here."
Alum,5,"Bard is a great school with fantastic faculty, beautiful campus, proximity to NYC, lots of special academic, cultural, civic and artistic programs, and is an institution that does much in the service of the underserved all across the nation and the world."
Sophomore,5,"Academically challenging and amazing. Professors know exactly what they are talking about and lead class in socratic seminar style, no lecturing at you."
Alum,5,"A great liberal arts college.                                                                                                                         

Great programs in every department."
Freshman,5,"Bard is an incredibly underrated school for truly gifted and diverse students. With a burgeoning sports program and international focus, it is sure to rise as one of the top liberal arts universities in the U.S."
College Freshman,5,sets kids up for success
College Freshman,5,I'm an athlete and I'm very excited about the program
College Freshman,5,Second-Tier Ivy. Excellent Academic Education
College Junior,5,"Bard is a very safe space.  If a student gets caught drinking or something, they will usually be sent to the dean but instead of being punished, they sort of check in with you throughout the semester - it's constructive rather than destructive. Just don't be stupid."
Alum,4,"I only had one online class, because I was a senior finishing my last semester. I guess I should've had 2, but one was taught by a post-doc at Rockefeller University (usually a very fruitful partnership between Rockefeller and Bard), and I think he was overwhelmed so he just let us do our own thing during covid so long as we handed in our final project. The other class I finished online was my human rights history class. I think the professor did a great job in terms of setting a compassionate grading policy. We were able to grade ourselves, as long as we submitted an explanation as to why. He lowered the requirements for the class as well. The zoom classes were still very interesting and enriching, and definitely worth my time to log on and focus/take notes. Shout out Greg Moynahan! Finishing my senior project online was tough, but at least my project was entirely computer-based."
Alum,4,"Bard College was truly a wild and wonderful experience. I spent all four years there, except for a study abroad experience in South Africa, first semester my Junior year. The academics are very strong and you have to work very hard there. Doing a senior project (thesis) my senior year was amazing and led to my selected career path in suicide prevention/mental health."
Works Here,4,"I’ve worked for Bard for several years now, and one thing I can say with certainty is that it’s the most student-centered and student-driven institution I’ve ever worked for in my 14 years of working in higher education. We may not be perfect, but we’re incredibly special and our students drive change like no other."
Junior,4,"Online learning was definitely a struggle amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, but professors were very understanding as to the abnormal circumstances, and were very flexible with deadlines, etc. The online curriculum was both rigorous and enjoyable, as it is in person."
Alum,4,"I did not do a class online at Bard College as I graduated in 2016, but I would assume the small class sizes make the transition to online easier."
Alum,4,"Bard's academics are unmatched. The small class sizes, enthusastic professors and engaged students make the learning environemtn optimal. Personally, I wish the athletics department was given more attention and I would have loved to have had the pre-law track during my time there."
Alum,4,"I did not have any online learning experiences at Bard as an undergraduate student, and I cannot speak to the online learning being employed now."
Alum,4,"Academically Bard College is a unique and wonderful place to grow and learn. The relationships that students can form with professors is second to none, and the freedom students have in designing their own classes allowed me to study all of the subjects that I was interested in as well as subjects that I wanted to explore. 

The one downside in my overall Bard experience had to do with diversity. This is not just racial diversity, but also socioeconomic diversity. As a student from a less privileged background, I felt isolated not only among the students, but also from the faculty. This is not Bard's fault, but is universal among private higher education facilities. However, if you're prepared to advocate for yourself you're sure to have an enriching experience."
Senior,4,"During the Coved-19 outbreak, many Bard professors had a seamless transition to the online format. The small class sizes that Bard naturally allowed important discussions and reflections to continue, even with an online format. Professors were still extremely available to students."
Senior,4,"Online learning was definitely a new experience, but my professors really helped out when we had to transition during COVID, and tried their best to implement quality education in a new and unfamiliar platform.I still felt like I was learning even under the new circumstances."
Sophomore,4,"Instructors were incredibly flexible during the switch to online. They communicated things thoroughly to each of their students and made accommodations to best suit our needs. Of course there were issues with glitches, but teachers showed compassion and patience"
Sophomore,4,"I went to Bard not expecting to love it as much as I did. Never have I felt so inspired to pursue my passions and grow my interests...The majority of the kids I've interacted with have been intelligent, open-minded, and inspiring to say the least, though there are a lot of drugs that flow around the school. Courses are super engaging and interesting and the financial aid is extremely generous. The cafeteria food is a bit hit or miss, but the school cafe DTR is always great :)"
Freshman,4,The professors at Bard are great and extremely knowledgeable in their fields. Students receive an extremely high-level education.
Niche User,4,"Diverse, lovely, scholarly atmosphere. The Annandale-on-Hudson campus is truly beautiful, perfect amount of nature and architecture. The food is mostly sourced locally and organically, and is made fresh by the amazing kitchen staff. The school facilities are quite exquisite, from a fitness facility accessible for whenever you want to catch a quick workout, to the stadiums and opera theater, which looks like a true feat of architecture and engineering. 
The abundance of nature and hiking trails brings a sense of serene calmness which is a great contrast to the stresses of a rigorous school.
At Bard, I feel academically challenged but very supported. The sense of community here is like no other and there is an endless scope for the imagination."
Alum,4,"I think my experience at Bard was a typical one, especially for liberal arts students. I learned a lot, met some new people, and earned a degree in an area of interest. And then, after graduating, I got not at all connected to that degree. While a lot of Bard students enjoy the parties and concerts that take place on campus, a lot of other students, myself included, wish they wouldn't go on until 1 am when they're being held right next to my dorm the week before finals."
Junior,4,"Bard is a fantastic college with fascinating classes and amazing professors. However, the campus is pretty decentralized and there isn't a lot of school spirit. This is not the school for someone who is interested in painting their face with school colors and going to football games."
Freshman,4,"Bard college is an incredible academic and social environment. The professors are dedicated to creating an open learning environment, meant to create deeper understanding of course materials. The social life of the school is inclusive, always something fun to do around campus."
Sophomore,4,"Bard is a great place if you love nature, and don't mind the fact that you have to take a shuttle to get to town. I, personally, love the fact that Bard is it's own little town, and despite having to leave  little early for class and work (because the campus is so big), I actually appreciate the opportunity to wake myself up with a brisk 10 minute walk to central campus for my class. I think a lot of people don't take this aspect of the college into account when applying, so many people transfer out. I have never actually thought of transferring once here, even with Bard's many faults. I have found great, inspiring, and kind people here and I wouldn't give up meeting them for the world. Bard is my home. I have  gone through a lot since applying here, and had to go through many experiences, good and truly horrible, but Bard has given me a chance to grow."
Sophomore,4,Bard College has an excellent and rigorous academic program. All of the professors strive to be available and helpful and their wealth of knowledge continues to astound me. The campus itself is beautiful and I've definetly made some life long friends. A lot of students smoke on campus which is one of my least favorite things about the school. You get a lot of second hand smoke by simply going to class.
Junior,4,"Bard is a small liberal arts school in Annandale on Hudson. The campus is on the Hudson river, and is surrounded by woods. In the spring, it is a beautiful area, but can be freezing and ugly in the winter. It can be very isolating because there are no towns within walking distance. A shuttle runs between the two nearby towns, Red Hook and Tivoli. The latter has one small store, a bar, and a few restaurants. Classes are usually small, from 25 students down to as little as 3 or 4 as they get more specific. Some professors are great, passionate about teaching, and knowledgeable, and some are lazy and barely teach, requiring students to do presentations for half of the class time."
Sophomore,4,"The education at this institution is amazing, it really pushes students to think for themselves and introduces them to texts that they otherwise may have never been introduced to."
Senior,4,"Bard College is a weird place; this will never change nor should it. 95% of the students are outsiders in some capacity, whether they were outsiders in High School or totally in society. This is what makes Bard weird and wonderful, but it is the also what makes Bard terrible because most students cannot accept this about themselves. A large amount will recreate how they were treated in high school: they will create cliques and shun people not in their clique. They will be attentive on a social hierarchy and make fun of everyone outside it. The absolute worst worst thing about Bard is- because these students are outsiders and used to the world being cold to them- will be aggressively cold to everyone else. Try walking through campus and making eye contact/smiling with everyone you see. One in 50 will smile back. They can't let go of the coldness the world has given them. Some do, and you will find these to be the most mature students on campus."
Niche User,4,"Bard is a unique place to learn. It taught me not only facts, but how to think and obtain knowledge. With the diverse range of clubs and activities, I never felt bored."
Freshman,4,"Bard has a very politically active community, which helps everyone in educating what is right. It is also a very supporting community for PoC."
Freshman,4,"Bard College is a beautiful, quirky liberal arts school.  It emphasizes uniqueness in person and once you get used to the vibe it's a wonderful place to study and grow as a person.  You easily feel comfortable with yourself here, and people appreciate that.  The academics are wonderful, often approaching subjects in ways that help you think about them differently.  There's an emphasis on keeping class sizes small because Bard really emphasizes discussion based learning.  Not only will you learn to articulate your thoughts clearly, you'll also learn how to write them.  The professors are friendly and easy to talk to.  The social scene is different, for sure, but if you get used to it it can be really incredible. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else for my undergraduate studies."
Alum,4,Bard is a very unique place and it opens your eyes to so many interesting and awesome people. Glad that I gave Bard a chance. I made awesome friends and received a great education.
Freshman,4,"Bard's a great college where you can create your own experience. There are tons of stuff always going on, on campus. However, the one really bad thing about Bard is that they are awful about communicating events. Everything is passed from word of mouth, which can be unreliable. "
College Senior,4,"The focus seems to be far more on safety of students than on enforcing laws, which makes it a lot easier to students in trouble to ask for help. There are several student run organizations that work to help anyone who needs a ride back to campus, and the physicians on campus acknowledge that drug use is common and focus on making a practical difference when it comes to students' health."
College Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my school quite a bit. The main drawbacks are the location and the size of the department. It's almost impossible to get off campus without a car, and this can make things like shopping or attending local events in the neighboring towns difficult. It often gets very isolating to be stuck on campus all of the time. My professors are incredible, and I appreciate that I've been able to develop a good relationship with them due to the small class sizes. However, because my major has so few people in it, there is a serious lack of higher level classes. After interacting with other students in my major from different schools, it seems to me that most of them have a much more extensive preparation simply due to the fact that they're able to get higher level courses more regularly than we do, so that is something to keep in mind when choosing Bard."
College Sophomore,4,"I gave this rating because the gym is nice. Weight room is often empty, equipment is good, and there's a nice pool. It's a great gym for a small school. As for like spectator sports, that's not something Bard is well known for. Supposedly 40% of my class plays a sport. That being said, people don't go to sports games often; it's just really not part of the school's culture, which I think is a good thing in some ways. I went to a few basketball games and a few lacrosse games last year. I enjoyed myself, but these events will never be the highlights of my college years, like they might be for students at other schools."
College Sophomore,4,"Bard is interesting. Bard offers a unique, top tier education. Bard's (so-called) proximity to NYC and other nearby intellectual hubs, has attracted an exceptional faculty. Bard is highly respected among academics, but many people (read: employers) don't know about it. I'm pretty sure I couldn't get the education anywhere else, but the same could be said about most decent colleges. All I know is that I respect my professors a lot, and that Bard has given me some amazing opportunities. With my concentration in Africana Studies, Bard has served me well. In my first semester, there was one month when I attended a lecture by Cornell West for free through a student organization one weekend; saw Toni Morrison, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Jesse Williams and more speak at the New Yorker Festival the next; and then saw an advanced screening of an award winning documentary on the Black Panthers the week after that. Still, life there can be difficult. There are so many narcissists and its so small and isolated, its hard to escape them. The Bard culture can be unpleasant at times, but as far as am concerned its worth it."
College Junior,4,Living on campus is really nice for the first two years. The newer buildings are quite beautiful. Many times the underclassmen/freshmen dorms generate great communities and create bonds that will last you throughout your four years at Bard.
College Junior,4,"Bard is a great place to be if you are trying to figure out who you want to be. As a student, you are challenged by rigorous coursework and profesors who push you to develop ideas and opinions.  Being a student at Bard means understanding the world without convention. It's one of the hardest places I've ever adapted to, but once I entered, I'm so happy to stay and grow."
College Freshman,4,"As a white man I feel very safe but I have some female friends who are concerned about walking alone at dark.  Also, the president is not very accommodating when it comes to sexual assault."
College Freshman,4,I don't have much experience with this yet but Bard seems to really prepare its students for the real world.
College Freshman,4,"Educationally, this school is great. I've had great professors who have been incredibly passionate and their passion has been contagious for what they teach. There are tons of interesting classes offered with very knowledgable and well-regarded professors. Class sizes are for the most part around 20-25, it's really easy to talk to your professors, and it's all a very enlightening experience within the classroom."
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus, mostly because of its location. It is secluded so I can mostly trust that people I see on campus are affiliated with the school or the neighboring communities. I am thankful that our campus security truly prioritizes the safety and wellbeing of its students over any kind of disciplinary action. I am also thankful that there is rarely a police presence on campus, as this is very threatening to me. Other than each others bikes, I feel that the students mostly respect one another's personal property."
College Freshman,4,"The experience of living on campus greatly depends on where you live. Personally I have had a positive experience. Although my room is very small, the school did a great job pairing me with a roommate that I get along with. I would not say that the dorm I live in is the most spacious, clean, or well built, but it is also not the worst on campus. It is very private and quiet for the most part. I think a great thing about this school is you can really choose what kind of on campus living situation you'd like to be in based on your preferred life style."
College Freshman,4,"When I chose this school initially it was because it met all the criteria I was looking for: personality, a beautiful campus, small classes, liberal thinkers, approachable professors, interesting courses, etc.... I still very much feel this way about the school. I have no regrets about my choice as I feel that I have met many incredible people, made extremely valuable connections with my educators, and had many opportunities to attend fascinating events and talks. I feel that there is a sense of community at my school and I am proud to belong to it. However it is very difficult for me that the school is so expensive and money is always at the forefront of my mind. A lot of facilities at the school (laundry for example), seem to be geared towards making a large profit off of the students. Another example is the food. It is extremely expensive and there is not much variety. I wish I did not have to consistently struggle with money while I am receiving my education."
College Junior,4,"Academically speaking, I love Bard completely.  Classes were always great- reading material well thought out, students active and attentive during discussions, teachers excited and always willing to meet outside of class if you needed help, etc.  But socially speaking, I've found my favorite people here and my least favorite people here.  I've been my healthiest and I've been in the ER here. I have been loved and I have been physically assaulted. I've seen actually green pizza in Kline, and I've tasted the best kale salad of my life so far at a restaurant in Rhinebeck.  Bard is a place of extremes and I strangely wouldn't take any of it back."
College Junior,4,Beautiful campus with lots of diversity in the student population.
College Sophomore,4,"I transferred into Bard, as did a surprising number of students, likely looking for something different than the traditional university style education. The sciences are not top-notch, which should be expected from most liberal arts schools. But the curriculum has been amazingly flexible and the Biology dept has been very open to working with me to customize my educational experience to best fit my needs."
College Sophomore,4,"So far the academics are good. I like the small class sizes which allow professors and students to get to know each other. The professors I've had have all been pretty reliable, and they give great feedback on my work. They are all passionate about teaching, too. The workload can be very manageable, depending on what classes you take. I have found that if you put effort into your work, professors will give you very satisfying grades. If you're struggling in any of your classes, you can get tutored at the Learning Commons. I have only gone once though because I did not find it helpful."
College Sophomore,4,"Safety is big at bard, especially with title 9."
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are really caring about students and are very lenient if you talk to them because they understand that students are also human and things can happen in our lives that would keep us from balancing everything well. Most courses are essay heavy and discussion based so participation is huge at Bard. Classes are not that big, maximum 20 students so professors are aware if you're present or not. 

Most courses offered are philosophical based because they want their students to critically think about language."
College Sophomore,4,"Students are encouraged to apply for internships for the breaks. Some Bard organizations like Bard Center for Civic Engagement offers stipends for internships that have to do with civic engagement. This helps a lot of students who can't afford a specific internship, to be able to be a part of it. The career development office is also very involved with students because they sit down, review your resume and find you jobs that you have a good probability of getting. There is also BGIA, for students interested in taking a semester in NYC and get recruited to a very prestigious internship."
College Sophomore,4,"Bard really knows how to pair roommates. However, students can be really messy. The housing is overall pretty good especially when you become an upperclassman. The village and New Robbins are the best dorm on campus. The village has suitelife where students apply for their own 'apartment' like dorm with three other suitemates."
College Sophomore,4,Bard is very challenging academically and socially. Once you opn your mind things get easier.
College Freshman,4,"Bard is a magical bubble you get to share with many other beautiful and intelligent individuals. Yeah its isolated but the people here make it so worth it, all very talented in different ways. It's not your conventional huge party college and if your an athlete you won't be seen as ""popular"", the grungy art kids run the social scene. Anyhow, trees everywhere and beautiful surroundings."
College Freshman,4,"My campus is beautiful. The student body is diverse. The professors are valuable. So far I have enjoyed my experience at Bard, the people I have met here are easily some of the best individuals I have met in my life. If I ever feel the need for help in my classes there are a ton of resources at my fingertips. The most unique aspect at Bard is the amount of student-run operations at the school. Here, there is so much an individual student can do. For example there is a student-run Emergency Medical Service team for which I will be a part of. All in all, I am having a great college experience."
College Junior,4,"It is the best you make of it honestly. If you hate it, you'll REALLY hate it. If you love it, you'll REALLY love it."
College Freshman,4,"Internships are fairly easy to get, and you do make connections, despite what people say."
College Freshman,4,I got a lot of aid. The school is ridiculously expensive but there are enough rich kids that they basically pay for the rest of us.
College Freshman,4,There are a few bad apples in every bunch.
College Freshman,4,But I wouldn't know. I don't party.
College Freshman,4,Beautiful campus but in the middle of nowhere
College Freshman,4,They're mostly nice and smart
College Freshman,4,Gave me a lot but was still expensive
College Freshman,4,"Bard is fair with the students. The administration understands what it's like to be in college, and uses policies of education instead of fines. I haven't heard of anyone receiving a fine for something like drinking, smoking, or a noise violation. ""Punishments,"" if you can call them that, are usually not prescriptive; that is, they will ask students to organize a dorm event, or help out a certain club, in lieu of facing monetary consequences."
College Sophomore,4,"For the most part, they're there to look out for students. If they see an issue that needs addressing, they'll address it. Otherwise, they can be pretty detached when you don't need them."
Sophomore,2,"My advice is to not go to Bard unless you are absolutely positive you want to be there. The campus is pretty, but there is nothing do anywhere on campus or in the surrounding areas. I would say the environment is cloistered. If you are rich and uppity, but want people to believe you are a starving artist as you list your favorite obscure philosophers, this is the place for you! Bard attempts to make 'innovative' programs like Language and Thinking at Citizen Science, but they are just a waste of time, just something they can use to make them selves feel that they are so very rigorous. I was in school my first year for about five weeks longer than any of my high school friends. Bard feels a lot like high school, very cliquey. There are some gems, but you have to sift through a lot of gilded  trash. Overall, the vibes are WAY off, would not recommend."
Freshman,2,"Bard is the ultimate safety school, as most everyone how applies gets in. Once here, you listen to the bottom 1/2 of your class, the ones with money, try to sound intelligent. The dorms are one step above homeless shelters, the food is disgusting, and 90% of the kids are high on drugs 24/7. The school's attitude: the more drugs the better. Some of the teachers are good. Most aren't. I transferred out to one of the little three. Much better."
College Senior,2,"As an athlete who is mostly in it to develop my own skills rather than win against other colleges, I love Bard athletics. There is zero school spirit, though, so don't expect to come here and have the whole school rally behind sports teams. The atmosphere is far more inclusive and the focus of athletics is more on improving than on winning, which I appreciate. However, if you're extremely serious about athletics, this probably isn't the school for you."
College Freshman,2,"One of the reasons why I chose Bard was because sports was not important here. While I do appreciate this immensely on one hand, I wish there was more passion towards playing sports ""for fun,"" such as club sports. I enjoy being active if it's not too intense like a DIII sport, and I wish more students liked playing sports as a fun hobby."
College Freshman,2,"Educationally, it's fantastic. The professors are all experts in their fields and are, for the most part, very approachable.  But, the location and lack of student life, student activities, and the overall community of angst-driven young adults, all leave you bored and uninspired very quickly outside of your classes."
College Freshman,2,No one cares about sports
College Freshman,2,I always feel isolated. The academics so far are ok
College Freshman,2,"Lots of tortured souls who would like to tell you about their parents' divorce at length, then maybe explain the plot of ""Inception"", layer by layer."
College Freshman,2,"Health services are Monday-Friday only. If you have a fever on a Saturday, you tough it out or call EMS to get escorted to the emergency room in a an ambulance. Twice I was publicly lectured for going to health services first thing Monday morning and not calling first EVEN THOUGH THEY AREN'T OPEN AT ALL ON THE WEEKENDS. That was fun."
Recent Alumnus,2,"-i wish people were as open-minded as they say/think they are. 

-tyranny of the majority is prevalent

-bureaucratic non-sense is common."
Recent Alumnus,2,The Bard Alumni network is stronger on OkCupid than it is in the job market.
Recent Alumnus,2,School spirit only exists on 4/20.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Bard has an Honor Code and Bard Admin specifically emphasizes community ties, but they won't actually do much to enforce it especially if it involves paperwork. It is easier to navigate the Great Firewall of China than Security Reports because the Bard Admin will make the complaintaint come in more times than the person they are complaining about. It is easier to just drop it. 

Bard Admin picks favorites: if they like you, you're set; if not, then may the odds ever be in your favor. 

Note: they give out financial awards to students that spend their 4 years of college conforming to Bard's bureaucratic standard of excellence... so if you want money, conform."
College Freshman,2,Hard to find or has too much drugs
College Sophomore,2,"Security is pretty good. We don't have a blue light system, which I find a bit problematic. We do have an emergency line and security will be able to get to you within a minute in case of emergency.

However, our health services are pretty awful. They are underfunded—both for general health and mental health purposes—and the nurses/counselors aren't great anyway. Expect misdiagnoses from the RNs and low availability from the counselors. We have free student-run services to transport people to off-campus therapist appointments and to the hospital for emergencies that don't warrant an ambulance (which saves you $$)."
College Junior,2,They close very early and there isn't much variety.
College Junior,2,The school doesn't directly offer off campus housing.
Recent Alumnus,2,"With biology it felt like the only options were genetics or microbiology, I wasn't particularly interested in either but there were no other options. If I could do it all over again I probably would have been a humanities major, at least I would have enjoyed my  four years."
College Freshman,2,Our school does have athletic programs.
College Freshman,2,There is basically nothing to do during the winter. We are about 10-15 minutes (drive) from the nearest town that offers entertainment/ activities. Most places close around 10 o'clock at the latest as well. During the summer there are some outdoor activities in the local towns.
College Freshman,2,"Sports were never popular at Bard, but for some reason 20% of the class of 2017 were sports recruits. They are starting a baseball team now. So the campus is in a strange process of accommodation with regards to sports. "
College Freshman,2,Huge lack of community here.
College Freshman,2,I wouldn't do it again.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I haven't had that much experience with campus parking, I didn't have a car while I was attending school. However, I have heard negative things from those with cars. Yet another example of the administration not being on the side of the student body."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The financial aid office is of little help, only marginally better than the student accounts office."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The winters are long and hard, and despite the same horrible winters every year the college never seems prepared for them. The campus shuttle, which is the only transportation for many, is often cancelled as soon as the weather turns a bit sour. "
College Sophomore,2,Bard really doesn't give out enough money. Expect your studies to be very expensive.
College Senior,2,It's hard to connect with students since it's a commuter school. I wish we had a more community feel to our campus
College Senior,2,There should be more police presence due to a string of rising crime thefts on campus.
College Junior,2,I'm becoming more and more disenchanted with their limited courses offering and the fact that most departments are repeatedly under-staffed.
College Freshman,2,The kids who are involved with sports seem to like them a lot but no one else really cares/ supports the teams
College Freshman,2,"No one seems to care all that much about sports. There are certainly athletic teams available to join, but they don't comprise much (if any) at all of the student culture."
College Freshman,2,"None of the towns surrounding Bard resemble anything close to a ""college town"". They are small, rather boring neighborhoods. Tivoli, where a lot of students live if not on campus, has some nice restaurants. Rhinebeck is cute and more lively but farther away and the shuttle only goes there once a week..."
College Freshman,2,"There is little to no peer pressure, but ever since coming here, many straight-edge people have begun to experiment with weed an alcohol. In my personal experience, I never smoked or drank until I came here, and now I do it on a casual basis. Occasionally, you will see some of the psychedelic hallucinogens, but not as much as weed. I have yet to see the coke presence. I'd say the biggest downside is that there is a significant divide between people who smoke cigarettes and people who don't - cigs are how many people make friends here at Bard. And then there's 4/20..."
College Freshman,2,"The only off-campus dining close by is in Red Hook, and sometimes relying on the shuttle can be a pain."
College Freshman,2,Very Rural – There is little to no atmosphere around campus.  A few restaurants and gas stations... not very connected to the school
College Freshman,2,"We Are a Very 'Green' School – Drug culture at Bard is big, but easy to avoid (sort of). We're a very laid back school, and as long as you're smart about it, there's really no chance at getting caught. Funny story: I was in my dorm room and we were having a party and our PC knocked (a PC is bard's version of an RA), she saw the booze and pulled me aside and told me that she was giving me a warning and then proceded to tell me that the next time I have booze in my room to always ask who is knocking on your door before you let them in. She is a fantastic PC. So, bottom line: Drugs aren't frowned upon unless you're stupid with them. I've seen a lot of people smoking joints while they're walking around campus, and you can always tell who is smoking when there's a circle of people standing around the back of the buildings. Actually, a really popular place to smoke weed is in the Community Garden. So yeah, there are a lot of drugs but if you're not into it, it isn't a big deal. But if you are, then you've come to the right place."
College Freshman,2,"Personally, my experience with financial aid wasn't the greatest and I've met many others wh0've had equally horrible experiences however there have been some who've had excellent financial aid service so I guess it all depends who you are. Regardless, the school is one of the most expensive ones in the country and we have a small financial aid staff."
College Freshman,2,"Red Hook, the town next to Bard is pretty small and is literally like two miles wide. You'll usually get bored of it within the first two weeks of coming here but it does offer some interesting stores and very courteous people. As far as the other surrounding towns around Bard the same concept applies. If you want hustle and bustle you'll have to go farther away from the campus."
College Freshman,2,"I'd Rather Stay in My Dorm and Study – There isn't really much to do in the area. If I do eat off campus, I'll go to the nearby chinese restaurant, Golden Wok, or the pizza restaurant. There are better restaurants in Kingston, but it's very difficult to get there without a car. Not many parties occur either. It's just a pretty boring area. The college campus is the highlight of the area and not much occurs here either."
College Freshman,2,"Pretty S****y.. Then again, I get the feeling that I should have gone to a larger university in a more urban area. The low(er) acceptance rate at Bard had fooled me into thinking that this was some demi-prestigious institution that I had been accepted into by some stroke of sheer luck. As it turns out, most everyone here is quite a bit less intelligent than I had expected."
College Sophomore,2,"Limited availability, expensive poorly kept.  Varying room sizes. After moderation we're not guaranteed housing because there isn't enough. South campus housing is convenient, but not great. North campus housing (the treehouses and trailers) is awful for freshmen. Upperclassmen housing on North campus is nice, but there isn't enough of it. Not all the dorms have AC and wireless. In general, Bard housing is lousy."
College Freshman,2,"High on the Weekend & Smart on the Weekdays – I've never been around so much smoke, weed-heads, alcohol and smart ppl at the same time smh"
College Freshman,2,It's Not the Worst – I'm sure there are worst dorms but being that tuition and room & board is sooo expensive it should be like the Hilton!! Off campus housing may be best.
College Freshman,2,"Drugs are EVERYWHERE at bard... you can obviously choose not to partake, but they are still everywhere, and there may be many occasions where almost everyone around you is high.. all the time... it's insane. I don't do drugs so I just watch it all happen, which is kind of funny, but if being around drugs makes you uncomfortable, bard probably isn't a great choice for you."
College Freshman,2,"Wide Range – Bard is really annoying about housing. It's one of the MOST expensive schools in the country, but none of that is reflected in the dorms. I'm living in a trailer. Bard has some really great dorms, and some horrible dorms, like the one i'm in... but there's always hope for next year. The dorm assignment system is completely randomized, so you never know where you'll end up."
College Freshman,2,"A Weird, Weird Place – many girls are used to going out and being hit on just because they are semi-attractive females at parties. this is certainly not the case at bard. for the most part, women have to ""advertise"" themselves, as a male friend put it, to the pool of available boys. this pool is great for girls who are into the whole skinny hipster douche thing, but for those of us who have had slightly more conservative tastes, it's not satisfactory. lots of sex. not lots of love."
College Freshman,2,"Could of Been Easier – The school gives a lot of aid to a few people. Most students at Bard do not even need that much finacial aid because of their backgrounds, so they can give a lot to those who need it. The problem is that applying for it can be a hazard. Its kind of a long process that many people need to approve."
College Freshman,2,"Be Rich – The only tip I can give is be part of the 60% that doesn't need any financial aid. Very few people get scholarships that are worth enough to make a dent in the $57,000 tuition."
College Senior,2,Extremely cold in the winter. You are likely freeze to death if you are underestimate winter in Upstate New York. Classes often cancel because of snow storms. My favorite weather is in the summer.
College Senior,2,"Doesn't Exist – there is really no enforcement at bard. with the exception of partying on the main campus road, or being really loud so that maybe the local police could hear you, bard security will totally ignore your party or drug possession."
College Sophomore,2,Buy Food – Of the two dining halls on campus the main one serves the worst food. Don't expect the food at Bard to be one of its highlights.
College Freshman,2,Most of the guys are gay – most of the guys are gay and the straight ones are mostly lame. basically its very slim pickings at bard
College Freshman,2,"The Food Sucks but What Did You Expect – kline is really bad. it gets old really quickly. if you want to eat well, you have to basically be very creative with your food at kline. down the road, the small cafe on campus, is much better but expensive and lately the lines have been really long. also manor is good but its so far away from the rest of campus that its usually not much of an option during the week."
College Freshman,2,"Very Small Town – Red Hook and Tivoli are the the quintessential small town type places. They is not much to do at all. The only thing to do is go to parties off campus but i don't even do that because figuring out the shuttle schedule is too much effort. there are a few good restaurants but they are all ethnic foods. other than that the only reason to get off campus is to go grocery shopping. we really are in the middle of nowhere here. Even the local ""towns"" still feel isolated from the rest of the world. it gets to you sometimes. also, the townies dont really like bard kids because we are so liberal and they are so not liberal. and we do drugs."
College Freshman,2,"Meh. Rain and Snow, but Pretty Springs and Falls – It's the north, so it's cold, lots of snow, and yes, rain rain rain. But when it's warm and sunny out, it's amazing. Spring and Fall are the best times to be here at Bard. So, overall, average weather for where we are."
College Junior,2,"The weather at Bard varies a lot because the Hudson Valley gets inconsistent New England weather. It gets very depressing and gloomy from November through March, which definitely affects how happy I am on campus and how well I work. When it snows, Bard sometimes cancels the shuttle service without canceling classes, which is a huge problem for people living off campus without cars. It's also long walk from some dorms to classes and the campus is not set up well for travel in heavy snowfall. Once spring arrives, it's beautiful and cheerful."
College Sophomore,2,"Buildings could really be better – The buildings could really be better for how expensive this school is. Some of the dorms (all the ""treehouse"" dorms) are trailers and very flimsy/dirty/even moldy. Most of the buildings feel lived-in and slightly run down. The Performing arts center is very nice (Bard's pride and joy) and I am not alone in thinking that some of the millions of dollars spent on it could have been divided among some of the other buildings which are in various states of disrepair. Many of the buildings are old and beautiful, some are quite new, but a few dorms are disgusting and even hazardous to students' health."
College Sophomore,2,"Freshman Live in Trailers – I'm not kidding about that. I'd say about half the freshman are in ""temporary housing,"" which for the record has lasted at least the last five years. All my kitchens so far have been small and nasty, mostly because the students are rude and throw crap all over them and steal other people's food. Dead serious. Get your own fridge if you want to live here. Some of the dorms are beautiful: Stone Row, Manor, Old Robbins, the Villages and the New Toasters. Others are atrocious. The worst thing in my opinion is that if you live on campus you have to be on the meal plan, but it's not convenient to live off campus."
College Senior,2,you should probably only expect 3 months of nice weather on this campus out of the 9 months you are here. It rains and snows all the time and the irrigation system is horrible. If you have any cherished shoes/clothing either don't wear them or kiss them goodbye.
Freshman,1,"I applied here thinking that this was the absolute perfect school for me but one semester in and I want to leave. No one wants to be here. Bard is almost everyone's backup school because the admissions rate was so high and they didn't get into their dream schools. No one cares about the school itself or tries to get involved in the slightest. The school is full of entitled art kids who blow smoke in your face as you're trying to leave the academic buildings. The walls in my dorm room are so thin that I could hear in great detail the guy down the hall from me having loud, violent sex and someone else having explosive diarrhea. On top of this, my room is infested with lady bugs, and other dorms are infested with stink bugs. And I'm one of the lucky ones -- some first years are forced to live in trailers that don't receive clean water. I know at least 10 people who have already transferred or who are transferring, including myself."
Freshman,1,"Full of angsty teenage liberal snowflakes who can’t get over the fact that the world is full of diversity and not a bubble of single-sided thought. 
Bard is a great place academically, but besides that there isn’t much else going for it. The dorms are in a state of disarray as my ceiling leaks and have had several incidents with rodents. Social life is practically nonexistent. As an athlete, there are occasional events, but always off campus. Everyone here is unable to get over their self-depreciated selves. One word to describe the student body would be eccentric. If you’re into alt-left liberal views, inhaling hazes of cigarette smoke 24/7 and homeless looking hipsters then this is the place to be. But if you’re any bit remotely mainstream or part of a varsity sport you’re looked down upon and judged. Looking back I would’ve done a complete 360 degree turn around and have re-evaluated my options before attending this institution."
College Junior,1,"Well there were trailers for dorms for some of the first years when I first started at Bard, so there's that.  But if you need a dorm, there will definitely be a bed and a sink and a toilet available on campus for you somewhere."
College Sophomore,1,"People do NOT come to Bard for sports. We don't even have a football team. Most sporting events are sparsely attended and many of the teams have a reputation for poor performance in the league. Also, very few people are athletic besides the athletes. But it honestly doesn't detract from the school in my opinion. It's just a different atmosphere."
College Freshman,1,I lived in a sadness-colored plastic trailer with very thin walls. All the other people in my dorm were friends so I got to sit in my room every night listening to them have fun. Nobody had any respect for the place and it was falling apart. They wouldn't even wash their own dishes. Our RA did not meet one of my dorm mates until November and I saw her in the dorm maybe once a week. They ran out of housing for next year and are placing me somewhere random when they find the space. It was a nightmare to get them to tell me anything about where I was to be living. Moldy bathrooms.
College Freshman,1,Way too isolated and the winter is freezing
Recent Alumnus,1,"We're out in the middle of nowhere, really out in the middle of nowhere. The winters are long and hard."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There is a major lack of housing on campus, during your first year you will almost definitely have to bunk with two others in a room that is designed only for two. FEMA trailers where brought in to temporarily alleviate the housing shortage, but they have been there for years. When I came to Bard for years ago those tailers where several years old, and THEY'RE STILL THERE! I wouldn't be so outraged if the cost of on-campus living was not so ridiculous."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Bard is in the middle of nowhere and many students do not have cars, yet the school's transportation is a joke. The schedule makes absolutely no sense and the head of the transportation department is both dismissive and rude when students attempt to contact him about the shuttles. Furthermore, it is unreliable and quick to cancel whenever the weather takes a turn for the worse. On several occasions I have been stranded because the shuttle driver was in a bad mood and didn't feel like stopping for us."
Recent Alumnus,1,"We have two small computer labs, only one of which is open all day. They recently began enforcing a printing quota which barely covers printing needs for the semester, student frequently have to wander around asking people to print something out for them."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I was happy to go to a school that didn't revolve around the athletics program. That was one of the main reasons I chose Bard. However, there has been a strong push lately to promote sports among the student body. The gym was redone even though there is a much more serious lack of housing. There are plenty of other schools were sports teams are the center of everything, I don't understand why this has to be forced on this liberal arts college. I have seen the atmosphere of the college begin to shift because of athletics and I resent it."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There are absolutely no resources to find off-campus housing, you are completely on your own. Almost all housing belongs to a specific individual who takes advantage of the relative lack of housing and guts those who rent from him. There's no information out there and the students are suffering from it. I have tried talking to the administration about opening up some dialogue about the off-campus situation, but they have been of no help."
Recent Alumnus,1,I was lucky to have a professor to look out for me. The school is not very helpful when it comes to finding internships or work afterwards. The alumni network is weak so you are kind of left on your own to find employment. 
Recent Alumnus,1,"To be fair, the food has gotten better over the years, but it is still severely lacking. To make matters worse, the company that the school has a contract with has a monopoly over the entire campus so if you can't stomach their food then you're out of luck."
College Freshman,1,"Bard does not have a football team and it currently does not have a baseball field. The athletes are not the most popular kids on campus - in fact, we lovingly make fun of them for not being dorky enough. Most of the athletics are awful but the soccer teams are pretty good.

We have a lot of club sports and opportunities for physical activity and the ultimate frisbee team is good as well."
College Junior,1,"If I were to do it again, I would not go here. I really underestimated the importance of food."
College Junior,1,"Limited and expensive. If food is important to you, do not go to this school."
College Freshman,1,"The local atmosphere is not spectacular, and take this from a girl who grew up in a rural area. Bard can feel a lot like a stifling little bubble, because despite the number of tiny towns in the area, there's rarely anything worthwhile doing in any of them. I've been to a few concerts, eaten at a few restaurants, but on the whole this area is dead."
College Freshman,1,"Bard only has one dining hall- Kline Commons. Kline is terrible to say the least. Food is usually under cooked or over cooked, the meat tastes terrible, and the selection is usually pretty bad (sometimes there will be two different types of white rice...what?). Kline is everyone's favorite thing to complain about on campus."
College Freshman,1,"I came from a very diverse high school so I might be biased, but the diversity here is terrible. Everyone is white and rich."

Graduate Student,5,Number one school for chiropractic doctors. The campus is relatively small but very beautiful. The parking available is the downfall. Parking is very limited the school has yet to build for more parking to help with the growing student population. the school does have the best chiropractic instructors from all areas of health science.

One thing that I absolutely love about Life University is the cultural diversity, people from all over the world attend this school. It gives you the opportunity to learn a lot outside of the classroom. One thing that I would like to see improve at Life is the variety of sports teams. Although we do have many great teams, it would be great to see some more common teams available. Other than that, I have been extremely satisfied with the University."
Graduate Student,5,"The school has great core values and the staff is always there to help you whenever needed!  The are so many student services, clubs, and activities to keep one's self occupied.

Recent Alumnus,5,"The majority of the teachers know how to keep students interested in the subjects, we are actively learning is most of the classes, because of the small student/teacher ratio, the learning environment is optimal, most of the undergraduate teachers know students by names, (this is great) makes it easier to ask question and feel comfortable with the teachers. There is a wide variety of courses offered (mostly sciences) not a lot of art courses."
Recent Alumnus,5,Definitely the best college of Chiropractic! Lots of technique clubs and seminars at school or in town! Must consider if looking for chiropractic education.
College Freshman,5,"I love the student/teacher ration.  The campus size is not overwhelming but it is big enough to give you that ""college feel.""

College Senior,5,"Living on campus is one of the greatest things about LIFE UNIVERSITY! The living facilities are open to students, their families, and the public. It feels more like living in an upscale apartment rather than dorms. The property is the first of it's kind and is a completely sustainable building located on the beautiful open campus."
College Senior,5,Plenty of off-campus housing available. Very different in price ranges and amenities. Most all have pools and tennis courts and most are gated communities that are in safe areas. Cost can vary by location but the prices are reasonable for the greater Atlanta area.

Junior,4,"I will attend on campus classes fall of 2020. This will be my first quarter as a student at Life University.  I have been impressed with my admissions process, housing, and the athletic program."
Senior,4,"My online experience has been great. Professors expressed to us if we needed them all we had to do is email them.  Response to
Email was really quick."
Junior,4,Online the teacher are understanding that most student either have other jobs or are heavily involved in sport so they are leanant or due dates.
Junior,4,"Very small school. Class sizes are between 10-20. You get to know you professor better then a bigger university, and they can help you better with less students to answer to"
Graduate Student,4,Life university is a solid school overall. It is just very fast paced so it is hard to keep up with sometimes. Administration could be better.
Senior,4,"Student teacher ratio is great. My class sizes ranged from 6 to 30 people.
Administration part is weak, documents get lost and if you need something YOU have to be persistent to actually get it."
Sophomore,4,The only thing that I dislike about the school is random/ high payments for basic needs. As well as how money is being taken away for unknown uses.
Freshman,4,"I first met one of the admission rep for life university at a planned college event thrown together by my high school,Campbell high school .Now your talking to a girl who you would say at the time she was all over the place;being that it’s senior year and all.Not having any  type of idea on were she wanted to go or what she’d even maybe want to do for the rest of her life; especially with not having the best gpa. So when I met the admissions rep for the college and he broke down everything,it was like music to ears, I was so excited to apply. Life is a school who’s giving me a second chance to be something magnificent In life."
Freshman,4,"Staff is amazing a life. Yet, on-campus living is very overpriced. Perfect school if you're interested in health and the body."
Graduate Student,4,I am a current student at Life University. One of the things I like about Life U is the diversity and the way they want to make you feel at home. The chiropractic program is very challenging but I have had a very good experience so far.
Freshman,4,"As a student athlete wrestler on the womens wrestling team, the coaches and my team make this an awesome experience.

However, I'd like it better if school events like seminars and graduation would be held at a different location aside from the athletics building; all sports teams need the building for practice and to boot us from using our practice space to hold events unrelated to our sport is very offensive and intrustive and disrespectful to our sport and to the athletes and coaches.

life is how you make of it. I'm glad I'm here; im here to wrestle and I owe it all to my coach"
Freshman,4,"I am attending Life University as a first quarter student. So far I have actually learned many things and have become more open in my life. I like the fact that every student that attends this college is so greatly different from the next. There are bountiful races and cultures here on campus. Even the staff and advisors help new students, and older ones, throughout their school years."
Junior,4,"Life University is an amazing school for anyone interested in exercise related industries such as chiropractics, athletic training, exercise science or dietetics. They have small class sizes which I personally enjoy and a beautiful campus. The downside is that it is a small campus with not a whole lot to do unless of course you leave and head into Atlanta (which is only a half hour drive or less)."
College Senior,4,I have been over to campus housing and it's great! Convenient and elegant.
College Senior,4,We are growing in our athletic clubs. Rugby team is known as one of the best nationally and have grown to include a women's team and volleyball team. School spirit is definitely not as huge as other larger and public universities.
College Senior,4,"The teachers are passionate about what they teach. I love how vitalistic and health oriented the school is and as a result the student body. Close-knit school due to the small size, feels like a family. On the flip side tuition is expensive."
College Sophomore,4,One of the top schools in the area
College Senior,4,"Party's at the Commons are give and take, but for the number of people at the school they are relatively big comparitivly speaking. There are few party's that were not any fun in my recent memory."
College Senior,4,"On campus is the Commons, of campus is Buckhead, the transportation is Uber"
College Senior,4,"My experience in class was great. I have almost no complaints, except that science classes are quite difficult and require a lot of studying."
College Senior,4,"Everything feels very safe. The only objection to that is the lack of effective security, the campus safety workers are very ignorant, rude, and honestly are nothing more than parking cops because that's all they do 1.) Bother good people 2.) Give to many tickets. If they were to be replaced that would be great."
College Senior,4,Can choose where you plan to take your career based on your own belief of your field of study.
College Freshman,4,"I constantly see the campus security driving around everyday doing their job, so I'm pretty confident and sure if something happened they would be able to handle it!"
College Freshman,4,I'm a freshman so I don't know too much about this subject at the moment
Recent Alumnus,4,"The housing options on campus are very limited, there is only one building, which is very neat, close from the school, everything is walking distance. Although not very spacious, it is very modern (all stainless steel appliances) there are some adjusting tables on every floors. It's clean the parking is ideal every resident has a reserved parking spot."
College Senior,4,"The university is centrally located in Marietta and there are plenty of dinning options off campus. Most are within a 3 mile radius of the campus, from fast food, to buffets, to sit-down options."
College Senior,4,The school has very reasonable policies for class attendance and many other basic guidelines that are completely doable and easy to follow. They rules only affect the students in positive ways.
College Student,4,There's something for anyone to enjoy. There are different types of restaurants with different styles of food.
College Student,4,The school is strict on subjects I think should be taken seriously and not strict in areas I think should be taken lightly.
College Student,4,"They offer food for any taste or budget, everything I have tried is great!"
College Freshman,4,i have never had a internship but i would love to have one. over the summer i do volunteer hours at a daycare center near my home town. so if i would do an internship for something i would be majoring in would give me a better view on what i would be looking forward in my future. i wouldn't have any problems with finding any inter ships because my school give opportunities for students to get an inter ship in their field.
College Sophomore,4,We have a nice country bar near campus.
College Student,4,I don't have to much experience with the Greek life.
College Student,4,Life University is a great school and has diversity.

College Sophomore,4,"It is less expensive than on-campus housing. If you have a car and/ or room-mate with a car, GO FOR IT!"
College Sophomore,4,We have computer labs and we get a quarterly allowance of $7 for printing. The network reliability and wireless speed depends on the area where you are around campus. You should have your personal laptop.
College Sophomore,4,"It is my first quarter attending Life University. During this time I have found it its a great opportunity for those interested in pursuing a doctorates in chiropractics. I love the fact that I have the ability to transfer down 60 credit hour courses in the biology field and take them during my DC program. You get to work with some amazing professors who are truly in love with what they teach. The work load is not easy, but they have academic tutors and options to help you through it all. They have a variety of clubs and internship opportunities to keep me on track for future job searching. I would recommend you to look into there programs if your interested in becoming a chiropractic doctor."
College Freshman,4,facilities are great. campus life is really good. i thought i would be alone on my first quarter but since orientation i got to know many people and the ones that are now my best friends. also i feel like i earned a new family.
College Freshman,4,athletic center iis really great. library is awesome. there are a lot of green spaces. and activities and traditions too
College Freshman,4,"dorms are ""new"" are clean. conviniet because you get to meet more people eaisily and socialize more. also you don't have to wake up eairly to find a parking or take the shuttle"
College Freshman,4,"it's strict, but it is also the law."
College Freshman,4,"I like to live off campus because i'm a girl so i like my big closet. Also it is near the campus, a proximity 10 mins walking. parking is good on certain hours."
College Freshman,4,There are patrols giving arounds all over the school. I have not listen of any mayor crime.
College Freshman,4,The deposit got on time! it's perfect

College Freshman,4,"The Leadreship weekend is one of the best activities i went and the other would be the first thursday because is a fun day of many activities and its outside, also you get to meet many people. I'd choose this college again because it has a great spirit, i like the surroundings and I can cover my bachelors and doctorates in no time."

College Junior,4,"great variety..american, Chinese, Thai, Caribbean, etc"
College Junior,4,going to downtown atlanta has its spots
College Sophomore,2,No diverse Greek Life-Black fraternities or sororities
College Freshman,2,"Security at Life University has went down since 2012 when Life has armed security in the building, security stop at the end of 2012 and has been discontinued since, and thus has made it feel unsafe today in 2016, and i must say myself find myself in the tiny rooms with one door and tiny windows no security unsafe."
College Student,2,It will definitely be an inconvenience because I plan on walking or riding my bike to each place that I need to go to. 
College Student,2,I am not fond of my financial aid counselor because he seems to beat around the bush and not provide me with the answers that I am looking for. My tip for everyone is to apply for several scholarships so that you do not have to go into debt.
College Senior,2,average dinning but not within a walking distance-however there is public transportation accessible to your needs available
College Senior,2,"no leadership no support!
they need to offer a coordinated programs within the masters of clinical nutrition as well as sports nutrition!
very limited and very discriminating against older students"
College Senior,2,More focus on security and less focus on parking tickets
College Senior,2,Poor choices extremely highly priced for the quality and value
College Junior,2,"Since campus housing is limited, most students have to commute to campus. This makes parking at Life is very difficult, as there are barely enough parking places for the number of attending students. There are no plans at this point for parking to be expanded. Ticketing is very common if you are parking in an unauthorized parking spot."
Freshman,1,"This school is so boring! If you expect a little excitement after high school going here is not the place, like around 4/5pm it is a ghost town. they have professors as advisors, it appears they are so cheap they didn’t want to add people to the payroll, so they assigned professors two jobs. How are professors going to teach and advise students? What if you happen to not like your professor but he/she is your advisor, how are you supposed to consult in the same person you don’t like? Or, how is the professor going to have time teach and advise students on a timely manner and give the students who need advising and teaching their undivided attention?"
College Freshman,1,"Life University does not have a Greek society. Life University is not popular nor engage in Greek traditions.Sorry, i have never seen a Greek at Life University. Sorry, Life University does not have the question on Greeks at Life University."
College Freshman,1,"Well I found Life University hard too get accepted in, and if could choose a different school again I would choose another for sure, Life University wasted my time and money putting me in classes that had nothing to do what I came there for!! Also  found the people in the student advocacy center to be very rude!  Parking is worse at Life, and the list of problems go on. Also found some of the Freshman teachers to be rude behind closed doors! Feels like I wasted my time and wouldn't never suggest this school to anyone!"
College Sophomore,1,"Quarter system is to fast for 25+ credit hours. Although I passed all of my classes, I haven't retained most information. Also, school is not friendly toward military personnel. Great instructors."
College Senior,1,"their IT department is subcontracted from another company and it shows
their computers are extremely old and slow 
their IT department needs to be replaced and the whole computers systems needs to be updated-pronto!"

Freshman,5,So far so good. I just started and am happy with the process this far. I am doing classes online only.
Freshman,5,willing to go above and beyond to make sure that u know every thing that u need to know when it comes to beginning school. Also they offer classes online and at the campus. The school will find ways for anybody to start school and graduate.

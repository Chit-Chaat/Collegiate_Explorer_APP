Alum,5,"Although I did not take online coursework, my understanding is that it has been a good experience for students this year."
Alum,5,USAO is like the Hogwarts of college campuses. The faculty truly care about students and spend time teaching - in small classes. You really have a chance to learn.
Freshman,5,"The campus life of USAO from what I've seen on campus tours, is amazing! There are several places I could go to study quietly and the professors seem really nice! There are trees everywhere and a lovely park where events are held. The campus itself is quiet and serene and even has jobs to work at while staying on campus."
Freshman,5,"As of yet, I do not take any classes online. I have heard that teh experience can be quite pleasant!"
Senior,5,"Taking classes online during COVID-19 became stressful at first, but only because everyone was learning at the same time. It was just as hard for the professors to figure out how to communicate for science classes or labs as it was for the students. Though this pandemic kept us from being able to have that one on one in person, we always had zoom to get us through our lessons. They were always on standby for whenever we needed to reach out and hear back as soon as possible. Online classes were not as bad as we had expected; I wouldn't mind doing it again."
Senior,5,"My experience about this university has truly been amazing. Every professor I have been in class with has been really good, and they are always real quick to help you when needed, as well as very understanding when you don't catch on to things as they expect. I have yet to have a bad experience because even the staff outside of class is amazing as well. The staff who works in the business office, financial aid, or student services are always super helpful and attentive at what is going on in school. It's the type of school that is very, very welcoming and makes you feel at home."
Junior,5,The students and staff here make it the biggest family I’ve ever been apart of. The staff gets to be one on one with students because of how small we are so there’s so much learning going on all the time. The food could be more diverse though.
Sophomore,5,It’s a small school so you get more one on one with professors and the classes are a smaller size so there’s more room for discussions in class.
Freshman,5,The campus is small and full of friendly people! The class sizes are small so in return you are more connected with your classmates and professors!
Niche User,5,I think it would be the best college  to go to and is the closest college  for me to go to and probably  has the best campus.
Freshman,5,Currently attending as a freshman. Love the size of the school and campus. I can walk everywhere I need to go.  I also like the friendly atmosphere.
Sophomore,5,"It's  small school, very affordable, and the interdisciplinary curriculum makes sure that you are constantly critically thinking. It's a very personal college and a great school to attend."
Alum,5,"The school has all the benefits of a private college with the public college prices. The atmosphere is great. The people and staff at the university are all friendly and have you in their best interest. There are a ton of opportunities for you to be involved on campus as well. All in all, USAO is a fantastic school!"
College Sophomore,5,"Since this is a small school, there is more of a percentage that show up to the games."
College Senior,5,It is a great school
College Freshman,5,I love living on campus between the people rooms and the freedom it really gives you this amazing feeling
College Freshman,5,I don't really notice anything about Greek life on campus
College Freshman,5,I love how the coaches encourage the players to do their best both in sports and their studies
College Freshman,5,"No crime, I feel safe on campus. Only have had a few personal accidents."
College Sophomore,5,usao has been the best experience Ive had in my life. I was extremely impressed by it to attend my freshman year. This past year was the biggest eye opener of my life. I learned so much about myself by actually struggling to handle classes and the freedom that comes from living on your own for the first time ever. It has made me a better man by the struggles I faced my freshman year. I'm a better person from it and plan to use it to my advantage to succeed in the rest of my college career and into my life after college.
College Freshman,5,"The courses are interesting and original. The school expects for a good, well rounded education and that is what they give you. It is up to the student to take the initiative and utilize their professors and schedule if they want to get the great education USAO has to offer."
College Freshman,5,"There are a lot of great classes and awesome professors. Most of the classes are not as easy as some may expect, though."
College Freshman,5,I enjoy the challenge of the theatre department and also value the bonds I have made with my fellow majors. The amount of knowledge accumulated and terminology that must be learnt is astounding. Davis truly is a master at what she does.
College Freshman,5,"I love the theatre program. It is very open and very malleable to every student's interests and needs. That being said, the director will not let anyone she sees as sub par or below her standards get through the program without achieving the vast amount of knowledge she believes her graduate need. Courses outside the theatre department are also mandatory for a theatre major. Specialization and personalized majors are also something she usually ends up requiring for her students. 

Associate Professor Davis is extremely knowledgeable and wants all of her students leaving ready for a career in their preferred field. She is also caring for the theatre majors and will listen and give them advice. The amount of time required in Davis Hall means the theatre majors become an incredibly close knit familial group and nearby graduates will return to participate in productions."
College Freshman,5,The officers are available 24/7 to provide help to students and the faculty and staff are willing to help too.
College Freshman,5,The campus puts a ton of emphasis on their students safety and the safety of the other students and faculty.
College Freshman,5,All the professors here have Ph. D.'s in their field of study. They like to get to know their students on a personal level and help them to decide on career paths that best suite the student.
College Freshman,5,Everyone is able to be involved in any kind of sport!
College Freshman,5,"The school is great. The administration is extremely concerned with teh students and helping them in any way they can. Student fees aren't just left and done nothing with, the school is always proving things for the students to do."
College Freshman,5,there is always a place to park.
College Freshman,5,I love how different everyone is on campus. People from all over the world go to school here. Speaking with someone from a different country is always good because you can learn so much from them.
College Sophomore,5,"Academics at USAO are some of the best in the state. The interdisciplinary studies program is fantastic and causes students to be more well-rounded than general education programs at other schools. All of the other programs at USAO are great as well. Professors are always available to help. The classes are small, so this gives students more opportunities for discussions during class."
College Sophomore,5,They hold the Deaf Education major and are great about informing student about necessary steps for said major and how double majoring with another education major is a good idea
College Sophomore,5,"The Library has computers on the upper and lower levels to use when they are open. It's generally a good idea to have your own when you live on campus because the library may be closed. They also have a writing lab, with computers, printers and a student to help you with a paper you are writing."
College Sophomore,5,I have not even seen or heard about a drug seen here in Chickasha
College Sophomore,5,This is the only public liberal arts college in the state. The mandatory courses cover a wide variety of subjects. Most Professors have the highest degree in their field. There are math and writing centers to help with homework. Classes are also offered in the summer so it is possible to graduate in 3 years.
College Freshman,5,"Liberal Arts, Public – USAO is the only college, at least in Oklahoma, to provide a liberal arts education in a public college setting. The school is very cheap and there are many scholarships, but when you leave, you will definitely have a well rounded education."
College Freshman,5,"Deaf Education – The University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma is the only public University to offer a degree in Deaf Education. It is an amazing program that will not only make me available to teach in a deaf or special needs classroom, but also any classroom in my specialization area (High School English). The professors are all helpful and truly want to see me succeed."
College Senior,5,"Super Helpful! The people in the financial aid office are very friendly and approacheable. If i have any questions or concerns, they are always there to help and answer those questions. They are good about sending scholarship notifications and letting you know if you are missing anything to receive aid. I have been to other school where I would dread going to the financial aid office to be hassled and not greeted in a friendly matter. The financial aid office at USAO is great. I have never had any problems and would recommend using their services to anyone and everyone."
College Senior,5,"I Love It – I a glad that I was able to work on obtaining my bachelors from USAO.  I love that my learning experiences here have been fun, and very beneficial.  I feel that I will be very prepared for graduate school."
Freshman,4,USAO is a very friendly campus and also very diverse which is wonderful! The classes are very interesting and the teachers are very hands on.
Alum,4,"A great school for students looking for a tighter knit community at a lower price. The school prides itself of its emphasis on interdisciplinary learning. Expect smaller class sizes and professors that care if you do. It is located in a smaller town, but is only an hour away from a metropolitan area. The living arrangements are decent quality and offer multiple options. Like all colleges, you will wish it was cheaper, but it is not overly expensive."
Alum,4,"The faculty and professors work really hard to prepare students for the real world.  The professors were really encouraging and helpful when it came to class work and understanding the material.  The school atmosphere is lacking some in school spirit and the student body seems to disinterested in finishing school.   Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and loved every minute of it."
Senior,4,"USAO is a liberal haven in the middle of a conservative state. The students and faculty are very accepting and try their best to provide students with a quality liberal arts education. In fact they are the only school in the state that does. You get to know your classmates and professors really well and it is easy to foster relationships with others on the small campus; however, there is not much to do in the town of Chickasha, so prepare to be bored a lot."
Sophomore,4,This is a great school. I know all my professors and they are caring and helpful but they do not let you slack off. The push you to be the best you can be while also being super encouraging. The food here is trash and you have to buy a meal plan if you live on campus. Parties are nearly nonexistent here so if you're coming to school for that stay away. I come to this school to focus solely on my academics.
Sophomore,4,It's a very small campus the people are super friends. The classes are very small and the professors know students by name. Since it's small you know more people than you'd think.
College Sophomore,4,"For my degree, there is only a few colleges who offer it (two in the state), but it is a job that always has openings."
College Sophomore,4,they patrol quite often and they know most of the students so it is obvious if you dont belong
College Sophomore,4,"I like the interdisciplinary style. The weirdest is the team taught courses. To work efficiently, you have two teachers that have differing views so you have perspectives to consider. I liked my first one, but the second one was not as great because they had the same mind."
College Freshman,4,"Professors are very accessible and there are a variety of courses, however advisors mostly focus on courses that are major related."
College Freshman,4,Health and safety checks happen once a month as well as pest control which is awesome
College Freshman,4,"I lived in the apartments. I did not really like my roommates very much, so I would suggest attempting to change them or you could be stuck the whole school year. Also you really need to try to be social with neighbors and the rest of the rest identical community, as it can be easy to just stay in your room."
College Freshman,4,"I would definitely choose my school again, I'm sure there are better ones out there, but I enjoy the fact that it's small and very one on one with professors"
College Freshman,4,"I like the parties here, better than my hometown's"
College Freshman,4,More and better than my hometown's party scene
College Freshman,4,It's a liberal arts college
College Freshman,4,No real enforcement but the student body works together to handle problems
College Freshman,4,The faculty is the best.
College Freshman,4,Its a PWI but I see many people from other countries.
College Freshman,4,We seem to be relatively safe but we have mix ups every now and then. nothing too huge.
College Freshman,4,"I mean we aren't a big school and that's perfectly fine. You get to meet more people that way. There are a few things I would like to see added but overall, I'm enjoying my time here."
College Freshman,4,The teachers and staff are very helpful when you need anything. Including just someone to talk to
College Freshman,4,"since this is a small school, the amount of classes is limited. i am a deaf ed major and i wanted to take ceramic handbuilding for my art credit.  i decided my freshmen year and was told that i couldn't do it until my junior year because of the schedule for deaf ed. 

most of the teachers are awesome. i had one that i particularly did not like because he would not take into consideration other people's religion when he spoke.  he is Buddhist and would put down Christianity."
College Freshman,4,"since i go to a small school, there are not much sports.  we do not have a football team, but we are known for soccer.  our sports include: soccer, basketball, baseball, and softball.  our soccer team won the championship, i believe. there were more students who showed up for soccer than for basketball."
College Freshman,4,reasonable living space and lots of amenities
College Freshman,4,The frats and sororities here are ultra nice and pretty helpful.
College Freshman,4,The curriculum challenges you and the professors wanna help you graduate.
College Freshman,4,Good college and teachers for a great price
College Student,4,"The people at this school are friendly and intellectual. Everyone is inventive and creative. People around campus are not afraid to express themselves in the way they see fit. The classes are somewhat difficult because they do into intricate detail; however, the professors are happy to help you with whatever you need when you come to there office."
College Freshman,4,"It's easy to get to, though there is no trained nurse constantly on duty."
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy being a theatre and political science double major. As theatre is my career path and the more intense of the two I will focus more on this major. Associate Professor Davis is extraordinary but also can be quite set in her own ways and ideas. She is serious, which is good, and incredibly experienced but also, as the only theatre program professor she has a way of making sure it all goes her way. In the end, though, it works out. And she is an amazing, wonderful person to help us become well rounded actors, staff, and crew who will be much more informed and much more ready to audition for a numerous amount of jobs unlike the one way acting methods taught at places like OU and OCU."
College Freshman,4,The professors are dedicated to their jobs and helping a student find their own way of figuring things out.
College Freshman,4,There are diverse classes that everyone can take at any point in their college career.
College Freshman,4,The town a small town with lots of shops to venture out to on the weekends.
College Freshman,4,The financial aid office had everything on file and took care of getting me my aid on time.
College Freshman,4,There are a variety of resturants off campus with many different food choices.
College Freshman,4,My school has an amazing basketball team and soccer team that is what they are known for. Everyone attends the game when able but they love the sports and teams.
College Freshman,4,The sorority is a service one. They do a ton for the school and community. I'm not sure about the fraternity.
College Freshman,4,"You meet all different types of people while attending here. Many are democrats, but that does not harm the amazing friendships you get to experience."
College Freshman,4,not the best but not the worst
College Freshman,4,not the best but its good
College Freshman,4,The classes here are really great! I learn something everyday and I'm always challenging myself.
College Freshman,4,The parties here a lot of fun since everyone knows everyone. It's always fun getting to get her with a different groups of people. You can learn so much from them.
College Freshman,4,"The school always has something going on. I like the athletic centers, sometimes they can be a little small but they are still nice. The student centers are nice also, and always a great place to hangout."
College Sophomore,4,"It's not bad, I just wish we could change the menu up a little bit."
College Sophomore,4,We have great professors. They actually care about the students and what we learn. They also get into what they are discussing and it really helps visualize the entire message. They really do know what they are talking about.
College Junior,4,"While there is not an abundance of schoarships almost every student is on at least one scholarship.  if you do the work they often help to get you something.  I have an out of state tuition waiver, but beyond that everything is for oklahoma residents only."
College Junior,4,"The classes can be strenuous, hoewver they are very helpful for career prep.  classes are very small, the largest being 75 students, any my smallest having only 4 students."
College Sophomore,4,"While there is not a big drug scence, drugs are pretty well regulated at USAO. If a student is found to be doing drugs, then they are punished."
College Freshman,4,"Though my school is very affordable, they do not offer huge continuing academic scholarships, especially if you do not qualify for financial aid. The financial aid people are very helpful and friendly, though."
College Freshman,4,"For a college in a small town, we have very diverse students because it is a very affordable liberal arts college. There are small town people, city people, athletic people, artsy people, even foreigners. People are generally pretty friendly."
College Freshman,4,"It is a small college and there are plenty of parking spaces. It may be difficult to get a parking space close to the building, so be early!"
College Freshman,4,"I believe it will become better and better for USAO. A wider spectrum of students from nearby, as well as international, will help USAO develop into a well known university and shape the views that people have towards USAO."
College Junior,4,"Parking is generally good. It's a small campus, and there is parking right in the middle of everything. From what I've seen, permit cost is about average. You actually don't need a car for travel on campus, but if you go out to spend time in town, you'll need one."
College Sophomore,4,They have many different majors. Also they have very good teachers who teach the classes.
College Sophomore,4,"Not much financial aid is needed because it is a cheap school, but the amount of aid given could be better. Freshman scholarships are abundant, but upperclassmen don't get quite as much help. However, the aid that is available is very easy to get."
College Senior,4,"The school is really good at putting safety first. We recently had an upgrade in security, while the security guys on duty don't know a student from a trespasser, and showing my ID more often is annoying the buildings are secure as well as my vehicle."
College Freshman,4,"A Melting Pot – Many foreign students are drawn to this school because of the sports and scholarships. We have people from England, France, Africa, Serbia, and Russia just to name a few. I am very pleased with the variety of students and the different cultures I get to learn about."
College Freshman,4,"Secure Traveling – I always feel safe on campus. It is a small campus in a small town and there are often people you know watching out for you. The best part is that if you ever do feel uneasy going to your dorm or car, campus security is more than happy to escort you."
College Sophomore,4,"Plenty of Options – On campus you can find different clubs to be involved with whether one is trying to find a club that relates to religion, or sexual orientation. If there is not a club already, you could help get a new club going. Everyone seems pretty friendly and will help anyone around. There are plenty of African Americans, Whites as well as foreign people."
College Freshman,2,"the campus is not lit up very well.  the cross walks are barely visible and barely lit during the night.  the only lights that are really noticeable at night are the crosswalk and possibly the back parking lots. other than that, it is pretty much dark.  there is the major street on campus that everybody drives down and it is dangerous sometimes to cross because people never stop for the crosswalk.  i always watch my surroundings at night because of the non lighting."
College Freshman,2,i have not seen much in the career field from outside the university
College Freshman,2,There is very little off campus dining. Napoli's is pretty good and sit down but is also pretty expensive. Mostly there are some Chinese places and fast food chains.
College Freshman,2,"It was weird the first week, bad the next, got better, and now it's good every blue moon. There is only one place open at a time that you can get a decent meal and use your meal plan."
College Freshman,2,It's a small town with basically nothing to do. The only way to have a good time is to drive an hour into OKC.
College Junior,2,"there are a few sit-down restraunts, and quite a few fast food places."
College Sophomore,2,There is not much nightlife at USAO. The best options for nightlife are house parties. There are no clubs off campus and very few bar options.
College Sophomore,2,"USAO does not offer many major options, because it is a small school. The major options are pretty basic, but these help to better prepare students for graduate school."
College Sophomore,2,"The number of off-campus dining restaurants are very limited in quantity and diversity. There are very few options. The bulk of the restaurants are fast food, and there are not many sit-down dining options."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life isn't very prominent. Each of the two sororities has about 15 or less members. There is no special housing for Greek members. They do a few service projects and they throw one party for Halloween.
College Senior,2,Track Clothes the Norm – Its really hilarious how many students come in to class wearing sweats or workout shorts. Competition of style isn't heavy on campus which helps keep the atmosphere relaxed.
College Freshman,1,"There are very few sorority girls worth talking to. I adore one in particular, but she is a senior and is leaving soon. Most of the sisters are just the same girl cloned and really aren't worth the trouble. I have a few friends who left the sorority because of such nonsense. This being said, the fraternity is where it's at."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus dining at USAO is quite poor. There is only one option available at all times during the day, and the are many times when nothing is available. The quality of the food in the cafeteria is quite poor and very little goes into preparing it."
College Sophomore,1,"The computers on campus are great. However, the WiFi is terrible. The internet constantly cuts in and out and is very inconsistent."
College Sophomore,1,"There are only 2  ""greek"" organizations. I forget the name of the boys but there is only one for girls called Em Hi...I did not participate because it required a lot of time."
College Junior,1,"Chickasha is awful. I do not like the town, but I love this school. Chickasha is somewhat famous for its christmas lights display every year with the tallest lit tree in Oklahoma. There are small fairs that go on here every once in a while. the town is so small so there are no concert venues, very very little parks, no attractions, very little cultural events, and little shopping to do here besides necessities from walmart. The local attitude towards students is good I guess, as some professors/faculty members live here in town."
College Junior,1,"We are in a very small town where things shut down around 10. There is one bar around here, but it's so shady that I imagine only convicted felons and crack dealers drink there. The campus is very very small, and there isn't much to do if you don't have friends or alcohol. There are apartments on campus that parties are held at, there are some organizations that host open mic nights or studio nights but that's about all."
College Senior,1,Small Town – The school is based out of a agricultural area so hot spots are not on the list. However most all the needs are met and a fair m\number of good restaurants are in the area.

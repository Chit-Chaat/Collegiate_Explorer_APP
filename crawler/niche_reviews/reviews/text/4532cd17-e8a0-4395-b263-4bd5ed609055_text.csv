Alum,5,"It was great, very inclusive, affordable, and a quality education! Advisors are very helpful, and their advice allowed me to graduate in under 4 years!"
Senior,5,WCSU has an excellent music program for those interested in a music related major. State of the art facilities. The staff is an incredible team of highly qualified professional musicians and teachers. The music educators who graduate from WestConn have an instant reputation because of their affiliation with this school. I can not recommend WCSU enough and feel that it truly is the best college in the state for a music degree.
Senior,5,I haven’t taken any online classes at WCSU yet but have only heard good things from those who have. A few bumps are expected with any virtual learning experience.
Alum,5,Great school I was a transfer here. WCSU was a no-brainer for the low cost and I was surprised how much I got out of it.
Freshman,5,As soon as I went to Western Connecticut State University for the first time I knew it was my home for the next four years. The staff and faculty are the nicest people that you will meet and will help you with any questions that you need to be answered.
Alum,5,"I was a transfer student to WCSU.  From the beginning of my experience, I found though the school was about 2500 total students.  During my time, I was able to participate in several conferences and exclusive programs.  A major improvement that was needed when I was there was how to best deal with resident disputes.  I found myself and my roommate being ""punished"" by having a troublesome resident moved to our apartment simply because we were the only room open.  After several disputes with us, we resigned ourselves to simply ignoring his existence for the remainder of our semester until graduation."
Niche User,5,"Western Connecticut State University is an amazing college. When I went there for a college visit in november 2019 everyone made me feel so welcomed, and for me that's important because I wouldn't want to go to a school where I don't feel comfortable. The tourist were so nice and they gave me some great advice, for example they told me to make some connections with the students and teachers because after you graduate there will be opportunities open and those connections might help you in your career. I am a very shy/nervous person but I felt like I belonged there. My nervousness and shyness went away because of how the students were there. Another reason why it's a great school is that they just passed a law where New York State counts as in-state, that was astonishing news for me because I live in New York. Overall my experience with Western Connecticut State University was wonderful and I had a great time there."
Niche User,5,Western Connecticut State University has great service for high school students who are interested in applying. The admissions representatives are wonderful and very easy to talk to. The experience you get when applying and attending Western is unlike any in Fairfield County.
Sophomore,5,"I love Western Connecticut State University. I just completed my freshman year and I'm very much looking forward to returning in the fall. I initially moved into the mid-town campus in August but those dorms seem to be more like a commuter school with most of the students going back home on the weekends. I transferred to the west side campus in January which is a much better location for music students. The academic program is very challenging as expected, but we have so much fun in class that it doesn't seem onerous. I love the fact that we have to attend concerts all the time for my major. Performing is a little nerve wracking but the music students are like a family and the upperclassmen are very generous with advice."
Sophomore,5,WCSU is a great university that cares about their students. Classroom sizes are small so you have plenty of one-on-one learning time. You receive the highest education possible.
Freshman,5,"administration and faculty are friendly , great extra curriculars , tuition is fair and location is great for college ages kids. other students are approachable and it is a comfortable place to be"
Sophomore,5,I am currently a sophomore and love it. It is extremely diverse and unique. I love most of my professors and everyone is so nice. Highly recommend.
Senior,5,I love my school such a great school helped me grow as a person and find myself and being true to myself I have respect for all the professors they want they best for you
Freshman,5,"My experience is great, would recommend others to go here. Great staff and help from professors. I've been here for a few years, and so far my experience has been a great one. There are great events at WCSU, good athletic programs, and very friendly people around the campus. If you need to go from campus to campus, there is a shuttle for transportation. Friendly environment, and relaxed too. The libraries are a cool place to go and have plenty of computers or resources."
Sophomore,5,Western Connecticut State University is full of faculty that wants the ensure the best for their students. They make sure the expectations of the class is clean cut so that students know what is expected. They also provide many resources for improvement and intellectual understanding of material.
Sophomore,5,I just finished my freshman year at WCSU and had a fantastic year. I loved my classes. I was accepted into the nursing program starting my sophomore year. It is a small campus making it convenient to get to classes. I feel perfectly safe on this campus. Made some wonderful friends. Lots of restaurants and shopping in the area.
Graduate Student,5,"I have had a great time at Western Connecticut State University thus far. The professors that I interact with are caring, invested, and intelligent about their field. They are always there to help when in need and want to see the students succeed. I am usually not on main campus, my classes are on west campus and I enjoy being there. It is a bit secluded and parking is always good. The dining hall they have there always has fresh food and at a reasonable price. The graduate classes are long, but breaks are given which help. I am enjoying my time there and am learning a lot."
Sophomore,5,"Coming in as a transfer I thought I would feel a little out of place. However, all the students and professors were very welcoming and friendly. I found myself fitting in right away and adjusting quickly to life on campus. The professors are more than willing to make sure you understand any material completely and really urge you to visit them during office hours with any questions or concerns. My fellow classmates are very encouraging and outgoing. The theatre arts department is like a little family. I’m very glad I chose WestConn to finish up my undergraduate degree."
Sophomore,5,WCSU is a great college to go to because they have a great course of selections and great professors. The budget is great as well.
Sophomore,5,The professors are great.  They are willing to help.  Most of the student population at Western are commuters.  Additional parking for commuter students is needed.
Senior,5,I love the professors and they're very resourceful. The common areas where the tutors are very helpful with homework and exams preparation.
Senior,5,"Western Connecticut State University is a great school! I have thoroughly enjoyed my experiences here, the people I have met and the opportunities I have been giving. Living on campus is a huge bonus at this school, as meeting people can be hard on a predominantly commuter campus. However, the school gives out whatever you put in."
Junior,5,I have a great experience with the school and would recommend it to anyone. There is a great variety of culture and the teachers are very professional. The parking could improve as there are not enough spots for everyone to park
Freshman,5,"I like the area it is surrounded in it's a very safe environment, I also like that the school is small but not to small so it's easier to get one on one time."
Junior,5,Great school at an affordable price! The professors are knowledgeable and caring. High involvement opportunities and a beautiful campus.
College Senior,5,"My experience with professors has been nothing but helpful. If I have a question after class, I can always go to their office hours and even make appointments on your own time. They give extra credit to help you better understand the material. Lectures are always explained clearly and posted on blackboard to ensure you can access them later."
College Senior,5,Living on campus is a great experience to have. You get more involved with other students and activities that go on everyday. The housing staff make it enjoyable to live in your buildings and host programs to get to know others that may live right down the hall from you. It is very convenient to be living on campus for the walks to the café or computer labs take less than 5 minutes.
College Senior,5,Western Connecticut State University has a staff that makes it very hard not to be successful. They give you the drive to want to do your best in their classes. Professors are very engaged in your grades and making sure you are completely understanding the topic at hand. They provide outside of the classroom hours for extra help and study sessions for upcoming exams.
College Senior,5,There is almost no incident and there are offices dedicated to this problem.
College Sophomore,5,My overall experience at this school is fantastic!
College Freshman,5,I love my school! I just cant afford it.
College Freshman,5,"I love Greek life and am so glad I decided to join. I love wearing letters, I loved the process of joining for Kappa Chi Alpha. There is no Greek housing but there is still that heavy family sense and most sisters room together eventually. I do get stares when I wear letters but never really experienced terrible negativity just maybe some light judging. Greek life is huge and amazing."
College Sophomore,5,"At the point when I was accepted into Western Connecticut State University I thought I was making the worst decision since it was the only school I could afford comparing to all of the conservatories and music colleges I dreamed of going to and was accepted into. However, once I start my fall semester in 2014 I fell in love with almost everything. The people, new beautiful visual and performing arts building and of course my wonderful professors. I never thought I would have love a state school this much but I wouldnt trade it for any other experience, as of right now I am just trying to continue my education here by somehow finding the finances."
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe here. Admissions helped me a lot when it came to my schedule and my major. The staff shows they really care about their students and the success of the college.
College Freshman,5,"I love it! The school is beautiful and I love the area! I just wish the dorm rooms were a bit bigger and the bathroom showers had seperate stalls with separate drains otherwise, It's great!!"
College Sophomore,5,The food is great and there's different choices .And the food is not the same everyday which is nice.
College Freshman,5,There are some truly great places to get food around here. The varieties of places are enough to satisfy anyone's hunger.
College Freshman,5,Faculty in the Music Department is impeccable. They have so some knowledge and experience and are always there to help students.
College Freshman,5,"Western Connecticut State University has the best Nursing Program in Connecticut, and one of the best in the country, and you can't beat their price."
College Freshman,5,Financial aid was very easy to obtain although it was a little bit of a process to get the money back.
College Freshman,5,"Our professors and their vast experience, the music education program has a large reputation as being the best in Connecticut, if not the best in New England. We have large expectations exemplified by our Professional Program. This program can and does cut off certain students from receiving their degree due to a lack of compliance with the guidelines. Workload is large as with any music related degree. Due to a large amount of core classes (theory, sight-singing, lessons, piano, etc...) many students are challenged by the high standards they are met with. Our new building, the Visual and Performing Arts Center is fantastic! Priced at $96.7 million, it is definitely of great use to our music education and other music related majors as well as theater and art."
College Freshman,5,"The workload is appropriate. The curriculum is meticulous in nature. The school is well prepared to help students immerse themselves into all sorts of specific majors and jobs. It is the pride of the school having a diverse music staff of all different backgrounds who want to connect their students to the markets they will master in the future. I enjoy it greatly. Due to personal reasons, I have switched from Music Education to Music Performance. Regardless of my choice, the music education has full grasp to turn a student into an effective educator. Through constant innovation of curriculum and an experienced staff, WestConn offers a comprehensive program that few other schools can match. It truly is fantastic!"
College Student,5,"The Music Education program at Western is becoming perhaps one of the most well-known and best accredited Music Ed programs in the Northeast.  We have about 80+ students in the program, a lot of student involvement from our school in the Connecticut Music Educator's Association, and a high graduation rate.  Schools smile upon music teachers who study Western."
College Junior,5,Getting into my program was very easy. I did not encounter any difficulty.
College Junior,5,I feel very happy with my program. My career goals are to get my bachelors degree in Mathematics at WCSU. I would proceed to get a Masters degree and then my Doctorates in Math. I would like to be a college math professor. To be honest I do have some concern with finding a job in my field because most math professor are permanent and there is a rarely vacant spot for someone new but since its what I really want I have faith I will get a job.
College Junior,5,Since Im a transfer the only thing I did was change my college and address. It possibly took me 3 minutes maximum.
College Junior,5,They have a wide variety of majors. Lots of professors. The registration process was fairly easy though I am a transfer so I knew what I was doing but overall its a great school.
College Freshman,5,"The job opportunities are awesome, your adviser sets you up with internships/jobs with ones that they will actually benefit you and know that you will get something out of it/"
College Freshman,5,The plus side of western is the FREE PRINTING!!!!
College Freshman,5,Not much of a nightlife in town but atmosphere is great
College Freshman,5,"All of the residence halls are all co-ed, either by floor or section. The guys and girls to ratio are very close, making no difference between the two populations."
College Freshman,5,By being apart of the Psychology program in my school it is very beneficial and the amount of access we have to us is incredible. There are many interships and volunteer opportunities available to us and clubs designed to help us succeed in our program.
College Freshman,5,"My school is very strict on the policies within the school. Whether it is an academic policy or a social life policy, each one is taken seriously and taken into great account for the safety of the students."
College Freshman,5,"Walking around campus you always see an aray of different ethinicities and people of different racial backgrounds. My school is extremely open to different beliefs and they make note of it by promoting them through clubs and activites. There are many clubs for everyone's politcal beliefs, religions and sexual orientation, like my schools Alliance club."
College Sophomore,5,"I have lived in Danbury, CT my whole life.  I know all of the great deals and places to eat."
College Sophomore,5,"I've lived here my whole life. Even though I am used to being here everyday, I caouldn't imagine it any other way."
College Freshman,5,The shuttles are great! They run every 15-30 min.!
College Freshman,5,everyone has a different culture
College Freshman,5,I'ts the hardest major at this school
College Junior,5,"Being in the clinical setting I have learned quite a number of nursing skills that I will need in my future career as a registered nurse. What sets this apart from everything else I have done at Western is the amazing people I meet each and every day when in the clinical setting with my instructor and fellow peers. I have a smile on my face when I enter the hospital and a smile on my face when I leave the hospital. It is so gratifying that we, as nursing students, are making a difference in one person’s life when we step onto the floor, even if it is just to make the patient more comfortable or even a simple smile before surgery. I can honestly say I cannot imagine doing anything else with my future other than to be a registered nurse and be there for my patients. "
Niche User,4,The virtual meetings were fun! I enjoyed the q&a and interactive speakers. The school looks great and I'm excited
Niche User,4,"I have not attended yet! But so far through the virtual meetings, and knowing the meteorologist program is awesome is very promising!"
Alum,4,"Campus is pretty easy to navigate, most students are very active with clubs,  most classes are less than 30 so you get better quality and a more personable experience out of the classes."
Senior,4,"Western Connecticut State University is an awesome local college that allows you to grow because of its population size. You have more opportunities to be involved, get leadership experience, be close to your professors, and have an on-campus job!

I'd like to see administration being a little bit more involved. The professors are amazing, and I think administration can be too if they built a closer relationship with students."
Senior,4,My experience at WCSU is great. The people and connections that I make and will continue to make will hold strong for years to come. The resources that we have been given in the educational and music field are second to none within this state.
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely adore the campuses, both Midtown and Westside, they're beautiful! There's a lot to do around and on campus as well, I enjoy being on campus whether it be participating in school festivities or just studying."
Alum,4,My experience overall was great. It's a small school but has a nice community. I've had great teachers and some okay teachers.
Alum,4,I've taken 2 online classes here. Both went well and professors responded in an appropriate time. Overall I had a good experience with their online classes.
Sophomore,4,"The environment of the college was nice- it had a traditional feel but it also had a touch of modern to it. The range of majors was also sufficient for those looking for any type of education. The student culture was also incredibly inviting and everyone was super nice. The activities for the students that the school puts on are also incredible and are lots of fun. The two campuses are an interesting layout, so getting used to the shuttle service is an experience. But overall it's a good school."
Sophomore,4,"I did have to take my classes online once the Covid-19 hit. Western handled the online transition well, with the use of Blackboard and Webex rather than zoom. I thought that taking away the classroom setting was detrimental to the learning process, but the whole setup of the online classes was handled well."
Freshman,4,"Western Connecticut State University was a good college experience. It is very small and the campuses are split, but the education was good. The teachers care about the students and don't just throw work on them because they have to."
Alum,4,Western Connecticut State University is a great college with numerous majors and minors. It is in close proximity to many attractions including New York City. WCSU also has 18 intercollegiate athletic programs and countless clubs and intermurals to choose from. It is a diverse school and provides great opportunities and resources to their students!
Sophomore,4,"WCSU is a great option for undergraduates. There are many resources to take advantage of within the school. There is a couseling center, career advising, help with every subject, and more. The teachers push students to tap into their full potential with strict deadlines and attendance policies. While strict policies may seem harsh, the teachers make sure to answer every question that arises and are always available for additional health even outside of their office hours. Along with many resources, the school has great research options. There are research grants provided for many different programs and majors. There is always a research opportunity or scholarship option for you. According to most students, food options and quality could be improved on both campuses and some renovations on old dorms are needed. Overall, WCSU has actually made me enjoy school for the first time and I am looking forward to returning in the fall."
Alum,4,The nursing program at WCSU very well prepared me to take the NCLEX exam upon graduation. Overall WCSU is a good affordable school for CT and now New York residents.
Junior,4,"It is a nice beginner university, where you can grow without worrying too much about debt. Meanwhile, other schools where have you in debt for years, when you just wanted to learn and grow."
Freshman,4,I have enjoyed living away from home and getting to know new people. I am a soccer player and was excited to play for the school men's team during my freshman year.
Sophomore,4,I love the support that is given by the professors and the atmosphere the campus brings. I would rate this higher but I strongly feel this university is highly commuter lifestyle-based and any campus residents are left scrambling.
Senior,4,"I've been to three schools and Western has one of the best communities on campus that I've been a part of. Plenty of clubs, athletics, and academic opportunities for everyone. You'll get out what you put in here."
Freshman,4,"What I like about WestConn is that the professors are all amazing, they have great food, an amazing library, and many tutors to help you if you’re ever struggling."
Sophomore,4,"I am nursing major and really love the nursing program here at WCSU. The professors really care and want to help you succeed. it is not easy whatsoever but it holds it reputation for being the top nursing school in CT and one of the top 10 in New England. 
My biology professors have also been excellent. 
I really love the honors program."
Freshman,4,I liked how many activities they offered at the beginning of the school year to help students get involved and get settled in.
Junior,4,"Diverse campus with flexible major programs. The fine arts program needs more attention, and the equipment for the studio rooms is often broken"
Freshman,4,"the classes as well as the atmosphere is really nice, I enjoy being on the campus. One thing I would change is the registration process for new classes because it is a bit confusing."
Junior,4,"I believe Western Connecticut State University is truly a great place to pursue further education, while gaining the full college experience. The university offers as much aid as they can to help students in their academics as well as all other aspects of student and personal life. WestConn has the best of both worlds as far as programs. There is an AMAZING MUSIC and THEATER PROGRAM, and the Nursing program is the BEST IN NEW ENGLAND!!! The best part, is that so many of the staff and faculty are willing to go the extra mile to help students excel in their studies. In my personal experience, the overall experience I have had with the majority of my professors is very good. They are some of the people who have allowed me to  positively grow as a student. I am very grateful I got accepted into this university. I couldn't imagine going anywhere else."
Freshman,4,"Although I am entering as a first year student, Western Connecticut State University has everything one can hope for a student.
The staff of the academic advisement center are so caring and truly put the time and effort to help a student chose the right path for themselves.
WCSU has a beautiful campus with a variety of shops surrounding the Danbury town which allows students to have many choices when it comes to heading out for food or finding things to do."
Sophomore,4,"I love the size of the school and the closeness of the students within majors. There are constantly activities going on, so there is always something to do. WCSU has an amazing Honors Program with incredible faculty and students."
Senior,4,"WCSU is overall a good school. I lived there as a resident for 4 years, and I am now a commuter. Every school has its pros and cons, of course. WCSU has 2 campuses, both of which are small but beautiful. They are currently working on many renovation projects to update the classroom buildings as well as the residence halls. Greek life is not as prevalent as it is in some other schools, but because of that, I do not see many cases of people being bullied or hazed. The party scene is not very prevalent, though it depends who you know. As a resident, life is simple and largely quiet, which is perfect for studying. As a commuter, I am happy that they have so many parking facilities. The Kathwari Honors Program is amazing; I have met so many wonderful people, and Dr. Kukk is an amazing leader."
Sophomore,4,"I really like Western Connecticut. I think the academics are very good. The professors want to see the students succeed and will work with them to make that happen. There are plenty of resources available which is great and helpful. It's not like your average ""big name"" school. It's a commuter school so sometimes the campus seems slow and for example there aren't huge fan sections at our sporting events. But, the people are great and there is stuff you can do and clubs and teams you can join to help stay involved."
Senior,4,I enjoyed the time I spent living on campus. It was a great way to connect with other students and the WCSU community at large. The professors were also great. As a National Guard soldier I needed professors with a certain amount of flexibility and they worked with me as needed. I am confident in this Western's ability to provide a quality education.
Freshman,4,WCSU is a great school. It is very inclusive and welcoming. They have many great programs to help students get to know each other and the campus.
Junior,4,"WestConn has been one of the most rewarding experiences that I've had in my educational career. Not only have I had some of the most supportive and insightful professors, the opportunities that I have had as a writer have been monumental as well. The only downfall is that they tend to have issues helping clubs and departments advertise well, unless they're involved with SGA or Greek life, but otherwise a great school."
Freshman,4,"When I first visited the school, I knew it had become my first choice school. After attending accepted students day, I committed immediately. The application process was very simple and I got a response in about two months. I was very happy to had been accepted being that I was worried my 2.8 GPA would be too low to get accepted into a four-year university. Wescon has a great campus with amazing and helpful staff and students. I enjoy every second I spend wether it’s in classes or studying at their phenomenal library. Wescon makes me more moviated to attend college and pursue my degree in nursing. Their nursing program is spectacular and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a BA in Nursing. Wescon is an amazing school that provides opportunities to many, being that they are so affordable with their tuition prices."
Alum,4,"For financial affordability purposes, and quality of education for a state managed higher educational institution, Western CT State University was a great choice! Their degree programs are designed to be broad enough to provide breadth of knowledge towards an advanced degree. But, if you know specifically what path you need to take to achieve your career goals, I urge that you do your research and look for program specifics that align closely with that long term goal."
Freshman,4,"it is a good university, only down side is having to travel from campus to campus. The shuttle does however make traveling t each campus easier, the only tough part is during the winter and waiting for the shuttle in the cold weather."
Junior,4,Very good art program and has variety of clubs and organizations that does a lot of fun events to do on campus and great affordable filed trips.
Niche User,4,"An amazing area. With two campuses on each sid of the town. Beautiful town, beautiful people, beautiful eveything. Staff are very friendly and helpful, no doubt of that. And overall, an amazing school with a lot to offer."
Sophomore,4,"This is a wonderful place in terms of academics. The professors care for the students, and the students are down to earth individuals. The only thing that might need a few changes is dorms/housing as well as health and safety."
Freshman,4,So far I have loved my experience at WCSU! I've meet a lot of great people. I have loved being apart of the athletics there. It helps me stay on top of my work and expand my horizons as well as giving me an awesome group of friends.
Niche User,4,"I liked how there was a lot of diversity and many different majors you can take. When I went on the campus tour there was a lot of things you can see. For example, there is a place in the gym where you can see all of the majors, athletics and more, as well as the information of these things."
Senior,4,"What I have enjoyed most about WCSU is the community of students, they are all incredibly welcoming and helpful to incoming students as well as current students. I was very hesitant about staying at WCSU but as soon as i got involved I was able to see how much i loved being there."
Sophomore,4,I really liked most of my teachers my first year at Western. The atmosphere on campus was always friendly and welcoming.
Senior,4,The class sizes are generally small and allows for direct interaction with the professor. Most professors provide convenient office hours for outside of the classroom assistance. The small community allows for students to get to know each other and provides captivating events throughout the semester.
Freshman,4,"I love the faculty and the students at Western. Everybody is extremely nice, helpful, and the individuals who I have asked for guidance have done such an amazing job in giving me advice and getting me on the right path to success."
Alum,4,Very affordable tuition with well educated and trained staff. Mostly organized. I completed the RN to BS program to which I was not favorable of.  The use of online materials and programs made it much more flexible then typical programs. The program prepared me well for graduate composition.
Freshman,4,I like going to WCSU a lot. I just don't like how they have changed the class schedule and how they plan to keep it. Other than that the classes are fun and great. Very inclusive school to get people to enjoy their college experience.
Freshman,4,This school is only 25 minutes away from where I currently live. WCSU has opened its in-state tuition to certain counties of NY and NJ allowing me to got there for instate tuition. The school is really nice and has two campuses depending on what your major is.
Junior,4,The Music Education major is phenomenal.  Music Theatre and Nursing are also very strong majors here... but that's about it.
Freshman,4,"WestConn is an average university. The people there are polite but not very friendly or helpful. There isn't much diversity on campus. There are no cultural clubs or cultural activities, so if you're interested in culture I wouldn't recommend this university for you. The performing arts department is good. This university is most suited for theater and acting majors, as it provides a good education on theater and drama and has many opportunities for students to showcase their talents on stage."
Junior,4,"I like that there are many things to do and clubs to join. I like working on campus because I get to see friends, and I am also able to do my homework when it's not busy. It's a great school, not too far from home."
Niche User,4,I am looking to go to Western Connecticut State University as a a freshman next year. My boyfriend goes here and I have been to the campus and eaten there multiple times. It is a great school and I am very excited to start my career here!
Senior,4,"This is my senior year and so far I have had an amazing experience here at Western. The only con is that it has two split campuses (there is a shuttle that brings students back and forth). Academics, student life, professors, parties, athletics, etc. are all great and pretty much what you would expect at any great college. (Only at Western the cafe food and dorm life, in my opinion, is much better than meals at other Universities that I have experienced). Furthermore, being it is a smaller school, it is a lot easier to create meaningful relationships with fellow students, staff, and professors."
Senior,4,"WCSU has been a great college and I am very glad that I chose to attend the school after acceptance.  The profeesors for my major are amazing, and the amounts of activities designed to meet new people and join clubs are endless!"
Junior,4,"I transferred to Western and I love it so far. As a commuter, i don't have trouble finding a parking spot and everyone that I meet on campus is friendly. Professors are hit or miss like every other college. Decent campus and library"
Freshman,4,I liked the lowkey kind of vibe that the university has but the fact that it is still a fun school that offers many opportunities to meet new people. I just wish the majority of freshman wouldn't go home on the weekennds
Freshman,4,"Western Connecticut State University is a very nice school. The professors are nice and the campus is very welcoming. The only glaring issues with the school is the fact that WCSU is located in the heart of Danbury, CT, and that the university is comprised of two separate campus locations."
Alum,4,Western Connecticut State University is an ideal school for those who are determined to excel in their academic career and achieve success.
Junior,4,"Western is a great school, but there is two campus's. The other connecticut school systems are able to spend more money on student involvement, but we have to constantly run a shuttle across to allow students who dorm transportation. Also, a lot of the classrooms are outdated, and the management professors are very mundane."
Alum,4,"I went to Western CT ST University for my undergraduate and graduate degrees. What I liked most about this school were the teachers and how dedicated they were to helping you succeed -- in particular, the English-Writing Department.  These professors helped me develop my thesis and guided me through the process providing inspiration and valuable insight whenever I got stuck, and the professors in Psychology were just as dedicated. Overall, West Conn, for me, was  a very community-oriented college that went out of its way to make everyone feel welcome. It's was definitely my home away from home."
Alum,4,Midtown campus is welcoming and inviting and there is always a place outside to hangout or do homework.
Senior,4,"So far I've been at Western for about five years and it's been one hell of ride there in attending the university. I've learned so much about myself as a person and as an artist. There have been many many times when I wanted to quit, but I didn't. I love pursuing my dream as a singer at the university. The professors in my department are some of the best musicians I've ever come across in my field of study. I have the world famous Jimmy Greene who teaches in my department and I'm starstruck. I get to see people like him everyday on my campus and it's truly a blessing."
Freshman,2,"Not a good school if you’re looking to meet life long friends or branch out. Greek life is very small and caddy there are other clubs but not many. Mainly a commuter school and most people go to class and either home or to their dorm. As far as academics go, the professors share their individual philosophies and opinions rather than teach. Overall, it is a good way to save money but if you are looking for a true college experience that will provide a good social life and good academics I suggest going somewhere else. Great option for the first two years to save and get your common core done but I highly suggest going somewhere better after those first two years."

Overall, it is a good way to save money but if you are looking for a true college experience that will provide a good social life and good academics I suggest going somewhere else. Great option for the first two years to save and get your common core done but I highly suggest going somewhere better after those first two years."
Sophomore,2,"Value wise, as an undergrad commuter student, this is a cheap school with a decent academic environment. Campus life sucks though. Everyone looks like they hate their life and wish they were anywhere else but westconn. Party life is nonexistent. The most fun i've had is staying at the dorms with a few close friends and partying there, but there is off campus apartment housing that a lot of people go to for parties. The overall atmosphere at these parties is uncomfortable to say at the least. Not only are you walking through a bad part of danbury, but the parties themselves are not very inviting and the types of people attending make you start to believe you aren't at a college party at all. Overall if you are trying to save money for a decent education, westconn is a good start, but you will absolutely not get the ""college experience"" here."
Junior,2,"I really hate to be giving my university a 'poor' rating, but I truly do not feel as though I'm getting my money's worth by attending WestConn. Now, before I begin, I should note that WestConn DOES have a lot to offer, but only in certain departments such as theater, nursing, etc... As an anthropology/sociology major, I feel as though I've received the short end of the stick. There are minimal classes in my major to choose from, and a couple of the required classes that I've taken for my major have been jokes and a complete waste of my time and money. The problem with WCSU is that it accepts just about everyone who applies. That leaves higher-achieving students in classes with students who demonstrate only a surface-level understanding of the given subject matter. This makes for lackluster discussions and lowered standards from professors. When I transferred, I was under the impression that this school would be a good 'bang for my buck', but I do not feel challenged in the slightest."
Senior,2,"It's alright. The academics are mediocre, the professors are okay, and the general faculty are unhelpful. The school charges way too much considering they give in return so little to the students. They've had a norovirus outbreak, no clean water, and even handed out expired purel to students at the time of the outbreak. Overall and okay school, but I wish I could've gone somewhere else."
Freshman,2,Nothing to do on campus except go to class and go back to your dorm. When there are things to do they are on days where most kids are busy and can't attend. Most of the time as well is that the activities are on the other side of the campus which is an inconvenience.
Freshman,2,"OUR MASCOT IS A SLAVEOWNER. Do your research BEFORE coming to this school. The administration will go on to persuade you into believing this is a diverse school. According to numerous polls, over 60% of students here are white. I, as a gay man, can tell you that I've had a very hard time finding a diverse and open area where I am comfortable.  The area in the town is sketchy at best. Homeless men will stumble upon campus. There is little party scene here - it's only in this one location which has the tendency to be shut down by police officers. And maybe that's for the best, as there was rumored to be a girl who was gang-raped there. My dorm is infested with mice. One hall on Westside is cockroach-infested. The food here is NO. Sodexo? SUCKdexo. Some professors here are caring but some are unprofessional and bigoted. I feel that if I lived on Westside campus, I'd be singing a different tune, but as it stands, WCSU is not a particularly great school."
Senior,2,"The most significant part of this school I have noticed is that they do not care about their students safety or health, at least not the people in charge."
College Freshman,2,"So if you are like me and didn't do much research, let me summarize it for you. If you plan to live ON-CAMPUS and you like interacting with people this is not the school. It is PRIMARILY A COMMUTER SCHOOL. At least for freshmen, you will most likely be living on mid-town campus.  This school is incredibly small, it says about 5,000 total students. On midtown campus after the day is over and on weekends it feels more like there is only 100 people on campus. The campus IS SEPARATED by 12 minutes. A split campus means that you have to take a shuttle over to West-side. West-side is better and the food on west side is better. On midtown the food is not as good and the breakfast, lunch, dinner schedule is odd, at times they may even be closed during the morning (make sure you keep food in your dorm). If you are a party person there is basically only one party, it frequently gets shut down. And that's pretty much it, there isn't much to do here, I want to transfer and it had been only a  month. The only thing so far that I have liked are the cafe ladies, they are nice. Side note: I do not play any sports and such, so it is probably more fun when you have sports or instruments."
College Freshman,2,"I don't exactly notice the greek life here as much as I thought I would, Its not very apparent."
College Freshman,2,The freshman dorms are absolutely awful. Newbury is much better than litchfield but they're tearing it down after 2016 anyway.
College Sophomore,2,"Westconn makes it nearly impossible to

Graduate in 4 years with a bachelors degree. The advisers are not helpful at all and the professors could be better."
College Sophomore,2,Graduating with a degree from this school puts you in no better position than if you had gone to a community or junior college
College Sophomore,2,"Completely overpriced for what you get. Your roommate survey has absolutely no affect on the roommate selection process and even if you pick a dorm early and get all your paperwork in on time, you aren't guaranteed a good dorm"
College Freshman,2,"I haven't been able to qualify for financial aid, even though I no longer live in custody of my parents, they're giving me a very hard time."
College Freshman,2,took me about a month to be able to receive even the number of how much i was going to receive. After finishing a step there would always be another that no one mentioned until weeks later.
College Freshman,2,I dont care about the sports at Westconn
College Freshman,2,"The greek system does not have a good reputation, they are boring"
College Freshman,2,"I would rather, if I was not a commuter, dorm on campus.  It would be too hard to find a house off-campus and its more dangerous."
College Freshman,2,"Many of the restaurants are very generic. Dunkin Donuts, McDonalds, etc... There is not one Wendy's in Danbury. The Mall offers a larger variety restaurant and small shop wise with places like Panera Bread and Chipotle and larger venues like Cheesecake Factory and the Burger Joint. Most kids on campus stick with Papa Johns, Dominoes, or the local chinese place for late night food. After Midnight, Danbury is pretty useless for food. Everything is close except maybe the local diners which really aren't that great like Three Brothers Diner and Windmill Diner."
College Freshman,2,My phone was stolen last semester. The campus police were of no help. Parking and parking tickets are a constant thing at this school. Alcohol/drugs are easily sneaked in despite the efforts of the RA's and RD. The cops don't do much outside of direct complaints from staff or parking incidents. Police are a bit useless. If a party with alcohol or drugs is caught it is immediately ended. We haven't had any protests but one peaceful demonstration went uninterrupted.
College Freshman,2,"Danbury, CT is not a very good college town. Everything is so separated. As far as near by attractions there is the Danbury Fair Mall and Danbury Ice Arena. Danbury is very bipolar, being either extremely residential or urban. There is the Danbury Hospital which means there is an assured health institution in the area. Large stores are very far and few in between. It's just not very active nor is it optimal for a college student."
College Junior,2,"As a music performance major with a concentration in classical violin, the experience is lackluster. My private teacher was incompetent and the strings department was under served and under represented."
College Junior,2,"What defines Westconn's diversity is a bunch of whites, some blacks and a few foreigners. There isn't really a good balance."
College Freshman,2,Took me 6 weeks after I applied to fasfa for western to tell me that i needed extra paperwork to complete the process
College Sophomore,2,"The first year that I applied for financial aid at this school, I did not receive it until the end of the first semester.  I had to pay half the tuition out-of-pocket, which was very hard for me.  I had to get a loan from a bank.  I was then refunded a quater of what I paid.  My parents paid the loan off to the bank.  However, I am still paying my parents back."
College Sophomore,2,it is nothing like a real greek system
College Freshman,2,Parking can be very difficult. 
College Sophomore,2,"I am not a type of party girl and I don't drink so I don't go to the parties, bar or club."
College Junior,2,"There is not much parking, and it is often full. One of the parking lots is only dirt with no lines so people park all over."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Did not participate much, but there a few bars nearby, well within walking distance."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Financial aid is available through FAFSA, but not much in the way of scholarships, and as a music major I already have more opportunities for tuition cuts/scholarships than most students."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Pretty diverse in all aspects. Income may be the exception to that, but even then, there is some variety."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Team performance has been pretty poor in the past, particularly in football, but since switching leagues, we've had a better record."
College Sophomore,2,I got a good amount of financial aid from the government. The financial aid department is usually really busy so it's a hassle to find other aids
College Sophomore,2,I honestly just found out about the Greek life here at west conn. Its not too big on everyone.
Recent Alumnus,2,It doesn't interest me. And the sorority's here dont seem very friendly
College Senior,2,"Parking garage is a bit insufficient for growing student population, but plans are in the works to build a new garage; shuttles late/full occasionally."
College Freshman,2,"parking on campus can be good at times and other times awful its all depends on the day and especially time for those who come very early around 8am-9am parking spots are very good, and easy to find. around 10:30am-12:30pm its hard to find a location its mainly when students are coming to class so your're lucky if you find a spot"
College Junior,2,"Academics are difficult to schedule.  The school has 2 campuses and though WCSU has a shuttle service which runs between the 2, it often runs late and depending on the student's schedule could make them late for class. Offices should be open later at least a couple of days per week to enable non-traditional students to access necessary personnel."
Senior,1,"West conn is a fine school, just sometimes when you contact them they don’t give you straight answers and sometimes they don’t answer the question you want them too. The classes are fine and the professors are pretty cool."
College Sophomore,1,The campus is very open to the public and near a terrible neighborhood in downtown Danbury. There is always at least one homeless person sleeping in the student center and the police presence is very minimal.
College Sophomore,1,"The academic advisement center is a joke. After taking an entire semester of classes my advisor told me I needed for my program, I learned they were all optional and was set back in my program because I then needed to go back and take all the classes I actually needed. The professors are, for the most part, interested in helping their students succeed. However, in my three semesters here, I've had three different professors who barely spoke English and could not adequately communicate material to the class."
College Senior,1,"I do not like WCSU one bit. You must take a gym class and lecture to graduate and it is the equivalent of a high school health class. I paid $800 together, my money could have been better spent at the gym. The parking situation is always terrible. The course offerings are always slim. There are many Asian and Vietnamese professors in the accounting and finance areas of study here. Some have thick accents and the others just teach differently than professors do in the states. If you take accounting you only have the option of a Chinese professor for Accounting 1, 2, and 3. The class sizes are around 25 students each which you think would be good, but you do not get the individual attention that you would believe you would get. Also, this makes classes fill up really fast and is difficult to stay on track with your major because most classes only offer one or two sections. I will not even consider this school for my masters. I've considered transferring numerous time, but I'm so close to finishing. The administration will not provide course overrides so you can jump into a class that is filled. I say what's the difference between 25 and 26 students, there could be 50 for all I care because most classes just teach off the powerpoints with no added information anyway. It seems like they don't want you to graduate fast because they get more money for you being there more semesters than adding more classes.The only good thing I can say is Dr. Kukk is an amazing teacher. I hate WCSU I should of went to CCSU."
College Freshman,1,"Nightlife is horrible. not many options to choose from. with the options available, not very friendly towards the college crowd."
College Freshman,1,diversity based on what you like to do.
College Freshman,1,It is pretty boring here to be honest. Not really much to do besides hang out. Unless there is a huge party you can go to people mainly go home or stay in the dorms. It is mainly a commuter school.
College Freshman,1,"When it snows they shuttles stop running, you can not really go anywhere, and it is extremely cold!"
College Senior,1,They help with loans and automatic grants if you're qualified but nothing beyond that.
College Sophomore,1,"It's cold & snows a lot, but it's in New England so that is to be expected."
College Freshman,1,"There are a lot of students however, majority of the student bodies race is white. Then there is that very small percentage of minorities."
College Junior,1,The girls are all very caddy and immature. No one can handle their alcohol and everyone is slutty. There are some attractive guys but not many.
College Junior,1,Campus is way too strict with signing in and drinking in the dorms. They call the police and there are harsh consequences for first time offenders.
College Freshman,1,"Nothing Is Really ""Unique"" About WCSU – WCSU is a below average state school. It is known for it's JLA, Music and Fine Arts, and teaching programs so if your not major in one of these areas, your wasting your time and social life. The social life at WCSU is awful. There is one club a quarter of a mile away for the Midtown campus and it gets old very quickly. The off-campus student housing or ""Chestnut"" was just named the ""most dangerous place"" in Danbury according to Danbury Police. Patrol cars usually visit several times a night on Thursday as well as through the weekend. Lots of fight and drug deals go on but most students don't care enough and try to get in anyway."
College Freshman,1,"Where Isn't There Drugs? Like any other school, alcohol is always present (just don't get caught sneaking it in or having it in your room). Besides that, WCSU is your typical ""reefer madness"" college. It doesn't matter if it's Monday or Friday, there are always kids smoking somewhere around or near campus. Most recently the new drugs of choice became coke, molly, and extacy. RA's tend to look by it unless your stumbling around visibly intoxicated (in which case you will be transported) but there really isn't any enforced policy to ensure the non use of controlled substances.. So if your into drugs and making stupid choice this could be the school for you!"
College Freshman,1,"We're Pretty Terrible – -besides for the fact that we always loose without fail and people only go to the games to get drunk, there is not a whole lot of Colonial spirit here. It really is a communter school. Not much happens."
College Junior,1,"Grueling Process – Make sure that you do everything in person rather than on the phone. Get a checklist FROM THEM and follow it. Have another person help you with the math, because they can make mistakes. If they promise something, get it in writing. They can ""forget"", and then overcharge your account for $1000. That part sucks. 
Be up on the deadlines, because you get little if any notification."
College Freshman,1,"Terrible Process – I completed my entire financial aid package but when I went to sign up for my classes, I was unable to because I had some outstanding financial aid hold that I did not know about. The school did not notify me about this hold and thus I got screwed out of the schedule I needed. Terrible Process."
College Freshman,1,Most Boring College Town in the Northeast – Danbury has to be the most boring college town in the Northeast. There's 3 clubs about a quarter mile away from the Midtown Campus (the freshman side) and there's always fights and a lot of police patrol; no fun. There is a huge shopping plaza about a mile from Midtown which comes in handy but other than that its a pretty terrible town.
College Freshman,1,"Basically so far I have not used the library's computers because they are so slow, also the tech staff is literally really the most unhelpful people ever, and the wireless works but if there's a lot of activity it slows down, even on my mac!"

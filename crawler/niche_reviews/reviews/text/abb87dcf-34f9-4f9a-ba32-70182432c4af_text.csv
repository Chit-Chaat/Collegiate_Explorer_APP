Alum,5,I loved my experience at Knox College. The campus is beautiful but small so it creates a very intimate experience. I really got to know my professors and I feel like i can still reach out to them as an alumni.
Senior,5,"I had no issues besides a lack of motivation on my end. I had one professor only meeting as a class once a week, which was on one hand nice as far as managing time goes, but also annoying because...I'm paying for classes. I made straight As."
Freshman,5,"I loved Knox, but they don't allow students to branch out. I felt that they micromanaged everything I tried to decide for myself. While I appreciated guidance, it was not always what I needed."
Sophomore,5,I love that it has a very diverse student body but I think that the administration and the staff could do a better job of interacting with the students. I love the facilities and the importance that it has for everyone on campus. The traditions and the extracurricular activities are also very welcoming and interactive with the campus throughout the whole year.
Alum,5,I loved my experience at Knox College! The professors are amazing and so is the campus! I have absolutely no regrets about going to Knox and I really believe the college changed me for the better. The faculty and staff really care for you and it really is a tight community.
Alum,5,"Knox is a special place, and while some discover that it's not the right fit, I continue to be amazed at how many Knox students and alumni speak so passionately about this prairie college in isolated western Illinois.  Fundraising is up.  The endowment has increased.  Much-needed changes have been implemented: Alumni Hall, which stood desolate for decades, was finally renovated and put into use; the beautiful new Whitcomb art building means that CFA (Center for Fine Arts) is now no long overcrowded (admissions, which also used to be in CFA, is now in Alumni Hall, I believe); and finally--finally--the eyesore that was the science and math building has been rebuilt (this formerly gray slab of a building was erected in 1970 and looked it!).  Knox is on the rise finding itself on the radars of more and more students."
Junior,5,"I look back at my time at Knox College and I truly believe that I would not change anything about my college experience. Knox offers its students something unique: the chance to be around people with extremely diverse backgrounds while getting an amazing education. The small class sizes allow students to truly get to know their peers and professors. Additionally, professors deeply care about the success of their students. I have met so many wonderful people at Knox College that have truly become lifelong friends. I could not imagine myself attending any other college. Knox has altered who I am in the best possible way."
Junior,5,Love Knox! I felt at home the minute I stepped foot on campus and have loved it here ever since! I love all the people and have received a great education here!
Freshman,5,"Knox is a diverse campus that has allowed me to delve deeper within my self, and get a better understanding of others around me !"
Freshman,5,"I am currently a first year at Knox and my first year has been going well. I really like that Knox is a small-sized school because of the classroom sizes. All the professors I have had have genuinely cared and wanted me to succeed in their classes. The professors are also very helpful inside and outside of class. Even though Knox is a private school, it is very affordable and I have received a lot of financial aid and scholarships that have made it possible for me to study here. Knox is also very diverse and its a very welcoming community. The campus is also very safe, I have never walked unsafe when walking back to my dorm even late at night."
Freshman,5,My experience at Knox has been very unique. Everyone here is so friendly and wants you to succeed. The professors are amazing and will be there to help no matter what. The small school culture brings about opportunities that you will rarely find a large university and gives you a home away from your own.
Senior,5,It's a great school.  Come here if you want happiness and life long prosperity! The student body is friendly and always ready to help.  They are smiling and joyous to be there!  I have enjoyed my four years to the fullest! <3
Sophomore,5,My time here has been well spent in getting to know a large portion of the community.  It is always fun having class with someone and building a friendship outside of that class.
Freshman,5,"Knox is an amazing place to be. There are always free events for students happening through Campus life. Every professor is incredible and genuinely wants their students to learn. This campus is diverse and everyone is so accepting of gender identity, sexual orientation, cultural and ethnic differences, etc. Knox is also extremely helpful with financial aid."
Alum,5,"I may prefer Knox's previous slogan, ""Freedom to Flourish,"" but calling Knox a ""Human-Powered Experience"" really gets to the core of the Knox... thing. I'm a tour guide here, and what I tell my ""tour-ees"" is to choose their school based on the people. Because it doesn't matter what building you're in, or what the weather's like, the moments that change you in college are the ones where a professor holds you to your best, challenges you to pull something out of yourself that you didn't know was there, or when another student takes the time to call you out on a character flaw, always in a loving way, or helps you put the pieces back together when you inevitably have that ""first year breakdown."" Knox is a school that understands, on a fundamental level, that these kinds of experiences are the ones that really develop a person into the kind of adult they hope to be. I really can't say how grateful I am to have come to Knox, as the campus seems naturally set up to help you... flourish."
Senior,5,"I've loved my experience at Knox. I'm from the East Coast but quickly fell in love with the open Midwestern campus, the sounds of the trains, and all the people here. Knox is truly great because of its people: the professors who really care about what they're doing, the students who are all super involved, and the staff who make the place run smoothly. I love the Knox student body because they always speak out against anything they see is wrong with the administration or with campus. While I can get a bit stir-crazy in the winter and have had my fair share of boring afternoons, Knox and Galesburg are really what you make of them. If you get involved, you'll suddenly have more to do than you could have ever planned, and have friends from all corners of the world and all walks of life."
Sophomore,5,"Small School, caring instructors, great campus, good food, lots of academic help available, They provided me with a tutor when I was having trouble with my math class"
Alum,5,"Small liberal arts college in small-town Illinois. Great academics, modest greek life, passionate professors. Great well-rounded education."
Senior,5,"Knox College has been the best decision I could have made. I have learned so much about myself and others and I cannot think of a better place to go to school. The atmosphere is small, which is great for classes and getting to know professors. Somethings that I would like to see change are the cafeteria and the athletic facilities. The cafeteria could offer healthier food and more options. The athletic facilities should be updated and I would love to see funding allocated equally. Overall, however, this school is an amazing choice for anyone who is looking to grow and to learn more about themselves and the community around them. Also, if you like community service, Knox is the place!"
Sophomore,5,"Great student to faculty ratio. My biggest class was general chemistry which had about 20 students. and my smallest class was my calc class which was less than 10 people in it. It is really diverse in Knox college. many of the students are international students, and we have International fair where all international students and non-international students get together and enjoy different culture time. Its great."
Alum,5,"Knox College is a place for anyone and everyone to flourish! I would not change one thing about my experience at Knox. It quickly became my home, and when I graduated I left a piece of my heart there. The professors all loved to teach and cared about each individual student. They made sure that you got what you needed out of each course and made the most of all of the oppurtunities offered to you at Knox. I know one thing that set my experience apart was studying abroad in Besancon, France. It was the most amazing time of my life and a great learning experience that would not have been the same without our Knox professor and my incompaprable Knox friends. I would encourage anyone who wants to broaden their horizons and develop themselves to apply to Knox!"
Freshman,5,"I like that the campus has a lot of green and the people are extremely friendly. However, the food is not that awesome. But overall Knox is an OK college."
Sophomore,5,"After my first visit to Knox, I found myself in the campus bookstore crying. I was overwhelmed at how much I felt at home in Galesburg and at Knox. Now as a Sophomore at Knox, I can still say that I made the right choice. The academics push me to be a better student, and the professors genuinely want the best for me. I have made deep connections with staff, faculty, and students. Had I gone to a different school, I don't believe that I would have the great relationships like I have at Knox, or would I have the academic system that not only pushes me to do my best but exposes me to a variety of perspectives that I hadn't even thought much of. The opportunities for study abroad, research, internships, and volunteering seem endless. The college doesn't want students to just sit in a classroom for 4 years, but to get into the real world and apply our learning.  I highly recommend coming and visiting the school for yourselves and see the history, the classes, the environment in general."
Senior,5,"I've thoroughly enjoyed my time at Knox. Coming from a big city I was a bit unsure about going to school in Galesburg, but I've found home here and I think you can too. Knox is a place where you'll get out what you put in, both academically and socially. Diversity is a buzzword you will hear a lot in the college admissions process, but here you can actually see it. Never imagined being friends with people from all over the world--its a really special experience.

The institution is not without its share of faults, but there's a healthy culture of self-awareness among students and faculty with regards to the school's shortcomings."
Freshman,5,"Knox College is home to me. Professors know you as a person, an individual. Knox wants you to be a part of their community."
Sophomore,5,"Knox thrives in connecting students with a world of opportunities. The small campus and community setting allows any student to pursue any interest or ambition as long as they are willing to put in the work. You can put together a beautiful resume in four years at Knox, perhaps not so much at a larger school."
Freshman,5,"I love Knox! Academics and activities are excellent. It would be nice to have some updated dorms, however."
Sophomore,5,"The classes here are challenging, interesting and require a lot of effort and time management.  The terms are very short, which means that breaks are very spacious, but a lot of content is jam packed into each term per class.  Being a student here is a lot of work.  Even so, faculty try their hardest to make sure every student can succeed.  There is tutoring, social services, clubs, sports, financial assistance, etc.  Essentially, you will have to work hard, but there is full support here for while you are at Knox and extreme preparation for your future after Knox."
Sophomore,5,"I love the diversity here. Knox is a place that will open your eyes to the world in one setting. It's impossible not to become an open minded person after just one term of attended Knox.  The campus and beautiful and people are beyond friendly, not to mention the 100% dedicated professors!"
Freshman,5,Knox is an amazing place to be. Everyone here is just so diverse and you will always learn something new. Classes are awesome and very challenging and you can totally keep yourself so busy !
Junior,5,"Knox College is a wonderful place for people to really find themselves in a community of close-knit people. From day one you find people you can connect with and activities that interest you. Even though the school may be small, you are a somebody to not only your peers but the professors and staff as well. You are able to create a personal connection with your instructors who are very knowledged in the subject area. No matter where you go at Knox, as long as you put yourself out there, you will find something for you."
College Senior,5,"Greek life at Knox is extremely inclusive which makes for a great experience. As a woman in sorority I have found that its a supportive environment  meant to give you more opportunities. In many ways these organizations function as a way of connecting you with philanthropy, academic resources, and a wide range of people with different interests. It's also very popular for students from out of state because it can offer them an extra support system. Being in Greek life doesn't effect anything else. Most people have a variety of friends both in and out of Greek life and it does't matter. The presents Greek life does have on campus is a result of the fraternity houses, which host a lot of registered parties. As a woman I would feel completely safe going into almost any of the fraternity houses on campus in any state."
College Senior,5,"It's been a really amazing few years here. The faculty and stuff really care about the students and I have found amazing mentors as a result. The student body is very diverse and extremely supportive. When students are unhappy with the way things are working at Knox they fight for change and the college is remarkably responsive to it. The leadership and club opportunities are also outstanding. Academically is it rigorous and its much harder to get onto the deans list at Knox then many schools in the country, but I really appreciate that."
College Junior,5,Our school has been provided with their own building which both the students and athletes can use without any prior knowledge on how to use devices for rigorous workouts. Students are very involved in all sports on campus due to the overwhelming team spirit and support that the school has for the players.
College Freshman,5,so many of all kinds of people. its good.
College Freshman,5,"You will get a job if you work hard. The alums aren't the famousistest but they are successful.


FEW PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BECOME FAMOUS. BUT SUCCESS CAN COME WITH HARD WORK AND DETERMINATION AT KNOX."
College Freshman,5,"It is a great school with motivated kids and motivated teachers who work hand in hand with each other to learn and explore topics of their liking. Dick Blick started here. Recently, a Knox alum was given the position of president at the shed aquarium. It's a small school and there are good and bad people here. You will find your group if you just look for them. Do not be so sad. Don't let first term discourage you. Everyone wants to transfer after first term, then by second term, everyone wants to stay.

A grade stuff here"
College Freshman,5,yup. deal with it. you know what youre getting with galesburg. dont be sad that its small and poor. explore hard enough and you will find great food and interesting people.
College Freshman,5,"Do not be opposed to joining a frat in fear of it's assumed ""rapiness"". Greek life at knox tends to be mostly safe and good-hearted, while I have heard of some questionable things happening. Greek life can be amazing."
College Freshman,5,"Really a great school. The professors care so damn much about the education of the students. At Knox, there are friends that everyone can identify with. There will certainly be people that you don't like here. Don't let that sad fact discourage you. If you keep and open mind and put yourself out there, you will definitely find awesome people."
College Junior,5,"I like to say that I found Knox by accident while I was searching for the best schools for Creative Writing majors. My main concerns in my college search was a long distance from home, study abroad opportunities, financial aids, and Writing programs. Knox was on the list all right, but I didn't intend to look through their website until I accidentally clicked a link leading to their page. Since then, I've been attending the school for the past two years and am now declared in Creative Writing as my major and a minor in Japanese. I'm still currently hoping to add another minor in Spanish this coming year as well. After studying abroad with a Knox-offered short-term program during this past winter break, I would have never had the opportunity to discover the possibility of studying abroad for the next year via three different programs that Knox has close ties with. I want to think that everything I have done, every class I've taken, every professor/advisor I confide in has led me to taking the next decision I make in my Knox career. Maybe I would have had other opportunities at other schools. But I'm here now. The Knox experience has really given me the ""freedom to flourish"" in allowing me to take these opportunities, from study abroad to courses I would have never considered or have been able to take at other schools."
College Freshman,5,"Knox College is an amazing place to visit and although I haven't started classes yet I've visited campus and sat in on a class, which I found very enjoyable and enlightening. The admissions office was also very personable and helpful with my admissions process, as well as coordinating my visit, answering any financial questions and getting to know me."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm in a sorority and I love it; it's one of the only reasons I've stayed at Knox. Some frats are better than others, but only because they're better, not because they're inherently good. They all have way too many sexual assault trials against them, and they all have issues with being on sopro (social probation) where they can't throw parties. At least one of the frats does haze, even though Knox claims strict anti-hazing policies. They are all so different as organizations, honestly, and only a few are typical frats. Sorority life is amazing, though we can't live in the house."
College Sophomore,5,"I came to this school because of the copious amount of scholarships they gave me. Seriously, they'll dole out money for anything."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Academics were great here. I had a number of engaged, memorable professors. Almost all instructors have PhD's in their field and you never get adjuncts or grad students. Small class sizes, interesting subjects, and a nice Trimester system. The best thing about Knox, bar none."
College Sophomore,5,"I don't drink...seriously. And I really am not a fan of dealing with people who do but campus safety has made the right decision in regards to handling drinking on campus. Kids are going to do it but safety has made sure that if you are ever in trouble you NEVER hesitate to call them. They are kind and helpful and they are not lying when they say your safety is their first concern. If they catch you drinking and it's severe you'll see a dean for the first offense. I do wish they offered more alcohol education throughout the year; they talk about it at orientation but it needs to be addressed more. Despite this I have never felt pressured to drink on campus; people are respectful of that decision. 

It is worth noting that breaking the honor code is a deal here. Don't cheat, because students will turn you in and you will suffer huge academic consequences that may include expulsion. Honor code violations are dealt with by the honor board system which is made of mainly students."
College Senior,5,"I've honestly come to love this school more and more, the longer I've been here. I've gotten excited about projects that my professors have helped me find. I've been pushed out of my comfort zone multiple times and whilst it's not too pleasant to begin with, I eventually see that's a learning experience and I'm grateful that they don't let me stay in my box.

I've also really enjoyed some of the volunteering that I've done as an Orientation Leader, and as a lunch host. Similarly, I've really enjoyed being a tour guide and ambassador for the admissions office because even though I can be shy these are all opportunities for me to push myself and open up by talking to various people.

I'm really glad I chose Knox and I would definitely choose it again if I had to. There are just soo many things that Knox has made possible for me. I switched my majors to the one thing that I had thought I could never do, music-vocal performance, and Knox gave me that.."
College Senior,5,"My group of friends couldn't be more diverse, we have lots of internationals (myself included), multicultural (2ng gen Americans from other countries), Americans, gays, bisexuals, and a know a few trans people on campus too. I have a few friends who are well off and others who came as emancipated minors and are paying their own way through college without the help of their parents. Most importantly, we don't hold any of this against one another. In fact, we celebrate and very open and free and joking with another about some of these things.

I, a gay black male, have personally never felt any kind of discrimination or prejudice towards me and I know my friends love me for me, I have lots of straight friends as well as gay, no group bands together."
College Senior,5,"I honestly feel really safe on campus, and the school is very transparent about what happens so I've felt paranoid that it might be worse than I think, from what they say. There are emergency phones in and on the outside of basically every building and if one ever felt the need to be escorted home, campus safety does provide that service. In the winter you can even get a ride and escort, rather than just a walking escort (we have a very small campus so we mostly would just walk). Campus safety can reached 24/7 and they do respond promptly and if there is some kind of emergency involving alcohol or drugs, students are given amnesty and their safety is made the most important issue in those situations."
College Sophomore,5,"While we haven't had a new building built in decades (up until October 2014, when Alumni Hall will be finished!!!), our facilities are pretty nice (except for 5-Name and the Aux). CFA, the Gym, SMC, Post, the Library, and Seymour are all absolutely lovely, and many are getting various forms of renovation over the next few years, if I recall correctly."
College Sophomore,5,"I would say one thing that seems unique to Knox and makes it lovely is the ability to create your own major or minor. Just the whole academic freedom is great, even moreso when you realize that while you do have this freedom, that doesn't mean they're just sending you off blind, you WILL get guidance and help in molding your education to your specifications."
College Sophomore,5,"This school has changed me and my life so much, and all for the better. It's only been one year and I've gone from a cripplingly self-conscious social wreck of a quiet, antisocial recluse with no ability -much less desire- to make much of myself in terms of leadership or individuality to a confident social badass who's taking control of the reins of her life. It's great. And I have met such wonderful people here (students, professors, alumni, staff, and faculty alike), and I have had so many opportunities I feel would not have been so welcomingly available to me elsewhere."
College Sophomore,5,"From my experience with other college dining options, I am very happy with what Knox has to offer. We have so many general food options, but then so many specialized options too. If I decide one day that I'm going to go vegan, it's pretty easy, and there are many options for that. And we have comment cards, upon which we can suggest new food entres, new drinks, new anything really, and the Dining Services people are lovely and receptive to these comment cards, often offering a trial run of a potential new dish."
College Sophomore,5,"The students here are so interesting, and so incredibly passionate about what they love. What they love happens to be an incredibly diverse combination of everything, and no matter what random thing you pick you're bound to find a Knoxian who loves it."
College Sophomore,5,"Our actual sports teams really are not good and we do not win things often, but we have a lot of spirit, and we have a lot of fun, and it seems generally agreed upon by everyone that that's what's important when it comes to school sports. 

Our intramural sports are lovely, too. I am a member of one, and it has been the best group of people I've had the pleasure of meeting, and my team has become my family, and this type of thing is common."
College Sophomore,5,"My financial aid was my saving grace and is the reason I can attend this school. I applied for many of the scholarships offered by the college, specifically. I did receive some scholarships, but in addition to that I also just received college grants based on financial need, enough to have me happily attend this school. The process wasn't at all a hassle, I got what I wanted, but even if I hadn't, I hear from other students that it's rather easy to get a bit more money in aid if you call and ask."
College Sophomore,5,"Our Greek Life is pretty nice. It's big in the sense that you recognize the Greek groups, and you recognize their parties, and many go to their parties, but it definitely isn't something like ""Either you're Greek or you're nothing."" There is little pressure to join Fraternities or Sororities, but the option is always available and welcoming --so welcoming, in fact, that many people I have known who have been staunchly against the idea of Greek Life have considered or actually joined, without an ounce of regret."
College Senior,5,"The Greek life at Knox is unique and very positive. It is an inclusive community and if you are interested in joining, chances are you will find a group that is right for you. I am constantly amazed at the diversity of Greek life- there is really no ""one type"" of member- all races, religions, ages, and personality types are included. There are 6 fraternities and 4 sororities. The fraternities have large houses that the members can live in. The sororities do have houses, but they are small and used only for meeting spaces, not living. This makes the Greek members very integrated on campus- all Greeks are also friends with non-Greeks and vise versa. In order to go through recruitment, students must have been on campus for at least one term (so freshman recruitment happens Winter term). GPA requirements also apply to specific groups."
College Senior,5,"Knox has a very flexible curriculum that allows students to design a 4-year plan that makes sense to them. Rather then a bunch of general education requirements that all freshman take (which is the model at most colleges), Knox students have core areas that they must complete a class in before graduation. Within those areas, however, students get to choose from a bunch of options to find something that is still relevant/interesting to them. For example, as a music major I will fulfill my science requirement by taking Physics of Music rather than sitting through Biology 101 as a freshman that will never be relevant to me again. There is only one required class for all students to take (Freshman Preceptorial) and the rest of the four years are up to you! Students complete the graduation requirements in an endless variety of ways by picking and choosing classes a-la-carte to best fit them."
College Senior,5,"The administration is involved but not stifling. Alcohol policies are just the same as the law, so any students over the age of 21 are allowed to have alcohol in the dorms. Underage drinking is monitored for safety but campus safety officers are certainly not out to get anybody and often become involved just for safety reasons. Protests, demonstrations, and visitations are not regulated and left up to student discretion. Attendance in classes is left up to the responsibility of the student and the leniency of the professor. Creating a new student organization is very easy and encouraged- new clubs are added every year. The honor code is extremely enforced, both by students and the administration. Students take the honor code very seriously because we appreciate and respect the trust that the faculty and administration have in us."
Junior,4,I love the students and the professors. The campus is very green and pretty. The party scene is alright.
Senior,4,"Great professors in the English department, albeit a bit zany. All the professors that I have had have been very understanding of ADHD accommodations as well as mental health issues. The school has been struggling in the financial department for a while, leading to discontent among students who, like any other human being, don't want to pay an arm or a leg to study. Many financial decisions seem rash. Diversity in the workplace is also an issue, with the majority of faculty being noticeably white."
Sophomore,4,"I recently took online classes with Knox. And due to the corona virus the classes were very different and not having that one-on-one learning or in person learning experience is not very ideal. However, Knox professors did a great job with making sure everything ran smoothly as possible."
Sophomore,4,"Somethings I like about Knox are how comfortable and relaxing the campus is, the Knox staff and faculty are always willing to help, and how students are always given the opportunity to be put in each others shows and look at the world in a new lens. If I had to change something I would change the amount of emergency call poles on campus."
Senior,4,"Knox College is a phenomenal institution, but it does have its disadvantages. There is vivid rascism on campus from both faculty members and students. Little has been done to resolve this issue. Other than that, Knox has great academics for the most part."
Junior,4,I'm really struck by the friendliness and the openness in the campus. The city of Galesburg has seen better days before NAFTA and PNTR with China. But the folks at Knox College and Galesburg are trying their best. I'm really looking forward to joining Knox this fall for their excellent creative writing program. Cheers!
Junior,4,"What I enjoy most about Knox College are the professors and the departments. If it weren't for the professors, I really wouldn't be as knowledgable as I am now.  The academics make up for the food!"
Freshman,4,I love the people and environment at Knox College. I wish there were more scholarship opportunities.
Freshman,4,"This experience as overall been very good, however I have had some issues. For one there is issues with my dorm buildings, as I am in one of the oldest Freshman dorms, there ave been times when tap water has been unsafe to drink, and we lost lights on the stairs for a month. Another thing I have issues with is the food. I once had under-cooked chicken served and I struggle to find food I look. Though this is partly because the Hard Knox Cafe tries to make vegetarian and vegan alternatives as options and I cannot eat them and I try not to eat beef which is a common meat served. I love the campus life here though with ow most of the time there is something to do but be warned about how many first years do party on weekends and most late night activities on Friday's and Saturday's are party related and that is rather annoying. Another thing that Knox does well are diversity and inclusion."
Freshman,4,"The school is quite small and located in a small town so you may find it boring sometimes. However, it is a very good place to study especially for international students. Cultural diversity is promoted. It's a small school but there are so many nice people. Professors are very friendly and supportive that students can access easily."
Sophomore,4,"Knox is a great college with engaged faculty members and a diverse and active student body. They foster an environment for its students to thrive through experiencing a multitude of different clubs, work opportunities, and a wide range of academic programs. The faculty are there to help you succeed, and while the small size doesn't foster amazing athletics, sports are still relevant and are one of the many ways in which students express themselves. It's a good place to get a good higher education."
Freshman,4,"Knox has a beautiful campus and lots of squirrels. There is a large focus on sustainability and the campus is always working toward becoming more sustainable. The classes are small and the professors are invested in teaching. They care about their jobs and about their students. There is a club on campus for everyone, whether they enjoy ultimate frisbee, music, community service, or meditation, there is a club for them."
Senior,4,"There is nothing particularly special about Knox on the surface. The campus is small and looks better in the summer than it does in the winter. Old Main (Knox’s oldest building) is the backdrop to the famous Lincoln/Douglas debate where the former president leapt from the window. Other than that, Knox claims home to a small city surrounded by cornfields. Attending Knox was the best decision I’ve made. In every class you take, your professor will know your name and care about your academic success. There are various clubs and activities. The people on this campus are friendly and proud. The library is gorgeous. The cafeteria food is average but the pizzeria nearby has amazing $5 pizza for students on Thursdays. It’s only when you look closer at the Siwash is when you understand why Knox has existed since 1837 and will most likely continue for many more."
Sophomore,4,"I really like the people that make up Knox College. From the friends I have made to the professors who inspire me to learn more, the people of the college are the best part. I would like to see the living areas improved, as that has probably been the worst part of my time so far. The rooms seem to have all sustained damage and it is typically too hot in the rooms."
Sophomore,4,This is a very good school with many opportunities available to every person who steps foot in campus. Classes are fast but professors are there to help and teach what needs to be known
Freshman,4,"Knox is an amazing School that prepare students for the world that lies ahead of them. Although they have an okay dorms and campus, they try to ensure that every student feel safe in their respective space."
Sophomore,4,I have made amazing friends here and feel so comfortable. The professors are truly invested in your academic careers and want to see you succeed. I feel like I will be prepared for the workforce when I graduate.
Sophomore,4,"The professors and staff on campus are amazing and extremely kind and helpful. You can always find someone to help you with anything that you need. Knox is also very diverse, i met people from different corners of the world and Knox does a great job at giving a voice to everyone. There's always something going on on campus so you don't really get bored and there's a lot of opportunities to get involved on campus and in Galesburg."
Senior,4,"Knox College has been a great decision for me. The intimate class size and the dedication of professors to help the students really reflects by their commitment. Although the extreme weather is not my scene, I'd chose Knox all over again if I have to."
Freshman,4,"As a first year, Knox has been such a wonderful fit for me. My professors are so attentive and caring, they’re like a second family."
Sophomore,4,"I like it here. The community here is great, a lot of great people to hang out with and do things with. The town isn't a highlight but there are a couple of fun spots to go and eat at. There is a big international community here and that plays into the type of people that you meet. The food is not great, but the community makes up for that."
Freshman,4,"Still early to make full considerations but thus far the experience has been very good. Encouraging atmosphere, quality instructors. Eclectic student body . Any type of personality should be able to find their group."
Junior,4,I love that all faculty and administrators genuinely care about students are willing to work with them on just about anything. You don't feel like 'just a number' here.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore at Knox College. I really enjoy attending this school because it is a small four year prestigious institution, which is what I was looking for. I also think that I am getting a great education and experiences with being an adult. However I don't like that Knox claims to be so very diverse when in reality it isn't. I hope to see more diversity in the student and faculty populations in the years to come."
Sophomore,4,It’s a good school. I like my classes and the professors are supportive. I fee like Knox is my second home!
Junior,4,I am from overseas but a US passport holder and I LOVE Knox. There's a lot of diversity in the student body and you will never get bored with your classmates. Everyone is open-minded and loving on campus. The students are focused on each other's success which creates a refreshing and welcoming campus as well as academic program.
Junior,4,"I chose Knox because it’s an institution that’s centered around teaching across a wide-range of curriculums alongside the vast racial and ethnic identities that emcompasses the student body. This institution has equipped me with the essential tools in understanding its diverse perspectives, and has challenged me in ways I never thought possible. The diversity at Knox has driven me to think more creatively on viewing issues or problems that I’m not as familiar with in a setting that acknowledges various opinions when making decisions and or evaluating different issues. I’ve also become more self-aware in learning from individuals whose backgrounds and opinions differ from my own. By being self-aware, I’m able to share my experiences with people that may have had the same experiences as myself, and I’m also able to learn about others experiences that may differ from my own."
Senior,4,"Knox College has a great sense of community and amazing professors. However, the food and residential housing are below average."
Sophomore,4,So far at Knox College it has been a very good experience. Although Knox does not have strong athletic teams but academics and campus is amazing and totally worth the money. I would recommend this school to students who are looking forward to major in Creative writing or arts as our school has a lot of emphasis on these two majors.
Freshman,4,"The overall experience of my first two terms at Knox College has been very nice. It is a very welcoming and proactive environment, students are trying to make change happen around campus. Many students are very expressive of who they are, so they are also accepting of others. A downside at the campus is that it isn't very handicapped accessible; there are a lot of stairs in some of the older buildings, and the ramps are steep."
Freshman,4,"I like diverse and friendly environment around the campus. Professors and students are helpful. With lots of things available to do in the college, it’s good to spend 4 years of one’s life away from hectic city."
Junior,4,"Knox is small and it allows for everyone to create actual networks of support. When I was a freshman first term, I had already found the places in which I would fit in and be supported. I made the Center for Teaching and Learning my home because it filled my up with potential and motivation."
Sophomore,4,The academics at Knox are challenging however the Professors try to help the students learn instead of memorizing for an exam. Knox operates on a trimester system so classes move really fast. A student can begin an intro class and by the end of the year be taking an advanced class.
Freshman,4,"I really love the small environment and how easy it is to get involved and truly feel a part of something on campus. There are endless opportunities, you just have to take advantage and there are great perks and benefits even on such a small campus. The people are awesome and you can always be yourself and find a good and true group of people to be with. the housing and food have a bit to be desired, but the educations is great with professors that have been around a long time and truly care about the students."
Sophomore,4,"Great place love it! Board is to expensive to taste only okay. Parties are nice, there is something every weekend and a scene for everyone. Ranging from small close friend group parties to larger ones where a lot of people come."
College Junior,4,"Greek life at Knox is very different from the glamorized stories and stereotypes portrayed through media. At Knox, Greek Life focuses on inclusion and service. While sorority members cannot live in their houses, Greek life remains popular. Fraternities and sororities work together to bring members from all different backgrounds together through whole-campus events."
College Junior,4,"While the athletic facilities at Knox College need some improvement, the atmosphere is extremely supportive. I think my favorite part about Knox Athletics is the community. Every team on campus supports the others by going to games, making signs and cheering their hearts out. The fan support has grown significantly due to past and current successes of many sports."
College Junior,4,"Growth of character

Strength of academics"
College Junior,4,There are quite of number of students who go on to Peace Corps as well as Americorps. For those who really are goal-oriented and strive to be greater there will be nothing to stop them and Knox helps with the programs it offers with Alumni.
College Junior,4,"I think the challenge with Knox is that there are only 3 months to learn a whole subject and exams come quickly as they go which can blindside you. You may have up to 2 different ""midterm"" exams and then a final exam maybe 2 weeks later. The professors expect a lot out of you but they also help a lot. There are a lot of tutoring opportunities from the professors and other students as well. Class sizes are small so the professor has the opportunity to know everyone well (if you don't talk to them it's not going to happen)."
College Junior,4,I am in a Greek organization which is extremely popular because it allows anyone to join (Alpha Phi Omega). There is a lot of community service that happens and many members in APO are double Greek.
College Junior,4,"It is a small community so you get to know the majority of the school and those you don't know, you have seen around. The professors are great—the ones I've had at least—and are available through office hours, after and before class as well as through email. Knox uses the email system very wisely."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are quite strict but fun at the same time. They are willing to help you either during office hours or after class. The workload is manageable but still quite pressured at a time. Overall, there are many courses being offered."
College Sophomore,4,The school itself is full of diversity. Everyone being open-minded and accepts each other's opinion. Its rare to see college students being so open-minded.
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are the best dorms I have seen, and I've visited a lot of colleges."
College Freshman,4,"When I visited the school, a student told my group that you can be in the gym while the teams are working out or practicing that is pretty great considering I work out when ever it's convenient for me."
College Sophomore,4,"Knox gives a lot of opporunities to their students which can be seen through the many emails they send out about job opportunities and internships, and advisors often recommend students to go visit the career center."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of things that Knox could do better on, such as dining and the issue of Title IX, but overall, Knox is a welcoming school with academics that are not only challenging but diverse and aimed at diversifying one's ideas and beliefs. What makes Knox great for me are the people I have met who have become my support systems. As an out of state student, I was very much overwhelmed with the whole idea of making new friends and building a support system from scratch. The people I have met here are wonderful, quirky, individuals who, though they may seem so different from me, share many experiences, tastes, and morals as me."
College Sophomore,4,"Academically, I love my school. It's great to know that if I ever need help on a specific subject, I have so many resources that I can turn to for help. I feel motivated and supported to do well in class, and I have never even skipped a class! Even on my lowest days, I still aim to do well."
College Freshman,4,"I have not applied for a part-time job or an internship. However, the career center on campus always send out emails about internships and push the students to look for what internship they want. The career center also provides mini interviews with the students to give them more experiences to handle the interviews. I have not been to the other schools but I do not think many schools like Knox have a career center that truly care about the students."
College Freshman,4,"The professors are always there. They rarely take days off, only if it an emergency. They always make sure that everyone participates and understand the contents. The workloads they give are challenging, but they do give students some breaks when near midterms or finals. Since my cousin told me about his bad experience with his professor, I realized that not every school have professors like professors at Knox that truly want their students to learn and success."
College Freshman,4,"Whenever there is a suspicious activity, the students would report to the campus safety right away. Then the campus safety would send out emails about the suspicious activity after they contacted the local police. They also patrol the area to make sure things are okay. I have not feel threatened when living on campus."
College Freshman,4,"To be honest, I have never thought that I would love to live on campus more than in my own bedroom. Although living on dorm comes with responsibility and independent, I was able to see myself handle my own schedule and get things done. It is kind of bad that I did not want to go back home because I will miss my dorm room."
College Freshman,4,"Knox College is a great liberal art school that help students to success in getting their education. Knox College was generous enough to give out scholarships when MAP funds were on edge of being taken away. If it was not for Knox, I would have no idea how to get the money to pay for the tuition. Also, since the school itself is small compared to other schools, it is easy to participate and contribute to the community. Knox also have many traditional events that make college a great experience, such as the one and only Flunk Day at Knox."
College Sophomore,4,"Knox students are very diverse in the activities they participate in. It is not that one club, sport or activity is bigger than another; however, all activities are attended and enjoyed equally"
College Sophomore,4,"My school is a liberal arts college. Therefore, students get a little bit of everything. Students have a diverse spectra of education."
College Senior,4,"I am not involved in athletics at Knox but we have some strong programs, including club sports and intramural. Students get really excited to go to games and support the teams. In recent years both the Men's and Women's soccer teams have really excelled. This is also true of the Basketball teams. I know the Baseball team was really strong when I first started here and it's started to show its ability again. The club Frisbee team is really big and they go to conferences often. Campus life in no way revolves around athletics but students do really enjoying support each other. The coaches are also pretty well loves. Especially the swim team coach Johnathan Powers."
College Junior,4,"I really enjoy the fact that classes are generally small and that the professor knows when you are actually struggling. Some professors even take the time to see how you are doing on your work by including meetings with them in the syllabus.

I'm also a fan of the variety of classes that are offered here because for those who may not have a sound idea as to what they want as a major or minor, it offers plenty of classes that can help a student find out exactly what they want to pursue a career."
College Junior,4,"The housing process on campus is relatively easy. You are given a list of places you can live and based upon what you may be looking for in a home, you can pick a home that is relatively close to your classes. However the necessity of a laundry room is very important, and unfortunately not every living area has one. Sometimes students may have to go to another building to do their laundry. Although that is not to bad, it can be stressful taking big piles of laundry back and forth. 

The atmosphere of the college is very natural and vibrant because there is a nice conventional spot where you and your friends can converse and enjoy each others company. It's very common to see students talking in the grass with one another or outside of the Gizmo area eating and enjoy the weather."
College Junior,4,"Greek life is very prominent in the school, but it doesn't overtake the other social clubs outside of Greek life. Many people are indifferent about Greek life, but enjoy the company of the Greek members. Greek life also thoroughly care about their members and are always looking for ways to support their college and town community, while, at the same time, creating bonds among members. Personally I think Greek life is a great thing to have, but because of my financial situation, joining would be expensive for me."
Alum,2,Knox advertises itself as a small liberal arts school that will always go above and beyond for its students but I found this to be completely untrue. The cost of tuition makes no sense considering how little opportunities there are on campus for classes and for internships/ valuable experiences.
Alum,2,"I'm an alum of several years, and I have to say I was disappointed in Knox. Knox always seemed to be increasing the number of students and decreasing the number of resources in an attempt to make more money. Dorms, classes, and the cafeteria were all overcrowded.  The faculty and staff were overworked and underpaid, and they took it out on the students, who they complained were a bunch of brats from the suburbs. There was lots of nepotism, which limited accountability. I was disgusted by the administration repeatedly trying to silence rape survivors while I was there. I will say I had very qualified professors, though a few of them had poor attendance records, and the administration did nothing. Knox's sole career adviser gave me materials 20 years out of date and told me (as she told all humanities majors) to be a teacher or librarian (useless). My Knox degree wasn't worth much more than the paper it was written on, so now I'm in grad school at a much more quality institution."
Sophomore,2,"Dorms are grimy and old, food is tasteless, environment is like a zombie apocalypse, wifi is like my great grandmother crossing the street. Basketball team and football teams are terrible. only good thing here is the academics and the amount of care professors put into your education."
Sophomore,2,"I am actually transferring from Knox College to Regis University.  The academics were great, but that's about the only think I liked.  It wasn't a very clean setting, no assimilation between the athletes and general student population, the administrators did their best in difficult situations but regularly fell short.  I'm sorry to say that Knox can be a moderately sufficient 4 years as far as getting an education, but you can get just as good of an education at another institution and have a much better 4 years.  It isn't surprising that Knox struggles with retention."
College Junior,2,"I feel relatively safe on campus as a male, but I know when it comes to female students on campus they, usually, do not. Female students are constantly cat called by people driving by, and , sometimes, are approached directly.

 Also this year a female student was physically harmed by a man who did not live on campus. This further demonstrates that more safety measures have to be called upon for the students.

Another incident that occurred was the breaking in of students dormitories. I believe as a school there are many things that we need to change so that the student body, specifically the women on campus, are as safe as a man would feel."
College Freshman,2,Most of the teams on campus are garbage. The soccer teams are pretty successful in their conference but they've yet to make a splash nationally.
College Senior,2,"Places go really fast. Off-campus places are not advertised enough. Also, there are not that many places to choose from. But, when they do happen they are great."
College Senior,2,"Off campus there are really good quality private restaurants available, though they are costly, but there are not many options. Everything closes fairly early, and you're stuck with fast food chains mostly."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Health services is run by some Catholic organization and will not give women information about abortion access. Sexual assault victims have it rough, Health Services is only open M-F during business hours and there's no easy way to get to the local hospital."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The sports teams are all really bad, the athletic complex is fine for a DIII school."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Galesburg is a very poor, bad town, so the options are few and far between. There are some decent bets downtown (Budde's Pizza and Baked mostly), but otherwise mediocre American Chinese, chains, fast food, etc."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Knox has higher rates of alcohol abuse and depression than comparable schools and this is reflected in the party scene. Fraternities throw very bad parties where sexual assault and alcohol rule the evening. Bars in town are mostly bad and full of townspeople. Many people get together with friends and drink and use drugs, which is probably the best option at Knox. People certainly don't attend for the party scene."
College Senior,2,They do not help students look for scholarships outside the school sources.
College Sophomore,2,"This campus is very lacking in diversity in political beliefs. There is some ethnic diversity with the international students who mainly come from China and Nigeria. The diversity in economic background, race, and religion are average."
College Sophomore,2,It's hard to find any off campus housing and anyway it's too far away.
College Sophomore,2,"Only public transportation is few small buses which only come once in every 30 min. Life is hard without a car. Few restarents are in walking distance, but crappy. Only shooping place for girls is walmart, target, or thrift shop. Oh yeah, and Amazon.com. I wouldn't have survived without it. They have old but quite decent thratre in downtown."
College Sophomore,2,I spend my whole year on the campus but seldomly met attractive guy
College Freshman,2,Students like smoking outside on campus n sometimes in the dorms.
College Sophomore,2,Hot when its hot. Cold when its cold
College Sophomore,2,Better if they weren't there
Niche User,1,"The only way to describe the people who attend this school? Angsty middle schoolers who incite drama with oversensitivity to the drama they themselves start. Petty, ridiculous, and immature."
College Sophomore,1,I could care less about the greek life on campus. No one is genuine
College Senior,1,"There are that many parties that are registered during the term and when there are they are pretty bad. You never go into a party with full knowledge if it will be good or not. Then, with those private parties, you never know if they will be shut down or not."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Galesburg is a very poor town with nothing to do. The locals have a very bad relationship with the students (this goes both ways, students never do anything for the town and the townspeople will heckle students)."
College Junior,1,"Most teams do not have winning records. The coaches are not the greatest and it leads to a lot of frustration. A lot of the student body are athletes, but there is lack of good equipment and the coaching is subpar for most sports."
College Sophomore,1,Less Than Adequate – The best restaurant we have close buy is a pizza place called Alfono's that sells stuffed breadsticks. Second to that is Wal-Mart and then the dollar store.

Junior,5,"Very fun and lovely, students are friendly and professors and advisors are always open to help. Ready for my Spring"
Junior,5,With the switch to courses being online to met the precautions with COVID19 the professors have been engaging and encouraging interaction in the course through online class meetings which i have enjoyed.
Freshman,5,My overall experience with University of South Florida is an excellent one. The university aids in the overall development of a student in many ways. They have many resources to offer. One of the main advantage at USF is that that has many organizations for the overall development. Organizations range from cultural to professional development.
Freshman,5,"For this semester, all my courses are online. The university uses various platforms to deliver its courses and keep a track on that. The main online resource is Canvas and Microsoft Teams. For homework, we used WebAssign and Achieve. The exams are online with the help of Proctoria. Proctorio prevents students from cheating."
Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful and has so many resources to offer. I've met a lot of people and we're very inclusive.
Alum,5,"USF has an amazing culture where excellent teachers are combined with a vast array of resources to help ensure student success. I absolutely loved my time at USF and will be returning in Spring 2021 for further studies. If you're a veteran like me, it is one of the best schools in the country for Veteran support."
Alum,5,I had an excellent experience with professors communicating and assisting with online coursework. The course layouts are clear and concise and tailored to help you navigate easily.
Junior,5,"I took 2 semesters online so far, and planning to take more online. I think the experience is good and the teachers definitely try hard to work with you on understanding even without being in the classroom."
Graduate Student,5,The University creates a conducive environment for learning potential whilst promoting an active and creative lifestyle.  The staff is attentive to the needs of the students and the learning material encompasses a brought spectrum of the world's best literature.
Alum,5,"USF has a variety of programs - from academics to extracurricular to sports to groups of faith. There was always something to do!  They've recently added newer dorms that look amazing! It's a beautiful hub and you have everything you need at a close distance. I did not have a car throughout my first three years, and that was not a deterrance at all. Overall I felt safe and had a great experience."
Alum,5,I took several courses online with a range of self-pace to structured. The professors are very aware and respond promptly to questions.
Niche User,5,"I do not attend USF, but I would love to in the future. The energy of the students are great and the campus is very nice. It feels like home."
Alum,5,"Most of my major was online. USF is a great school for online classes because a lot of the majors are hybrid or all online. During 2020, its an asset to have these systems already up and running."
Freshman,5,"I like the students. I also like the atmosphere, everyone here is nice. All the office workers are helpful. I like my classes."
Freshman,5,The teams meeting are flowing nicely and all my professors put a lot of effort in their classes. I like my classes.
Junior,5,The online courses offered at this university are better than I have experienced before. The professors record lectures as well as assign readings so you can have some sort of teaching.
Junior,5,I enjoy USF the only thing I would change is offering more online classes for the psychology major. Instead of the limited amount of classes that are offered online.
Freshman,5,"I started there over the summer, of course it had to be done online. I was very respected and appreciated all the help I got. I still get assistance from them over emails and over the phone since my fall term is also online. I admire all the time they took to make our experiences easier and better even with everything going on."
Freshman,5,"The university makes me feel welcomed. They show compassion, kindness, and love. The way they care about their students is being comparable. I truly appreciate how I have been received and contacted even with the pandemic. I never got the chance to actually go to the university and talk to an administrator but I received phone calls and emails asking if I needed any assistance which I truly admire. I never feel like I am wasting my time with them, I believe they are a family and now I am a part of that family."
Freshman,5,They have adapted great during COVID! Some classes are hybrid but the majority of classes are online this semester. They also make you take a COVID survey test that clears you to be on campus.

Junior,5,"Through the pandemic, USF really did their best in accommodating live classes to doing everything remotely. They used platforms like Canvas and Zoom and Microsoft Teams to do everything and made it easily understandable."
Junior,5,I loved how at home it made me feel. The advisers and the professors really make you feel helped and like you're not in this alone. USF offers many opportunities to get involved on campus and I really see USF as my second home.
Freshman,5,Great school! So many resources for students and the campus is beautiful. Staff and faculty were friendly and helpful to me and my family. This a great school for everyone.
Freshman,5,This is my freshman year and all of my classes are online. The online platform was a little difficult in the beginning but I was able to figure it out. The professors are very helpful  and stay in communication with us often.
Senior,5,"I have taken many classes virtually with USF. My current degree program is entirely virtual. My instructors are phenomenal and very helpful. They are always easy to contact and very personable. The school uses Canvas for our class portal, it is very easy to navigate! The school also provides you with the software you need to keep your devices up to date to ensure you are able to access everything you need!"
Senior,5,"I began attending USF in June of 2012, just two weeks after I graduated high school. I started at the St. Petersburg campus. I absolutely loved it! They did not offer my intended major, so I transferred to the Tampa campus and earned my BA in Interdisciplinary Social Sciences with focuses in Communication Disorders and Psychology. I couldn't stay away after that, two years later I re-enrolled at the Sarasota Manatee campus to earn another degree; BS in Communication Sciences and Disorders. USF to me means, you stay forever! The faculty and students make this university an outstanding one. Go Bulls!"
Junior,5,"University of South Florida has always been my dream school. I did everything I possibly could in high school to guarantee my admission to University of South Florida. Ever since I have stepped foot on campus just to get an overall view of the campus, I felt so positive and driven to thrive and achieve all of my future career dreams at USF. It has an amazing pharmacy program that has sparked my interest as a pre-pharmacy student and it has always been the university I have seen me succeed in the most. I do not have any thoughts or opinions towards needed change as I love every aspect of the university."
Junior,5,"USF's canvas is very organized and it is very easy to navigate through for each class. It provides a calendar for all upcoming or and current classes, all assignments that are due in bullet points, and a very organized tab to search through your syllabus, help from the professor, and so much more. Since the recent pandemic of Covid-19, I was afraid to do my pre-pharmacy classes online but now that I am able to see exactly how it is panned out on the canvas, I am very confident that I am going to do great online as much as I would on campus."
Senior,5,The teachers have been really helpful and understanding of the recent changes to online.  They have taken feedback and made adjustments to the class as seen fit.
Graduate Student,5,This school is full of diversity all on campus which I think helps many people get out of their comfort zone. USF also has so many resources on campus that it would be hard not to add things to your resume because there are so many things to get involved in. All of the teachers and TA's are very helpful its just up to you to actually reach out if you need help.
Senior,5,"Everyone that I've met so far were welcoming to me including staffs, students and professors. The environment is always clean and smells fresh. The professors always make sure that a person gets the topic to help them move forward and get good grades in there classes. The foods are delicious and everyone is nice to each other no matter the race or ethnicity."
Senior,5,"I’m currently in my last year at the University of South Florida majoring in Public Health while being on a Pre- Physician Assistant Track. I love the student involvement on campus as I am part of two clubs I’m very dedicated about. Some changes that I wish could be made are more food options that are accompanying to people with various allergies or lifestyles such as vegetarian, dairy free, soy free and keto."
Senior,5,I have taken some online classes for my major and feel that I have been lucky to have some amazing professors who take an interest in the subject and really want to help you succeed. I do wish that online classes would include the materials necessary in an online format since some materials are on back order or not readily accessible.
Sophomore,5,"All my professors have adapted very well to online teaching and have made it easier for the students as well. Though it is much harder to do labs online, our TAs are very helpful. There are designated times; like office hours. You can set an appointment up with your professor or teaching assistant so they can answer your questions."
Sophomore,5,"I love this university! There are so many opportunities to get involved in the Tampa community and provide service to those in need, while building unbreakable bonds between peers in your same career path. There is something here for literally anyone; from Greek life, organizations for any and all cultures and religions, organizations for every major, and many many more! I personally got involved in the Judy Genshaft Honors college, Muslim Student association, and Medlife. There are many positives to being apart of the wonderful USF build community."
Sophomore,5,Although I’ve only been enrolled here for one year my experience overall has been very good. From the available activities to the dorms my experience was great!
Sophomore,5,Most of the teachers are actually competent in teaching an online setting. The funding as well as the time given to the teachers and faculty during these times is handled very well.
Sophomore,5,"The University of South Florida has truly amazed me with its many involvement opportunities and welcoming atmosphere. I am currently a Nursing Major, and chose this school based on its many opportunities for those seeking a degree in Health Care. USF offers many volunteer opportunities between its 4 on-campus hospitals and is really dedicated to student success and involvement! I have made so many solid friendships at this school, and have been blown away by how amazing USF has been for me. The campus is also so beautiful! I have loved this school so much that I applied and was accepted to work as an Orientation Leader, and I can say from experience it's just as great being an employee of the University too. I feel so blessed to welcome new Bulls to USF!"
Junior,5,Professors previously record lectures and attach those to powerpoints so you can listen as well as read what they are teaching.

Alum,5,"Went here for 4 years and it was amazing. I got my BSN here and I wouldn’t do it anywhere else. USF has so much to offer such as a large campus, multiple events, free items, diverse population, restaurants and stores on campus, bussing system, etc. I felt that the environment was safe, a great place to grow and thrive and a place to connect with others. There was always something to do while I was here and I never felt bored! It was a stimulating experience and healthy experience. I loved my experience so much, I plan on coming back at some point to further my education! I really cannot stress enough how great this university is. I really recommend this university!!"
Alum,5,"Online classes were not hard at all. Professors were available if you needed to talk to them via email or in person. They were very quick to respond (1-2 days). Otherwise, I don’t have much more to say on it. The classes were fair and quite standard for online classes! Maybe even easier in my opinion. I would’ve taken all my classes online but I truly enjoyed the campus life so I opted out on that!"
Junior,5,I have had the best experience attending USF so far. The resources to exceed are amazing and so are the professors.
Junior,5,"USF gives gives the most college vibes you can think of. Couldn’t imagine going anywhere else. All students are friendly, and the staff is always caring."
Junior,5,The platform (canvas) was easy to use and the professors made it feel just as rewarding as in-person classes.
Junior,5,"The application process, to the advisors, the courses and the scheduling was all a seamless and supportive process."
Junior,5,"University of South Florida is filled with diversity and uniqueness. There are always resources if a student is in need, and there’s always opportunities to get more involved on campus."
Junior,5,"My online learning experience with the Unviersity of South Florida has been simple, manageable, and has allowed me to stay involved with the school."
Niche User,5,I am a high school senior and attended a tour. Everyone was so welcoming and informative to me! Very much will be applying!
Niche User,5,The website was ver organized and informative as well and provide multiple opportunities to me. Very accessible.
Senior,5,Very welcoming atmosphere. I feel very safe on campus which is an important part to getting a good education.
Senior,5,"While I initially had some difficulty integrating into the hustle-and-bustle of a large university setting, I fell in love with USF for its beautiful and spacious campus, its multicultural diversity, and its overwhelming support for its students.

I had access to student counseling and support services, essential care at the student health clinic, the Feed-a-Bull food pantry, free meal swipes at food courts, financial aid, free scanning + PDF technology at the USF library and access to its course reserves (which saved bundles on textbook costs), and much more.  I am so grateful for the generosity of the university, without which I would not have been able to finish my education.

The professors at the School of Art and Art History were amazing, and I could not have asked for better.  At USF, I received a well-rounded education in the arts, having been encouraged to experiment with different approaches to art-making, overcome my hesitation of critiques, and create polished work."
Senior,5,"The online courses navigated a range of subjects using the Canvas learning platform. Weekly assignments were manageable, even with a full course-load and a part-time job. Online instructors were regularly in contact with students and provided excellent feedback. It was easy to contact instructors through the Canvas messaging system, which connected to their school emails. The built-in file and media upload system was one of the most useful features of Canvas. Discussion panels allowed student to publish and edit content. The layout was light, easy to read, and well-organized. Submissions for essays were automatically synced to Turnitin, which dissolved the need to use an external website to check for plagiarism. Canvas had some of the best integrated quiz software I had ever seen, and there was never any lag or accidental drops in connection. Outside of Canvas, instructors used mobile-compatible apps like Microsoft Teams, Skype, GroupMe to stay in contact with their students."
Graduate Student,5,"Most of the faculty are truly interested in helping the student. It is nice to experience advisors that care about getting their students graduated, as opposed to needlessly make students jump through hoops."
Alum,5,I loved the atmosphere of the campus and how everywhere you went on campus you felt safe. I would recommend this University to any student looking for higher education.
Alum,5,The professors I had were always diligent about answering any questions or concerns while using an online platform.
Alum,5,They had an effective online course when I attended.  They kept everything on Blackboard and used online classrooms for live lecture.
Alum,5,I liked the flexibility the school offered.  There are multiple campuses and offer a wide variety of majors that are highly rated.
Junior,5,"Being a transfer student can be very daunting. However, my transfer process with the University of South Florida has been nothing but great. Along the way, I have been helped by advisors who take a great interest in students and helping them reach their highest potential. The community atmosphere at USF is one that is inviting and welcoming. Before I transferred, I was assured that I was already a Bull, even without walking on campus. I am excited to see where my journey leads me while attending USF and I hope that those who have an interest in the university takes advantage of their opportunity."
Junior,4,"There has been a lot of hiccups with online learning, but overall, the professors have been easy to work with. Minus one star because they use Microsoft Teams which has tons of issues, and that online learning is still not fully functional here."
Junior,4,"Very diverse college with a lot of great professors. However, parking can be a bear, and the campus can be daunting. Highly recommended for social science students and those looking for a diverse community with tons of opportunities."
Junior,4,"So far, I’ve had a pretty good experience with USF. I haven’t been as involved as I would like to be, and once COVID started, it’s been extremely hard to get involved. I lived on campus my first year and then lived back at home for my remaining years. I live in Tampa so the commute is not too bad. Campus life is fun and there is always something to do, but I’d much rather live at home because that is my personal preference."
Junior,4,It has been a nice transition from working full time to returning to school full time. everyone I have met has been friendly and helpful.
Junior,4,"Unfortunately, for this semester I had to drop a course because the professor could not figure out how to use the software to give a live lecture. Other than that, my other professors have been excellent. They’re proficient with the technology and have been able to give lectures and make sure that everyone understands."
Junior,4,"As a transfer student it has been difficult to adapt to this uni seeing as it is huge! It been a great school so far. Staff is helpful, although at times they’re not really cheerful. You will get to meet a lot of people if you integrate yourself and join clubs and associations!"
Freshman,4,I took all my classes online except when I go into my chemistry lab every two weeks to do experiments. The class is limited and divided into groups.
Alum,4,"Overall, I liked the University of South Florida. It is a bit hard for minority students to find their niche, but once you do, it is a great school. However, the school isn't as diverse as it claims to be."
Alum,4,"I did take classes online, and they were very easy to pass. The professors were easy to communicate with and easy to talk."
Freshman,4,"A lot of ways to get involved virtually for first-year students during the 2020-2021 school year, professors are very understanding and helpful when it comes to the assignments"
Alum,4,The campus at USF is beautiful and there are a lot of resources there for new and current students online and at the MSC building. The classes were challenging yet engaging and fun whether it was online or in-person.
Alum,4,I took most of my courses online. I do prefer online classes and all the professors I had made sure that we had a community and space to discuss with other students. I enjoyed the discussion posts the most. Most of the online courses were more relaxed.
Sophomore,4,"Most professors were good at presenting the material in both a small classroom and a large one. However, I’d like to see the teacher engage more with the students in both classroom settings."
Senior,4,I like the mellowness about my campus. Its not very crowded and the class portions are a nice size. I always feel heard by professors and enjoy the classes USF offer.
Graduate Student,4,"The online learning experience was effective in that this medium of communication was flexible in light of the current pandemic. The lecturers were effective in communicating the information and assignments via the online platform. The online interactive between fellow peer groups and lecturers was also very active and informative. However, the concern regarding practical courses was of concern."
Sophomore,4,All of my current classes are online! My professors are also only online and at times it is difficult to understand them over a screen. I do know they are trying their best and it's a technical error. Most of my experience so far is positive.
Sophomore,4,I liked how they are ready to help you and provide opportunity. My professors are very understanding of our current situation (the pandemic). Other offices/buildings are somewhat bad at responding to emails and calls.
Junior,4,"My online experience at USF has been 85% good I think. USF teachers like to use Microsoft Teams which disagrees with my laptop, unfortunately. I have a class that does class participation through iClicker. Most of the students have had issues with this app where it'll time out because it has a timer. We can't see it, but the teacher can. If we're in the middle of typing a response it will close and the teacher can not reopen it. There is no other way to make up the class participation despite being present. This has had an effect on my online experience at USF. Other than that everything is great with online learning. Make sure you can stay focus and can police yourself on due dates."
Junior,4,"The University of South Florida has been very good to me this year. Everyone is friendly and caring. The teachers can be a bit strict with how they grade, but most are very understanding if undesirable situations happen to you. As long as you inform them that something is going on they'll work with you. The campus is large and beautiful. The food options on the campus are plentiful. They even have a grocery store on the campus which is amazing. I haven't attended any parties yet due to Covid-19, but I'm sure they were fun the years prior. I can't wait to gain more experiences at USF. Go Bulls!"
Niche User,4,"I do not attend USF, but friends of mine have mentioned that the online learning experience isn't too bad, although they do wish to be on campus again."
Junior,4,"a large part of my university experience has been online based. due to the nature of my degree which is technology based, i do have a lot of online class options. most teachers handle the format well while others don't seem to understand the different approach needed in terms of assignment construction."
Junior,4,the university of south florida is a great quality school. there are a great variety of available classes for lots of majors. there is no shortage of groups clubs and other activities on campus. the dining options are not to bad either.
Alum,4,It is a beautiful campus! It's much nicer than the other Florida colleges view wise. I  recommend living on campus at least one year. I  wish I took advantage of living on campus more than I did. The gym is the best part of the school I  think.
Senior,4,I have had my share of online courses and I am just very glad that I've had the privilege of having some very understanding and compassionate professors. Some of my TA's however are absolutely terrible. If they were my actual professor I would rather wait a whole year than take a class with some of them.
Freshman,4,"Teachers are very forgiving for getting used to online classes and most are easy to contact. With Covid, the school has taken a lot of precautions including having more online classes."
Freshman,4,It is a very accepting community. There's a lot of clubs or activities where you can meet new people. They also have a wide range of majors or minors. Go Bulls!
Sophomore,4,"It was a fairly decent and average experience, they provided what I expected which was great. However, if you know that you'll do better learning in person then this is highly ill-advised."
Senior,4,"It has been great. Most of the teachers are amazing , but some professors are not good at explaining/teaching and just confuse you."
Graduate Student,4,The online learning experience has been I think the best that it can be. There are only so many resources that you can get only online. I do not feel that it is the schools fault. The online learning experience overall will have to be very time consuming compared to learning in person with your peers. I think it depends on the type of learner you are.
Sophomore,4,It has a very wonderful campus all the people there are so nice. Also if you have a learning disability their Students with Disabilities department is very accommodating and willing to work with you.
Senior,4,I haven't taken any online classes at yet but based on the responses from friends I can comfortable say that it will be great. Professors help in anyway they can.
Sophomore,4,"USF is very diverse with a huge number of international students enrollment. Therefore, it gives me a chance to learn from other peers who come from other countries and have different cultures."
Sophomore,4,I have experienced online learning at USF and it was very good. The professors from all my online courses were very caring and responsive to students needs.
Sophomore,4,"I ended up taking all of my spring semester courses through USF online after the Corona Virus came. I can say that the online experience that you have through USF definitely depends on your professors as well as your own willingness to stay on top of your work. Online classes in general are not easy for me, but the professors that I have had are good about communicating with students about their expectations and are quick to respond to emails if you ever need help! It will just be on you to reach out. Also, professors generally decide to make the class self-paced if it is online (in my experience) which is nice if you're looking for that independent learning style."
Freshman,4,"My online learning experience was pretty good overall. The only negative I have noticed since switching to virtual learning is that some instructors/professors are not the best at responding to emails in a timely manner, which can be difficult without the availability of face-to-face meetings."
Freshman,4,I love being a student at the University of South Florida! There are so many great events on campus (pre-COVID) and a lot of opportunities to advance both academically and socially.
Sophomore,4,I love the campus and how big and open it is. I also really like the selection of food and restaurants on campus. There are so many different places to sit on your own and be undisturbed. There aren't too many things I would want to change about it.
Sophomore,4,"I've taken several classes online with the University of South Florida and my experience has been pretty good. My professors have been very pleasant and helpful, despite never meeting them in person."
Sophomore,4,"I decided to go to the University of South Florida mainly due to the fact that I could live at home and attend class, as well as the fact that the state of Florida offered generous scholarships to students who remained in the state. Once I began attending USF, I immediately took a liking to the many positives of the university. Most of my professors have been passionate, willing to help, and understanding. The campus contains a lot of resources that I have made use of for classes here on campus. The students are very diverse, with plenty of opportunities for international students to come over and study. Everything works at least at a satisfactory level except for the online class system. The online system can be buggy and confusing to navigate, even if you are familiar with the sites used (canvas). Personally, I had to drop a class last semester due to the online system messing up assignments I had submitted. Despite the online system, USF has been a great opportunity for me."
Alum,4,"Online classes were strait forward and manageable, convenient as a commuter student.  Professors were responsive.  Obligatory message boards were not always the high of educational conversation."

Senior,4,"Ability to take my classes online has allowed me to work while supporting myself through school, which has been a necessity for me"
Graduate Student,4,"I had one very poor experience, and one excellent experience. My excellent experience came from a writing professor. I was studying abroad my final semester of college and needed to take this writing course from USF, so I took it online. His instruction was concise, helpful, and very comprehensible. I typically enjoy in-class teaching better, but I don't feel like I missed anything through this online writing course. I don't remember the professors name, but he ended up being one of my favorite teachers - which says a lot considering the nature/alienation of online courses."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy attending USF it was one of my top choices when selecting a college and I do not regret my decision. I have had a lot of great experiences here so far!
Senior,4,"I loved the teachers, the campus, and coursework at the University of South Florida. However, the transportation situation needs to be improved. The parking passes are really expensive and for someone who works full time and is only on campus twice a week felt like it wasn't worth it at times. It is still very difficult to find available parking, I personally feel like for how much we pay to park there it shouldn't be so difficult to find a spot."
Freshman,4,Very large campus with many things to do in ones down time. Great with general education classes for transfers.
Junior,4,"Overall, this University offers a lot in terms of academics, especially in the medical field. Also, is a great area with lots to do and people to meet."
Junior,4,"Online learning isn’t for everyone, but the university of south Florida has made online learning a better and safer way to interact and learn."
Junior,4,"While I have yet to take a class because I am a transfer student, I would have to say that my required pre-registration courses on Canvas helped me to get aquatinted to the school and learn more about it. Courses such as Academic Integrity and Plagiarism helped to show me the school’s stance on such matters and helped me to appreciate just how focused the school is on being an honorable student."
Sophomore,4,"Taking a few classes online was very easy, the online format is easy to maneuver and you can easily reach the teacher for additional support."
Senior,4,The University of South Florida is a wonderful experience. The professors are nice and will work with you; they care about their student's success. The courses are well structured and the campus is beautiful.
Senior,4,The online courses at the University of Florida are very well structured and easy to follow. The PowerPoint and video lectures made learning easy.
Graduate Student,4,My online learning experience has been good. My professors still make it known that they are available for any students who need help learning the material. Most of my online classes have either live virtual sessions or pre-recorded sessions to watch at your own convenience. My professors promptly respond to my emails regarding questions on course material.
Freshman,4,"The online experience is very good given the circumstances, The administrators are there to help and they are very attentive"
Freshman,4,The campus is really beautiful and has a lot to offer. There are more than plenty of clubs and activities to get involved in.
Sophomore,4,"As a pre-med student online is not ideal but it was doable. I do not recommend it but in this current climate, I understand if it is mandatory. Labs and chemistry will be difficult but for the most part everyone did well."
Sophomore,4,"I suffered a little from the education online, as I prefer the teacher to interact with students in the session as well as to him
Methods of attracting attention and the ability to focus, but I missed all of these methods in videos that were unable to attract my attention for a long time"
Sophomore,4,"Shift to online classes was not so hard for me. Online classes made me realize that I need to be organized and manage my time properly. As I had face-to-face classes at a specific time, during quarantine it changed, consequently it is important to properly organize your time. Generally, it was a great experience to try online classes because I know I will need to take them during my summer semester in the USF."
Freshman,4,I have taken 3 in-class courses as well as 1 online. I have had a great experience with both and the professors are very helpful
Freshman,4,I am only a freshman but my experience at USF has been very well so far. There is a variety of clubs and organizations to join to maximize the experience as well as classes
Senior,2,I currently take 3 classes online and its been challenging. I learn much better in person and the online learning hard hindered my grades.
Senior,2,"All classes are online. Depending who your professor is he/she will take their time to explain course materials so that you would understand but others don't.  I would recommend to do some research on the professor before you take their class. Online classes requires student to do more work to keep up. However, the good thing is that it is you can do classes anywhere and it save travel time."
Senior,2,USF changed their policies for transferring grades from another school. They do not accept credits from other 2 year college when it comes to the engineering field. I would like if this policy would change for the better.
Senior,2,"For classes which are intended to be online, there is an alright experience in terms of how much I learn. The classes just aren't very engaging, but there is an effort made in terms of the use of discussion posts. However, for classes not originally intended to be online it is truly horrendous, which is to be expected, but it is worse than I thought it would be."
Sophomore,2,"Personally, I have had the most issues with online learning at USF. While I am not a person who likes online courses, I did take some both semesters last year, especially when all of my classes got transferred to online due to the current pandemic. I had listed my grievances due to online in my “overall experience” review."
Niche User,2,The professor is fine but the resources are severally lacking. It's really hard to get access to help.
Senior,2,"My experiences at USF have not always been the best but this semester has demonstrated a concerning level of inconsiderate behavior against students. 
My work-study grants are continuously lowered midway through the semester. This has occurred during multiple terms. I applied for a COVID grant and the money was taken out of my available work-study. For the majority of my courses, much of the material that was given to students was not tested on. Rather concepts that were not introduced were tested on at the level that was expected by the professors. I find myself worrying a great deal about the quality of the professors and it does take my focus away from the course itself. I am disappointed but outside of academia, I have found incredible students that strive to pursue their dreams at this particular school. I feel that this idea should be taken into consideration by the administration as well as the professors that have the honor to educate students."
Senior,2,"Overall, the campus needs improvement. The facilities need to be cleaner, and more updated. There is absolutely no parking on campus, yet we pay $100 for a parking pass. The dining is awful, other students and I myself will not eat there. Professors do not even want to do their job. Just not a good experience personally."
Alum,2,"Quality of classes is poor, large classrooms and not personalized attention, old campus, bad doorms, not great advising offices."
Niche User,2,Very impersonal. Professors often would alter class and test materials day of exam. Very little opportunity to seek one on one assistance academically. Pricy.
Alum,2,"It was an okay school. Really needs better professors that are interested in students education. Needs better organizations, groups  or courses that inform students on graduate life or additional graduate school information. Many don't know where to begin. I was lost after graduating due to the lack of help from outside sources. Advisors were not helpful at all. Most just agree with your schedules and don't try to help you improve."
Alum,2,"I went to USF from 2009-2013 and graduated with my Bachelors in Public Health. I began school as a Pre-Nursing major, however was denied to the nursing program my sophomore year, as were hundreds of other students. I was responsible for figuring out my new major without guidance from an advisor. Public Health was interesting, and I eventually after many years have decided to pursue my Masters. However, that was no help from USF. Upon graduation, there were very limited job opportunities and hardly any assistance or preparation to enter the work force. Overall, for my situation if I had to redo it, I would not attend that school. I know some programs are excellent and students are very academically prepared; that just wasn't the case for me."
Recent Alumnus,2,Every semester there was an email sent out about a sexual assaulted/rape victim. Although we had a police department on campus the hours of operations were not realistic and the school continuously cut back on some of the safety programs that would ensure a student made it home safe at night.
College Freshman,2,"I have lived in Mu hall all semester and its been the worst experience. It is dirty, old, and there are bugs in the dorms all the time."
College Sophomore,2,For a school as big as the University of South Florida the gym is not nearly big enough. Sports are only slightly relevant but not advertised. I have never even heard of when there is a sporting event other than an occasional basketball game and football game. If it was advertised more and people were encouraged to go it would have a better athletic environment.
College Senior,2,"I stayed in the worst dorms my freshman year, by choice, as these were the cheapest. Housing is very expensive on campus for very little reason. Soon, the older housing complexes will get torn down, so once the new ones are built, it may be nicer."
College Junior,2,On campus living was never very clean or spacious the people on my floor were nice but i never met my RA and we didnt have any events.
College Sophomore,2,"Courses fill up fast and class sizes are large. Frequently, classes require permits which makes registration every semester a pain."
College Sophomore,2,"The Greeks are very discriminatory, even though we have our first multicultural group. In my experience, they tend to be very rude and entitled. The Greek area of campus makes me feel uncomfortable and uninvited. The off campus Greeks tend to be very party-filled."
College Junior,2,I do not participate in night life or partying around campus. I know there are some options around campus and different events through greek life that give students opportunities to do so. I know a lot of students utilize uber for transportation.
College Junior,2,Personally i do not surround myself with people who do drugs. i have heard things through conversations that people encounter in these things but i cannot speak on it. There really is no peer pressure if you surround yourself with the right people. Drug use is enforced on campus and there are consequences.
College Freshman,2,So overpriced.  Not kept in the best conditions.  RAs don't seem to care about much.
College Freshman,2,I know absolutely nothing about Greek Life on Campus.
College Freshman,2,"Housing can very extremely depending one where one looks. Prices are fairly low, but sometimes the location can be a bit dangerous."
College Student,2,"Not many healthy choices, and the healthy choices don't look that appealing."
College Sophomore,2,I am a white male without a military parent and so I'm ineligible for almost all scholarships.
College Sophomore,2,Chic Fil A has tons of MSG which is not good for studying and learning at all. Subway is garbage. Einstein is ok but they close early in the day. I haven't eaten at the dining halls
College Sophomore,2,The ability to obtain actual University scholarships is very difficult and I strongly wish that the university would update its scholarship list and make it more accessible for students to be awarded.
College Sophomore,2,The majority of the on-campus housing are rather old and are in desperate need of renovation or an overall rebuilding. The campus has announced that they are currently planning to updating the buildings however until that happens the housing will still be unsatisfactory.
College Freshman,2,"dining halls are horrible, don't even try them. dining dollars gets you the ""quality"" food."
College Sophomore,2,Really not great in dining halls
College Freshman,2,"The dining halls are terrible, and it's very unreasonable that the meal plans are mandatory for freshman."
College Freshman,2,the paperwork is way too tedious
College Freshman,2,"we dont really have a party type of society here at USF. It sucks pretty bad actually, buy Y-bor makes up for it a little bit."
College Freshman,2,The space is very cramped and old. It also isn't kept up the best.
College Junior,2,"There are particular housing units that are very livable - for example, Cyprus Hall and Holly Apartments. However, the Andros section of campus has been infested with bed bugs (something that the University will not recognize) and living spaces are very minimal. I would never recommend living on campus in the Andros section of campus."
College Freshman,2,"The school claims they don't want to ""baby"" us and ""hold our hands"" but in reality it just makes figuring out financial aid very difficult."
College Freshman,2,I do not often feel safe on campus. I am aware that we have police presence but rarely do I feel like it is large or doing a job to protect me. I know if I were to call they would arrive quickly but it is easy to forget that they are around.
College Sophomore,2,"Barely any parties at USF. The most ""party scene"" I've seen here has been the loud, overcrowded cafeteria at 11 pm every single night."
College Sophomore,2,"I live in the cheapest dorm on campus, where there's poor design, dim lighting, and no elevators. However, the more expensive dorms seem pleasant and like the designers actually cared about it. Still, in general it is a very lackluster campus with ugly buildings and poor attempts at greenery."
College Sophomore,2,"Having a problem with my financial aid ended up sending me from office to office, where none of the campus employees seemed to want to be working at the moment. Very apathetic about the students's problems and their work."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek students are barely discussed or seen here. The only time I've actually interacted with a Greek group was when one came to talk at my class and get more people to join. Just not very popular, it seems."
College Freshman,2,Not many people show up to the games because we always end up losing.
College Freshman,2,The town is not a college town so there is close to nothing to do off campus which makes for a very boring weekend sometimes for people who don't enjoy frat parties.
College Freshman,2,I don't enjoy going to parties and the ones that I have been to are not enjoyable. I don't believe that it has a positive impact on anyone.
College Sophomore,2,"I heard the basketball games are fun! but athletics are slacking, students have more spirit for rocky the bull than they do sports...football could definitely improve"
College Senior,2,They are pretty much annoying and stuck up
College Senior,2,advisors are near clueless on most topics in helping students. wish i would have had a mentor in college
College Freshman,2,"I am personally not a fan of Greek Life in general, I find them to be arrogant and they only associate with people in Greek Life. Most non-Greeks don't like Greeks."
College Junior,2,I do not participate in Greek-life. I will not pay for friends. I understand it looks good on your resume but I would think it could also hurt you. I feel that is a total cliche thing to do now a days and a lot of girls and guys think they are better or at a higher standard because they pay money to be in a group. I feel if your going to do something like a Greek-life do it to where you actually get accepted because of who you are not because of how much money you should be putting in.
College Freshman,2,I currently cannot afford my schooling and seem to be looking. Forward to being in debt for the rest of my life. I was a great student in high school and still received almost nothing that's actually helpful.
College Sophomore,2,"Busch Gardens is close and students get a great discount, but traffic in Tampa is terrible."
College Sophomore,2,"Poor communication between StudentLoans.gov and this college. Nothing gets transferred the first time. The people are friendly and act interested in the problems, but problems still exist."
College Senior,2,"The discrepancies between housing options is very bad at USF.  If you live anywhere in Andros, it is the absolute worst you can get.  If you live in JP you are doing pretty well!"
College Senior,2,"Being a finance major is alright at USF.  Its hands off, and from the actual curriculum, nothing applicable is applied.  There a lot of opportunities for internships offered through the school, and I recommend each student taking advantage of this."
Recent Alumnus,2,Poor service. Never answer phones.
Recent Alumnus,2,"No movie theaters close by, rude people bad driving"
College Senior,2,Its too competitive and nearly impossible to get in
College Sophomore,2,"Football isn't great here. I think we won maybe 3 games last year? Not many people go to games, plus we don't have our own stadium - it's about a 25 min drive plus $20 parking. I feel if we had our own stadium things would improve."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Tampa in general just has the most random weather pattern. One day it is raining cats and dogs and I am up to my ankles in water, and the next day it is bright and sunny. This is still something that I am trying to get used to, but if you plan on living in Florida, it is just one of the things that you will learn to accept eventually."
Senior,1,"This school is hands down the worst. Placed in an unsafe and dangerous area with frequent crime, as well as staff you make you feel like they actually don’t want you to ever graduate. Especially whomever you advisor is. They are literally the worst at helping navigate your courses. Stay far away from this school if at all possible."
Niche User,1,"Single handedly the worst institution I have ever worked with. They don't care about you in the slightest. You, as a student, are an inconvenience to them. I tried for WEEKS, to get a single person to call me back. I finally got a very nice student from Tampa, and that's the only person I've spoken to. Every administrator I've spoken to, replies in the most passive aggressive way possible. It legitimately amazes me that people still attend this awful university."
Graduate Student,1,"I had to dispute with the school about an erroneous charge. I spoke to Cashier's office, graduate studies, School of Public Health, and got student council involved. the process took 15 months. Wherever I call, no one answers. I leave a message and they don't respond. When I get hold of someone, they punt you to a different department. Most I spoke to (50+ different phone calls) had terrible attitudes and none of them showed any intent to be helpful (except Ombud and 1 person at Graduate Studies). 

This just shows how poorly run administratively they are."
Senior,1,The people here are mean there is no social life and nothing to do on weekends. We need change now USF!!
Freshman,1,I just finished my first semester and USF and it was the worst 4 months of my life. The classes are way too big and you get no individual attention as a student. It’s like nobody would notice if you weren’t there. The new dorms are horrible and made with cheap materials. All this school does is try to suck money from you for the most stupid reasons. The parking is the worst and nobody listens when the students say this over and over again. I will be transferring to SJU in Philly next semester and can not wait for a better college experience. Think twice before attending USF unless you want to be just another one of the thousands of students. Even the counseling department does a terrible job at responding to clients. This school is a scam and its educational quality is significantly less than my high school. It was a waste of my time and ruined my spirit.
Senior,1,Not good at all. There is litterally nothing to do fun wise. The Greek like is hardly there and the campus is ugly
Sophomore,1,Worst experience ever. I feel like there’s nothing to do. The schools just ok it’s not terrible but it’s also not great
College Sophomore,1,Greek life at this school is horrible. The system to get people to join Greek is so pitted against Greek that no one actually ever joins. Also once you are in Greek the school makes you jump through hoops that take up massive amounts of time and energy instead of helping the chapters grow. Greek life at this school is more stressful than ROTC where you are trained to be a leader.
College Senior,1,"So, from my perspective, I do not like Greek Life in general. I believe it is a terrible practice and do not agree with the Greek Life mentality."
College Freshman,1,parking is way too strict
College Senior,1,Complicated and no one to walk you through it
Recent Alumnus,1,"I was assigned a counselor who does not treat me as a human being. My information was mixed up with someone else with the same name, I was misinformed about the details of my COMP exam thrice, I was told I would not graduate one day before graduation, I was listed under the wrong degree for 3 years, and had questions answered by email with more questions."
Recent Alumnus,1,I've been trying to get a job/internship for months
College Sophomore,1,Takes forever to find nearby parking to your classes. If you're a commuter.
College Freshman,1,The public transportaion is rarely worth it. It is very slow that if you want to get somewhere that bad you ask a friend with a car to drive you there.
College Student,1,You can't find a spot to save your life if you have an S permit. Be prepared to spend at least 30 minutes looking for a spot.
College Sophomore,1,does not give sufficient aid
Recent Alumnus,1,They're more strict about alcohol in the dorms. 
College Freshman,1,Everyone has so much school spirit!
Recent Alumnus,1,the financial aid department is a joke. they have no idea what they are doing. its like they purposely screw with you to make your life miserable
College Junior,1,"Only one professor teaches some classes so there is no way to take a ""better"" professor sometimes. Curriculum is difficult. Registration is fine, the employees who facilitate it are ignorant. Workload is too much. There are plenty of nights where we don't have time to sleep. No special study options. Study areas are few. "
College Junior,1,Everyone I have ever talked to about campus dining gets sick from eating the food. Majority of the time temperature is not what it's supposed to be; tuna melt is cold and cold salad is room temperature. The servers are rude and confrontational. The salad bar is hardly ever stock and when it is it generally has mushy vegetables. The only thing you can get that will come out exactly as you expect is a deli sandwich. 
College Junior,1,"A couple of my professor teach classes in buildings that are on the other side of campus from the area my department is concentrated in. Because of the walk to get there, it makes me not want to go to school on days that it rains. My backpack is a rolling backpack, because my stuff is too heavy, and there is no way to protect it from the rain. "
College Sophomore,1,The parking permits are ridiculously expensive and it takes at least twenty minutes to half hour to find parking.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I'm pretty angry that after being charged quite a lot of money for a parking permit (something I never had to do at SPC), I regularly get to school a half hour early or more and still get to class late because there is no parking.  Often the parking garage is also full (except for the first level which is saved for special people).  I have a job and homework and a life and no time for this nonsense."
College Senior,1,"Parking on the Tampa campus is horrendous.  Unless you get to school early in the morning it is extremely difficult to find a parking space.  The permits are very expensive and you have to renew each semester including the summer semesters. Parking fines aren't too overpriced, but they will fine you for being a minute too early for parking in a different spot without the proper pass or if your pay by space has run out by a minute.  USF has a lot of students which makes it difficult to find good parking after 9 a.m., but if you find a spot on campus you can walk anywhere in just a few minutes."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not enough parking.. To many calculus parking, but don't accommodate the students who pay 100+ for parking which is ridiculous.."
College Freshman,1,"The school overall is amazing,but they have to do something about the parking situation. If you have R parking you might as well park at walmart and walk to campus- you'll at least have a parking spot there. And $90 a semester for parking?? That's robbery."
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is stressful. Not only do they charge you an arm and a leg for the permit, but there is never any parking spaces. I think the cost of a permit is outrageous considering how much we pay for tuition as it is and off campus parking is not an option because most off campus parking is not within walking distance of the university. Sure they have the bull runner, but as a commuter student, I don't have time to sit around and wait for the bus."
College Senior,1,"Parking can be absolutely ridiculous here, the spaces fill up quickly due to the amount students who go here. The pass is very expensive. They've opened a field area for overflow parking which you also need a pass for but its a 10+ minute walk from there which just doesn't seem worth it. Car pooling and busing are not options for me."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is very limited on campus. There are only a few parking garages and only a handful of parking lots, and it is hard to get a parking spot, especially around the middle of the day. To get a good spot, be sure to come early and be prepared to wait for a spot to open up. Also, the parking passes are expensive at over $100 per semester. The parking rules are strictly enforced and it is likely that a ticket will be issued if someone does not park in the correct lot."
College Sophomore,1,I only like hockey. They don't have a hockey team.
College Senior,1,Parking can be such a pain sometimes. It is usually very hard to find parking that may be near your class. I usually have to park on the other side of campus simply because it is hard to find parking and I don't want risk being late for class because I have spent 30 minutes trying to find parking. Decals are pretty expensive too. I don't know about other schools but I defintiely don't understand why decals are in the hundreds of dollars. Maybe thats normal...I don't know!
Recent Alumnus,1,I guess it depends what people you spend time with. I was in nursing school and all my friends were in nursing school also and we had no time for anything except studying.
College Junior,1,It is surprisingly hard to find good looking guys but there are lots of pretty girls who are typically in sororities
College Sophomore,1,Off campus housing at USF is always available. Finding one is't the problem but the having your own privacy is. Most of the housing are affordable but that is if you have a roommate. But someone like myself that prefer to be alone finding a one bed room is more than paying rent for a one bed room apartment.
College Sophomore,1,Always difficult to find parking. The library is the WORST
College Junior,1,"There are simply not enough parking spots for students! And you pay an outrageous amount for a parking pass, and you aren't even guaranteed a spot near your class, let alone in the major parking garages. It is a hassle and you have to come to campus early for a good spot, and if you are running late, you may miss some of your class."
College Senior,1,"Parking permits are expensive and then you will always be hunting for a spot, especially if you are looking at peak times or during the first/last week of classes."
College Junior,1,There is not enough parking on usf campus. Sometimes you have to drive in circles or sit and wait for someone to leave. It is suggested you at least come 30 minutes before your class starts so you'll be able to find a parking spot.
College Freshman,1,For Tampa Florida residence we all know the dangers of living off Fletcher. Off campus apartments get broken into often. you should never be alone after dark either.
College Freshman,1,It was absolutely horrible. I had to go back multiple times just to get everything sorted out and had to go back again after they changed what I had put in for my needs on pellgrant because they didn't listen to me the other times I went in. I have heard of others having similar problems but in my experience this process was the biggest pain I've had so far in college. The only reason they don't have an F is because it did eventually work out and I got what I deserved but if I hadn't hassled them time and time again it would never have gotten done and I would have spent much more money then I had to.
College Freshman,1,"Drinking is a really big deal on campus, and I've already (unfortunately) met a lot of people who do hard drugs."
College Senior,1,"The only positive of the University of South Florida transportation is the Bull Runner system. These are free buses that run all over campus. This makes it convenient to make it from one end of the campus to the other. The negatives include; horrible traffic, accidents, NO PARKING, parking passes are extremely expensive, and inconvenient parking spaces."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking can be an epic adventure at USF. During the day, there is a lot of traffic on campus and the parking spaces are practically non-existant. Parking garages are exlusive to off-campus students, which leaves the regular parking spaces for the taking. The best thing to do is arrive several minutes before class starts."
College Junior,1,There is a parking pass you have to purchase and parking is limited.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Transportation is horrible on campus.  Even though freshmen are not allowed to have a vehicle during their first year on campus, it is horrible getting around campus as this school is one of the highest commuter schools in the country.  The parking situation is awful and there is never enough parking."
College Junior,1,"I dont even have a car, but i hear a lot of complaining about how much it costs to get a parking sticker...and how hard it is to find a parking space if you have a morning class. You should leave an hour before class starts to ensure you have time to get a space."
College Sophomore,1,"In All Seriousness – USF is strict when it comes to campus events especially if safety isn't taken into consideration. All protocol must be followed by students and staff in order for things to run smoothly and everyone's safety be taken into account. They make you have fun and soak up the college life, but vandalism, drugs, alcohol, weapons, and other facets that are deemed harmful to us aren't allowed, and they will not tolerate it."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Criminology Was a Joke – Half of the teachers run there class online by using the cell phones. It's a complete joke. They copy and paste test questions from different schools through out the country.

If you want to go to law school or go the doctoral route this a great way to go it's easy. if you want a  job out of college go to a different school or have a different major than Crim."
College Sophomore,1,"Notoriously Bad – You will most likely not find a spot on campus at USF. If you do happen to find one, you will most likely not have the right permit to park there and they WILL ticket you. I have gotten 3 parking tickets in 2 years and they have a terrible warning system. Also, parking permits are not cheap."
College Freshman,1,"More Hassle Than Help – You must get to class at least 45 minutes before your class starts to find parking. Even if you get there early if your first class is in the afternoon you will not find a spot. Parking at USF is like parking at the mall on Black Friday. Pay by space parking is $1.50 an hour with a maximum of 8 hours. Parking passes range from $90 to almost $200 dollars and if you do not have one...do not park where you are supposed to have one. Even on the first day of a new semester, parking services are strict. You can try and talk your way out of a ticket but it is unlikely. On a good day, with an early class and a permit, you have nothing to worry about, anything less, its like you have to give an arm and a leg to survive."
College Senior,1,In order to make it to class in time you need to be there at least 30-45 mins early.  Some times I even parked at the mall and ride the bull runner to school.
College Sophomore,1,"When I first got accepted last year, I got multiple emails and letters saying that the University was going to offer me scholarships. I even completed a thank-you letter to the donor that was requested of me through writing so that I could receive the scholarship. Then one day, before I started my first summer session, the scholarships they promised disappeared from my online account. When I tried calling to inquire, I was placed on hold for over 30 minutes to an hour. I don't remember what the person said when I finally was able to speak to someone, but I never got any of the scholarships they claimed I had been awarded. I don't know what to suggest to others because I need advice myself. :("
College Senior,1,"Department transportation at USF, Tampa has a price for every thing parking slot on the campus. If you are there first time you have to buy ""day pass"" about $5.00 to park where they allow to you. It does not mean that you will have a spot on parking lot closest to a place/building where you will go. If you park in a way that is convenient for you then you will get a ticket $30.00 for valeting some of their rules. No parking on streets ether. They know how to get money from you and do not care about your convenience."
College Sophomore,1,Parking cost are very high and USF does not offer discounts to multi family users.
College Senior,1,"Business Department Can Be Difficult – The College of Business does not seek to make things easy for students and is difficult with work with. The advisers do not attempt to make a relationship with students and are often quite rude and hard to track down. Most appointment books are full months in advance and wait times can exceed 4 hours. Although the College of Business does better in scoring internships and job opportunities, it does not make up for their lack of attention to students needs in academics."
College Junior,1,"Expense and People – The off campus housing is very expensive and some of the places are not safe to live in, students getting their cars broken into and robbed is not uncommon. For the high cost of living the apartments should have better security."
College Freshman,1,"Not Much of a Party – Unless you go out to Ybor City, proximal to Downtown Tampa, you are not really going to find nightlife around elsewhere. University of South Florida has very strict policies that they thoroughly enforce. Oh, and if you have no car, and being as it may that Tampa is a rather spread out city, well, nightlife will just not be in your agenda."
College Freshman,1,i haven't gotten a single on from USF. All the valedictorians receive all the goods.

Junior,5,"Hardin-Simmons is a feeling of home and self accepting. the classes are small and professors get to know you, instead of sitting in a class of 75. i am apart of the women's soccer team and love every second. besides being d3, they want your best effort and nothing less."
Junior,5,"they did a wonderful job during covid-19 transitioning to online. the professors provided all the information needed for notes, exams and quizzes."
Sophomore,5,It’s a great school!! Lots of loving and kind people on campus. The professors are very passionate about teaching and helping students learn and grow!
Freshman,5,the campus is very nice and feels like you are right at home. You don't feel lost on campus but at the same time it is not too small
Sophomore,5,"Hardin Simmons is a very inviting, and engaging school. I enjoyed my first year here because I was able to get out of my comfort zone in a safe environment. I was pushed to become apart of this community and that is one of the things i think Hardin Simmons does very well. Whether it was social, work or academics, I was always being challenged to be something more than I was when I started. Student Life does their best to make sure students find people and find a community at school. There was always someone to talk to or something to do. In my academics the professors doors were always open and they made sure we knew that. I was pushed to learn and to grow in my views and defend myself on my thoughts. I was never punished for speaking my mind and I was able to come in to the classroom everyday knowing that I was going to learn engage with the material. I worked as a Student Worker as well and that was one of the richest experiences because I got to see the backbone of the university."
Sophomore,5,I love Hardin Simmons because that is where I have met all of my friends! We stay up late doing homework together and talking about life.
Graduate Student,5,"The PT program I'm in has very attentive professors and staff. There hasn't been a moment where my classmates and I haven't been cared for. The program is a complete family, caring for each other and making sure nobody falls behind. The program has a great new facility that stimulates our learning experience. The overall education is top-notch, with our professors being available almost 24/7 to help us when we need it. In addition, the learning environment is something I've never heard of before, with so many resources available for our department to thrive and allow for the best preparation for clinicals and the workforce."
Sophomore,5,"Best university, people are so nice and the professors are friendly and approachable. it helps students to grow their faith in God and serve the community."
Freshman,5,The campus and the way it felt and how it felt like home to me as soon as I walked on to campus. Along with that the way the professors actually care about your success as much as you do and are part of your support system. Campus involvement is something different with event almost everyday it it sure for you to have fun and to get away from homework and grow closer to your fellow classmates and even staff sometimes.
Niche User,5,The environment at HSU is something like I have never seen. When I Visited for a football game day  the environment felt welcoming. i will be back!
Junior,5,The facility and staff really show an interest and care for you. I have learned a lot since going there. They take the time and effort to give you what you need to succeed.
Freshman,5,"Hardin-Simmons is home. I have only been here a month and I have already made friends I know I'll have the rest of my life. Everyone around campus is so friendly and would love to get to know you. The professors are engaging, challenging, and open about their Christian faith, which I love."
Freshman,5,"So far my experience has been great. I have met some great people, engaged in intramural activities. Minus the food and older dorms everything and everyone has been excellent. I would highly recommend this university to anyone unsure of where to go that wants to stay with a smaller school."
Freshman,5,"Hardin-Simmons is a big family and a lovely environment. Though students may feel that the tuition is too high, they make sure to provide financial opportunities to everyone to pay for their expenses. They are also great in sports. I hope one day the school expands even more and we move up the latter from D3 to D2 then to D1. We really and truly have D1 potential and loving hearts for all sports. Overall, HSU is all about family and student life!"
Freshman,5,"Everyone there is so kind and willing to anything to help you do your best and succeed! The campus is beautiful, and most of the professors/staff that I have come in contact with are nice. My program has taught me a lot about my future career."
Alum,5,"Challenging academics, caring and supportive environment. Lots of opportunities for student involvement."
Alum,5,"I love everything about this college. Professors and resources are beyond their pay grade. I really enjoyed running and being a part of an amazing track and field team. In 2016, I had the amazing opportunity of being a part of the FIRST women's track and field team to win the conference at Hardin Simmons University with Coach Rodney Smith, who actually started the program. As an individual of the team, I won the 100 Hurdles in 2016 as well and got a medal. The 2 years I was there was beyond amazing. I did a study abroad with HSU as well and got to live in Central London while studying in the field of Social Work."
Niche User,5,"Hardin-Simmons University is a very cultivating school that will teach students many things , and how to become a better christian is something that is very big at HSU."
Sophomore,5,"The Financial Aid office has really been there for me and helped me in every way possible.  The school having a 12/1 student/teacher ratio is really great, all my Professor’s know who we all are. There is weekly tutoring  available if needed at no extra cost, which is very helpful! The food options are really great in my opinion. The Freshman year FYSM class is perfect for new college students; you get to know other students, the school, they give you pointers on the library and other important lessons you can only learn on campus. The different student committees and groups always have things going on around campus. So you can be active or just hang out and get to know others. **We have our own bowling alley!**"
Junior,5,Hardin Simmons University is a wonderful school. It has such a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Everyone there is so sweet and makes you feel like family.
Sophomore,5,Hardin-Simmons University is like Disneyland to me! I have had so much fun this first year and i’m excited to see what else is in store!
Senior,5,Hardin-Simmons is a wonderful place to go to college. The professors are great and try to get to know each of their students.
Niche User,5,My visit to Hardin-Simmons was simply amazing. The faculty and students were extremely welcoming. They definitely treat you with kindness and respect and want to see you thrive.
Niche User,5,"What I like about Hardin-Simmons is the sense of community and friendless that everyone genuinely shows. I am a transfer student who got the opportunity to go to campus and see how everything works, and so far the transition for me doesn't seem as intimidating than I thought it would be. All in all, Hardin-Simmons is a great university with great people and I would recommend anyone considering on applying to go ahead and do it!"
Freshman,5,"Very thrilling, colorful, and full of energy. Hardin-Simmons is a place where one wishes to find themselves both socially and spiritually. The christian university offers a vast amount of opportunities and activities to explore. Hardin-Simmons is a recommendation for those who pursue their careers not too far from home and to whatever they desire."
Alum,5,"I attended HSU from 2013-17 & I loved being an HSU student!

The class sizes are small so I got to know my peers and professors well. I felt like I could ask questions/reach out for help if needed. I told people that I cared for & known as a student.

At HSU, I felt like I received opportunities that I wouldn’t have at other universities. The student life, athletics, & campus community are great. As a student, I was in several organizations while keeping a job & my studies. Our campus organizations always had events for students to attend. Organizations would hold events that met the needs of every type of student on campus. HSU athletics is awesome! Students & faculty are supportive of our athletes! 

Abilene is a fun city! Abilene has food trucks, bakeries, coffee shops, local restaurants, theaters, dance halls, & more! The community is student friendly & provides free food, discounts, & job opportunities for college students!

I wouldn’t trade my experience at HSU for the world."
Niche User,5,What I liked about Hardin Simmons was the family like atmosphere on the campus. I toured the campus about four times and every time I was there the students and faculty were very nice to me and my family. I wouldn't change anything about Hardin Simmons.
Graduate Student,5,"As a 2017 graduate of HSU, I can't say anything but the best about the school, teachers, and campus life. I transferred to HSU after being at a junior college for two years. My first few weeks of being in Abilene and being around school, I felt very welcomed by peers and staff. Professors truly want you to succeed and do good in class; all while they are creating personal relationships with you. Sports are a very close-knit group at the school. Everyone wants everyone else to do good and succeed. Although I did live off campus in my two years, I enjoyed being apart of campus life through refereeing/umpiring intramurals and other social events. Within 9 Months after graduation, I have found a career in the field I studied and, it was all because of specific connections I made through Hardin-Simmons."
Niche User,5,"I've been to Hardin-Simmons University only 2 times and I loved it both times. The people there are very nice, very warm welcoming and I would love to go to that school and play basketball. I didn't get a chance to eat the food but I know if you are hungry you will eat it. I believe that everyone should go there and it would be a great area."
Freshman,5,"Hardin-Simmons is fun, safe place to attend.  The Student/teacher ratio is low and the school spirit is great.  You have so many different opertunites to serve your community also."
Senior,5,"My education has been enlightened by faith. The professors have challenged my faith in a positive way. They have provided me different lenses to read the Bible with. For student life, it is amazing. They have late pancake study breaks, Christmas parties, and have puppies on campus during finals week. They are genius in how they interact with students by providing them plenty of events to go to and meet new people."
Sophomore,5,"It is a wonderful place to be, and has a very put together campus and society involving students and professors. I suggest everyone give Hardin Simmons a chance, because it will change their life just like it did mine."
Freshman,5,HSU is a small knit school where everyone holds the door for you and and says hi to you on the way to class. Professors want you to excel in their class and will do anything in their power to help you understand the material being thought. Everyone is very proud to wear the school colors and say that they go to/or play for HSU.
Junior,5,It is very community oriented and I love the teachers here. The teachers are very interested in investing into your life on a personal level. The campus is very beautiful as well making it a wonderful place to live.
Freshman,5,"The professors are all so welcoming; they are genuinely happy you are there. The other students are very helpful, and someone is always there for you when you feel utterly alone. You are welcomed into a family."
Freshman,5,The atmosphere and the caring people. Great academics. Coming to Hardin-Simmons University was a great investment for me everyone was helpful and informative. The experience is great and exciting. You have a balance of learning and biblical which provides a great way to ground you in your studies.
Sophomore,5,Hardin-Simmons is a small school where everyone is very welcoming and kind. The teachers are personable and are really there to help you and make sure you succeed both in and out of classes. I chose to come here because it was just the atmosphere I was looking for and it felt like home. HSU really has that sense of community and you're bound to always find someone to turn to for help!
Sophomore,5,"Coming to Hardin-Simmons, I was overall extremely nervous. Even though I already knew my roommate, I was still quite scared that I would not make any friends quickly. Not even entering my second week of college, I was already blessed with having a second family. I've gotten so many opportunities to preform at this school: I was a lead in the fall musical 'The Addams Family', the titular character of the first spring play 'Sylvia', and a supporting character in our spring musical 'GodSpell'. The professor genuinely care about the success of their students and are so willing to help us whenever we ask them to. The atmosphere of the school is so relaxing and it has already become like a home to me."
Freshman,5,Good Enviroment and perfect classroom size for student to learn what is essential for them in future.
Sophomore,5,The greatest thing about Hardin-Simmons is the close-knit community atmosphere! The intersection of faith and education are also a great asset.
Sophomore,5,"When I was looking for a college, I had three top interests on my list. The reason I picked Hardin-Simmons was because the students were more involved and the campus was the cleanest of the three. The main thing I enjoyed about Hardin-Simmons is that there are students leading campus tours as opposed to older staff members. The students were also very kind and I felt like I fit right in here at Hardin-Simmons. 

My advice is to choose a college where you will feel most at home because that college is where you will be spending at least your next four years."
Alum,5,"Wonderful, Christian university with a faith-based curriculum. Located in Abilene, a great college town with many activities and a vibrant student culture."
College Junior,5,All of the academic aspects within the university are amazing! All of the professors are very personable and they care about the student. Everyone is friendly around campus and there are so many options and degrees to choose from.

College Junior,5,Quality of the courses is high. Professors are very invested and passionate about their subjects.
College Sophomore,5,"The school is great in many ways.  I like the campus, the people and the city."
College Freshman,5,The Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity at Hardin Simmons is the best one at Hardin Simmons
College Freshman,5,The Music Department is amazing!
College Sophomore,5,"The professors here are exceptional.  My academic review elaborated more on this.  They are extremely personal and caring.  In my three and a half semesters here, every professor I've had learned my name, and most of them still know it and still greet me when I see them on campus.  I know that if I have trouble in a class, I can talk to my professor one-on-one, and they will do everything in their power to help me learn the material and succeed.  Most of them have an open door that if we're struggling with personal issues that we can talk with them if we have nowhere else to turn.  You are never a student ID number or a test grade with the professors here."
College Sophomore,5,"The academic environment here is exceptional.  All the professors in every class that I've been in, whether in my content area or in core classes, have been experts in their fields with a passion for what they do.  All have worked extensively in their fields before teaching, and many continue to work in their field while being a professor at Hardin-Simmons.  All the professors have a personal care for every student in the class.  A few weeks into the semester, without exception, every professor has learned my name, and will say hello when we cross paths outside of class.  The dean of my department (Fine Arts) knows every student personally, though he doesn't have very many of us in classes.  He knows all of our majors, and what instrument (sometimes multiple) that we play.  Every professor I've had has had very open office hours, and encourage students to stop by, call, or email to talk about class, or just anything in general.  I have had several professors give out their personal cell phone numbers for us to contact them with.  Many of my professors have invited the class to their homes at the end of the semester for dinner and a chance to just hang out without the pressure of a classroom environment.  I know that there are several professors that I've had on this campus that if I was struggling with problems in my personal life, I could talk to them about it.  The professors here want out success not just in their classroom, but in other classrooms on campus, in our future careers, and in our lives.  This campus feels like family, and I am truly blessed to be a part of it."
College Freshman,5,I always feel safe on campus and so far have had no problems.
College Sophomore,5,Hardin-Simmons has become my home. I have established myself in a community that is rooted in an education that is enlightened by faith. Small classes and professors who take a genuine concern and interest in not only the students education but their lives as well has made my time at this school unforgettable. From the first moment I stepped foot on campus I knew this was the school I needed to attend. I know that when I have completed my education with Hardin-Simmons I will enter my community with the skills and knowledge I need to not only succeed but to prosper and advance in whatever I do.
College Senior,5,The Staff is awesome and very helpful. If your plan is to buckle down and do your part the staff is their to help. There are many opportunities to get help through tutoring and sponsors. Take advantage of every opportunity and enjoy an education enlightened through faith.
College Sophomore,5,I have made so many friends and so many memories and there are only more to come!!
College Junior,5,I love that the professors here know me by name.
College Sophomore,5,"The education program at Hardin Simmons is unlike any other.  The faculty is amazing, always willing to help you and truly wants you to succeed in whatever it is you are doing."
College Student,5,"Church, football, family & fun."
College Student,5,In the faith based campus atmosphere things seem to always flow smoothly.
Freshman,4,"I love the sense of community and family especially when it comes to playing sports. I also like how religious they are, even through sports."
Sophomore,4,"Haven’t taken any online classes, but from what I’ve learned and seen the professors will teach the curriculum very well even on online classes."
Freshman,4,online classes were a bit of a struggle but the professors helped everyone manage the courses. The courses themselves all resided on Canvas
Freshman,4,A very friendly atmosphere and wonderful teachers and staff who really care!! They really put an emphasis  on-campus activities for students. I just wish that there was more diversity in both the student body and staff.
Sophomore,4,"This university makes it so easy to get involved and make new friends. However, the academics here are rigorous and I find it difficult to keep your scholarships, which is vital for this institution as it is so expensive, and continues to face financial struggles, causing them to increase their overall charges."
Freshman,4,I really like that it is a private co-ed college. It's in my hometown so I never really get homesick but I like that it is not too big but not too small . The professors and workers are very helpful and super nice. Overall my experience so far is amazing .
Sophomore,4,"It’s such a good campus because it allows me and all the other people that attend the school, be so close and makes me feel much more comfortable being there."
Freshman,4,As an on coming freshman I am super excited to start the process of furthering my education at HSU. After my first visit I had feel in love with the campus and the atmosphere at HSU. I recommend this school to anyone who is looking to further their education and grow closer to Jesus.
Sophomore,4,Hardin-Simmons University has an accepting atmosphere and many wonderful resources to help you with academics.
Freshman,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Hardin Simmons! Everyone on campus was delightful, and it was super easy to become involved on campus in the many different groups. My only complaint is the price point. But I definitely met my life long best friends in Abilene."
Freshman,4,"It’s ok
I HAVENT EXPIERENCED IT AS A STUDENT BUT MY ROUND UP EVENT AND STAFF EXPERIENCE WAS OKAY IT COULD OF BEEN BETTER TBH BUT NOT EVERYTHINGS PERFECT"
Freshman,4,"Even though I plan on attending Hardin-Simmons University this coming Fall of 2019, the experiences I've had with them by emails and phone calls were very helpful. They make sure to keep me up to date with important dates and activities coming up."
Freshman,4,"From my first campus visit, the campus is wonderful environment and seems very safe. The administrators that helped me and tour guides made a good difference on helping me decide where i want to go."
Niche User,4,"The campus is absolutely beautiful and the staff and students are very friendly. My parents met each at Hardin-Simmons, and have been together ever since. From being influenced by them and hearing their experiences from going to Hardin-Simmons has inspired me to want to continue their legacy by following my path with God to Hardin-Simmons to become an Elementary school teacher."
Niche User,4,"I am not attended Hardin-Simmons  university however, I went to visit it once and it seemed ideal for me.  People were very nice and the environment looked safe to live in. Even though that my college of choice others should join the cowboy journey."
Freshman,4,The atmosphere is great and the people are amazing! All of Hardin-Simmons professors either have a masters degree or are in the process of obtaining one.
Graduate Student,4,"Great school, great staff.  Would highly suggest looking into here.  I'm using them as a graduate student and they were actually personable and responded quickly to any questions.   The support and help is wonderful.  If you're looking at graduate level or undergrad classes, give them a look."
Niche User,4,"In my opinion, I really enjoy the college environment at Hardin-Simmons University, the nature and people are very welcoming to others and the community. I am now a senior in High School, so far I've only toured the college site which was an experience that was so great and memorable where I couldn't    forget."
Sophomore,4,Hardin Simmons is a very free campus. There are so many comfortable areas to spend time in. The only issue is that there should be more diversity on the campus.
Sophomore,4,"People on campus are very friendly & there is always something great to be apart of! This university not only carries out the trait of loving an Almighty God, but carries out the true meaning of hard work as well. You'll love the people, you'll love the atmosphere & most importantly you'll love the journey."
Junior,4,"I honestly love Hardin-Simmons University. One of the best choices I made was coming to this school. I am going on my third year at HSU, and I have noticed a few things that made me give HSU four stars instead of 5. One of the things that I believe could be improved is how the school sees the LGBTQ community. The school's discrimination against the LGBTQ wasn't something I noticed immediately. It was something I saw in classes and during lecture. Whether a student was being singled out or it came up in lecture, the professors were not open minded and pushed a negativity about the LGBTQ community openly. I am not apart of the LGBTQ community, but I do believe they deserve to be treated equally. That is the only change I would make to this wonderful school."
Sophomore,4,"Great faith based university, has a small college feel that makes the experience feel family-like. Plenty of events to attend and students feel safe to practice christian faith with chapel, bible study, and faith allowed in classroom environments. Many work study opportunities for students, and a great school for all military and dependents."
Niche User,4,I came here during my 3 Years in Highschool for Early Medical Classes. It was a nice environment. Teachers will help you go through the toughest of times... finals!! Very sportive community and all around excellent school.
Junior,4,"I love HSU. The largest class I've had is about 30 students. The professors know you on an individual basis and go out of their way to help you succeed. I've even been in classes where the professor invited the class to dinner at their own home. It's a small campus, yet it still has the amenities and standing of a much larger school. It's situated in a convenient area and Abilene is an easy town to learn to navigate."
Junior,4,"HSU has wonderful professors and is a great place to pursue a degree, especially in the sciences. It is located in a small, quiet town with not a lot going on but serves as a great place to study. Lots of positive changes are going on in the university that I believe will further propel it to greater heights."
Freshman,4,"What I have liked about Hardin-Simmons University is the fact that the staff is willing to help students through any issues they may come upon. Rather it is helping you find scholarships, learning to adjust, or simply finding a way to make you feel comfortable in your new home they are willing to find solutions. The school, also, invest with its students. Any money that comes into the school always goes back into bettering the school to meet the needs of the students, staff, and faculty. I admire the idea of chapel, as well. Every Tuesday the school offers chapel from 9:30-10:10 am, which is a great way to connect with God, no matter how busy your schedule might be because offices are closed during this time. Overall, my experience has been great and I am glad to say that I have chosen Hardin-Simmons University as my home for the next four years of my life."
Junior,4,"The school is overall alright but the town is not made for young adults because there is nothing to do in Abilene, so even though the education is good the town is not accommodating for young adults. The school could really use an upgrade on the residential ares such as the housing and apartments because they are getting old, out of shape, and have a lot of damage."
Freshman,4,"Hardin-Simmons is a smaller university located in Abilene, TX. I choose to go to Hardin-Simmons to major in exercise science. Once I graduate, I plan to go to their amazing graduate school for physical therapy. I am currently starting my second semester here as a college freshman. There plenty of activities and clubs to join. I love Hardin-Simmons because here, you can be or do anything. The professors I've had have all been amazing. They teach with such passion for their subject. One thing that I love about Hardin-Simmons is that we are always growing. This year they have started a men and women's lacrosse team. the coach accepted us if we knew how or play or not. He wants to grow the game in Texas."
Junior,4,"I like that the staff at Hardin-Simmons actually care about each individual attending the University. They are willing to work with you on finances and offer support. The teachers care about your individual success, and they explain each topic they are teaching in full. They work with you if you fall behind and are understanding if class is missed for unforeseen circumstances."
College Junior,4,Almost everyone is in a social club but it isnt the most important aspect of campus life.
College Junior,4,"Our athletic programs are great, most of the campus population are athletes."
College Junior,4,Alumni network is great. Graduates usually coming out with a career within the first 2 years
College Junior,4,Safety on campus is pretty great. Not much (in terms of violence) happens. General safety is high.
College Junior,4,Greek life plans many student events on campus and charities across town. The greek life here is based around the morals and principles of the school and are a great opportunity for new students getting involved and making life-long friends. No Greek housing available.
College Junior,4,Student involvement is good and school spirit is generally high. A large portion of the varsity sports on campus won conference this past year and are very successful most of the time.
College Junior,4,"There is a lot to do on campus, a lot of organizations to get involved in, and the academics here are above average and produce very successful graduates."
College Sophomore,4,Looking forward to being involved
College Freshman,4,"Not the best, but it gets the job done"
College Freshman,4,The football program and baseball program is amazing!
College Freshman,4,Living on campus for my first year was a blast. I meet some of my best friends here. The residential life staff make it welcoming and comfortable to live in a community.
College Freshman,4,Sports at Hardin-Simmons are just as important to the athletes as they are to the fans. Our campus supports the athletic department and also intramural sports.
College Freshman,4,"I feel pretty safe on campus, but walking alone at night is frightening. Our police and safety services are very convenient though."
College Freshman,4,"The value of a degree from Hardin-Simmons is exceptional. I know that when I graduate from here, I will have no problem getting a job."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't hear about very much crime happening on campus.  It happens very rarely, if ever.  There are security poles around all the dorms that call campus police.  Campus police patrol all hours, and are always on call.  I personally feel very safe on this campus.  I've walked the campus alone at 2am and didn't once feel threatened or unsafe.  I do know that some of my friends have been sexually harrassed, but not assaulted.  I don't know specific circumstances, but I do know that not a lot was done to resolve the issue as far as giving warnings or preventative measures being put in place."
College Freshman,4,"I have little to say about sports, but heir attention to the program is admirable."
College Freshman,4,"The university is adequate in it's setting, but makes up for it through it's developed programs."
College Freshman,4,The registration process is very simple to complete;there are many people available to help if needed.
College Freshman,4,Class size is small so you get to know your professors and they get to know you. professors are involved with students in activities outside of class.
College Freshman,4,I am still undecided on my major. My professors and the career have been helpful in narrowing down what I might choose.
College Freshman,4,I play tennis for Hardin Simmons. Phase 1 of our new tennis facility is complete-- it is great!
College Freshman,4,My first semester went very well. I had to learn to better manage my time. My professors were very helpful and understanding. I am looking forward to the spring semester starting.
College Freshman,4,"Friends I've made on campus, and joining a social club are what makes HSU great!"
College Junior,4,"The professors can sometimes be lazy and not teach properly but that has been a very rare experience. My only other bone to pick is the living conditions. The dorms are horribly out of date and have a highly depressing interior, being mainly bleach white brick walls with glaringly bright white lights with some paneling here and there to break it up a bit. Great school if you live off campus or in one of the campus apartments which were built sometime this last century at least."
College Freshman,4,They don't allow nonsense making the college experience enjoyable.
College Sophomore,4,living off campus is Gods gift to HSU students
College Sophomore,4,most students come here for sports to get the opportunity to play collegiate sports without being good enough to go to a D1 school
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe on campus.  We have 24 hour officers always available to us.  I had a random man come up to me at night in the parking lot one time asking for help to get gas and our campus police was there within minutes to escort him off the property
College Sophomore,4,Abilene is a great city to live in.  It's a  safe environment for students and families.
College Freshman,4,"There is a lot of diversity on campus. There are students here from all over the world. Although a majority of the students on campus are Christians, there is a vast diversity of ideas and specific beliefs within the religion. Political beliefs also vary some."
College Freshman,4,"There is a mall in town, plenty of places to eat, and even a small zoo. The locals are very welcoming to college students and try to help them as much as possible."
Freshman,2,When  we went online it was all very pointless with a lot of unnecessary busy-work. Online experience was not very good.
College Freshman,2,"There's definitely a lot of drug and alcohol use on campus. No one cares whether or not if you do drugs or not. If caught with alcohol or drugs, you could face serious punishment."
College Sophomore,2,"as a Baptist school, most views that are different from the Baptist beliefs are not accepted"
Recent Alumnus,2,The school hasn't moved on from its cowboy heritage and refuses to move forward and. They don't even attempt to compete with real universities.
Recent Alumnus,2,Do everything possible not to deal with complaints
Recent Alumnus,2,Greek life have had several legal infractions which the university administration refuses to acknowledge or investigate.
Recent Alumnus,2,The university would be in major trouble if there were a real security / safety problem on campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,It's a small town with rural surroundings with little entertainment to offer yet locals act like it's a highly urban area.
College Junior,2,"There are no parties that are located on campus, unless the campus clubs host a dance or meal of some kind. There is no drinking or illegal things going on. All events are hosted on campus and are safe."
College Junior,2,"Although there are three colleges in Abilene, Tx, there is not much to do off campus. There are the occasional shops and one mall, however, the scenery is terrible, and there are almost no outside attractions and activities to participate in. The local atmosphere is seen as dead and not enjoyable for the amount of vibrant college kids that reside here."
College Junior,2,off campus housing is priced very high in Abilene for the worth of the house. Landlords seem to be very up to keep on there property. The houses around the colleges are all very outdated for the most part and not alot a variety. Most neighborhoods around the colleges are very sketchy and run down. 
College Sophomore,2,HSU doesn't have much to offer in off-campus housing.  Most of the facilities are for students in family situations
College Sophomore,2,Campus policies are very strict. Dorms are strictly gender segregated and you can't have opposite gender friends visit your room at all. Drinking policies are similarly strict. I could never live on campus.
College Freshman,2,"For as racial diversity, things are okay but they could be much better. Most people on campus are open minded and well rounded individuals, but some are very ignorant and racist."
College Sophomore,2,"The parking at Hardin-Simmons sucks! There are parking near the dorms, but if a student were to try and get to class they would have to park very far. There is also very little parking."
College Junior,2,Another Day Another Dollar – I personally do not like having to pay for parking as a commuter student. this is a small school with very great parking but I just hate how they charge for every little thing at this school.
College Junior,2,"Student Section Needs Help – Most students attend the football games, but we definitely lack fan support. School spirit is there, just not at football games...weird. A good portion of the HSU students are on a team (football, baseball, volleyball, basketball, track, golf, etc)."
College Sophomore,2,Somewhat Helpful – I went in to try and find more money to stay here and they want to give me as little as possible if any. They tell me they don't have certain forms when they give the same forms to get money to other people.
Alum,1,"This school is pathetic. The staff is full of uneducated religious money hungry clowns. The price is too expensive for the high school level education offered at this institution. All the professors just read from power point presentations for which they didnt prepare themselves and have no idea what they are teaching. Certain professors also have study abroad opportunities for which they constantly interrupt class and make deals with students to get their roster filled so the professor can leave country. They say they accept all forms of religion and belief but force you to go to chapel on campus against your will. The chapel services are sub par and are not presented well. There are hidden financial fees not made apparent to the students until it is too late. If anyone is looking into this school I would say go with the other options on the table because you will definitely regret ever even hearing the name ""Hardin Simmons."""
Alum,1,Was not assisted in fulfilling my career after receiving my degree. No guidance after graduation. There are so many holes that need to be filled in the education being taught at this school. No one will ever leave there feeling a portion of complete or ready because the knowledge is not present at HSU. Curriculum requirements change every semester and it is maddening to actually understand and finish your degree.
Niche User,1,"I am ashamed a purported Christian university tramples the free speech rights of it's students. Even more appalled Hardin Simmons embraces the racism of Marxist Black Lives Matter.

I had contemplated my children attending your college. Hopefully, the other students will escape indoctrination in Hardin Simmons' leftist orthodoxy."
Sophomore,1,Awful school. I would not recommend this school to anyone. The people working at this school do not care about you and this school is so broke they will do anything to suck every coin from your pocket. They just want your money. Everything about this school is awful. Do not go here.
College Freshman,1,"The dorms on campus are very old and haven't been updated in ages. They are also very unclean. There are also no elevators so the stairs are the only option to get to your room. There are also no microwaves allowed as they could short the electrical circuits because the building isn't updated. You have to pay for your laundry, and the laundry water contains rust in the pipes, so you often get rust stains on your clothes, which are very hard to remove."
College Sophomore,1,"our campus is extremely strict on most rules, but that should be no surprise as we are a Baptist university"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Most of the student events are aimed at high schoolers, so the most fun is often small-group events not associated with the university. Many student-led groups never make it out of the planning phase and are doomed for failure. There's normally just a handful of popular events each year."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There's little student life, go to ACU for events."
Recent Alumnus,1,Too much money put into athletics for low quality.
Recent Alumnus,1,"A small percentage of students are non-white, and only a few of them tend to mingle. Professors who obviously have experienced little diversity act as if they're experts."
College Senior,1,"The only nightlife is social club activities. Outside or off campus activity is nearly non-existent. And if it is existent, I certainly don't know about it."
College Senior,1,"It's a Baptist school, if that was going on, no one would know."
College Freshman,1,The drug scene at HSU is somewhat big. Everyone really just go to the parking lot and do them out there
College Sophomore,1,The Greek Isn't Huge on Campus – Greek life is not really shown throughout campus that much.We have fraternities and things of that nature but its more swayed towards chhristianity and faith.
College Freshman,1,"Soccer Facilities – For a NCAA D3 school and a Women's National Soccer Championship, the soccer fields are not an asset to the program.  It definitely needs lots of improvements."
College Junior,1,"Not Available! There are several Campus Houses located near campus, but they are in a sketchy neighborhood and there aren't enough houses for all of the students needing housing. You have to put your name on a waiting list at least a year before you need the house, and you still probably won't get one because priority is given to married students. There are a few apartment complexes around, but you're pretty much on your own to find housing."
College Sophomore,1,Nothing Going on – There is just nothing to do out here. There are only 3 restaurants within walking distance and only one of them stay open past 10. The good restaurants are across town and everything in the city shuts down at ten even on the weekends.

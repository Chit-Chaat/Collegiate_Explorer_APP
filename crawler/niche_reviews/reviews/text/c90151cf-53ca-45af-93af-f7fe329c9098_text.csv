Junior,5,It has been an easy online learning experience and all the professors have been as helpful as possible.
Junior,5,"I love Longwood University, and have met my best friends there. I love the small town, and the small campus feel. It feels like home away from home."
Freshman,5,You instantly feel at home stepping on Longwood's beautiful tree lined campus.  There are lots of different groups to join and activities to be involved with.  The professors are knowledgeable and encourage participation. You feel like they know you instead of just being a number. I am so glad I chose Longwood.
Junior,5,"I did take online classes , at first it was a challenge but later own i warmed up to it and later on enjoyed the class."
Junior,5,"Longwood has been my dream college and when i got accepted to it , I fell deeper in love with this school and the major that i have decided to take up."
Freshman,5,"My dad has worked at Longwood the past few years, so the college has always been close to my family. Even before I decided to attend this college, every time I would go to visit with my dad everyone was always so friendly and talkative. The people are all so diverse and make you feel welcome no matter who you are and they make you feel like you are apart of their ""family"". I personally love the atmosphere of this school and i cant wait to spend the next for years here building relationships with my peers and my professors on such a beautiful campus, while also being close to home where my father works."
Junior,5,The local area around the school is a bit boring but the campus a lot of amenities and is very active.
Niche User,5,"The campus is really nice and baseball coaches were very helpful. The campus is getting some renovations and overall looks really good. It's a smaller campus in a small town, but it's something I was looking at when applying."
Freshman,5,"As a freshman that just started my second semester at Longwood University, I have nothing but love for this school so far. This is the perfect school for me in every single way! From the first time I toured it my junior year in high school I could see myself loving every second of going to school here. Everyone is so nice all the time and is always happy to help anyone if they had any question, may it be where something is or what there is to do around the area."
Freshman,5,I loved Longwood University so much. From the dorms to classrooms. It's a very small campus but big enough to feel like home. I really liked how big the gym was as well how many dining halls they have on campus. I really do recommend applying to Longwood.
Sophomore,5,"Longwood is a amazing place to go to college, the professors are so passionate and helpful, they really want their students to be happy and do well. Longwood has a sense of community and school spirit and you get the small school feel with having small class sizes and close knit community. Longwood is such a special school as it has 2 secret societies!! Longwood really has a lot to offer with being able to major on anything under  the sun, clubs, organizations, Greek life, tons of leadership opportunities. Longwood is a great little school!!"
Freshman,5,This is my first semester here and I am having a BLAST! I enjoy attending Longwood University so muach:)
Senior,5,"Longwood University is like one big, diverse family. There is a club or organization for almost anything you can imagine, so you can find your space! With small class sizes, you know everyone around you and get more out of class. Professors and faculty actually know your name and are able and willing to provide you with career and internship opportunities. It also doesn't hurt that the campus is stunningly beautiful! I'm so glad I go to Longwood University!"
Alum,5,"As an alum I can truly say Longwood University is the best campus for teacher/student ratio. There is a close-knit community between the school and town. Every year there is a community service challenge which allows students to help out in the Farmville community. Extracurricular activities are ample. I was able to join a christian fraternity, belly dance club, and a gospel choir. Campus is always active with an Oktoberfest, Spring Weekend, Relay for Life Fundraiser and various sports games. When it comes to academics, teachers go the extra mile to assist their student in learning the material. Attending Longwood was the best decision I have ever made."
Junior,5,"Overall, my college experience has been excellent so far. The professors are very knowledgeable and their lectures are a lot of fun, too. On campus, there are hundreds of different clubs and organizations for students to get involved. The only thing I would change is having more diversity within the university."
Freshman,5,"A charming, beautiful and well-maintained campus surrounded by a quaint small town. This university is very appealing to those looking for a family/community like atmosphere and offers a more tranquil lifestyle rather than that of a large impersonal university. My first visit there I felt at home and knew immediately that this university is a perfect fit for me."
Sophomore,5,"Overall, my college experience has been excellent so far. The professors are very knowledgeable and their lectures are a lot of fun, too. On campus, there are hundreds of different clubs and organizations for students to get involved."
Sophomore,5,It's a really great university and the only thing I would change is the enrollment of minority students.
Sophomore,5,"I have attended Longwood University for just one year, but I couldn’t ask for a better school to go to. I was super scared leaving home and finding my way around a new place, but the campus is not only beautiful, but it’s small and easy to find your way around it. Throughout the semester, the personal advisors we are given are absolutely amazing!  The professors are super helpful when you need them to be, but can be very strict when it comes to attendance. The dorms are a decent size, and absolutely everything I brought fit perfectly into my room. The area around the school isn’t much, but there’s a local movie theater, and bowling alley if you want to go out with friends and have some fun! There’s plenty of food options around the school, but Longwood's dining hall isn’t that great. The party scene isn’t too crazy, But we party hard at Longwood! Longwood overall is just an incredible school and experience!"
Alum,5,"Longwood, is on the smaller side of public higher education institutions allowing for a more personal feel. Its student centric approach provides a great atmosphere to live and study in. I would suggest this school to any student looking a truly communal college experience."
Senior,5,"Longwood is an excellent school to attend. I love the small town atmosphere, but there is always something to do. Longwood makes students feel like a family and that is a great feeling to have."
Freshman,5,"Longwood university is a very beautiful, very diverse and hardworking school. This university has endless academic possibilities with something for everyone who attends. The staff and campus students are genuinely interested in you and helping you along on your way to graduation. The location is amazing with lots of things to do and places to visit. All restaurants are within walking distance to the campus and are easy access throughout the day and night. Longwood is a overall amazing college to attend."
Junior,5,"The teachers here really care about you and your success. All of the faculty work extremely hard to help you succeed. Because of the small student to faculty ratio, the professors always have time to answer questions and help you learn the material."
Niche User,5,"I'm an incoming Freshman and while I'm not currently living on campus or taking classes, I've already fallen in love with Longwood. The staff are super helpful and response time via email is usually the day of or two days at most. The campus isn't just the campus, it's the town. Everyone is super friendly and makes you feel at home. The restaurants are amazing (I recommend Riverside Cafe's bacon, it melts in your mouth yet it's crunchy!) and there are plenty of activities that you can be a part of! I cannot wait to start attending Longwood this fall and I hope that you can see what longwood has to offer."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy Longwood, I just wish the dining hall would improve the food. So far, the campus atmosphere has been great and I would really recommend others to come to Longwood."
Freshman,5,"There's seems to be something for everyone here, from the partiers to the hermits. Large campus, friendly professors, decent housing."
Freshman,5,Longwood University is such a safe school. It has a good student life and a safe campus. The food isn't half bad. The teachers are very understanding and have good office hours.
Freshman,5,I liked how close all the people at this town are no matter the race or ethnicity. When I went to visit they made me feel right at home. They gave great advise to be able to further my education before coming to college. They also gave great outreaching programs while you wait to hear back from them. They were very warming to all the prospective students when showing us the campus. They gave us resources to be able to contact them.
Junior,5,"As someone who transferred here after completing two years at a community college, I found my transfer here to be a little rocky, as I'd had no previous experience living ""on my own"". However, once settled in, I found Longwood to be very accommodating, and especially enjoyed the New Lancer days where people were split into groups depending on if they were transfers or not, which meant it was easier to get along with others who were in the same boat. 
All in all, I love the campus (despite it's endless stairs, but I need exercise so :/) and the professors and staff who make it what it is. Small classes (rarely over 50:1, and the higher up you go the less), people who kind of stick to themselves, and lots of organizations to join. Loving the new Upchurch building and the new restaurants - adds more options than d-hall which can be a little lack-luster. 
Advice for outside the campus: Avoid Walmart, Dollar Tree, and Goodwill. Go somewhere else. Trust me."
Niche User,5,I loved everything. Everyone was nice and helpful. I didn't get lost because the campus was small but not to small.
Graduate Student,5,"The administration graduate endorsement is fantastic. All of the online resources are helpful and easy to use. The instructors are all knowledgeable. Registration, billing, and transcripts were all handled at ease."
Sophomore,5,I love being at Longwood. It has changed me as a person. I have met so many people that I get to call my friends. I would not change it for any other school.
Senior,5,Amazing place! Small campus and easy to navigate. All people are friendly and you will almost always see someone you know when walking around campus.
Sophomore,5,Love the quaint campus and the professors I have had.  Its a great University if you would like small town feel.  The professors and the students are involved.  There Is a broad amount of clubs and extra curricular activities you can get involved in.
Niche User,5,"I am not at Longwood University right now but I am committed there for softball, and I visit there all the time. I love the small university because everybody knows each other which helps engage conversations. I also like the professors there, and the small classes help the professors have a close relationship with you."
Junior,5,"it has the program of studies that I wanted as an all encompassing program.  Other schools I looked at didn't offer English as a second language as a degree program.  The professors work hard for their students to assure their success in their education and personal life.  College life is full and offers many opportunities for personal growth, friendships and to explore different activities on and off campus."
Freshman,5,"Longwood University, in my opinion, is the best school in the state of Virginia. The teachers are paid the least in the commonwealth, yet they work the hardest. In my major, Communications, I have so many opportunities to learn and build my resume. I can branch out on campus from athletics to academics, with equal opportunity to all. The greek life is very open, inclusive, and harmonious and has a strict no hazing rule. Longwood also requires at least one internship before you graduate. This helps students put their minds to building their resume. Longwood's biggest goal is to educate their students and equip them with the skills to thrive after college."
Freshman,5,Longwood feels like home.  Everyone is friendly and wants to help you begin your adventure at Longwood.
Sophomore,5,"Despite some issues here and there since no school is perfect, Longwood University is the school I fell in love with, and I will always be proud to call my home."
Junior,5,"Longwood University is a school with small class sizes that make it easy to thrive in your desired field of study, not to mention the amazing teachers."
Alum,5,I received a great education from Longwood University. The professors work extremely hard and are focused on making sure students are interacting with the material. The only aspect Longwood should improve upon is increasing the dining options.
Senior,5,Students and Staff are very friendly and welcoming. School has a tremendous amount of school spirit.
Alum,5,Longwood University is a school with a small town feel that gives one the education experience of a big time school. The student to staff ratio is excellent and allows for an experience unlike any other. The campus is beautiful and the community around it is integrated and lovely.
Freshman,5,I really like how Longwood has a program that fits everyone with what they want to do after college.  Even though it is a small college when you get there it has all the same feels of a major college.
Senior,5,"Longwood University has become my home away from home and has become a place where I have been able to grow as a student and as a person. Through many organizations across campus, I have been provided with numerous once in a life time opportunities that I would never have been able to have had if it weren’t for Longwood University. I am extremely excited for all of the change that is happening at Longwood and can’t wait to see what it does for the university. I have enjoyed every second of my time at Longwood and wouldn’t change it for the world."
Freshman,5,"I have become so involved in the community in a variety of clubs. I have made great friends and my classes have been amazing. Campus is so beautiful even with the construction, but once it’s all done, it’ll be better than ever."
Niche User,5,What I like about Longwood University is that it is a small and tightly connected place and a college where you can really get to know your professors. It is a beautiful campus and an adaptable place to live and spend your time.
Niche User,5,"Longwood is an amazing school, with a beautiful campus. The surrounding area is very safe. They definitely care about their students."
Niche User,5,It was very fun experience to visit the campus. I went there during a fine arts event and I learned a lot of very fascinating things about music. The teachers were very kind and super helpful. The food was very good and students that went there were very nice. I am glad I made a visit to Longwood University.
Senior,5,I just love this place!!! I can't believe in a few months I have to leave--the professors are great and for being in a small town pretty far away from cities there's a lot to do. Dhall food leaves a lot to be desired but i still love it Go Lancers!
Freshman,5,I love my college so much. I love how the professors care for you. The student life here is really good. I love the little town of Farmville.
Freshman,5,I love Longwood University!  It feels like home and I can't imagine myself anywhere else!  Their education program is excellent and all the professors want to help.  There is plenty to do around the area even if it doesn't look like much.  The campus is beautiful and I love it's small size.  The fact that it's a seven minute walk from one end of campus to the other makes it great for those 8 a.m. classes.
Freshman,5,I love Longwood!! We have so many cool traditions that I was glad to be apart of this semester. Longwood is the place that makes you feel at home when your not at home. You get to meet so many great people because we are so close. Longwood shows you what it is like to have a good time and be a family.
Sophomore,5,"Longwood University is wonderful.  I love that they have a lot of program set up to help academically, clean campus, friendly student and wonderful faculty and staffs. They only thing I will change more option to use our bonus cash."
Senior,5,this is an amazing school!! I transferred 2 years ago and it was an amazing decision! The professors actually care about the students and thee classrooms are not big!c
Niche User,5,"I visited Longwood University and overall I liked the school. I feel very welcome and home. However,  I feel like the school needs a better building and needs better teachers"
Sophomore,5,I have had a pretty good experience so far with a few bumps in the road. Longwood all in all is a great school.
Freshman,5,"Longwood is a great school for those who would actually like to learn in their search for higher education. It is a tightly nit community with a place for everyone. The class sizes are far smaller than most people would think for college, allowing students to be more involved and able to apply their knowledge without feeling lost in a crowd of students all just trying to scrape by. 

Most of my professors were very nice and intelligent people, giving students chances to apply what they know and grading based on ability rather than memorization. I only had a problem with one of my  professors, who would become frustrated and skip over important steps in math problems. However, the rest I would enjoy taking another class with as their classes were interesting and challenging without forcing memorization.

For anyone looking for an actual education I would recommend Longwood. Especially the education programs which it is clear that a lot of work has been put into making it great."
Freshman,5,"Longwood University is a school that prides itself on its concept of creating ""citizen leaders."" The beautiful campus surrounded by the quaint town of Farmville gives off a very peaceful vibe as you go about your daily activities. There are a vast amount of club, organizations, sports, and groups in general to get involved with, if you so choose, and each are pretty grand in their own way. Most of the people that you will encounter in town or on campus are very polite and always seem genuinely happy with living in Farmville, be it temporarily or more permanently. Overall, my experience at Longwood University has been overwhelmingly positive and I would encourage anyone looking into Longwood to come and see our campus during the week and they will hopefully experience what I have said."
Freshman,5,"Longwood University is a wonderful place, and its and honor to be a Lancer! It;s a small rural school with extremely helpful professors and staff and super welcoming students as well. "
Niche User,4,I graduated from Longwood University’s RN to BSN program. This was an online program that was very easy to navigate.
Niche User,4,I graduated from Longwood University’s RN to BSN program. This was an online program that was very easy to navigate.
Junior,4,"My experience at Longwood for the first year was great. I felt very welcome and very comfortable here at Longwood University. What I really enjoyed being at Longwood is being involved in the school. As I Caitlyn Martens, I was able to be involved as a Student Government Association Senator, which is when we senators reach out to other students' concerns or needs and try to find the best way to advocate for the student. I was also involved in Relay for Life Executive, which is someone who helps plan many different aspects of Relay For Life for the school of Longwood University. I really loved being involved in both of those clubs and making a difference here at Longwood. I would as I being a transfer student, would recommend making transfer students feel more welcome to the school at Longwood. I would try to have a specific day for transfer students to get a tour around the school and to see what happens here at Longwood."
Sophomore,4,I love how Longwood is such a small campus. Everywhere you go you see at least one person you know. Everyone is so connected and really care about each other. The professors really care for their students and work with what they need.
Freshman,4,"I had some trouble with online learning due to COVID. Obviously it wasn't ideal for anyone. I felt like most of my professors really made an effort to be available and helpful and give clear instructions. Unfortunately, some of the classes I was taking did not really translate well to the online format (they are hands on, not just papers and tests.)  I had a lot of trouble with one class and professor who kind of just gave up after the first few weeks of online learning. Overall, the professors really made the effort."
Freshman,4,I love that I started my college career at Longwood. I really wouldn’t trade it for anything. I feel that Longwood was the best way to transition into this new chapter in my life with starting college. Longwood is like a Hallmark movie and I love it.
Junior,4,Longwood has amazing professors and a beautiful campus! Greek Life is huge there as well!! The downside is the dinning hall isn’t the best.
Junior,4,"I love Longwood because the professors and students feel like family. It's a very warm and welcoming environment. The classes are small so the students have more of a chance for a one-on-one discussion with the professors. The faculty with work with you endlessly to help students meet their goals whether it is financially or academically. Also, there are endless resources available."
Niche User,4,I applied to Longwood University this year and I will be attending starting fall 2020. I have been around the campus and it is beautiful and seeing other college students walking around makes me feel like I can do anything.
Freshman,4,I like how you can choose your classes and what time of day you can take them. I also like all the people here they are so nice.
Sophomore,4,"The professors here are amazing...they really care about the students and will do anything to help them succeed.  There is really not much to do here, very small rural town.  Overall I am enjoying my experience."
Freshman,4,"Small town, feels like home although there's not much to do there. Easy to get involve at longwood especially with the club teams. Weekends are pretty chill if you know the right people there's good party's. The gym at Longwood is very nice and well caught up so if you like working out you're all set."
Junior,4,"Longwood University is a bit pricey in my opinion, but is definitely a great institution.  It is predominately Caucasian when it comes to race, so it could work on it's diversity levels a bit.  The professors are amazing and truly care about their students, which makes a big difference.  I do commute so I am not quite sure about the dorms, but the couple that I  have been in have been very nice.  They are currently remodeling a few dormitories, as well as building new academic buildings."
Junior,4,Longwood University is a very tight-knit community with an abundance of opportunities! There are plenty of majors and minors to find your perfect fit - as well as plenty of organizations to find a great group of friends all while making a difference!
Sophomore,4,"Longwood has a good campus size and is a good community overall. Longwood is not too far from home and it feels like a second home to me. The small classroom size allows for the professors to have a close connection with students. Different students from around the east coast, nation, and even globally come to Longwood and help the diversity. Longwood has many traditions and the school continuously builds around the area of Farmville year after year. Longwood University is basically Farmville. Farmville now feels like a second home: I’m enjoying my major and everything about my education, I am in a fraternity now, I have made many friends and build connections that will last all through the rest of my life."
Niche User,4,"My sister go there and when I go to visit, I have a great time. The people there are friendly and we always have fun activities to do. I wouldn't change anything about Longwood. It is very pretty and comforting."
Freshman,4,"This University is my home away from home. The campus is beautiful, the classes are small, and the professors are AMAZING. Worth every penny even if the food really isn't, though it does always have staples and things you can make yourself which helps (plus coffee is coffee). My only real complaint is lack of diversity, though it is getting better and I know has part to blame with the location. There's not much in Farmville, except some really great nature spots, so most of your fun is on campus (get involved). If you're thinking about making the move to Longwood, come visit us! Meet our outgoing students and wonderful professors!"
Sophomore,4,"I do love Longwood a lot, the community is just the right size. You know everyone there and where everything is. The campus is fun and full of activities. The campus is extremely safe and crime free."
Freshman,4,"Longwood University, all though small it is overall a great university. The classes sizes are small enough that students can establish a relationship with professors. There is constant construction on campus to increase overall student life.The athletics program could do a better job of promoting each program along with their athletes via social media. Outside of campus there is not a lot to do, mostly just land. Although, there is an all boys college near by. A car is the best way of transportation since there is not a local Amtrak or bus stations to go to major cities or other states. There are more females than males on campus. As well as more female athletic teams."
Freshman,4,They weren’t the best with communication in the beginning but this semester they’ve been much better! My advisor is great and he goes out of his way to help me with my scheduling and classes. I love the size and the professors genuinely care how you do. I’ve met my best friends here and I already feel more prepared for my career in education!
Senior,4,I love how small it is! The class sizes are small so the professor knows your name. I would like it if they stop spending so much money on extra buildings when we can work on getting more cameras and money for mental health serviecs.
Niche User,4,"It is a small knit community and very including of all students. It is a division one school for sports and they offer intramural sports for students who are not at the division one level.  The food is tasty and there are plenty of options for students with allergies. Also, there are plenty of resources for students with disabilities and special needs. They offer single person dorm rooms for students who  need accommodations. They offer gym facilities and pools for physical activities."
Niche User,4,"The Campus is very close-knit and everyone I've met while on a tour are very kind!  Main street is less than a quarter mile away from campus.  The only thing I would like to see change is the dorm size, but the dorms are actually quite good."
Freshman,4,I liked the campus and how the staff made you feel welcome. They have a great teaching program and have beautiful dorm rooms. Longwood could improve on the food but it is decent.
Sophomore,4,A great university with lots to offer in a small town environment.  The professors show their support with open offices and detailed lessons and objectives.  There are several weekend activities to keep students involved and staying on campus.
Junior,4,"Longwood is a great, small school to go to. It's close enough home that I can visit on weekends, but far enough that I wouldn't visit every weekend."
Senior,4,"Longwood University is a really good school. The staff is very helpful as well as dedicated and their curriculum is set up in a manner where students are set on a pretty straight path to graduate. However, I would like to see Longwood better accommodate transfer students. It was really hard to find classes because I transferred in from a community college with so many of my prerequisites and electives complete, I found my self either having to wait until certain classes were offered or I  had to take 2 pillar classes before I could really dig into my classes."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy attending Longwood University. There is a great sense of home on this campus. The only bad thing is that there is a lot of construction, but that happens everywhere."
Sophomore,4,"I love the environment! There are great professors and faculty that want to see you succeed. The campus as a whole is beautiful, even with the construction. There are always people hanging around on the lawns, studying, playing volleyball, walking their dogs. You walk outside and there is no reason to go back in. I found a home."
Sophomore,4,Longwood is a lovely small university that truly feels like home. They care about you as a person and a student and not you are so much more than a number to Longwood. I have met the greatest friends ever since I have been at Longwood.
Niche User,4,"Very nice school if you like the small school vibe. Small classroom sizes and nice facilities. Food is average and dorms are very nice.





dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd"
Alum,4,I loved the small town feel I had at Longwood. There is nothing like getting out of class and getting a new shirt at Pairet's or having dinner at Charley's pasta night. Farmville is extremely unique and you won't regret having a college experience at Longwood.
Senior,4,"Longwood University is a great way to make new connections and get involved in a positive and welcoming community. I have made such great friends and have gotten to know my professors on a personal level as well as most of my classmates with the small class sizes. I  enjoy partaking in the traditions such as the Chi walk, basketball games, and Spring/Fall weekend concerts."
Freshman,4,Longwood University has a very good environment and good professors. These professors actually care about you and your future. One of thr best choicchoices I have made in my life was going to Longwood University. The academics are also great. The best part about the Longwood experience is the campus. The campus is so beautiful. The best part about your freshmen year  is T.H.E. G.A.M.E. This is also where you receive your Longwood scarf.
Freshman,4,Longwood is an incredible school with incredible students and faculty. The professors really care about their students. The class sizes help you get to know them even better. It truly is my home away from home.
Niche User,4,"Longwood is a school in a quiet town, where you can barely hear the traffic as you walk along the grounds of the school, which is relatively small to begin with. The school grounds are well kept and beautiful, boasting many trees and open grassy places to sit down. However, I would be excited to see what  the school does with its image now that it is a University and not just a teaching school. The school has a lot of room to grow not only into the community that surrounds it, but also a lot of room to grow into itself."
Niche User,4,"It has a very Beautiful campus, the Greek life is a big thing, the food is so good, and great campus life!!!"
Freshman,4,"I love it here! So much to do, and so many organizations you can join. The class sizes are small and the community is nice."
Freshman,4,I love all the traditions they have there and how it actually feels like somewhere you could live for four years. The campus is all in one area so you don't have to worry too much about transportation.
Freshman,4,"It's an excellent place to study your degree and offers a number of excellent programs, including a 5-year master's program for physics and engineering. The professors are all very personable and easy to confront and talk to, making it easy to get help when needed."
Sophomore,4,I'm a sophomore at longwood and I love it here. The environment is so positive and FarmVille is on the rise. But I must say our dinning hall is trash so hold on to those bounds dollars for as long as possible.
Freshman,4,"I love the overall environment of Longwood. It is a home like community of people. Each professor wants you to succeed. Their goal isn’t to make you suffer or to push you to your breaking point. I only wish the food variety were larger though. Offering more vegetarian, vegan, etc options. For those that choose not to eat certain foods or can’t due to allergies."
Freshman,4,"Longwood University is a very friendly campus in a great community in Farmville, Virginia. The people on campus are helpful in every way and the students are very passionate and strive for excellence. I am only a freshman but from my short time at Longwood I can already see that I enjoy where I attend college and look forward to my next 3 years."
Freshman,4,"The campus itself is beautiful and has a home-like feeling to it. The size of the campus and student population is big enough to offer plenty of chances to meet new people and get involved in multiple clubs and organizations, but also provides smaller class sizes. Professors provide interesting lectures and try to relate to students and their interests."
Senior,4,I love Longwood's overall atmosphere. The students and faculty here are very nice and caring. It's a very greek affiliated school though.
Sophomore,4,The campus is beautiful and class sizes are small. If you are looking for a wide variety in activities Longwood has them. A good change for the campus is parking. Making more spaces available to students.
Freshman,4,"Longwood is beautiful, builts on some hills- but nonetheless beautiful. The staff are all so willing to help!"
Junior,4,It is a small school in a small town that is focused on growing within the school and the community. Class sizes are small and personal and every professor knows your name. There isn't much to not like about it.
Sophomore,4,"This is an amazing institution that offers plenty of opportunities to grow and mature. Personally, I have achieved great success at Longwood because of the amazing staff who constantly encourages me to step outside of my comfort zone. However, Longwood does have its negatives. Our school spirit is close to nothing. Longwood is located in the small town of FarmVille which often lacks opportunities for internships or employment. Longwood is great if you make it great.  Get involved or not, is your choice. The opportunities are there, just go find them.  Overall, Longwood is a stellar University in the upswing."
Junior,4,Longwood is a small school so you pretty much know everybody. I love that about it though. The classes are all pretty small as well so you get to know your professors well.
Freshman,4,I really love this school and its ability to have high academic standards and be able to cater to each and every students needs. My first year at college has been rough but Longwood and its lively student life has helped me through.
Freshman,4,Longwood university is a prestigious a school with high academic standards with a fun side that tries to keep their students interested and less stressed about the college life.
Sophomore,4,"Although Longwood's student population doubles Farmville's population, I wouldn't change anything. With a great local atmosphere and a beautiful campus you can't go wrong. I enjoy the open space and quiet there is on and off campus. I am able to fully focus on my academics while still enjoying myself. Professors here put in 110% to make sure you are learning the most amount of information possible. On top of numerous greek life organizations there is also copious options for extra curricular activities such as clubs and club sports."
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed the close knit community that you can only get from a small college. I enjoy most of my classes since I can get close with the teachers. The campus isn't that big so you won't be late to class. However, even though the community is nice, you will be in the middle of nowhere: there are both pros and cons to that."
Freshman,4,"Longwood is a great school that offers much to its students. A relatively small school, not many people know about it which makes it a more unique school that can really engage its students to learn. In the heart of Farmville, it's a nice scenic location with much to do outside of studying on campus, such as many state parks. The family and tradition one finds at Longwood is unmatched at other colleges. I didn't have any outstanding reason for picking Longwood, but I'm glad I did and I wouldn't pick any other college, go Lancers!"
Niche User,4,Longwood has a beautiful campus. It is very welcoming. Longwood University also has delicious food services.
College Freshman,4,There are many job opportunities for people who earn a degree from Longwood University.
College Freshman,4,i have been having a lot of fun so far.
College Freshman,4,Longwood does a great job of ensuring everyone's safety.
College Freshman,4,I love living on campus because  have a great roommate.
Junior,2,"My online experience wasn't very good. With the outbreak of the Corona Virus last semester was quite complicated, not on the Universities fault but no one was prepared to completely shift to online learning. For two of my courses the transition wasn't all bad the professors were very understanding and understood that not all of us were returning to the best living environments which hindered learning. While my other classes the professors weren't very understanding of everything and particularly didn't try to work with me on completing my task so I was forced to Pass/fail the classes.  Me personally I am not a fan of online learning I would rather much be in the classroom."
Sophomore,2,Longwood is the place to be if you want to join a frat or sorority. If you want to be social and party it is almost necessary for you to join Greek life especially if you are a guy. The campus is beautiful and most of the professors I’ve had are good but students don’t really care too much about academics. A lot of the focus is put on the crappy sports teams instead of the students and it shows. Longwood is also very conservative so if you are liberal and considering enrolling then you should know the school leans right. I just finished my sophomore year and am most likely transferring to a school closer to home in the fall. I met some great people at Longwood but the school just isn’t for me.
Sophomore,2,When it comes to me being at Longwood University as a person I often feel as if i don't fit in within a crowd. It's mainly because I don't look like the other students here on campus. I don't really care for the dining provided here some days it's good some day I get tired because I don't really have any options to choose from. The parties are an absolute bore and there is nothing more I can really say about it. Most of the campuses money goes into athletics they don;t really care about academics here at Longwood when it comes to being recognized for your hard work. It's more about your involvement and service here then about anything else.
Junior,2,Not the best school for commuter students. Not many resources or consideration for them. The school also cares too much about the money than a students education.
Alum,2,Professors are under paid and it shows. There was some good customer service staff but a majority of them just confused me more or just never answered any of my questions. The food gave me food poisoning on multiple experiences. Everyone that goes there is the definition of initialed. If you still decide to go here don’t live on campus because a majority of my roommates were insane and the residential life staff do not care about your safety.
Freshman,2,The school is in a bad location. It is very boring and if you are a guy you cant really party anywhere unless you are in a frat. But class room are a good size and easy.
Sophomore,2,"Strong professors, but not strong students.  Virtually no class discussion because no one does the assigned readings/really cares about their classes.  Even the honors college is just full of people who think their geniuses but are not much smarter than the rest of school. Athletic teams, with the exception of softball, are not good and there is no support for them.  There is nothing to do in Farmville, and campus is dead after 6 pm because almost everyone lives in off campus apartments. The parties are not good, and there are no nearby bars. Also, the dining hall is disgusting."
Senior,2,"Despite having some absolutely wonderful professors, Longwood was not a good experience for me. The school is incredibly Greek-centric, so if you choose not to be a part of Greek life, you will struggle to find a social nitch. The office of Financial Aid is very difficult to work with, and generally unconcerned with helping students find scholarships and financial solutions. The Office of Admissions and Records made a clerical error which altered the course of my graduation and left me two classes from my degree with no easy way to earn those credits."
Junior,2,"I transferred from VCU to Longwood University last semester. As far as academics go it is a great school to really focus and get your degree. However the food is horrible. Unlike most colleges the only dinning options students are available to swipe at with blocks is the dining hall. For all the surrounding restaurants you must use cash or the bonus dollars on your meal plan, which is why they disappear so quickly. There is no diversity at all, sometimes it is a bit comforting and makes one often feel the need to conform to their environment instead of embracing who they are."
College Junior,2,"Economically there is a large diversity, but ethically there is next to none. The majority is white. The are some blacks and a handful of Asians. Other than that there are no others. We do have a few foreign exchange students but not for long and it's not many."
College Freshman,2,It's really bad here the campus is so small and there is absolutely nothing to do. The classes are high school level classes and the professors are pretty rude. the Dinning hall is disgusting and have very limited options. If you don't like small towns and small class sizes i would recommend coming here.
College Freshman,2,The school is too boring and slow. I hate being in the country. The only place to go is bowling or Walmart.
College Freshman,2,"I did receive some loans, but i am still struggling with paying for tuition"
College Freshman,2,Issues that are still being worked on...
College Sophomore,2,There are really only fast food options. Farmville is such a tiny town that having lots of sit down or nicer restaurants would be difficult to keep in business especially when students aren't there like in the summer or on winter break.
College Junior,2,"The food is rarely warm, and the combinations are very hit or miss.The amount of times that you will eat grilled cheese, pizza, and cereal because of a lack of better options is ridiculous."
College Sophomore,2,"The dining hall serves the same foods over and over and theres onion in everything. Instead of gaining the ""freshamn 15"" my freshman year I lost about 15 pounds. The only consistent thing at the dining hall is pizza, stale grilled cheese, and fries. Most food options are all the same color and there is little vegatables and hardly every any fresh fruit. The dining hall does a good job of obtaining locally grown foods however. The Student Union has prices that are crazy high and causes students to run out of Bonus dollars early in the second semester"
College Freshman,2,It is a very painful process. Not well informed.
College Freshman,2,"Our Dinning hall is repulsive.  They never have good food or fresh, healthy options.  The cottage cheese drips into the strawberry yogurt on the salad bar and the other day, they served a crunchy waffle with nacho cheese on top with caramelized powdery onion rings to top it off... I don't even know what to call that!"
College Freshman,2,you will live on mcdonalds
Recent Alumnus,2,"As a commuter student (because I lived in Longwood Village apartments), it was extremely frustrating to see cars with Residential and Lancer Park parking passes parked in Commuter spots.  My parking pass was more expensive than those. For them to take up Commuter spots and not receive any kind of penalty was completely ridiculous.  Attendance is very strict, but that's dependent on professors taking attendance and enforcing it.  All of my professors did. As a transfer student, I only had professors in my major, for the most part.  If you miss more than three classes, professors are supposed to drop you from their classes.  If there are extenuating circumstances, they are understanding, though. The honor code is very strictly enforced.  Violations are taken very seriously.  If violated, the student will be sent to J-Board for consequences... no fun!"
College Sophomore,2,"The dining hall stinks and it never has any of the same foods. I wish it had like chicken patties, and grilled chicken, or cheeseburgers daily because we could pick things that we like to eat. Or make mac n cheese that isn't gross. The prices at the STU are very expensive especially for the bbq chicken flatbreads. And the STU store has a lot of things to buy but they are all very expensive to buy."
College Sophomore,2,"Dhall has terrible food.  It serves many of the same things every day and when they do serve something new, it tastes terrible.  The only places you can use bonus dollars are the student union, chick fil a, the pod, and moe's.  There should be more options since Dhall has bad food."
College Sophomore,2,"Too rich for financial aid, too poor for school"
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot to choose from.  Moe's, Chick fil a, Cookout, BWWs, and a few other crappy fast food places that you'll need a car for."
College Freshman,2,Dorms suck unless you get wheeler or cox
College Freshman,2,The town of farmville is poor and it stands out.
College Junior,2,"At Longwood I believe that it is very difficult to receive financial aid. Considering my mother is a widowed parent, we do not receive much to help me through school, but it is better than receiving nothing at all. Each year I have been enrolled I have received less and less and by my senior year I am more than positive that I will not receive anything at all from Longwood University. I understand there has to be enough to go around to all the students but it seems that the limit is decreasing each year."
College Freshman,2,"There are no healthy options. Only Dhall's food upsets many people's stomach and the Student union only has sushi, Einstein's Bagels, and a Pizzeria."
College Freshman,2,I do not know much about off-campus housing other than the fact that the official website is not much help. I do not know where to look to find information about houses/apartments in the area.
College Senior,2,Its hard to get scholarships and then it seems like nobody wants to help you sometimes when you have questions.
College Senior,2,There is not much diversity you may see a non-white student ever so often.
College Sophomore,2,Quality and variety lack severely
College Junior,2,All there is to do is party or go bowling which on certain nights is just a mash-up of drunk college students and locals. Most of my nights are spent in my room because to me its much more appealing.
College Sophomore,2,"There is not enough parking, and what parking there is too far away from everything and over priced."
College Freshman,2,Most of the off campus dining options are unhealthy and there isn't a large variety -- mostly American food. I would like more healthy options and it would be nice to have more vegan options as well.
College Freshman,2,"I have many friends that are in sororities/fraternities and they all love their Greek family. It has never been my thing, but I have thought about joining the Art fraternity."
College Freshman,2,"Just hearing the name 'Farmville' makes people wonder where it is. No one has really heard of it before. I always have to say that its about 1 hour from Richmond VA. Then they all have the same reaction: ""Oh, yeah I think I've heard of that."" When they really haven't."
College Freshman,2,The campus transportation is shared with the community.
College Freshman,2,Its just moes and chickfila.
College Freshman,2,"I am a freshman and do not have my car, but my friends who do have to walk a far distance to get to their cars through the town which sometimes feels unsafe"
College Freshman,2,"I wish they had more options, but I enjoy having it so close. Having Chickfila and Moes so close is nice, but there should be more options within walking distance"
College Freshman,2,Basketball is the most popular sport. No one really pays attention to anything else
College Freshman,2,"We have a high school sized gym for our D-1 basketball teams. Many buildings are old, few are new. Student union is mainly used to buy food and drink very little socializing, few people study there."
College Freshman,2,Most students go out and drink on weekends. Alcohol and marijuana are very easy to find. Other drugs may need more searching. Adderall is also very easy to find
College Freshman,2,"I already got a strike, it sucks. They are strick when is comes to drugs and alcohol."
College Freshman,2,No Wifi in dorms. Everything else is pretty average
College Freshman,2,"Its not the worst, but I would never hype it up tho."
College Freshman,2,Terrible campus dining. You literally 5 damn options to eat here. 
College Freshman,2,Everything but parties are almost non-existent
College Freshman,2,The off-campus housing is not the best at Longwood. Not many options and it is very expensive.
College Freshman,2,The weather does not affect the campus experience since the campus is very small and the campus is not in an area known to have extreme temperatures.
College Sophomore,2,Charley's Waterfront Cafe is the only restaurant that I've been to that was worth gong to again.  The other restaurants are just like the ones i have at home other than Macado's which was just okay!
College Senior,2,"There's not much to do in town besides bowling and going to the local bar, especially since everything except for the restaurants closes at 5pm. Luckily Longwood holds activities on campus for students to go to, but they're not always fun nor do they have something planned every weekend."
College Junior,2,"Longwood has potential to have great school pride. Due to the fact it is a small school, us Lancers need to stick together to stay the strong and supportive school we are. However, our lack of winnings often ""kill the buzz"" of attending games. In all, with help from the student body Longwood has all of the ingredients needed to make create pride in our athletics, we just need a chief to mix them all together."
College Junior,2,"Like high school pizza is offered daily but if you rely on that you will grow tired quickly. Salad bars are available, birthday dinner once a month is something to look forward to. Not the best tours experience the best food you will likley spend your bonus bucks at chic-fil-a, moes, or student union often."
College Junior,2,"Women sports more successful but it was also a womens school for many years before, sports are improving across the board though."
College Freshman,2,"The temperature is crazy! I feel like every morning, it is freezing, but by mid afternoon, it is burning up. Very bipolar."
College Junior,2,"Not many options and what is available to us isn't that great. Also, the hours stink."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The campus is in a very small town, so there are few options. Most students eat on campus."
Alum,1,"very poor. the cops are mean and corrupt they hinder any and all students just trying to have fun on the weekends, the town is small and almost everything closes at 9:00 pm. there's a lot of town violence and drugs are everywhere. other than that they have an excellent english department but the food isnt too good and the dorms are rather bad and very overpriced. the party scene is nice but again you can' t really blow off any steam because the cops are always out to get you. theres also a school wide undercover operation"
Freshman,1,"Longwood is the most boring, clique-y, and repulsive university. The parties, the people, the food, and the campus suck. The campus would be so much better if there wasn't so much construction. I know about 10 people, including myself that are transferring next year or next semester. And I cannot wait to transfer out of this hell hole. However I have noticed people from small towns like it more. So if you're from NOVA or Richmond I would defiantly NOT recommended"
College Freshman,1,Greek life is what this school is all about. If you aren't greek you don't fit in with anything.
College Freshman,1,"When I first decided to come here I was so excited! Sadly I was let down pretty fast. The dinning hall here is awful, there are no activities for students, if you don't have a car there is no where to go except Walmart, and the classes make you feel like you are back in high school. The professors don't care about you and their grading is very erratic and a lot of the ones I have had so far are very rude to you when you have questions. All that is advertised on campus is greek life and if you aren't a part of that then there is nothing to do."
College Sophomore,1,"There are few healthy options and not much variety. If you live in campus housing, you MUST have a meal plan. This is very inconvenient considering I live off campus. The food in the dining hall isn't very good either."
College Freshman,1,"Because both of my parents have college degrees and jobs, it is extremely difficult to receive any financial aid."
College Senior,1,"Parking is Longwood's singular downfall.  The campus police are extremely strict about parking enforcements, and there are nowhere near enough spots for all the students, faculty, staff, visitors, and local people to park.  It is a problem."
College Freshman,1,You need a car. You are basically stuck if you don't have one.
College Freshman,1,"Everyone is republican, from the country and smokes cigarettes. I HATE IT!! "
College Freshman,1,"One selection during lunch and dinner. Breakfast is always the same. Meals are often very similar and some are very gross. Don't let the tour deceive you, food is not that good."
College Freshman,1,MIDDLE OF NOWHERE!!! It is a drive to go see friends.... It is a drive to get to a nice town. 
College Freshman,1,"I hate campus housing!! Every time I visit a friend, I get jealous and want to have their living conditions and housing. Things need change!!"
College Freshman,1,One day it's very hot then the next day it's chilly. It could give you a bad cold.
College Sophomore,1,"Not very challenging, typical students cheat on assignments and exams. Curves are very rare."
College Sophomore,1,"Extremely low level of diversity, and not accepting of anyone besides a typical cookie-cutter student."
College Sophomore,1,"Very hard to receive financial aid, and the grants are unbelievably low. Mainly forced into loans, so students graduate with huge accumulated debt."
College Sophomore,1,"High amounts of alcohol and alcohol peer pressure. Drugs are common as well, and the punishment for both of these offenses are very laid-back."
College Sophomore,1,I wrote an entire paper on the problems with parking on campus. There are more parking passes bought than there are spaces available (for students and for faculty). The spaces are really small and are not good for SUVs. Everyone with a car complains about the parking.
College Freshman,1,"So the parking at LU is terrible. You pay $125 per semester and you have to park pretty far from your dorm. I am a freshman and I have to take a bus to my own car....pretty sad. Upperclassman do park closer than I do but its still a good walk for most of them. They have limited parking space for dropping off loads. You have to take a car to go get groceries or go to a job, so you expect the convenience of your car being right there...nope. The system needs fixed somehow."
College Junior,1,Mostly White Students – Longwood University is a small university that is mostly populated by white students. This sometimes causes friction with the black students because the outside community is mostly black and black students are sometimes confused with locals due to the color of their skin. At college events black students are sometimes treated as locals and barred from the event but if the student was white they would be assumed to be a student and allowed in the event.

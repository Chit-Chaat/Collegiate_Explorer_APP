Freshman,5,"The reason I chose Saint Mary-of-the-Woods is because of the campus size, the beauty of the campus, and the friendly atmosphere of the college. If you're not a fan of huge schools, SMWC is perfect for you. It is easy to find what you are looking for and everyone is very friendly and helpful. I feel safe and happy at the Woods and I would never pick another school to attend."
Freshman,5,"Note: I'm an online-only student, which limits what I can give feedback about. 

I'm in the online paralegal certificate program, which I decided to apply for after seeing the stellar reviews. This program definitely lives up to its reputation. The professors are great, and the content is a great mix of practical and theoretical. I'm especially a fan of PL112, which is a crash course in using the WestLaw database - a fun but extremely practical class that I'm really glad I took, because I think it'll help me the most in my future career. If you're considering the paralegal certificate program, you can't go wrong here."
Sophomore,5,"The classes are small and inviting. Knowing almost everyone on campus really does help you make friends and learn how to stay connected to the communities around you. If you choose to go here, you'll have an amazing academic experience for sure!"
Freshman,5,I loved the atmosphere at Saint Mary’s. It felt like home away from who and everyone was so welcoming. Everyone is so helpful and really work one on one with you about any questions or concerns you may have. I especially love the student ratio which allows for more one on one basis with the students.
Niche User,5,Saint Mary of the Woods has a beautiful campus along with a great atmosphere. All of the professors are very helpful and friendly. As an athlete my professors are willing to work will my schedule so I am able to excel in all areas of my college education.
Freshman,5,It has a beautiful campus and small class sizes that give you more 1:1 time with the professors. There is a lot of philanthropy and history to go with the school. It has newer liberal arts opportunities that some public liberal arts schools may not have such as; strong music therapy and art therapy majors.
Alum,5,I loved the atmosphere of the Woods! Everyone is so welcoming and is all about helping you suceed. The class size is very small once you get into your major which allows you to create a better relationship with your professors. I do wish that they offered a wider variety of majors in science.
Freshman,5,"This is only my third week at SMWC as an online student, but even after going to campus once and emailing and talking to professors, registrars, and my advisor I absolutely love it. Everyone strives to help you succeed and are really helpful and also very understanding. Everyone I know that has gone here was right! It is a beautiful amazing college. Everybody empowers each other and I’ve met some incredible folks."
Senior,5,Great college to attend. Ranked best school to attend by USNews. The campus is beautiful. The professors are wonderful to work with. And the staff are a wonderful group of people. I am blessed to attend this beautiful college.
Junior,5,The campus is absolutely beautiful and amazing. The professors and instructors truly care about your success. I would like to see that the financial aid office be more helpful in finding ways to pay for tuition since it is so expensive.
Alum,5,"I love this school. My four year experience was priceless! Small class, sizes, caring professors, BEAUTIFUL campus."
Alum,5,"As a student at SMWC, I had an unbelievably positive experience academically, socially and culturally - I was able to study abroad, to hold leadership positions in many campus groups and committees, to develop my own initiatives, and I felt as though I was 100% supported academically. As an alumni, I have felt that same support through career counseling, alumni networking, and the simple, yet unique feeling of being ""home"" when I'm on campus."
Alum,5,"This place is the perfect place to empower leaders. It breads strong, intelligent and capable leaders with a voice. SMWC absolutely changed my life and gave me opportunities I'm positive I wouldn't have had anywhere else. It's a setting designed to help students succeed. The smallness helps to give students more support from professors, faculty and staff and an easier time accessing resources. Town is just minutes away with plenty of things to do and places to go for a night out and away from homework. It provided me the opportunity to play college sports, make lifelong friends and launched me into a career I love just 2.5 months after graduation. Without a doubt the best decision of my life was to attend this college and I owe so much of my success to my alma mater and the faculty/staff who helped encourage, support and challenge me along the way. You will not regret the decision to attend Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College!"
Alum,5,I loved my experience at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College. The Masters of Leadership Development was a perfect fit for me. I was able to work full-time and complete my degree in one year. The skills I learned were invaluable and the professors were wonderful. They really cared about me and my future.
Alum,5,"As a graduate of the campus program, I recommend that anyone looking for a small liberal arts college experience look into Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College! The people, the environment and the programs are truly something special. College is an experience and an investment in your future...make the right one. Don't miss out on what SMWC has to offer you!"
Works Here,5,"As the parent of a 2016 graduate of the college, I am very pleased with the quality of education she experienced while at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College. Because it is a small, private school, she had excellent personal attention from faculty, she was able to become a leader on campus, she learned how to think for herself, she felt encouraged to study abroad and participate in numerous service learning trips. We are both exceedingly pleased with the degree she earned, and the beautiful campus buildings, grounds and atmosphere is just icing on the cake!"

College Junior,5,"Saint Mary-of-the-Woods is a small private Catholic based institution that has many unique major for it's students, this being a top notch Music Therapy program and Equine program and facilities, as well as others. My favorite thing about the Woods is being able to be involved all over campus even if that is not my concentrated study, I am able to learn about all things across a wide spectrum of teaching and students. We are very rooted in the history and service of the school, as well as our connection with the Sisters of Providence who with their Foundress Saint Mother Theodore Guerin founded our school in 1840."
College Freshman,5,I enjoy going to class every day. Any questions I have I am able to ask and not afraid to ask for help.
College Freshman,5,They were quick to get me registered and ready for school on the first day. I was a transfer and it took a little while to get transcripts from Ivy Tech.
College Freshman,5,"I love Saint Mary of the Woods and i am so glad I am going there, the atmosphere is wonderful and everyone is so helpful and want you to succeed."
College Sophomore,5,"Saint Mary-of-the-Woods is in the top five colleges to attend. The landscaping and story is amazing, and everyone is very helpful when it comes to your academic future."

College Sophomore,5,There really isn't a party scene
College Freshman,5,The administration are very friendly and take the time to get to know you.
College Freshman,5,we have a low crime rate. There is security around the clock and cameras. Campus gives you securities number to put in your phone. You can call them if you're in the parking lot and they will come and walk you to the door. I feel very safe on this campus.
College Freshman,5,I always feel safe on campus.
College Junior,5,I did not have issues getting into the school. It was a fast process!
College Junior,5,The advisors work with you on your work load. They know what classes work with your busy schedule.
College Junior,5,The academics are great at this school. The workload fits the college load and all the hard work pays off.
College Junior,5,This school is the best I've every been too and I enjoy every moment of being apart of the school.
College Junior,5,The campus is really safe.

College Junior,5,Art therapy is everything I would wish and more
College Sophomore,5,"Safety is always a big thing with everywhere you go and since it is a small town once something happens people know quickly and get a problem solved. Plus, there is always something to do on and off campus and students are always welcomed everywhere with open arms."
College Sophomore,5,"SMWC welcomes foreign exchange students, students of all beliefs, of all sexual orientation, political beliefs, economic background, and diversity because every woman deserves the right to learn and prosper throughout life and make a name for herself."
College Sophomore,5,"The security guards are always on campus. I see them in their office in the basement of the resident halls every time I pass by and they are always patrolling around campus. If you need anything, ask them. They are really good to talk to and enjoy student interaction."
College Senior,5,"We have an incredible intern coordinator, she uses her networking skills to find internships for all areas.  Pay has been more than reasonable for each internship I have had.  Time commitment has been based upon my school commitments and other factors.  Hours per week can range from 15-40 hours."
College Senior,5,Being in the accounting program is an incredible experience.  The department head is also with marketing at the Children's Museum of Terre Haute.  There are endless opportunities for internships if you use proper networking tools.
Recent Alumnus,5,The atmosphere is wonderful.  Beautiful campus with positive attitutes every day!!!
Recent Alumnus,5,"Human Service Major gives you a wide range of career options.  My career goals are working for a school as a Counselor/Social Worker.  I had a great experience gaining my BS at St Mary of the Woods College.  The instructors are very knowledgeable, concerned, and go above and beyond the call of duty!!!!  They want their students to be successful!!!!"
Recent Alumnus,5,The campus life is great.  Students enjoy the beautiful campus and convenience.
College Junior,5,"I currently live in Bloomington, IN and attending Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College online. I found that this is the best way for me to attend school with my given situation."
College Junior,5,I have only had good experiences with the schools academics.
College Junior,5,"The academics are amazing, and everyone is dedicated to providing excellent education for all."
College Sophomore,5,This schools curriculum is excellent. And it is a great honor to receive a woods ring when you graduate.
College Sophomore,5,"Saint Mary of the Woods campus is located in a remote location and has campus security.  Because the campus is a small women's college, safety is relatively low."
College Freshman,5,Everything is useful and helpful. I don't have any trouble with any of it.
College Senior,5,"SMWC doesn't really have ""varsity"" sports as such because we do not have a NCAA classification. However, a huge number of campus girls do participate in sports and teachers are very understanding. We are in the process of getting funding for a new athletic center that would make us eligible for NCAA classification."
College Sophomore,5,Getting into my major was easy.  All I had to do was declare it.  My advisor was really good about telling me what classes I needed to take and when and how many hours I should have.  Delcaring my minor was pretty easy also.  I just had to find the advisor for it and have him sign a paper then turn it in to the Registrar.
College Freshman,5,The drug scene at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College is not abundant at all. I am not saying that students don't participate in drugs but I know for a fact that it's not done on campus.
College Senior,5,"Dry Campus – Our campus is alcohol and smoke free. We do have students that smoke, but they usually go smoke in their cars. We have very tight policies if you are caught with alcohol on campus. You may drink off campus and return, but alcohol is not allowed in your possession."
College Freshman,5,"Online Student Only – I am a complete distance learner, am not able to accurately answer the school's on campus computer facilities."
College Sophomore,5,"Totally Supported – There are plenty of study areas.  The library is huge, supremely stocked, and the ideal ""quiet"" area.  The dining hall is even a pleasant study experience.  The whole campus, itself, is dedicated to the students' educational experience."
College Sophomore,5,The winter makes the campus look like a wonderland.  The spring is absolutely beautiful.  The summers are gorgeous.  The fall is awesome.  The whole campus takes on the look of the season and is just breathtaking!
Junior,4,"I like the small classroom experience at the Woods. Being a nursing major it helps have a close nit relationship with my peers. 

I would like to see a change in accommodation of study areas throughout campus. It can get crowded in the few study spaces and I hope one day they expand on this endeavor."
Senior,4,I have had a very great experience at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College.  I have recieved great education and received more funding here than at any other school. All departments really work well with you to get you done with school with the greatest success.
Junior,4,Private college that provides a lot of opportunities for kids in all aspects. There is a lot of leadership roles we can apply for and activities to be involved in.
Freshman,4,I love Saint Mary's. Everyone is friendly and it's a great community to live in. My professors are the best I've ever had and they always make sure everyone in the class understands a topic before moving on. I think parking is a big issue here so I would like to see that change.
Senior,4,I have had an overall good experience at Saint Mary of the woods College. I have had a lot of struggles that have caused me to be a little distracted and the school has worked with me to achieve my overall goal of getting my bachelors degree. I enjoy the tutoring option and the help each professor gives and the academics are good as well.
Junior,4,I love SMWC. I love the campus environment and the teachers. The school is a dry campus. There is no drugs or alcohol allowed on campus I love that because I'm not really into the party scene. For people who are big parties should think about that before coming here.
Freshman,4,"The campus is gorgeous. The financial aid is not so great, but all the professors are so welcoming and kind."
Freshman,4,Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College is an awesome school. Since it's so small you know just about everyone! The professors are wonderful and the small class sizes you get plenty of one on one help.
Sophomore,4,"I love my small campus and the opportunities it brings to get involved. Everyone here is so kind, friendly, and helpful! The dorms are spacious and they maintain some of the original charms from when the building was first built in 1923. The only real complaint I have is that the food they feed us here is expensive and not great quality. Other than that I believe I go to a great college with amazing character."
Freshman,4,"The people here at SMWC are fabulous and very friendly! However, some of the teachers don't have the best teaching methods! "
College Senior,4,"SMWC has been very convenient for me as a working mom. The online module is very practical and easy to navigate. The professors are likable and knowledgeable, and for the most part very available to students. The study material has been largely engaging and interesting. 

However, the faculty departments are somewhat evasive and very difficult to reach by phone. Many of my previous credits from a community college were NOT transferable, even though I did thorough research before deciding on SMWC. I discovered this to my chagrin and was forced to re-take several courses (dangerously depleting my financial aid). If you choose to transfer credits from another school, do not expect a straightforward answer from anyone at SMWC concerning this process. Expect to re-take even the most generic generals (ie English 101!!!, Intro to Philosophy, Intro to Religion/Spirituality, most Math courses, etc)."
College Junior,4,"Athletics is a huge part of campus for many students, games are attended and athletes are supported through community and scholarships. All of the athletes are wonderful and passionate about the sport they are apart of!"
College Senior,4,for a small all women's college they have some of the top teams.
College Junior,4,I am in the Masters of Leadership Development program. Class size is small and majority of work is done online.
College Senior,4,The drawback is having a commute to campus for classes.  For online classes it is great
College Student,4,Seems like it will be exciting. Love the small campus life.
College Freshman,4,The buildings are older but the rooms are still nice.
College Freshman,4,We have a lot of courses to choose from.
College Freshman,4,Terre Haute has a lot to offer. There are many attractions and shopping centers. There are also a lot of sports events and concerts.
College Freshman,4,Terre Huate is right down the road. The small city offers a large variety of restaurants and fast food.
College Junior,4,I am in Health Care Administration with a minor in Human Resources. SMWC is one of the best schools in Indiana for Human Resources.
College Junior,4,"You will have some very strict professors but, they want you to be successful. If you have questions ask. I'm a online student and my professors email me back within 12 hrs."
College Junior,4,I am a online student. Great experience so far!
College Junior,4,The career advisors and student advisors are great about getting you the help you need to find internship/job opportunities. The programs are fantastic and the faculty will always help you achieve your goal of graduating.
College Junior,4,The campus is great about accepting anyone
College Sophomore,4,Love that we dont have to pay for anything related to technology. Something I love about this school. They check our computers at the beginning of every school year to make sure they are safe and provide us with free software. Some computers should be updated but everything is useful and we are getting newer technology and improvements as we speak.
College Freshman,4,The curriculum is challenging. The career center can help get you a internship or even a job after you graduate..
College Freshman,4,There are emails sent out about how the teams did. This lets the entire campus know how the teams did even if they couldn't make it to the game.
College Freshman,4,How close we can get to our teachers. We can get one on one time pretty much any time we need help.
College Freshman,4,I love how we are only 20 mins from Terra Haute.  This means we don't have to drive far for fun things to do.
College Student,4,"I haven't starting any accounting classes just yet, so I cannot answer this question."
College Student,4,Since I attend online I do not know too much about the sports at the school.
College Student,4,"This is my first semester at this college so, so far so good."
College Student,4,I attend online so the weather does not affect me.
College Student,4,I attend online so I do know really know about the parking situation at the school.
College Sophomore,4,They have a huge diversity in majors I just wish they had a minor or major in dance because I love dance but if you take that out it is absolutely fantastic!
College Junior,4,I have found that the transportation is great at the school.
College Sophomore,4,The dining area is beautiful and spacious. There is a nice variety of tasty food.
College Freshman,4,"They have great sports teams, I'm just not really interested in sports besides watching them. GO POMEROYS!!"
College Sophomore,4,"This is an all girls school so no guys to worry about.  The girls are more laid back because of it.  We all get along pretty well.  As for looks, we actually don't get gussied up very much because of the lack of guys to impress."
College Senior,2,It is currently a women's college.
College Sophomore,2,The teachers are awesome and the school was to. The atmosphere was unorganized and the students were treated as children.
College Junior,2,The atmosphere in Terre Haute is horrible.
College Senior,2,"We live in the outskirts of Terre Haute.  In order to go to any off campus dining including McDonalds it is a 15-20 minute drive which is inconvenient, especially when the lunch hours are from 12-1."
College Sophomore,2,The campus is beautiful but there are not many extracurricular activities available. SMWC is very close to Terre Haute so it is cool if you have transportation because you can go do things at the other schools in the city or find outside activities to do. Its not that great if you don't have transportation.
College Sophomore,2,On campus is cool but it would be nice to go off campus
College Senior,2,"This is a Catholic college, but yet Catholics are in the minority and even sometimes under attack by other students and even faculty! An emphasis on music and arts programs brings a lot of people with ""alternative"" lifestyles, which can make life uncomfortable."
College Junior,2,"It's a Catholic School, What Do You Expect? Drinking and drug use on campus is a big no-no. Even if you are 21+, you will get into a lot of trouble if alcohol or any illegal substances are found in your room. If you are legal, keep it off campus. 
Also, visitation is strictly enforced. If your guest stays one minute past visiting hours, an RA is sent to your room- sometimes with security. Boyfriends cannot stay the night, ever. Guests have to be signed in and out each time they come in Le Fer. It's pretty strict."
College Junior,2,"Transporation Is Hard to Find – The first two years of college, I didn't have a car and had to rely on my friends and roommate for rides into town. If you didn't have friends with cars, you were pretty much out of luck. No buses come into West Terre Haute. The only time there are ""Shuttles"" were for Walmart and Honey Creek Mall trips once every 2 or 3 months. The moral of the story is to have your own vehicle."
College Sophomore,2,Boring Terre Haute – There isn't much variety of things to do in the Haute. It's quite boring.
College Junior,2,there are not a lot of attractions around the school for students to attend
College Freshman,2,"For Such a Small School, the Administration Is Not Very Cooperative – The School officials are very hard to deal with if they are ever around. I came to the school becuase I was told that the SMWC faculty would work with me and make me feel at home. All I have encountered is resistance and this has made me seriously rethink my decisions about coming here."
College Senior,1,I don't even think it is a thing here
College Sophomore,1,"We are treated like children, its a boarding school were you get your bachelors. We have to escort any guys we have over to the basement where their bathroom is. cant be loud because our neighbors complain and want you to get in trouble. So girls here are inconsiderate of the word FUN. We have to sign in and out guests by a certain time. even girls are limited to the amount of times they are allowed to sleep over. Ridiculous! We get snack at 9 PM, only good thing  this school has going for it. Noise violations frequent, we are allowed to do nothing!"
College Sophomore,1,Were a dry campus and smoke free so everything is done on the DL. RA's always trying to ruin everyone's fun so its best again to leave this campus at night and go to ROSE!
College Sophomore,1,Unless you go off campus youre night is full of homework and your boyfriend is a pillow. Go out to rose hulman were the parties get crazy! Lots of bars out here too bad im not  21 cant wait until I am though.
College Sophomore,1,Its terre haute nothing is here! We sign a contract that makes it impossible to live off campus!
College Sophomore,1,"There is virtually no transportation, given that we are in a super sketch town we should have a freaking bus or something. Again no consideration for students actual life. Its not a Boarding school!"
College Senior,1,Therre is no nightlife at our school.  We are a very conservative and classy school.  If you are interesting in parties or the bar/club scene you must travel to one of the neighboring colleges in our community.
College Senior,1,Students are not allowed to live off-campus unless their permanent residence is within 45 miles and they live with their parents. On-campus housing is adequate but sometimes less than desirable.
College Junior,1,"Terre Haute- Dry Town – Terre Haute is a very small town, and also Meth capital of Indiana. There really isn't much to do besides Meth and to go ""spookin.'"""
College Senior,1,"Without a Car, Find Friends – Its all in the title. A new system was introduced whereby every friday a few students can sign up to take the van to the main town to shop. But other than that its like being on island with no boat. So my advice is invest in car, even a ""hoopty"" or make some friends."
College Freshman,1,It is very hard to stay on campus without a car. It is advised for you to have a car since the school is so small and they have very limited transportation possibilities.
College Freshman,1,"There is no greek life, although there is a big sister little sister program"
College Freshman,1,"Not All That Great – Softball field
Workout room
Library
Computers
No campus activities"
College Student,1,Campus or Home – There are really no other places to find housing. You can choose from finding a place in the town of West Terre Haute or in Terre Haute but there really isn't very many places to find another housing area nearby.
College Freshman,1,The Process Is Terrible and the Fees Are Outrageous – The financial aid representatives are uneducated and are unable to give adequate information about financial aid. They are difficult to work with and most people end up with a mess. The tuition has also been raising to ridiculous levels making affordability nonexistent.

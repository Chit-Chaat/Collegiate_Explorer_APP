Sophomore,5,Arcadia University is a school where everyone belongs and is accepted. Its small size creates a great community feeling atmosphere to its students. The professors see each student as an individual and goes out of their way to help them in any way they can.
Sophomore,5,The professors and university overall were very flexible and understanding when things changed to online learning. They still offered one on one help if the student wanted/needed and were always quick to respond to emails.
Junior,5,"Arcadia is a tight knit community where the professors truly care about the education and success of their students. They know you by name, they know how you learn, and where your strengths and weaknesses lie. In terms of campus life, it can get quiet. Finding the right people is essential."
Sophomore,5,"Arcadia University has the best opportunities from study abroad to scholarships. Those specific elements have helped me be more productive with making smart college decisions. Not only has the educational experience been amazing, the environment of living with others and learning to be an adult improved fast. However, one thing I would suggest as a change would be to have more parties that everyone can enjoy from time to time."
Sophomore,5,My online experience was a bit difficult the first two weeks but I worked through the frustration and started to think about the good that comes out of the hard work. It taught me to learn how to work in different environments especially when it comes down to an emergency.
Sophomore,5,"I have not taken any online classes with Arcadia yet, but have heard that the teachers are extremely helpful with helping their students to engage in their coursework online, and understand it!"
Sophomore,5,"This school is very tight-knit and friendly. Everybody is a somebody! The school pride is so engaging, and there is so much for any type of student to take part in."
Sophomore,5,My time so far at Arcadia university has given me exposure to a wide variety of people with varying talents and beliefs. expensive.
Freshman,5,Arcadia has a beautiful campus and wonderful food. Something I would like to see improve is more social events in the area to meet new people.
Freshman,5,"Arcadia has a wonderfully welcoming atmosphere. The campus itself is just absolutely stunning. With a wide variety of courses and majors to choose from, and just a train ride away from the city, Arcadia is the place to be!"
Niche User,5,"I loved Arcadia. The campus looks like an absolute castle. I went to visit with softball coach and then took a tour and everything about the campus is gorgeous. The hospitality of everybody is incredible and it has a very low rime rate, though only being 8 minutes away from Philadelphia."
Freshman,5,Arcadia is such a beautiful campus and their staff is so welcoming. They are more than willing to go the extra mile to help their students.
Niche User,5,"I felt at home right away and I love the lacrosse team and how welcoming they are. Coach Hosford is awesome. When I came for my overnight I sat in on a class and loved the personal connection with the professor. Lastly, the physical therapy program is very appealing."
Niche User,5,I fell in love with Arcadia the first time I visited. The campus is absolutely gorgeous! The students and staff that I met were all very nice! They have a really nice range of majors as well!
Freshman,5,Arcadia Univeristy was a great fit for me because of the small class sizes and how welcoming everyone is. Their academics are absolutely amazing and there is free tutoring offered in every class along with a writing center to help you edit your writing pieces. Arcadia is an amazing school.
Sophomore,5,"Arcadia University is a school that wants students to be involved. There are always opportunities to meet new people from all around the world because the university is known for being the #1 school in the nation for study abroad! If you want to broaden your mind on different culture, Arcadia is the university for you."
Graduate Student,5,I loved the study abroad program offered to the transfer students. I had an amazing experience meeting so many people from various backgrounds
Senior,5,"I call it the goldilocks school. It's not too small where nothing happens, but it's not too big where you don't know what's happening. I love it. It's so inclusive, and there so much voice in the student body. All professors actually care, especially the adjuncts."
Niche User,5,I like the atmosphere at Arcadia University. The people and professors were friendly when I met them. I'm looking forward to attend in Fall 2018.
Junior,5,"I have had a lovely experience at Arcadia so far. My classes are small, allowing me ample interaction with my professors and the subject matter through deep discussion with students who actually care about the classes they take. I have gone to China and Washington DC for conferences and will be spending a year abroad in an opportunity to further my education. This school offers not just an education, but an experience that will change you for the better."
Sophomore,5,"Arcadia is a small school but a school that  I love. It has an amazing study abroad program that is greatly emphasized. It also has a fabulous science department tat prepares students for even further education. The one downside to Arcadia is how expensive the tuition is. I do not see the need for the outlandish price of Arcadia when it is compared to similar schools with lower tuition. Otherwise, Arcadia is a great school to further my education."
Sophomore,5,It's a really great school. It's very diverse and the best thing is that we not only have our major requirements but the schools requirements and the great thing about that is that we are able to broaden our views on different things. 
College Sophomore,5,Everyone goes out and parties every weekend.
College Sophomore,5,Diversity helps when going out into the world to work.

College Freshman,5,You are always able to get help from administration.
College Freshman,5,"Arcadia is one of the safest environments I have been in. As I stated before, everyoje on the campus acts like one big family. As we all know, families look out for one another."
College Freshman,5,There is air conditioning in all dorms except for the castle. All dorms and the castle areally in amazing condition and are well kept
College Freshman,5,I will be playing soccer here and the athletic community is such a huge family to be a part of. Even the intermural sports are a lot of fun and are a very fun way to get the community together. Everyone is a. Part of one big family.
College Freshman,5,Arcadia has been a life changing experience for me. The orientations make me extremely excited. The environment of this school is something words cannot describe. The people are all unique and respectable and it is such a beautiful place to be.
College Freshman,5,"I am just now beginning my second semester here, and I am quite sure that I will be at Arcadia for all four years. I find the classes very engaging and the material full of depth. Every class really encourages students to form their own opinions about the world. The professors are all very inspiring and excited to teach, and the study abroad program pushes every student to venture abroad to further their learning. I am very satisfied here."
College Sophomore,5,"We have call boxes around the campus perimeter, Public Safety that patrols 24/7 and the Glenside police that patrol twice throughout the day. I've never felt unsafe, even walking from the library to my Oak Summit apartment 15 minutes away at 2am."
College Freshman,5,Arcadia has a prestigious academic system. They offer you nothing but the best and the academic advisors make sure you are taking the correct classes at the correct time and make sure you do well. If you begin to really struggle with the major they offer you many solutions; from dropping/withdrawing from a class to changing your major. They want you to succeed and they will offer you amazing courses based off your interests/requirements.
College Freshman,5,"Arcadia consistently sends out emails regarding the career center about employment opportunities in the fields based off your major. I have not gone to the actual center yet but, I've heard it is very accomodating."
College Freshman,5,"I was fortunate enough to be placed in a rather odd housing situation. I am currently housed in an on-campus castle that houses 7 girls including myself in one room. I could not be more happy with this situation, even though at first I was terrified, and I would highly suggest it to anyone who is considering it."
College Sophomore,5,among all the universities I applied to Arcadia was the one that made the process smoother for me
College Junior,5,"My experience at Arcadia has been incredible so far. I'm more than halfway through my college career, and while it's gone by faster than I'd like, I don't regret any of it. The professors in my department are incredible, make the time spent in the classroom fun, and my classes are always interesting. The campus is small, but beautiful. There are varying opinions about this school, but I'm in the group that loves it."
College Junior,5,"The Physical Therapy Program at Arcadia University is a great program. They focus on school being a learning opportunity- in the classroom is where you practice, make mistakes and learn from them before you enter the clinic and the real world. The teachers have thought out every detail of the curriculum; everything we do and when we do it is well planned out to give us the best experience. The program also focuses on strong camaraderie among classmates."
College Sophomore,5,"Arcadia University was always my top pick because of the study abroad options (we're number one in the country) among other factors. I was able to study in London, England for the first semester of my first year of college which was an incredible way to start my four-year experience. I was taught in the UK university system and learned so much from the different methods that were used. Through my AU professors overseas I was given the opportunity to shadow several different members of Parliament and go behind the scenes at large functions. When I returned to AU's campus in Glenside, PA I walked in to another world, so the novelty of the first year of college never wore off. Three months in to the spring semester I traveled to Shanghai and Da'Lian, China with a Preview course, and for a fraction of the price which I would normally pay. Arcadia allows me to learn about and explore so many more cultures than I would have had available to me if I were to have gone elsewhere. I am now planning to study abroad for the entirety of my junior year, the fall in Toledo, Spain and Barcelona, Spain in the Spring for my respective fields of study."
College Sophomore,5,"If I had the option to choose a university again, I would stick with the school I am at because it really is a great school. I've made so many great friends and I got to live in a castle my first-year. I know my classmates and professors well because we have such small class sizes. My school has great study abroad programs and they have a program for first-years called preview, which is a week long travel experience and it's a one of a kind experience. There are always things to do on campus and the school has great info sessions and other programs that can help students out in the future."
College Freshman,5,As of today I haven't started attending my school but so far everything about it seems great. I begin In late August. My school is a small private school with a small population of students and an amazing abroad program. This school offers so many opportunities for what i want to major in.
College Freshman,5,There is no Greek Life.
College Freshman,5,"The security on campus is excellent. There are rare cases of campus crime. In terms of personal safety, I rarely felt unsafe walking around campus at night. Public safety is always on rounds, and are there to assist anyone who is in need. Moreover, the public safety staff are very friendly."
College Freshman,5,"I'm a commuter, and sometimes if I decide to stay on campus til like 3 am, I feel perfectly fine and safe doing so. The campus is just as lit up at night as it is during the day. Not worried at all."
College Freshman,5,The Political Science program is amazing. The teachers are passionate and committed to their students.
College Freshman,5,Lots of small business with grocery within walking distance from campus.
College Senior,5,I love my program. We are a tight knit family since we are a small school and program. All the teacher's are incredible and willing to help with whatever you need. Our program includes an internship that is very different from most since we work closely with our supervisors patients and see up close what it is like to be an Art Therapist everyday. The workload is sometimes challenging but it prepares you for the future career path.
College Senior,5,I have never felt endangered in any way
College Senior,5,Off Campus Housing provides a sense of independence while being able to be close to assistance and classes. It is 100% the way to go if you are looking for a way to progress in your adulthood.
College Sophomore,5,There are various apartment off-campus that are very affordable and comfortable.
College Sophomore,5,I am very happy with my education and the University and I am sure that will get job.
College Sophomore,5,Lots of ways to get an internship.
College Sophomore,5,"Arcadia is all about study abroad which is great for me because I'm an international studies major. Most of the faculty on campus has a great deal of knowledge about certain parts of the world and it's super easy to study abroad. The workload isn't too heavy, but it's not super easy either. Also because the school is located so close to Philly, there are a lot of internship fairs and opportunities."
College Junior,5,"I'm so happy with my chosen major. If I could do it all again, I would hope that I would know what I want from the start but life isn't about HOW you get there, it's also the process, so no. I actually wouldn't change anything."
College Sophomore,5,"if anyone is caught using drugs of some sort, they are taking to public safety. The RA's write up the students and and area coordinator takes them in her hands. These students first warning is to join alcohol and drug use classes to prevent from another encounter next time. "
Junior,4,"Arcadia is a great university that focuses on creating students with global perspectives, and although they highlights their diversity among students they could take steps to improve the racial and gender diversity"
Junior,4,"The professors tried their best to make switching to an online learning platform as seamless as possible. It went well, and students were encouraged to continue with the semester as well as they could, with leniency and understanding that each student's position was different and difficult."
Sophomore,4,"I love Arcadia. The campus is amazing, it’s truly the ideal small campus. The staff is very understanding and you can really get the chance to know them and vice versa. The students on campus are fairly friendly and I enjoy every minute on campus."
Sophomore,4,"Arcadia University is a great school. The small environment helps with adjusting to college life. At Arcadia, you will never feel lonely. When you go to the chat or dining hall, you will always see someone you know, and be greeted with a smile! 
In the classroom, teachers know your name and truly want to help you in any way possible. Arcadia University is truly a community that helps you reach your goals and create life-long memories."
Sophomore,4,"I feel like Arcadia is a place where I can truly belong. There are definitely some flaws - the campus doesn't prioritize accessibility for disabled students, and a lot of the buildings are run-down and in need of repair. The theatre, science, and media departments don't have adequate equipment. The professors make up for that, though, with their high-quality education and passion for teaching."
Freshman,4,Very accepting and diverse! The staff are extremely helpful and the financial aid they offer is absolutely amazing. If they could have more food options that’d be amazing.
Alum,4,"As someone who wanted an international experience, Arcadia was great! There's lots of opportunity and support for students who want to study abroad. Each department cares about the students they work with. While still in school, there were issues with administration, but it seems like improvements have been made while under new leadership."
Sophomore,4,"Due to its smaller size, there is great opportunity for one-on-one learning in and outside the classroom; your curriculum is better tailored to your personal goals and aspirations, and most professors make themselves available for research, advice, recommendations, and so forth. If you are looking for a party school, Arcadia isn't for you, although we do have a range of activities running every weekend for students, including night showings of the latest box office successes. Arcadia is centered on learning through action and community service, and encourages students to explore broader horizons––which justifies its #1 rank nationally for study abroad participation."
Sophomore,4,"As a sophomore at Arcadia University, I have experienced highs and lows of Arcadia. If I did not have such wonderful financial aid, I would not attend Arcadia. Food and campus facilities are subpar, basically what you would expect. Some days are better, some are worse. Professors are great, as it is a small school. There's definitely variation between departments, but most professors are communicative, understanding, and fair. Campus social life is below subpar. Unless you make a close group of friends early on, odds are you will not have a booming social life here. There are no parties. Ever. Public safety and resident assistants are strict. On-campus housing is quiet, no one is on campus over the weekends. There is next to nothing to do around the area of Arcadia unless you own a car."
Senior,4,"Arcadia is a small school with a tight knit community. It has a wide variety of clubs and organizations to get involved in that can fit any interest. It is located in Glenside, which has a nice, small-town feel, but is also very close to the train station to provide easy access to the city. Arcadia has a lot of really great professors (but also some aggressively mediocre ones) and an amazing study abroad program (especially Preview!)."
Junior,4,"Arcadia is a great place to learn because of the class sizes. Learning is so personalized. It is easy to make and maintain professional relationships with the professors in order to achieve educational goals. Overall, the campus is beautiful and a wonderful place to learn."
Senior,4,"Smaller school, everyone is very friendly. You can find your niche here fairly quick. There’s only a few options for food, but we usually have free events that offer more variety. I love the study abroad program! They make it so easy for kids to go abroad and I went to London"
Junior,4,"I love Arcadia University because of the personal attention they give to their students, the academic programs offered, and their study abroad program. Arcadia’s average class size is 14. The student to faculty ratio is 12 to 1. I like that you get to know all of your classmates and you develop a relationship with your professor. I like having a name not an ID number. The professor’s are easy to talk to and really go above and beyond to help students. Additionally, Arcadia has amazing programs. Personally, I love the Biology department and know all the professors really well. Other majors talk highly of their programs, professors. Lastly, Arcadia is ranked #1 for study abroad participation for the ninth consecutive year. Arcadia offers two programs for first year students that opens their eyes to the opportunities that we have abroad. Students have the ability to travel and study wherever they want."
Senior,4,"Arcadia University is a small university that provides their students with a lot of opportunities to be involved.  The university has 50+ student organizations and students have the opportunity to become a part of university committees and become an Arcadia Ambassador.  Arcadia is huge in study abroad as they currently offer programs like FYSAE (first year study abroad experience), where students can study abroad for a semester during their first year, a spring Preview experience where first year and transfer students are able to travel to various places around the world over spring break, a Global Field Study Experience that is similar to Preview, semester, summer, and academic years abroad, as well as a study away experience in Washington D.C..  Some of the buildings on campus, including dorms are in need of updates, but overall, I am satisfied with my experience at Arcadia University."
Senior,4,The professors and administrators at Arcadia University are very supportive of their students. No matter if you are someone they met for the first time or a long time student the treatment is the best quality.
Graduate Student,4,"The campus is beautiful. I've had no issues with anything during my time here at Arcadia. Only issues I've had thus far are with the security office- we were advised that PA students would have 24 hr access to brubaker hall, but months later its still an issue and theyre not responsive to email and dont change anything."
Sophomore,4,I love the school so far. I met good friends and also great professors. I made some mistakes relating to academics like not using my resources to benefit me or studying at the last minute. I'm excited for next year.
Alum,4,"Lovely campus, good professors overall, small class sizes. Not too much to do in the immediate surrounding area, but I was a commuter, so it wasn't too big of a deal for me. Never lived on campus, so can't say much about campus housing."
Senior,4,"I love the small campus and small class sizes, it has a great family aspect to it. I love how helpful and caring the professors are, with the small class sizes they are given the opportunity to really build a relationship with you. The campus is well taken care of and very beautiful with lots of open space for outdoor studying. I would like to see more campus life and activities for students. The food could also be improved, but I feel like that is a problem at most campuses. Overall, I have really enjoyed my four years at Arcadia."
Alum,4,"Study abroad school with many international students.  Encourages students to study abroad for breaks or semesters.   Not a big party school, which is what I was looking for.  Expensive like many institutions, overpriced, but what are you to do in America when trying to go to school.  :/  Not s ton of sports, no football.  AGain not something I was looking for. Division 3 athletics.  Nice ceramics department which is unique to many universities."
Alum,4,My over all experience was very good. The classes were small and the professor were very helpful. I was a business administration major and my academic advisor  was extremely resourceful. I believe the university could work on the overall diversity.
Freshman,4,"Arcadia is a good school, it’s very unique and has a gorgeous campus! They have helped me with all of my financial needs as well as academic. I have made some of my best friends here as well. It’s a small campus, which is actually really amazing to have."
Graduate Student,4,"My experience has been, for the most part, a good one.  I have learn a lot. Teacher are like any school some good and some not so much.  They use video classes which for some subjects you really need a hands on professor.  They listen to students concerns."
Senior,4,"I have had a pretty good experience! The profs are awesome, classes are small and the people are friendly. It is a small university but it is great if you dont want a huge university."
Junior,4,"I am a student athlete here at Arcadia University. The campus is beautiful, the professors and academic resources are helpful, and the athletic teams are relatively close to one another."
Sophomore,4,A small campus with multiple options to live on campus. Many engaging professors that want their students to succeed. Most students leave near by or just commute. Campus is very empty on weekends. The biology classes have amazing professors and a multitude of fun classes and labs. I'm currently a sophomore bio major.
Junior,4,The small classroom setting allows you to talk to your professor one on one. Some professors are amazing and some are terrible. It's always good to ask around about how they teach.
Senior,4,"I love Arcadia! I love the class sizes and close-knit environment. If there was one thing I could change it would be relations between students and administrators, but it seems that with the new President, relations are slowly improving."
Sophomore,4,Arcadia is an academically rigorous college and I can assure you on that. Academics at Arcadia will prepare you for anything coming your way starting your first year.
Freshman,4,"So far my experience with Arcadia has been good. The staff cares about your well being, there are a lot of events for students, and the community is welcoming. One thing Arcadia can change is improving job security for their teachers."
Junior,4,"The best study abroad programs in the country. They make it affordable and give so many different opportunities to get everyone out of the country and to an adventure of a lifetime.  Additionally, they try very hard to make the University affordable for its students through scholarships and grants.  The campus is beautiful and most of the facilities are top notch and pristine.  Location to Philly is perfect for internships, jobs, and weekend life.  Upperclassmen housing needs to be improved."
Freshman,4,"Although Arcadia University has its flaws, it is really a tight-knit community here. Everyone looks out for everyone, everyone is kind to one another, and we all fight for what we believe in."
Sophomore,4,"Arcadia is known for its wonderful study abroad opportunities! I spent an entire semester in the UK during my freshman year. The professors at Arcadia truly value each student, and are willing to go out of their way to help cultivate the educational growth of each student. There are always engaging campus activities. For off-campus activities, the city of Philadelphia is just 10 minutes away by train. There are also apartments within a 5 minute walk of campus where students can live for an affordable price. There aren't many food options, so it's best not to buy the meal plan. Lots of scholarship money available for financial aid. Overall, Arcadia is pretty great."
Niche User,4,Arcadia University is a great school with a beautiful campus and so many amazing opportunities. There is a great sense of acceptance and community on campus. They are also number one in the nation for study abroad.
Freshman,4,Arcadia is a safe and accepting college that is very supportive of their students. I recommend it for students who are looking for a small community with big a heart and passion for what they believe and teach. The professors no doubt love to teach and will do all they can to help.
Freshman,4,This school is small. With only around 6000 students (graduates included) we get to actually know our teachers and classmates. We have so much diversity here also it doesn't matter where you came from Arcadia is very welcoming with everyone. That's what sold me on this campus about a year ago today.
Junior,4,I think Arcadia has a beautiful campus and is surrounded by a friendly neighborhood. But the classes can be either extremely easy or extremely hard. In my experience I have not had a class somewhere in the middle. What I would like to see change is the connections on campus. I feel everyone has there clique and if they don't like you than a lot of other people don't like you. Or that the sports teams are very closed and don't really allow for others to join.
Freshman,4,Amazing people! As a commuter the commuter lounge is my go to as the commuter assistants are friendly. The teachers are funny and helpful.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the small student to teacher ratio, in my experience there is always a direct line of communication with professors who are willing to give feedback and want feedback in return. As an art student I feel that my peers in my department are like family."
Sophomore,4,"The academics are what drew me to this campus, and the professors really take an initiative in their students.  The student life is excellent, and if you put yourself out there, you will have a fantastic experience.  Diversity is very important to all members of the campus community, and resonates deep within the roots of the college's mission, in which all students are taught to think through a global perspective.  Housing and dining services have been the only negative experiences I've had within the institution."
Junior,4,Class size allows for an intimate setting and for personal relationships with professors. Atmosphere of campus is very laid back and contemporary.
Senior,4,Arcadia is very much so a 'not for everyone' school. It's for people who prefer a quiet night in with a few friends over a huge college party. I've met some of the best people of my life here. Study abroad and small class sizes are the big selling points with this school.
Sophomore,4,"Arcadia is an oddly magical place. Like any college, there are things to complain about for each individual but overall it isn't a bad school, in fact it's quite good! One, the campus is beautiful, well kept. The housing and a few other buildings could use renovation and expansion but it's still quite nice. Academics is pretty impressive but not all the professors deserve the same critique. Athletics are probably one of the few weak points at Arcadia but the teams are still loved and celebrated properly by the student body and faculty. Campus food is undoubtedly the weakest link, enough said. Safety regulations and security could be better. The party scene is weak if you don't know the right people. Diversity is very impressive, probably due to Arcadia's intense focus on international education but nonetheless impressive. Girls are the dominant gender here though, by far, but to be fair it used to be an all girls private school. Ultimately, an amazing experience and beautiful school."
Sophomore,4,"Arcadia is a great school for someone looking for serious one-on-one attention. Arcadia is really small, and your relationships with your professors are very personal. The campus is beautiful, and the atmosphere is really accepting and the value of education is the most important part of Arcadia. If you want to travel, this school is definitely for you as we have one of the best study abroad programs in the country."
Junior,4,"Arcadia University is the place to go for any and all study abroad wants and needs. Along with countless countries to study in, the Freshmen Preview Program allows every student the equal opportunity to learn and travel."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the study abroad opportunities, the modern languages department, and the small class sizes. I feel like the professors here really care about me and want me to succeed."
Freshman,4,As a student who lives here the life at at Arcadia is not too bad buy the food and the amount of money we need to pay just to attend is a bit ridiculous.
Freshman,4,"Arcadia University is great for amybody who wishes to study abroad. Not only that, but they have a stellar international program and physician assistant/physical therapist program. It's a great school if you know you want to travel."
Alum,4,I had amazing professors who were very genuine about their teaching styles and cared for the wellbeing of their students. Also the study abroad program is phenomenal!!
Senior,4,The atmosphere is comfortable. The professors are above-average.  Course availability could be improved.
Sophomore,4,"I was drawn to Arcadia University initially because of it's beautiful campus. It is a magical sight to see in any season. There is a historic castle on the property that hosts events and serves as housing for some students. Arcadia is a very small, private school. Campus is usually quiet but it is exciting to see it come alive every day as students go to class. There isn't any greek or party life, which I prefer. I can focus on my academics, and it is also very easy to make friends. The food is often complained about, but most dorms have a kitchen where you can cook and bake your own food. The school is still expanding in various departments and it is great to be a part of that. I am so happy I chose this school and I would not want to be any where else."
Freshman,4,"I like the small class sizes as well as the food options, and the people on campus are very friendly."
Freshman,4,"Arcadia is a nice enough school with a beautiful campus, great teachers, and a nice student body. It's great for people who want a smaller school and more cohesive community, because they really do their best to get everyone involved in school events. "
College Freshman,4,There is a lot of pride in this school. People are excited to be at Arcadia
College Freshman,4,I love Arcadia University because everyone is so friendly. The campus is small enough that it allows you to get to now everybody.
Alum,4,"I loved the small class size and personal connections made with the teachers.  Being an athlete at this school was great.  The coaches were dedicated and really wanted you to become a well-rounded individual.  The negative about this university is the cost.  For many of the majors here, the same major could be found at a different school for less than half of what you pay at AU."
College Sophomore,4,Arcadia University is very supportive.
College Freshman,4,"From what I have seen, security is always around Not because of problems, they just make sure nothing bad happens especially if there has been a shooting at another University. ."
College Freshman,4,I'm in my second semester and I have no complaints I would recommend attending this school.
College Junior,4,"They take the academics very serious and the workload is only hard if you do not study and then it becomes an issue, most of the time you will see people in the library or the commons"
Senior,2,"Transferred. Don’t do it. Waste of time, and not a good college to attend for a well rounded education. Also some really awful faculty."
Sophomore,2,"As an Ed major at Arcadia, I've been beyond dissapointed. After layoffs at end of the Spring 2018 semester, the ED department took a huge hit, losing 3 professors. The transparency of the department and school is lacking. The students are often blindsided by the programs, adding unwanted stress to the already stressful lives of the students. The campus is a ghost town, especially on weekends when people all either go home, or go off to other colleges to party. Arcadia has taken a huge drop in quality in the last few years, the strong programs it was once know for are finding they aren't being funded as much or the enrollment is down. There is always a talk if transferring from just about every Ed major here. The highest praise of the school I have heard is, ""it's okay... I guess"", and for the price tag of the school, ""okay I guess"" isn't good enough for me."
College Sophomore,2,Barely any parties. You have to know people to even know about a party if there even is one.
College Junior,2,"The freshmen dorm rooms and the apartments in Oak Summet are not worth the price that is asked for by the students for room and board. The apartments aren't updated at all (only a select few are updated), and definitely isn't worth $9000-$10000. It should be that price for all 3 or 4 students who are in the apartment to split. The elevators sound like they could break at any moment (and are known to break down and sometimes students get stuck in them)."
College Freshman,2,There's a lot of alcohol.
College Freshman,2,It's not for chemistry majors.
College Sophomore,2,Hardly any talk about sports goes on around campus.
College Sophomore,2,"No one cares about sports except people actually on the sports teams. Sports kids seem to only hand out with each other and don't interact whatsoever with the rest of campus. I've been here a year and a half and I don't know what tams we have, where the facilities are, or when games are. People might be motivated to care about sports if they were more integrated into the community, but as it stands, the university prioritizes recruiting atheletes so the school looks good, and that attitude means the general student population looks down on sports and ignores the sports cliques. Oh, and overall school spirit is awful."
College Sophomore,2,"The school's study abroad program is great, but the administration and courses aren't living up to my expectations. The facilities are not worth the money and the surrounding area is very boring."
College Sophomore,2,There are not many parties at Arcadia. The only ones that exist are off-campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Seeing as my parents make a decent amount of money I was eligible for almost no financial aid. However, my parents are not helping me pay for school at all. I feel as if I a drowning in student loans with no help from anyone."
College Sophomore,2,"Food is not one of this school's selling points to say the least. At times it looks like they are improving but then it goes back to sub-par quickly. In fairness however college food is notoriously bad everywhere so although it sucks to life with, it's somewhat expected."
College Sophomore,2,They should give out more because it is pretty expensive.
College Sophomore,2,"Arcadia really isn't a party school. You can find something if you try hard enough, but it's honestly easier to just go to another school. Most ""parties"" seem to be smallish get-togethers, with alcohol, and maybe some drinking games, depending."
College Freshman,2,I am highly unpleased with the traditional residence halls and all of the campus housing is overpriced.
College Freshman,2,Not at all great. No variety and the portions at the chat at least for the meal exchange are ridiculous.
College Freshman,2,"For a social butterfly like myself, Glenside is dull and hard to live in. Downtown Glenside has a few cute shops but that's about it. There aren't really any attractions unless you feel like taking a 30 minute train ride to the city, which surprisingly many students don't feel like doing."
College Freshman,2,"I still have trouble with communicating with financial aid. If you want t get good financial aid, make sure you apply to FAFSA as early as you can."
College Freshman,2,"We don't have parties, which is why we always go to Temple."
College Freshman,2,"Besides the parties at the Tower, the party scene at Arcadia is not very live."
College Senior,2,"Not many parties, always get busted and is usually only certain people"
College Senior,2,I am still trying to get the financial aid that I need
Recent Alumnus,2,History was not a real major
College Freshman,2,"Arcadia is not a party school. Most of the time the campus is dead on nights and weekends except for the occasional get together or kickbacks in the apartments, but there are no parties."
College Freshman,2,"There really isn't much to do except for thrift store shopping, getting tattoos/peircings, get your hair/nails done and grabbing a bite to eat. People usually get a ride or use SEPTA to  go into the towns next door which offer a lot more. I know I never hang out in and around downtown glenside. The only places to be are on Campus, at the Oak apartments or around those (for the few that live in houses), at the wyncote towers or eating at michael's. Otherwise you're better off heading out somewhere."
College Sophomore,2,The computers at Arcadia are very slow and the campus wifi cuts out often.
College Sophomore,2,If you're into parties then Arcadia might not be the school for you.
College Freshman,2,"Mice on mice on mice in the dorms, or should I say ""residence halls""."
College Junior,2,I didn't get financial aid but I got an academic scholarship so that was good.
College Freshman,2,It is very boring here at Arcadia University. The only thing you can actually do at night is drink in your dorms with your friends; but you have to be careful or you'll get in trouble.
College Freshman,2,minimum quantity and slow speed internet
College Sophomore,2,"it is really hard to get the amount of financial aid that you need. the financial aid office gives you a lot of hassle trying to figure things out. receiving scholarships depends on how good your test scores are or grades, maybe if you play a sport you could get a little more money too. "
College Sophomore,2,food is pretty bad. they like to carb overload here
College Sophomore,2,there is not really anything to do during the week
College Sophomore,2,"glenside and keswick are okay, nearby cheltenham is a death trap."
College Sophomore,2,"There is no transportation available from the school, so students (with no cars or friends with cars) are left to rely on SEPTA, which has several bus stops next to the school, and there is a train station about 15 minutes away."
College Junior,2,"The academics at Arcadia University are overall average for a college. There are some departments in which there are a few problems, not enough staff (or the staff that they have aren't the greatest), not having/giving out information to the students, and a few others. In the opposite direction there are some really great professors that care about how their students are doing and will give them the help and support that they need. The registration process is okay, when I first arrived at Arcadia I wasn't registered for classes but they were able to help me sort everything out, the process is a little unfair for anyone who isn't a senior or an honor student. The honor students are allowed to register before everyone else which isn't fair if they are freshman and the sophomores and juniors aren't allowed to register until after them. The workload is fair, although in some cases it might seem outrageous to the amount of classes some majors and minors have. Arcadia is said to be the number 1 study abroad school and they really push their students so spend at least one semester abroad. They also have a program for freshman and transfers called Preview in which they are allowed to take a class and visit a country during their spring break, it's a lot of fun and a cheap way to study abroad/travel."
College Senior,2,Nightlife is what you make of it here. There are not a ton of local options but our Student Programming Board does have a ton of fun programming. 
College Senior,2,Glenside is a really safe neighborhood. 
College Senior,2,If you live in the on-campus upperclassmen apartments you are really about a ten minute walk off campus. If you choose to drive to campus it is really hard to find a spot in the morning and the middle of the day. It has been especially bad this year. 
College Senior,2,"They can be a little strict about certain things, but there is a strong level of fairness and reasonableness. "
College Senior,2,"I live on campus because I receive a lot of financial aid as a resident, but I have many friends who live off campus, and they have really like their off campus housing and it is really nice from a visitors standpoint. "
College Senior,2,There is a large girl to guy ratio with a larger number of females. This has been changing over the past few years as more guys attend. 
College Senior,2,Arcadia is far from a party school. This is reflected in both the 'party atmosphere' and the guidelines. We are not a dry campus and students over 21 are allowed alcohol as long as no students are under 21 are there. This does not mean that there is not underage drinking though. 
College Senior,2,"If you are in the upperclassman housing options such as Oak Summit Apartments or Knight Hall, they are really nice. There is lots of room and in Oak students have access to their own kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry rooms. "
College Sophomore,2,The food is over-priced and fairly bland. It's usually over-crowded no matter when you go to the dinning hall or the Chat (on campus cafe) and it's hard to get anywhere else when you're pressed for time.
College Sophomore,2,A parking permit cost $60 to get one. If you don't have one there is a change of your car getting booted if they see it overnight for awhile.
College Sophomore,2,It's decent but nothing incredibly fun or entertaining
College Junior,2,"Arcadia university is very small doesn't have much around campus. The university does a pretty good job keeping students busy through the student activities organized by the school. Because the campus is so small it is hard good parking, but if you get to class early you will be able to find decent parking."
College Sophomore,2,"The network is terrible. The wifi hardly ever works. The computers take forever to log onto and they are always having issues. We pay a lot to go to this school, we should have internet/computers that actually works."
College Sophomore,2,"The athletics program is probably one of the better things on campus. The teams are alright, and the people on it are okay. I wish there was a football team on campus, or that the school was bigger so it could be in a different division, instead of something that feels like an inter-mural division."
College Junior,2,"You can generally get away with drugs so long as you're good at it.  There's a lot of places on campus to smoke, and a few dealers."
College Junior,2,"They're very strict. Everyone has a stick up their ass, and they will whip it out and hit you with it."
College Freshman,2,"Freshmen housing definitely has its flaws. With all of the key swipes that exist between the outside world and your hall, you certainly feel safe. However, most freshmen halls are pretty tough to navigate, and maintenance does not clean the bathrooms very well (in Thomas, at least)."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not many good choices, and they run out often."
College Freshman,2,"The health center is almost always closed. It is closed on weekends, so god forbid you get sick on a weekend you are out of luck. The good thing is they have cheap/free STD testing and shots available. However, I always feel safe on campus! It's too small to feel unsafe because there are safety officers EVERYWHERE."
College Freshman,2,"Impossible to get a spot during the day. At night, however, it is much easier."
College Sophomore,2,"Severe Punishment – The punishments can be severe when it comes to violating the drinking and drug policies. The housing assistants will get you busted, well most will. Violating these drinking and drug policies can result in letters home to family, mandatory drug and alcohol classes, and risk of losing housing and being at the school all together."
College Sophomore,2,"I'll never find a job.  Anthropology?  I need a higher degree, and then a teacher degree, then maybe I'll be a teacher.  If I get a phD"
College Senior,2,"Take the Train – Buses are okay, but sometimes late. Trains are pretty decent. Arcadia does not provide any type of transportation."
Freshman,1,"The school is highly overpriced for the sub-par education they give. Not to mention the lack of support given by staff. The only things that are good about this school are the study abroad program (which you can probably find at other schools), the communications program (which I am not a part of), and the castle."
Freshman,1,"Commuter school. there is nothing to do on the weekends and there is little no school spirit, the dorms are a nightmare and the town that it's in has nothing to do in it. Please, don't go here."
Senior,1,This school is not at all what’s advertized. I wear hearing aids and the disability support services have been nothing but a pain they are not helpful at all or concerned at all with the students they claim to be helping. Financial aid is a mess they again have no concern for students and will put off adding my scholarships or releasing loan money for weeks then lock your account since you havnt paid off full tuition so you can’t student charge for books or for meals or anything. Finally the advisory here is lacking I’ve been told to take something like 5 courses which have had no effect on my graduating status and ultimately have forced me to stay here another semester possibly another full year to finish my degree. Arcadia’s tuition is increasing every year and no one seems to know where all that money is going. Don’t wast yours on this trash college.
Freshman,1,"It’s a really pretty campus with fairly good academics and okay financial aid. That’s where it ends. No real events or social life. Everyone is super cliquey. Honestly, I had more fun in high school driving to a funeral than I have collectively in my time here. Both myself and 2 other girls on my floor are transferring after this semester. I don’t think anyone actually wants to be here. Save yourself the time and just go to Temple."
Freshman,1,This school is trash. Don't go to it. Everyone wants to leave after the first semester. Awful school choice.
College Freshman,1,It is lacking and the administration has covered a number of sexual assaults for their own reputation.
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have any Greek life, aside from honors societies."
College Freshman,1,Athletics are a very minor part of Arcadia.
College Junior,1,"It is a small school that lacks all the benefits of the small school. Many adjunct professors, advisor doesn't even remember me when I walk into his office three times a week, I had a lecture that had 70 people in it, no school spirit, very cliquey, Even though there aren't many people you are competing against to get a research opportunity you also have a small staff in each department so there aren't many opportunities in the first place. Even though financial aid is fantastic, it is still not worth the money I am paying for this school. However, the study abroad opportunities are wonderful."
College Sophomore,1,"It's a small liberal arts school outside of Philly, of course this school doesn't compete with larger universities. The party scene is practically nonexistent and definitely isn't a reason to attend this school, but it also isn't difficult to get to a college/city where parties are common."
College Freshman,1,There is not Greek life.
College Sophomore,1,THERE IS NO GREEK LIFE
College Sophomore,1,"Don't come here expecting a party every week. There really are no places on campus to party. For those who like to party, they either complain about the lack thereof or they take SEPTA to Temple University."
College Freshman,1,I have gone to one good School hosted party/dance. The social life here is why I think so many students specifically Freshmen transfer.
College Freshman,1,the food is horrible. no healthy options at all. everything is drenched in oil and fats. i always get nauseous and i rarely eat until i am about to pass out then i shove a slice of fattening pizza down my throat.
College Freshman,1,i am the type that likes the party scene and going out to socialize but sadly i picked the worst school for that. unless you're on a sports team then there is nothing. no greek life so no college ave = no parties = boring on weekends = i go home every single weekend because my dog entertains me more than arcadia.
College Freshman,1,"Nonexistent! Unless you want to go to into the city, there is nothing"
College Freshman,1,"There's a diner across the street but honestly, that is. Downtown Glenside is a mile walk away and it can get sketchy at night since the food options shut down around 10 pm.."
College Freshman,1,"There is no Greek life so not surprisingly, there is not that many parties that take place on campus."
College Sophomore,1,We have no Greek life wish we did though.
Recent Alumnus,1,Too expensive for tiny dirty rooms
College Senior,1,There is no greek life on campus
College Freshman,1,We don't have any frats.
College Freshman,1,"if you want to do something, be prepared to pay big $$$"
College Freshman,1,"no sense of community, everyone stays inside "
College Freshman,1,"terrible, entire lax team is subject to scrutiny, no freedom"
College Freshman,1,"Very strict, eyes are on you at all times, no privacy"
College Sophomore,1,There are only two places to choose from. No chain restaurants or anything.
College Sophomore,1,WE don't have greek life.
College Sophomore,1,wifi here is terrible. the guest network is usually the more reliable
College Junior,1,"There aren't many, if any, fraternities or sororities at Arcadia. If there are any they are brand new and very exclusive. The whole Greek life isn't a main focus at Arcadia, which is something I really enjoy."
College Junior,1,"I don't really know much about the transportation at Arcadia, I have my car on campus and don't need to use any transportation that Arcadia might or might not offer. I do know that there are a few zip cars (I believe 2) but as I have my own car I don't need to use theirs."
College Senior,1,"I am not a huge fan of on campus food, but it has gotten significantly better over the last year or so. "
College Junior,1,"Poor on campus, 10 minute walk from apartment, I leave car in apartment lot"
College Senior,1,"The dining hall is just horrible. I have seen so many mice, the staff can be rude, and we also failed our health and safety inspection. The chat is the only other option for food on campus and is better than the dining hall but not by much."
College Sophomore,1,If you're not here early in the morning to get a parking spot you may not find one all day! I took mid day classes one day a week and it was the worst to find a parking spot. I would have to wait sometimes for people to leave or park somewhere that I wasn't supposed to in order to make it to class.
College Sophomore,1,"So easy to do drugs on campus, or nearby. They are not big on drug safety it seems, and finding the is simple. There are plenty of dealers on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Barely any diversity. This school has a handful of each race, maybe a little more, that is not white."
College Sophomore,1,"SLOW SLOW SLOW!!!! There are plenty of computers, don't get me wrong. There are MAC's and Window's but the server can be so slow!! If you're on your own laptop you're better off going to McDonald's and getting the hotspot there to do work, you will get it done faster."
College Sophomore,1,"The teachers are ok but it depends on who you get. Some teachers are amazing! You can understand them, they know what they are teaching, and make things fun. On the other hand there are teachers who are horrible. Those teachers love to confuse you more than they actually teach you. Their grading makes no sense and they contradict themselves in class, or try to make their mistakes look like they were doing it on purpose."
College Junior,1,"Arcadia is a place where a very small few stand out for being one or many of the following: Intelligent, interesting, strange, crazy, creepy, not white.  Everyone else is so powerfully boring you'll wonder how you ended up at Grade 13 instead of college."
College Junior,1,"It's nearish to Philly, which is good.  Elcy's is good.  The Pizza Box is good.  That's it.  There's really nothing else going on around town.  Glenside's pretty boring, but you might like it that way.  And, if you don't, it has a train station."
College Junior,1,"The first school I went to was like the school where all the kids anyone had ever feared would bomb the school went.  Arcadia was like the school that all the kids no one even slightly cared about went.  And I'm not talking their parents - these people had exceedingly boring parents and they grew up to be exceedingly boring human beings and they will pair off and breed more exceedingly boring human beings.  You can't walk five feet without seeing a polo shirt.  Everyone has the same hair cut.  You will have the same conversation every day.  You can recognize Arcadia students around town by their dress and look, because they essentially all look like the same very boring person."
College Junior,1,"I think there are about ten black students on campus.  A few asian students.  Not many of any other type.  Definitely only three middle-eastern students, about.  Most of the people who go here are pretty racist, too.  And not the straight-forward, hateful kind of racist.  I'm talking privileged and ignorant."
College Junior,1,"NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO.  Just generally awful.  I've lived in all the types of housing they offer, and I guess the best was Knight, because the least people bothered you, and the facilities were the nicest.  Last semester I lived in an apartment - they try desperately to charge you for everything they possibly can, anyone who has a key can and will just barge into your place whenever they damn well feel like it, and the walls are paper thin.  Second day there I killed a cockroach as big as my hand.  And the dorm-dorms are basically the same only smaller."
College Junior,1,"This is only a D because the wraps and paninis in the Chat are good.  Otherwise, it would be an F.  But still - if the only thing that keeps it form being an F is the Chat, you're in trouble."
College Junior,1,"Boring as shit with a few diamonds in the rough.  Despite these diamonds, I expected college to be crawling with passionate teachers who wanted to teach me and everyone else about their subject.  especially a smaller college.  Nope."
College Freshman,1,There is no night life. Unless you want to walk around glenside at night.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I transferred into Arcadia after completing a 2 year degree program at another school, and transferring to Arcadia was one of my worst college experiences, and I've had plenty of others.  Unless you're a first year student they didn't really seem to care about you, study abroad options are basically extinct and that's what Arcadia's reputation is built on.  I had trouble leaving housing because I was a transfer student too.  There is never anything really going on on the weekends, so they can get pretty boring unless you're at home.  Tuition is insane! $47,770 to live there for a year, before books and additional expenses is just ridiculous! If I could go back in time, I would have transferred to a different school."
Recent Alumnus,1,"For the cost of tuition being so high you'd think they'd at least serve edible food.  You can go to the Dining Hall or the Chat with your meal plan, and the Chat is the place to go, the food there gets old quick though."
College Freshman,1,"The places around campus are very limited. You have three options: the Dining Hall, The Chat, or the Easton Cafe. After the first month, I got very sick of the food."
College Freshman,1,"School Spirit? a Joke. If you're looking to attend a school with a lot of spirit, games, or even the after-party of the games, forget it. School spirit is on its lowest level, and even games that are played on Arcadia's fields are dead. Plenty of intramurals to play but no sports team to actually watch for a good game."
College Student,1,Literally can't stand the food here.  Tough to eat somedays
College Sophomore,1,Too Many Females and Whites – The school is clearly dominated by females and whites. It takes away from the diversity that schools really strive for. It doesn't help that the school is small.
College Junior,1,Very hard to find a spot during the day for classes. Campus security quickly gives out tickets for parking when you need to quickly stop and get something when there are no options at all to park
College Junior,1,"Can I Get a Ride – You need a car on campus to get to most places. There is a Walmart and a Pathmark in walking distance. However, to go to the mall you can take public transportation (SEPTA) or a car or a friend with a car."
College Junior,1,"The school plans something every weekend for students to do and gives out some awesome prizes. However, other than that there is not much to do on campus. You have to look for your fun. There are some parties in the apartments off campus. Best bet is to go into Philly and attend another college's (Temple, Drexel to name some)parties.There aren't many bars in walking distance of campus and you get to many places without a car."
College Junior,1,Could Deff Be Better With the Money We Spend – the dining hall is pretty bad. i mean they usually have the same things everyday and turn left overs into something that it shouldnt be...like tomato sauce for spaghetti into tomato soup. the vegetables are always covered in butter or geese and are never fully cooked. the best thing there is the sandwich and salad bar.
College Senior,1,"Oak Summit Is Roach and Mouse Infested – I hate Oak Summit!  It is roach and mice infested, and the exterminator personally told me that it's Arcadia's fault because they do not want to invest money to fix the ceilings that are open to bare concrete or the holes behind the washers and dryers.  It is also outdated, and needs remodeling, but Arcadia is not willing to invest the money. It's so sad that we pay $10,000 a year to live in an outdated, pest-infested building when we could live somewhere like Wyncote Towers, which is clean and in great shape, and the same price!!"
College Sophomore,1,"Gay Yay, Race Boo – Arcadia is very diverse in it's sexual orientation. There is a large amount of people in the homosexual community and at Arcadia this is generally accepted. In the case of Racial ethnicity though, there appears to be a larger white ratio to other ethnic backgrounds although I believe thoughs of all races are accepted. Arcadia has a lot of pride in its global campus and this is apparent by the many international students on campus, all of which are welcomed with open arms, yet the majority of students are still those who travel from PA, NJ and NY."

Junior,5,"My  online  experience  with  drake  was  not  bad  at  all , except  when  during  the  time  blackboard  decided  to  act  up. Other  than  that  drake  online  learning  experience is  one  of  the  best  in  the  nation."
Junior,5,"My overall  is  experience  with  drake  is  awesome .  The  faculties  are  great, very  helpful  in  so  many  ways. They  work  with  every  students  to  achieve  their  academy  goal."
Senior,5,"Ill-prepared for the most part, but professors were incredibly lenient and helpful and I'm impressed how may rose to the challenge. The only issue was how much we did/didn't get refunded for having to leave campus."
Junior,5,"After going to two colleges and two universities, I can safely say that Drake is the most student friendly experience I've had. They aren't a research based institute, so the staff focus entirely on helping students with anything they need. The central Des Moines location is pretty convenient and allows decent access to most of the small city. Both the physical and online facilities are well-maintained and helpful. It's easy to see why Drake students have high high graduation and employment rates."
Junior,5,"The Drake website is safe, secure, and easy to use. Most importantly, the university staff manages it well. Teachers know what they're doing and don't hesitate to make things as convenient as possible for students. I even have a professor this semester that's providing a free online textbook to his students. Drake is a very friendly and accommodating university."
Sophomore,5,Pretty much as good as it could be. Professors very nice and willing to make changes to the curriculum.
Sophomore,5,"Small university, but you get to know people very quickly. Des Moines offers anything you would need from a large city."
Sophomore,5,"So far the professors are amazing! The small class sizes help facilitate learning and just one year in, I have two letters of recommendation from my professor. I wish my school would act quicker with decisions and statements. They were slow to make a decision regarding Covid-19, and did not speak up quickly about the civil rights movement occurring at this moment."
Freshman,5,"Drake University is a pretty nice place with small ratio of class, meaning that there are more faculty member available for students."
Niche User,5,"I loved the building, the scenery, and the people who I've met there and can't wait to spend my 4 years with."
Niche User,5,The campus is a well liked campus with a great area surrounding. Also the sports are awesome. Drakes football is super fun to watch. Although the school is small the education is stupendous. The student to faculty to student ratio is really low which helps when students need help.
Freshman,5,Advisors and professors all have professional curtesy and truly care about the students' learning and well-being. I have yet to meet a professor that I believe I could not talk to. Advisors very very helpful with those unsure of future plans.
Graduate Student,5,Drake University has provided me with a wonderful education and cares for its students. They ensure students are prepared for the real world after graduation and want the best for everyone attending.
Senior,5,"I knew little about Drake University until I was recruited at a College night at my high school. I decided to visit and I was immediately impressed by the way I felt accepted and wanted by all I met. After some discussion with my parents and some promise of scholarship money to make it more affordable, I made the decision to attend. For me, I can not imagine any place better for me than Drake. I never have felt ignored or taken for granted. When I needed help it was always provided. I got better at college every semester. I have loved it here and would recommend this University to anyone. Itâ€™s Great to be a Bulldog!"
Freshman,5,I liked the campus. It was small but big at the same time and just felt very safe and welcoming. I also like the area in which Drake is located and how everything just felt right and perfect for me.
Niche User,5,"Drake University offers lots of great opportunities for students. Like helping them figure out what scholarships are available. They made me feel comfortable in trying to figure out what i want to study and when. Drake University is an verall great place to start, and figure out what you want to become."
Sophomore,5,"When I first came to Drake, I was so nervous about if I will like the school. How will I able to adjust in the new settings and if I will be able to make friends. All crazy questions hovering over my mind but Drake guided me really well. Mainly the professor is like parents and they will treat you as your son\daughter. Since I am an international student, I just could not make as many friends as I wanted. That is the only sad thing that I feel right now."
Freshman,5,"I have really enjoyed being a student at Drake University because of its personal touch that it adds since it is such a small school. I have greatly enjoyed getting to know all the great people on campus, from the students all the way to the professors. I just feel that I am truly a person who is cared about on this campus rather than just a number. I wouldn't trade my college experience so far for anything else."
Freshman,5,"I love Drake's campus and the community surrounding it. I would love to see the tuition lowered, it is pretty steep right now. The people here are super kind and loving and the faculty is really understanding and helpful."
Sophomore,5,This is a place where people with every different major can succeed. It is always the right choice to continue education.
Niche User,5,"Drake was an inviting atmosphere, kind guides, dean was at the visit center and very welcoming. The campus was very beautiful, and if you enjoy ham mocking this is the place for you. Their is also free bus transportation practically anywhere so no need for a car if you are concerned about that. Intramural are diverse. The center of campus is about 5-10 mins from downtown Des Moines which has much to offer at night, music, and above all else.. FOOD!"
Freshman,5,I am so excited to be a first year student at Drake. All of the faculty have been so warm and welcoming to me and played a huge role in my college decision. The campus is the perfect size and the students seem really down to earth.
Freshman,5,"As an incoming freshman, Drake has been helpful and welcoming in all aspects. They are kind people who are all dedicated to ensuring their university is the best fit for you."
Freshman,5,"Drake is an amazing college and a great place to begin your journey to a professional career, while having a fun time."
Freshman,5,I love the interior decoration of the library as a person who loves bright colours. The library makes it easier to study and its there are sections open for 24 hours which is awesome for someone like me who studies at odd hours. The University has the right amount of fun and seriousness and the staff there is extremely helpful and understanding.
Freshman,5,"Drake University is a fantastic school! Between the faculty, students, and opportunities you recieve, I can't imagine a better university to attend!"
Freshman,5,"I would highly recommend Drake University. The teachers know your name, the people around campus treat you well, and the Drake truly invests in the students rather than the other way around."
Niche User,5,I loved everything about Drake University. They have a great approach in getting people internships fast and helping people realize what they want to do.
Freshman,5,"What I love about Drake University is how welcoming everyone is. Not only that, but the size of Drake is perfect. It's around 5,000 undergraduate students. This size allows for you to always see someone you know, but also meet someone new! Something that I would like to see change in is the diversity rate at Drake. Drake needs to improve how diverse they are, especially since that is something the school takes great pride in."
Freshman,5,"I fell in love with Drake University during my senior year of high school because of all of the amazing interactions that I had with the people there whether it's the girl I had an overnight visit with or my admissions counselor.  Drake is a very supportive community, and I've adored all my classes so far. I also love the flexibility it offers. It's possible to triple major or double major with two minors and still be able to study abroad more than once and graduate on time."
Sophomore,5,"Drake is a really nice, small school that provides you with multiple career opportunities.  I have really enjoyed my  time at the school.  I am positive I would not have gotten the experience I have gotten here at any other school."
Graduate Student,5,I love going to Drake University. It is a smaller school but that makes it feel more like home. We are a tight knit community and the professors and students all want to see each other succeed. There are so many opportunities to advance yourself and to get involved on campus.
Freshman,5,I love the small size of Drake. It is very easy to get involved in anything and everything you want to. The small classes sizes allow you to personally know every professor.
Sophomore,5,"Drake University is a midwest gem of a university. There are a plethora of opportunities on campus and in the local area for internships, jobs, clubs, etc. that help with the transition to college along with your personal development in your field. The students at Drake are motivated and hard working and it makes you want to go above and beyond in school and your activities."
Freshman,5,"Drake, like Des Moines offers numerous opportunities while still retaining a small town feel. As a CA native, it feels like downtown Des Moines is like 10  brlocks of LA (but a lot colder) in the middle of what would otherwise be a college town. Im studying Political Communication (through  SJMC) in the heart of the Iowa Caucus, and was given a paid internship in my 1st semester.  Specialized programs, welcoming atmosphere (more than any  other colleges) and generous scholarship won me over from NEU, Syracuse, GW, American, and SMU. The other academic perks of being such a small school include NO TAs teaching classes which not only allows better instruction from professors but will help students bond with the professors for future letters of recommendation. The school is very preprofessional with a strong emphasis on career development and does very well (evidenced by 100% career placement) to give internships and other experiential learning opportunities to its students."
Alum,5,"As somebody who graduated four years ago, I am elated that I can maintain contact with former professors and classmates.  The environment, in addition to the smaller class size, at Drake was incredibly beneficial to fostering relationships with your fellow classmates and instructors, encouraging campus involvement and exploring opportunities."
Junior,5,Lots of local internships available and athletic programs on the rise. The neighborhood can be shady but itâ€™s not as bad as people make it sound.
Sophomore,5,Drake University is a small university that has amazing opportunities for students and staff. One of the best things about it is that itâ€™s easy to get around campus. The staff and the professors here are very helpful. I am glad I choose this university and I am a proud Bulldog !
Freshman,5,Drake is a great university that really challenges itâ€™s students to do the best. Professors do an amazing job making sure their students succeed and really get to know their students. The students become a family and overall attending Drake University is an amazing experience.
Sophomore,5,After finishing my first-year at Drake I have had a immense amount of opportunities. The size of Drake gives everyone an opportunity to hold executive positions and get valuable experience
Sophomore,5,I love the sense of community at Drake. There are so many clubs and organizations that there is something for everyone. I have the privilege of constantly seeing my friends from the clubs I'm involved in around campus because of the smaller population of Drake.
Sophomore,5,"Drake is very inclusive of all different types of people from different backgrounds. There is some sort of club for every single person, because Drake offers such a large variety of clubs. I also feel like Drake is very good at preparing their students for the future."
Freshman,5,Most professors are very caring and do their best to help each student. The worst thing about Drake is probably the dining options.
Freshman,5,"Drake University has a beautiful campus in Des Moines, Iowa.  The campus is filled with tree and the live mascot, Griff, can often be found around campus. "
College Junior,5,DU is prestigious with many opportunities.
College Senior,5,"The SJMC has a +90% student placement rate, meaning most students find a job or get accepted to a grad program within 6 months of graduation"
College Freshman,5,I love greek life. It is my favorite thing about Drake so far. I have met so many people through greek life. All my friends are involved and the friends that are not wish they were. We volunteer and get internships/jobs a lot easier because of the connections we make. The parties are a blast as well.
College Freshman,5,"Almost everyone does an internship at some point while attending Drake.  These internships are all over the world and are very easy to gain access to.  Also, 98% of students who graduate either have a job or an acceptance to a graduate school in the 1st 6 months post graduation.  Graduates are also very successful in their careers and willing to help current students."
College Freshman,5,"I am not apart of Greek life, however, the fraternities and sororities do great things for the campus and surrounding communities.  They're all very welcoming to everyone and hold events that everyone is invited to attend.  Almost every fraternity and sorority has a house on campus that juniors and seniors are welcome to live n."
College Freshman,5,Drake is an amazing university that has created endless opportunities for me to explore my future career and myself.
College Sophomore,5,"While sports are essential at Drake, we shouldn't, and don't, revolve around them."
College Freshman,5,"Everything here is pretty much almost amazing. I fit in well, my professors are easy to talk to, classes sizes are small and personal, and there is an immense variety of classes offered"
College Freshman,5,"There are many opportunities for career and internship prospects. The biggest part to it is that network that Drake provides, classmates, professors, alumni, on campus employers, ect."
College Freshman,5,"each program is designed to each particular student, so you can practically make your major."
College Junior,5,Living on campus was very enjoyable and there are always fun things to do.
College Junior,5,Help with career planning is incredible.
College Freshman,5,Drake is my first choice no matter what!
College Junior,5,"The campus housing is excellent overall. The dorms are very up-to-date and have nice and clean amenities. The RAs are generally very helpful, with the occasional exception."
College Freshman,5,The people that you live with really do become your best friends! So far almost everyone I've met has been really friendly and is willing to talk.  The residence halls are great and the RAs put on great programs like one about different cultures and how things are different everywhere you go.  My classes teach me a lot. For example we learned about genetics and how the different genes can work togeher in ways that have different results eaxh time.  I feel like I am getting my money's worth when I am learning a lot and engaging with others in class and outside of the classroom.
College Freshman,5,I joined the fraternity FIJI and I'm loving it.
Junior,4,"I enjoy going to school here and am very grateful I have the opportunity to do so, I can't think of anything I would change."
Alum,4,"I absolutely loved my undergraduate experience at Drake University. I was allowed the opportunity to live in a new city, meet people different than myself, and have my perspectives broadened. Drake was a perfectly sized university to know people while walking on campus, but not feel so small it was stifling. I had great, personal relationships with my professors and took classes that challenged and excited me. I would heartily recommend Drake to any prospective students."
Sophomore,4,"I took all my classes online besides my chemistry lab. I felt that many professors tried to use different websites and such to enhance learning, but the biology lab department did exceptionally well. They gave us a new platform to learn from that was essential to our learning."
Freshman,4,"No, I haven't taken any online class so I am not sure about the online learning experience with Drake university."
Alum,4,"It's a nice University, it's small and it adds a different feel to the environment to the school. The school is nice and friendly!"
Freshman,4,"I liked the positive environment and friendly staff. There is a commitment to academic excellence. I wish they were better at communicating sometimes, and the campus is not fully accessible."
Niche User,4,"Drake has a great campus. I like that it's small, but I wish it was a little bigger. Dorms are average. The campus location is good since it is so close to downtown."
Alum,4,"I had a very good experience at Drake, as it allowed me to pursue my passions while still getting a well-rounded liberal arts education. The campus was small, but it had everything I needed. However, I think Drake needs to work on its handling of student issues. Many students who experienced sexual harassment and assault were very disappointed in the universityâ€™s reactions. I also know of many students of color who have found Drake University and the Drake Community to be less than helpful when it came to dealing with transgressions."
Freshman,4,"So far, I have loved my experience at Drake. It is a very caring community. There are many opportunities to have new educational and social experiences."
Sophomore,4,Small size which makes it easy to walk around. Parking is a mess and needs to prioritize students and faculty.
Freshman,4,"From an academic standpoint, Drake is an amazing school. I absolutely love all my teachers, they really enjoy what they teach. The school has each student set up a good background which really helps round out each student and allows for better people in the long run. In my major, I have top notch teachers doing their best to educate so many people to the highest degrees possible, and the academics at Drake are really impressive. From a social standpoint, if you're not in a fraternity or sorority (which I'm not because I disagree with the concept), finding friends can be a struggle. Greek life seems to be everything here which for me isn't great but I know a lot of people who really benefit from that. Also the food here is kind of terrible, but where a university really matters- in the academics- this school is the best of it's kind."
Senior,4,"Loved the academics, the social life is not very great, but is located minutes from downtown Des Moines which offers more of  social scene. Friendly professors, average cafeteria food, lots of clubs."
Senior,4,"It's a great place to get an education but the environment is not always the best. The business school in particular is very strong and highly respected, so definitely a good choice for that field."
Sophomore,4,An amazing school for a student that wants to do it all! A great D1 athletics program with excellent academics and a vast array of student organizations.
Graduate Student,4,I am enrolled in the Drake Occupational Therapy doctorate program. My professors are great and I enjoy coming to class everyday. The faculty and staff are always willing to answer any questions you have or help you in anyway because they truly want you to be successful!
Sophomore,4,"I love my time at Drake University. The campus, the professor and the academics are all amazing. While it may be a smaller campus there are still plenty of areas to be outside to do schoolwork or hang out with people. There are plenty of amazing student activities to participate in and student groups to be in. I enjoyed my time in the first-year dorms but I wish there were more activities for first-years to get to know each other. Also, the upper-class dorms leave a bit to be desired. They aren't quite as nice as the first-year halls and don't seem as well kept."
Freshman,4,I have loved my experience so far at Drake. Through my first semester I received a 4.0 and I accredit my success to the amazing professors who are on staff at the college. The school is small so as a student I am able to create a personal connection with my professors and further my education in a positive way. There is not much I would change about the school except for the student involvement and opportunities.
Sophomore,4,I love Drake because of its openness and wide range of opportunities on and off campus. Everyone from staff to students are so engaged and vibrant that it makes Drake a place you feel at home at.
Sophomore,4,My overall experience has been pretty good. The courses are difficult but the professors care and I know I'm getting a good education and there are plenty of resources for further employment or education after graduation.
Senior,4,"Drake overall is a very fun, inviting community. I've greatly enjoyed my time in the institution. However, I am disappointed in the way money is dispersed through programs at the University. The lack of funding for one of the most prominent music programs in the midwest is mind blowing."
College Junior,4,"student support, but education top priority"
College Junior,4,"DU is private, comparable students, challenging"
College Senior,4,I really do enjoy attending this school and am happy that is where I am
College Senior,4,"I like greek life at my school, it's a great way to get close to a group of people"
College Senior,4,I absolutely love my school! You get to know your professors and they really care about your success.
College Sophomore,4,"If you're the student who would like to partake in drug or alcohol activity you will find it as long as you look. The campus does try to keep underage students away from alcohol, so there are plenty of activities planned on the weekend for students who would rather not partake. There is no pressure however to do anything a student isn't comfortable with, theres a crowd for everyone."
College Sophomore,4,"I'd say by graduation 9/10 students if not more have stepped foot into the real world with their major, via internship, research, or even employment offers. Companies seek out drake graduates for employees because they know just how much of a quality education these students have received and how dedicated they are as people."
College Sophomore,4,"I love classes at drake, the professors are caring people that really are there to create successful adults. They lend a hand to those who need a parent away from home, but they won't baby any student. I've built great relationships with my professors within the science department. The only thing that i wish could change is the number of classes offered for one course, there are few options for each course each semester and it can be hard to fit in all the classes you need to stay on mark with your peers in your major."
College Sophomore,4,"There are draw backs to being a small campus just outside of downtown des moines, the surrounding area isn't the safest. However we have bulldog alerts and other apps that are used for student safety. Public safety is on duty constantly to make sure our dorms, academic buildings and other public areas are safe. I've never personally felt unsafe walking around campus. However its a good idea to never be too comfortable and have a buddy to walk around with at night on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Drake University is a small school with big school perks. We're in the city and have D1 athletics, however we have have small classes in which I've grown close with my classmates and professors. There are many resources available on campus and through the professors in order to ensure student's success. I haven't ever questioned my choice at drake it's the perfect fit for me."
College Freshman,4,The alumni network is big here (they have a house for their club). Their are tons of employers that recruit from all over the place. I have never used the career center so I am not sure about that.
College Freshman,4,The class sizes are great. They are small but allow you to get to know the professor better and you can ask questions easier. There are many different courses offered and very different class styles. The professors are well educated but some are very tough. You really need to study well at this school.
College Freshman,4,The rooms are so much nicer than most schools. Our bathrooms are cleaned everyday on the weekdays and they custodial staff is super nice. The halls coordinate events that are actually fun.
College Freshman,4,I love Drake. I am involved in the Student Activities Board and I am in a Sorority. The classes are really hard and more advanced than most schools.
College Freshman,4,Drake recently inaugurated a new president.  One of the first things he did on campus was work on security on campus and in the surrounding community.  His focus is on students safety and has updated safety procedures on Drake campus.  I have never felt unsafe on campus during the day or late at night.  Public safety is almost always visible and they are super friendly people.  Safety is a big concern for every student on Drake campus and fellow students look out for each other.
College Freshman,4,"The courses are usually very interesting and the professors are very engaging during lecture.  You can find all types of courses that you are interested in and advisors work to help you fit these classes into your schedule.  Also professors are very helpful inside and outside of class at answering questions and helping student better comprehend the material.  The class size are usually small except for your major lectures such as intro to business, chemistry, and biology."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are quite spacious and have air condition!  There is a large lobby with a t.v. and fireplace that allows everyone to socialize and study together.  There is also a study room where students who like a quiet study space are able to focus and do their work.  The bathrooms are cleaned everyday and their is a good number of bathroom stalls and showers meaning you never have to wait in line.  Everyone on campus is super friendly and it is easy to meet new people and make friends.  Also, the food on campus is always close to the housing making it convenient and easy to get to if you're in a rush."
College Freshman,4,"I'm here for the program, the school is pretty good."
College Sophomore,4,"I've been looking at summer internships back home which are far and in-between, but I'm looking!"
College Sophomore,4,"I love Drake, the classes, class sizes, and everything they have to offer, but there's always room for improvements."
Senior,2,"Overall a good school, especially for the business majors, but lacking in administration. The response to COVID-19 left many students stranded after spring break, financial aid and how much you pay will vary by student and is lacking any form of transparency, and alongside that, donor funds from the school usually serve some aesthetic purpose or another gentrifying attempt at the Drake neighborhood, when really social programs and helping lower-income students should be the priority. The name of this school gets me jobs, though, so I guess I can't complain there."
Alum,2,"If you read one review, read this one. 120K for a college education is not worth it. Drake University is 30K a year, at least. Absolutely do not attend Drake, if you are paying for school yourself. I would also highly advise you pay no more than 40K for all four years, if you decide to attend. It is not worth the amount of crying you will do when you pay $900 a month in loans. Drake is no different than any other college in the US. Your education will be no better than a public education and you will be left with four times the student debt the average student accrues. My advice? Figure out what public school you want to attend. Talk to an advisor and find out what elective courses are required. Then, take those credits at a community college and then transfer them to the public university. After finishing the elected courses, attend the public university, and try to graduate in 2-2.5 years. This will save you so much money and prevent you from fighting to stay afloat as I am now."
Sophomore,2,"Students are not accepting or open to new people or ideas. The professors and faculty are great and very helpful. I feel as if I am getting a good education for the amount that I am paying. Scholarship opportunities are great. The students are some of the cliquiest, most close-minded people I have ever met. If you are not interested in drinking and partying, there is nothing to do on campus during the week or on the weekends. The only organizations that have events are Greek organizations. The dining is awful and I have gotten food poisoning from it twice in the year I have been here. The area surrounding the campus is very dangerous. Shootings are not uncommon in the blocks surrounding campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Our campus is very accepting, however there isn't much to accept. It's mainly christian white kids from affluent families. However those in minorities are not looked down upon, they work into our campus just as any other student. I personally haven't ever seen an instance of racism on campus."
College Freshman,2,Well this isn't a safe neighborhood  so
College Student,2,"I wouldn't say that campus is necessarily bad, but around campus is not the best. The night of the super moon, there was a shooting a block away from my dorm."
College Junior,2,"I don't think the alcohol or drug policies are enforced strictly enough. They may be strict on paper, but they are not usually enforced to the full extent that they should be, if at all."
College Freshman,2,"Drake University is not diverse at all. Drake is about 80% white and most people seem to be affiliated with Christianity. Since Drake is located in Iowa, politics are a hot topic at Drake and individuals are often discriminated against due to their political or social beliefs."
College Freshman,2,"Drake University is definitely not known for its athletics. While it is division-I, the teams are generally pretty bad except for the women's basketball team."
College Sophomore,2,There are very few scholarships available at this school. :(
College Freshman,2,Things to do but they aren't very exciting. The bars are easy to get into but they get more crowded and boring the more you go
College Freshman,2,Usually a lot of muggings at the off campus bars
College Freshman,2,They are very strict about drinking on campus which was pretty annoying
College Freshman,2,They usually throw lame parties.
College Freshman,2,There is limited diversity on the campus. Most students are of the same race and economic status.
College Student,2,It's very near the city but there aren't really any things to do besides shopping for students.
College Freshman,2,"There aren't many options, and they don't tell the Freshmen how it's going to work very well, so a lot of them end up getting ripped off for the most part."
College Junior,2,"Nobody stays on campus as an upperclassmen, because there are no upper classmen dorms, so it is almost impossible to find something."
College Junior,2,"There are three bars, but none of that are that great."
College Freshman,2,"Two bars are very close to campus, one is a dive and they do not card at all. The other seems to card consistently and from what I hear is pretty nice."
College Freshman,2,"Hubble dining hall is really iffy.  The food is normal college mess hall food, It's not great but it's edible and doesn't taste all that bad"
College Freshman,2,"The area is sketchy, and security is not actually affiliated with the police like other school's security forces, so they really have no power or jurisdiction besides being able to hold you until the actual police come.  There have been a few reports of violence around campus and only one incident on campus so far.  However if you can stay in a group you are good"
College Freshman,2,The wifi here sucks.  It randomly cuts out on me when I am doing an assignment or am on FaceTime.  It also sometimes just refuses to connect in certain buildings.  Also the guest network simply doesn't exist in the freshman dorms
College Freshman,2,The wifi can be awful at times.  For awhile I was unable to get any connection in a certain room where I needed it the most. 
College Sophomore,2,"Des Moines is a city that is still developing. In comparison to other cities it doesn't have as interesting attractions and events as say Chicago and St. Louis. But, that being said, there are concerts that come to town, campaigns, and fairs. It can be a sleepy city."
College Freshman,2,"It's Iowa - the weather is never predictable.  It can go from 20 degrees to 70 degrees in one day.  It snows, but it's nothing terrible.  You'll get to see all four seasons!"
College Junior,2,"If you don't have a car your options as far as off-campus dining are pretty limited.  Jethro's Sports Bar is half a block from campus and there are a number of bars nearby as well, but the food is less than spectacular for the price.  If you just want a break from Sodexo's dining hall ""food"" you can get a decent meal at one of the three or four places near campus for around $12, but other than that there isn't much variety.  I personally prefer to keep things healthy so the McD's, Subway, and ""KF Tacos"" (KFC and Taco Bell) that are right by campus just don't cut it for me.  There are some cool restaurants downtown like the Rock Bottom Restaurant and Brewery but these are quite a bit more spendy and not reachable by the city bus after about 6pm.  I have a car on campus so my friends and I take the freeway about 12 miles to the Jordan Creek Mall area in West Des Moines and there is a lot more variety there."
College Senior,2,Parking is pretty expensive and it can be pretty hard to find a spot that's anywhere close to where you want. There are specific hours you can and can't park on the street.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Heavily Midwest & Caucasian â€“ The majority of students come from upper-middle class families from the Kansas City, Minneapolis, & Chicago areas.  There is a presence of international students from Southeast Malaysia. There are probably an equal number of African American students are there are foreign students-- very low. Thos who are interested in politics are very voal, but the majority of students stay pretty  mum. Very few people are out about being gay, both men and women."
College Sophomore,2,Time Consuming With Ease â€“ They are very cost -efficient (free) but take time
College Junior,2,"Welcome to the Corn State â€“ This is not Miami, a city thriving with opportunity and exuberant night-lifers from all over the world basking in the night life which is a good investment. I am not saying Des Moines or Iowa as a whole would be bad places to invest in, there just isn't anything established of decent quality or size. Everything nightlife-wise is run down, old, and tiny. All the spots are 21 and up. Most of the places with nice crowds are seconds away from high-crime areas. Downtown at night is scary place. I went out one night as saw over 9 fights and about a dozen arrests. It seems people here party too hard sometimes with nowhere to really party. Students get free bus rides around town but the busses stop running around 9 p.m. Taxis are available 24/7."
College Freshman,2,Bars and Such â€“ Even though statistically we don't have a huge Greek population it definitely dominates the social life here. If you don't party/drink and aren't involved in Greek Life you will have to work harder at finding things to do.
College Junior,2,"Bars, Bars, and More Bars â€“ It felt like if you didn't want to go out and party that there was nothing to do for you."
College Student,2,"The freshman dorms at Drake University were just redone a few years ago, but they have an increasing problem with mold including moisture issues. It gets so bad that if your pillow is against the wall you can wake up to it being soaked in the morning. Some of the upperclassman dorms are a bit better, but still have their own set of issues."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Many Spaces â€“ There is plenty of street parking, but during the weekday I would not plan on going anywhere. Commuting students take the street parking and parking lots are always full. We could end up parking very very far away."
College Sophomore,2,On My Own for Job Search â€“ I feel as though I have not gotten much help when looking for research opportunities and future jobs.
College Freshman,2,"Alot of White Students â€“ Diversity on campus is increasing. However, the school can do alot more to increase the diversity on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Pretty Slim â€“ The dating market is pretty slim at Drake. It seems like the hottest guys and girls are also the ignorant frat boys or the ditzy sorority girls. However, because of Drake's location, you are guaranteed to meet people from all over the Midwest, and even all over the country. And there are some sweethearts here, but most of them are taken or gay."
College Senior,2,The food is hard to get adjust to especially after eating your mom cusine for years.Eating the same food will make you loose interest in on campus dining .I suggest getting the 10 meal plan which you will have 10 meals per week with $275 flex dollars .you can use the flex dollars at the coffee shop or C-store.Thats how I survived on campus dining
College Senior,2,They Are Ok â€“ I do not know greek people and do not associate with them
Niche User,1,"Much talk about how diverse and accepting they are when you apply, but when you get on campus nothing could be further from the truth.  An especially difficult place if your Asian or Latino.   Food is awful and you are required to purchase a meal plan, fully paid for at start of semester so not any incentive to change things.  Dining staff can't get it together when it comes to allergies.  Especially bad if you have a life-threatening food allergy as they never seem to really know what's in food.  Administration constantly screws things up and correcting their errors/managing them will be a full-time job for you.  Many Drake teachers teach at the community college and classes there are the same as at Drake.  Begs the question what kind of education you're really getting for all of that money."
College Student,1,"Drake University put on a facade of acceptance and friendliness which ceased after the first day of classes.  I did not feel that I belonged and the experience spiraled me into the worst depression I have ever been it.  I medically withdrew after one year, but I am not returning."
College Freshman,1,Drake costs way too much financial aid is inadequate.
College Freshman,1,I live right by the football stadium and I still never know when there's a game going on. No one goes
College Sophomore,1,"Nobody likes sodexo. They have low quality fruits and meats. All the food they serve is carbs and there is a lack of variety. You also have to pay for everything at the beginning of the year, they don't care if you want their food and decided to buy it. They already have you're money. I hate sodexo at Drake."
College Freshman,1,"I have had a rough semester personally, however it is all what you make of it, and I have made the wrong choices from the start"
College Student,1,"Des Moines is sooooooo cold in the winter!!! Most people are from the Midwest so we are used to it, but if you're not be prepared!"
College Sophomore,1,There is not a lot of diversity at Drake. Most students come from similar backgrounds and are typically from the bordering Iowa states.
College Sophomore,1,"The Greek life on campus is not really open for students from  different races. They put an emphasis on money and partying instead on brother or sisterhoods. They always hang in a click and I feel that they don't try to expand their horizons on campus. At Drake, the Greek Life is not really as important as it should be. We also, don't have diverse Greeks on campus."
College Freshman,1,"There is a small amount of diversity on campus, but the large majority of students are white.  Coming from a high school with large amounts of diversity, it was a little bit of a shock."
College Junior,1,"I have been nothing but disappointed by the academics at Drake.  I came here from a fairly high-achieving public high school with quite a few credits under my belt, and expected my high school coursework to have prepared me well for the rigor of college.  Having chosen Drake because they presented themselves to me as being a great place for highly motivated students who want to ""do their own thing"" in ways not possible at large public or research-oriented institutions, I was disappointed when I realized very quickly that not much is expected of the typical Drake student.  Professors often don't show up at their office hours, have other meetings scheduled, or push you away if you're doing well in their class and are just there to find out how you can go the extra mile.  Furthermore, Drake takes pride in their small class sizes and attendance is required in a vast majority of courses, yet most classroom time is completely worthless with professors and students alike simply regurgitating the text.  I may have gone to a very good high school, but that is no excuse for Drake being such a profound step down from the level of academic excellence I have formally been held to.  If you're going to college for the college experience and just want to glide through a prescribed succession of coursework and get a degree ""on the side"", then Drake is for you.  If you are curious about more than one subject, you actually like to learn, and you want to take full advantage of your four-year, one-hundred thousand dollar investment, then you might be disappointed.

College Sophomore,1,"No Options â€“ There are no 18 and older clubs, only bars. 3 of the 4 bars are really small and crowded. Aside from going to the bar, there's not much to do."
Recent Alumnus,1,It SUCKS â€“ THE PROFESSORS DON'T REALLY SEEM TO KNOW WHAT THE ARE TALKING ABOUT EXCEPT FOR A FEW. I WOULD NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE THAT'S FOR SURE.  STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
College Sophomore,1,Honor Code â€“ Drake University takes their honor codes extremely seriously. Students with even one alcohol violation in the residence halls are subject to punishment. I have seen people not get into pharmacy school because of a small violation. Take the honor code very seriously because it could come back to haunt you.
College Freshman,1,"Many first year students don't have a car at school so they have to rely on walking, the dart bus, or their friends cars. Unless you have friends or if the walk is short, it is hard to get around at night when the dart bus closes early."
College Senior,1,"Greeks Very Exclusive â€“ The Greek life at Drake is very exclusive.  Greeks make up just under half the student population and will hang out only with other Greeks.  If you are an independent, they will most likely not give you the time of day.  They also claim to have the highest GPAs on campus, but recent exposes have proved this not to be true."
College Freshman,1,A parking pass costs $250. Without a pass there is no parking near the classes or libraries.

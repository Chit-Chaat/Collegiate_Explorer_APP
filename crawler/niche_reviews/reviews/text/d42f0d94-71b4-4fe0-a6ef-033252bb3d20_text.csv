Freshman,5,The administration staff has been ready and willing to help throughout this Covid-19 pandemic.  Even working from home they are fast to return emails as well as phone calls.  They are friendly and knowledgeable staff that are assisting in anyway possible.  Even though classes are able to start in person they are not holding up the process and are continuing to allow online progress at this point.  The college is easily accessible there are no issues to report in that aspect.
Sophomore,5,It's a great school! All the teachers are fantastic! The faculty members are very reasonable and understanding! As someone who isn't very religious and attending a Christian College I have adapted well! The teachers are religious as well and many do express their beliefs but I doesn't tend to interfere with their teaching and the students learning. We have a great security staff that does a wonderful job and the school is very good at challenging it's student. Highly recommended!
Freshman,5,"If you want to be in a small school, focus on your self, and to be spiritually lifted, Robert Wesleyan is the school for you. I admire this school to the fullest. The professor care 110%  about their students as well as the other faculty members, giving a lot of one on one time with students. Professors also will make every effort to show up and support the students and the programs. Its currently changing me for the better and is bringing more opportunities for me to be successful with tutors for any and every class and the counselors and advisors that guide me everyday. I recommend this school to anyone and everyone."
Junior,5,Roberts Wesleyan College is a private Christian college. Their professors know every student & the school has a learning center in case of any student that needs additional tutoring. The school tries its best in making sure they provide the best graduates from different majors. I highly recommend.
Junior,5,"I adore this school! The professors obviously care about their students as well as the other faculty. If invited, teachers will make every effort to show up and support the students and the programs. The academics here are stupendous and I have a good time learning. The faculty is very helpful and very willing to help. I would recommend this College to any and every body!"
Graduate Student,5,"I liked how welcoming everyone was. Every employee there has gone out of their way to help. In addition, the campus is very clean and very modern. However, it is small, it has a lot of character. Great place overall!"
Niche User,5,"I was in awe when I visited Roberts.The campus was beautiful with amazing scenery.The property was well maintained,and it was nice to see so much nature surrounding it.I'm grateful for the welcome I received,one of the biggest factors into my decision with Roberts.I was blessed to be apart of a service,seeing one of the campus pastors preach.It's awesome to see that in school,it is a faith journey.Many many students attended, and the band was made up of talented students.My tour guide was definitely the best.She was extremely enthusiastic about the school and her dual sporting.I could definitely tell she was faith bound,and a disciple of God.The food was delicious.An athletics recruiter encouraged me to finish my soccer season strong,and perform well in track.That little motivation helped me as a captain of both teams to win the NFL title for our school,and break another school record for track.I'm looking forward to being able to attend Roberts!"
Senior,5,The professors at this college are excellent. There is a high quality of learning as well as a good teacher-student ratio. The classes are interesting and engaging.
Senior,5,Roberts Wesleyan College is a great college if you are looking for a small campus. It is a beautiful campus. The amount of diversity is ok. The professors are supportive. they are hands which will equip you for the workforce. Roberts is a place for you to grow spiritually.
Sophomore,5,I love that everyone knows each other and that your professors take a personal interest into helping you succeed.
Freshman,5,"I knew I wanted to be a student at this college because when I did the tour, everyone I met was happy to be part of Roberts Wesleyan College. The staff and faculty truly make you feel like family and will help you will anything you need. I feel like I am part of a family here and I encourage all future students to take a tour of Roberts Wesleyan College."
Senior,5,"Roberts is the type of college that promotes a strong sense of community. No matter where you turn, someone is there to help and encourage you though your academic career. You are not a number, you are a person and every professor takes the time to know you and what you need as a student."
Junior,5,"The teachers at Roberts are excellent, they have a lot of experience in the fields they are teaching in. The students are also very nice and accepting, it is easy to make a lot of good friends. Along with the nice people,  the school has really nice gyms and sports programs. The only downfall of a Christian school is how much it is talked about and worked into most classes."
Junior,5,"When I started college at Roberts, I didn't think that I would make the friends I did. But I became friends with people who have the same values as I do and believe we can last for a long time. I really recommend taking a tour of the campus and see if you want to apply to Roberts. I did and I am glad I did."
Freshman,5,Roberts has a very positive environment that revolves not only around God but also anything that students value the most. There is always someone there for every student to talk to. Courses are taught by professors who are not only there to teach but also to care and pray with their students. There are also multiple clubs and groups that students can join to get away from the acedemics and do what they love best.
Senior,5,"The higher education experience I received at Roberts was excellent.  Through my major, Roberts equipped me with unique hands on experience that has made me competitive in the workforce.  The classroom sizes are small, the buildings have all been recently renovated, athletics are evolving, it is completely safe, programs are innovative, it is located 15 minutes from downtown Rochester NY and the relationships are strong.  President Deanna Porterfield is a true visionary holding to the roots of Roberts 150 year history.  I am proud to be a member of the Roberts Wesleyan community."
College Junior,5,We have the top school in NYS in campus safety
College Junior,5,Roberts is a very very safe campus. Never have to worry about your safe being.
College Junior,5,Security on campus is always available to contact.
College Sophomore,5,i love how much knowledge the profs gave they shouldnt even be working in a school they should be curing cancer
College Freshman,5,"Our academics range according to our major. We have tons of options and it's really helpful, especially when you aren't quite sure about what you want to major in yet."
College Freshman,5,We are a very diverse campus and we enjoy having different ethnic groups come to Roberts and teach us about their culture.
College Freshman,5,Campus safety is willing to help out no matter the problem. My friends and I were stuck at the diner down the road and security was willing to help out and drive us back to campus. I appreciated it very much.
College Freshman,5,"I love living on campus, it's amazing to be close to my friends."
College Freshman,5,"I love being there, I feel as if I actually belong. Everyone is very friendly and they are always willing to help out if you're in need. I enjoy the classes and all the friends I've made."
College Sophomore,5,"If you want to come to a school for academics, this is the best choice. The professors are extremely knowledgeable, and want you to learn real world material rather than just how to pass a test."
College Freshman,5,The courses are helpful as well as the professors. Most of my professors have sought me out to see how I am doing with all of my grades. Class sizes are small and close which is a good atmosphere for learning.
College Freshman,5,This school makes me feel like I'm at home. I couldn't be happier anywhere else. All the professors are knowledgeable and actually care about the student's grades.
College Junior,5,The professors are by far the best part of the college.  They are amazing!
Recent Alumnus,5,"Roberts has small classes, interdisciplinary studies and is student driven."
College Sophomore,5,"MCC is a great start to furthering education. I met a ton of people and many of us had one thing in common, furthering our education. There is a wide variety of classes and times. A great staff of dedicated professors who make it their goal to get their students excited about their education. I would go back and experience it all over and wouldn't change a single course or professor."
College Freshman,5,"The class sizes are very small, so I am able to connect to my professor and I am able to learn the material very easily"
College Sophomore,5,Many diverse groups attend this school
College Sophomore,5,I have never been offered drugs or alcohol on campus or heard of anyone doing drugs.
College Sophomore,5,Teachers for the nursing program what to make sure when we graduate that we are ready to become get nurses. That we are prepared and not afraid to ask questions. The teachers push us to do our best and are wonderful and essentials pieces to our learning.
College Freshman,5,"The school itself isn't very prestigious, but the professors sure are."
College Freshman,5,Rochester has a ton to offer once you get past its awful weather.
College Freshman,5,"There have barely ever been any incidents regarding a lack of safety. I say ""barely"" because I've never heard of any, but they still could have happened at one point. The security is all over the place but there are no issues, so they basically act as a transport service. If it's 3 am and you've finally finished your homework in the library, call security. They'll drive you back to your dorm.

The health office is also really great. Appointments pretty much always get you in really, really fast. The counseling center is also wonderful."
College Freshman,5,"It's nonexistent, officially speaking. In reality, my friends and I go out to bars and whatnot all the time. None of the professors or administration really care. They say that they won't let you drink, but no one cares and if they know anything, they won't tell anyone just because no one wants any trouble."
College Freshman,5,"I'm going to school for only about $5000 a semester, and that's really cool. They were very generous with scholarships. I also have three on-campus jobs to help out with my bills, which is awesome."
College Freshman,5,"You don't need any kind of transportation; it's a tiny campus. That's the best kind of transportation.

But if you have a car, there's plenty of parking."
College Freshman,5,"I don't live very close to the school (West Henrietta) but the commute is worth it. If the weather is bad and your professor knows you're a commuter, he'll very likely be understanding of absence."
College Freshman,5,The professors are amazing and really care about you. Some of them are even known to invite the class over for dinner. The dining hall staff are very friendly and the food is amazing. I love the Christian aspect of the school and being surrounded by other young Christians. One of my favorite parts of the week is going to chapel. It's nice to have a scheduled break in the week where there are no classes. 
College Freshman,5,"Everyone I know has gotten at least one scholarship from Roberts. They're very understanding and do their best to help lower the cost to make it easier for you to attend. When I realized that I didn't have enough money for books, they helped us to figure out how to add a loan so I would be able to purchase my books and even gave me a voucher since the loan didn't go into effect when I needed it to."
College Freshman,5,the best campus security ever!! I love them
College Junior,5,"Across the board , sports are well represented at Robert's Wesleyan College."
College Junior,5,"I have never felt unsafe and Robert's Wesleyan Campus. I have been on campus at all times of day , and evening and have never felt unsafe."
College Freshman,5,"Roberts is a christian school, but almost half of the people here are not. Some simply come here because of the quality of the education you can receive here. Yes, some teachers are harsh, but almost all of them are approachable, enjoy the material they teach, and offer some sort of extra help when needed."
College Freshman,5,I love my dorm and my roomate. I feel safe always and never feel unaccepted.  We all take turns shopping and buying our necessities.
College Freshman,5,The whole academic view is based on the study of the bible and the word of God! If you love the lord this is the place to study.
College Freshman,5,"Our school thrives on our academic perspective as it is enforced by the word of GOD (Bible).  If you love the lord, then this is truly the place to study as each class draws in the perspective and influence of the word.  I have learned about the word and grown to have a better relatiobship with God."
College Freshman,5,"I truly believe that the teachers and personnel staff are very accepting of diversity in my school. I have made plenty of friends here that will last me a life time. Of course there were minor kinks amongst my peers that had to worked on in the beginning, but nothing major.  It was sort of like when you start a new friendship or relationship, you have to get to know each other better before the relationship can mature."
College Junior,5,Taking online class so weather is not an issue at this time.
College Sophomore,5,"Because Roberts is a Christian school, the drug scene is basically nonexistent. You might find a handful of people who do drugs, but they don't do it on campus because it's against the rules."
College Freshman,5,"I'm a nursing major so our workload is heavier than other majors. As long as you don't procrastinate, you should be fine. It really depends on your major and class."
Recent Alumnus,5,Safety at Roberts – I feel very safe at Roberts. I have heard of one time some one was on campus dress inapropriate. from my years at Roberts I have had no issues or concerns. there are call boxs around and the security rides around very often. When a issue arise the school informs you asap concerning the issue. Just be wise in your actions and belongings.
College Senior,5,"You Are Not Just a Number! At Roberts, the professors truly care about you as a person and that is going on in your life. If there happens to be such a tragedy on one's life that might deter a test grade, the professor may allow you to postpone that test till a later point when you are more prepared and able to take it without distraction. They are all wonderful!"
College Senior,5,Free Printing Is Great! The labs are great! All printing is free! The tech support is also great! Always there to support and help you in time of need! :)
College Senior,5,Determined and Driven – The athletes of Roberts are determined to succeed and are passionate about what they do. One of the greatest pole-vaulters in the world came through Roberts and now is a recurring Olympic champion.
College Senior,5,"Challenging to the Mind Yet Warm and Welcoming – I love Roberts and could not dream of attending any other college for this stage of my life. Everyone is so warm and welcoming. The professors truly care about you and it doesn't matter what background of life you led, all they care about is seeing you succeed."
Senior,4,"I came into the pathways to teaching programs a year ago, and when my journey began the staff was very helpful in explaining everything and making sure I understood what the program was going to be like and the expectations. One thing I would change though is the communication on taking extra classes. start them early if you need them so you're not trying to cram everything in at the end."

Freshman,4,Roberts Wesleyan College is a faith-based community who is very welcoming to anyone. A small campus allows students to be able to get to know their professors easily. Very beautiful campus and the people there are just amazing.
Sophomore,4,"Roberts Wesleyan is a great college. If you are a Christian, I would recommend this school because it is clear that God is the focus of this school. When I was searching for a college, I wanted to find a Christian college that would help me grow spiritually. This college is also great for athletics, especially cross country and track. I am lucky to be part of the team and grow as a runner."
Sophomore,4,I love the faculty and staff. It is definitely not  your typical college filled with non-academic pursuits. But it fits my personality perfectly and provides me with the lifestyle I want.
Freshman,4,"I love this campus. It is very well maintained. It is very pretty, espically during the fall when the leaves change. The residence halls are nice. They are well maintained. The staff is so helpful, amazing, and friendly."
Junior,4,I would like to say that Roberts is an extremely peaceful place. Every on is there to learn and take their studies very serious. There is not a lot of partying that goes on but they do have many college events that students can engage in. Some of the professors are absolutely amazing and others aren't the best. Overall it is a friendly school and a friendly area.
Graduate Student,4,"I am going to be in the RN to BSN completion course. I've been out of school for over 5 years ,Roberts Wesleyan College has given me the flexible opportunity to work full time and obtain my degree one night a week."
Junior,4,The communications department is led by people who have been there for too long and do not involve hands on experience as much as they should. But the people are as friendly as they seem as when you come and visit. It gives it a very homey feel.
Sophomore,4,"I love the smaller school feel. The campus is beautiful. I don't personally know everyone, it is college, but the majority of people I see are familiar faces. Chapel is a great addition. Their JV soccer program helped me branch out and meet people and keep playing after high school, The professors really care how I am."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Roberts has transformational. Its a small college campus where you can get know so many nice and outgoing people who share similar beliefs.
Freshman,4,"Somewhat difficult to find what you need, but very useful and informative. Some of the scholarships seem unreachable. It is helpful to be able to compare things like prices, grade point average, acceptance, etc. all in one place."
College Junior,4,Most of the graduates at the school get jobs right out of school.
College Junior,4,I really like the size of the classes. They are small enough that the professors actually know us all by name.
College Junior,4,This campus is super safe. Nothing really bad happens on campus.
College Junior,4,I really love the housing on campus. It is really close to my classes.
College Junior,4,"The school is small and quiet, I really like it. I'm glad I go there"
College Junior,4,Alcohol is around but mostly it is good
College Junior,4,"I haven't applied for internships yet,mostly good"
College Junior,4,"Great school, very open and friendly environment"
College Junior,4,Roberts Wesleyan College is a great school. Go!
College Junior,4,I have yet to reach that stage but feel good with walking away with an education degree from Roberts.
College Junior,4,The courses are challenging and feedback from professor is always available.
College Junior,4,"I would recommend my school because of the time,patience, and understanding staff put into caring about students."
College Junior,4,Most of the faculty are educated and encourage healthy living. The sports department overseas the health insurance offered to college students that doesn't have medical insurance. I appreciate the each faculty members put into caring for students.
College Freshman,4,whenever there is an issue our campus safety is always there when you need them
College Freshman,4,Professors are all very nice. Add some relligous aspects into every lecture. Class sizes are pretty small for gen eds. Biggest classes are the nursing classes and sciences.
College Junior,4,There are a lot of job postings and job fairs on campus
College Freshman,4,They actually care about the education we are getting and they continue to care even after graduation.
College Freshman,4,I like that my professors are willing to help and that they understand that college can be rough sometimes. I enjoy the way they teach and most of the time they make it easy to listen to.
College Freshman,4,"People at Roberts get very I to sports and they love to encourage the team. Intermurals are also a big thing, they want their students to get into being active and having fun."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel extremely safe at this school. I am a girl and I never worry about walking back to my car at 3am across campus - it's that safe. However, the security guards can be sticklers about silly rules sometimes. Especially parking."
College Sophomore,4,I actually was able to get an internship my Sophomore year because of on-campus recruiting. I plan on continuing my career with this particular company after I graduate.
College Sophomore,4,The athletic center was just recently renovated in December 2015.
College Freshman,4,There is barely any incidents involving campus crime and the security is quick to react to incidents.
College Freshman,4,The faculty and dean works hard to make sure students create connections with employees of their desired major.
College Freshman,4,There have been no safety concerns this first year that I have attended.
College Freshman,4,I feel the smallness of the school helps with the class sized and relationships with professors.
College Freshman,4,I am only involved in intramurals but my friends who are in the sports programs have attended this school to be on the teams.
College Freshman,4,I enjoy school so far and feel it is preparing me for my future.
College Sophomore,4,"The security team is actually really good, most if not all of the security staff are former or current police. There can be some overzealous policing on campus (during finals we were kicked out of the student lounge because it was closed, and the library cafe was completely full with nowhere else for us to study in a group. Other than some incidents like that, the security team is great."
College Sophomore,4,"Either every year or every semester there's a job fair on campus to recruit students, and the student internship network is pretty great. The primary reason I went to this school was because of how many people had said that they'd heard great things about the school and it's graduates."
College Sophomore,4,"I lived in 2 different dorm buildings during my time there, and both had their benefits and drawbacks. It really depends on the kind of community that you want. I lived in the large girls dorm (Davison) which had the advantage of being pretty new and updated. All the rooms in this building are suite style, and it's 4 girls to a bathroom. The common room was decent sized, and the process to reserve the dorm tv worked pretty well. The rooms were fairly large, and all the rooms had ac/heat. The Greek village dorm I lived in (Sitig) was a lot smaller but it had the advantage of being tucked kind of out of the way and away from the underclassmen. There was a bit more of a community in the dorms in Greek village, though the dorms were older and didn't have a/c. Personally I preferred the privacy and the bathrooms over in sitig were pretty good, with 8 girls to the bathroom. It's more the kind of experience you want when it comes to the dorm lottery, which you enter in your second year."
College Freshman,4,Although I have not yet used the career center I have only heard great things about it.
College Junior,4,The campus is a safe place to be.
College Junior,4,Roberts is well respected in the community.
College Freshman,4,"I have had trouble adjusting to my school, but I think that comes with any college. Overall I am glad that I ended up at the college that I am at because I am so involved in so many things and already have great leadership roles and bunch of friends. Additionally, it's already starting to shape me as a person, in a good way."
College Sophomore,4,"Ive only been in school for about 5 weeks or so, and so far I really like this graduate program and the professors."
Recent Alumnus,4,I liked how the students and staff were friendly
College Freshman,4,"Roberts is a pretty strict campus.  If you plan to become involved with drugs and alcohol when you come to college, don't go to Roberts.  Drugs and alcohol rules are highly enforced here, and something as simple as being caught with people who have been drinking can cost you your education here at Roberts.  There is no co-ed dorming here, but there are certain days and times when people of the opposite gender can be in the dorms. This is also highly enforced but not as highly as you  are told when touring the campus ( people are supposed to keep their doors open when visitors of the opposite gender are over but they usually don't).   Overall, I have never felt unsafe here, and the rules are very upheld."
College Freshman,4,"Since this is a private college, Roberts tends to be more willing about giving grants and money that the students may need. The staff here understands that college is very expensive and difficult to pay for.  Roberts costs about $40,000  per year, but for me, Roberts covered a little over half of that. So, I pay about the same amount of attending a state school, with the experiences and opportunities of a private school.  Students here pay by semester, so ever semester us students are paying for half of the tuition.  On average, i pay about $2000 a semester thanks to the money i earned from the school and scholarships that i applied to on my own.  If you really show that you want to be at Roberts, they will help you."
College Freshman,4,"Being a freshman here at Roberts, my dorm building is not the best dorm building to live in on campus.  My floor mates and I go through problems here and there such as a broken washing machine or a broken toilet.  It's not luxury living, but it is definitely better than other college dorms that I have seen elsewhere. Sometimes I think that I pay too much for my housing since appliances break and sometimes the heat isn't right (plus it takes what seems like forever for these things to be fixed), but I have to live here so it is something i have to deal with.  The social life in my dorm building is great! I have a great RA  and RD that holds events for my floor and my building overall.  it is a great way to get to know people especially since i have to live with them.  All and all it is not perfect, but it is pretty alright."
College Sophomore,4,The officers are very nice and always make you feel safe.
College Freshman,4,The room sizes are pretty decent and the dorms are not too far from everything. The school offers good scholarships to try to help lower the cost of their dorms.
College Freshman,4,"NCFR, Bill Gray's, Agatina's, Rohrbachs, Jitters, Subway, Wegmans, Tim Horton's, Wimpy's,Jerimiahs along with Rookies are super close to campus."
College Freshman,4,"The town is great, all business accept the RWC students.  All attractions including the city, sports and night life are within a 15 minute drive."
College Freshman,4,The campus is extremely safe. There are these blue boxes around campus that call for security but it is rare that someone uses it.
College Freshman,4,There are new renovations this year on the nursing/science building and the cafeteria. They are looking awesome. I can't wait till they are completed.
College Freshman,4,I know a lot of people who have had great success in pursuing their dream job.
Recent Alumnus,4,There are great advisers to help get someone into the right major and help them through the process.
College Freshman,2,we don't have any farts or sororities. There is no Greek life on campus nothing fun like that.
College Junior,2,A ton of busy work that takes away from the core of your learning.
College Junior,2,"I have a couple of great professors this semester and have had great experiences with adjuncts. Overall, I am not impressed with the faculty. Very disorganized"
College Freshman,2,The school doesn't have many sports options and the facility is really small
College Sophomore,2,"I personally had some pretty bad professors, and some pretty bad classes, and the lack of support for students who are more diverse than the overall student population is pretty staggering. There's one lgbt support group and it meets in secret. There's multicultural clubs, but no real multi religious clubs, and with all the mandated religious requirements at the school, it helps fuel alienation of students with differing views."
College Sophomore,2,"Only students who are very religious or very alternative should go here, since those are the only groups welcomed on campus. The nursing program that I was in was pretty much only for the super studious honor roll students. If you weren't one of those people, then there tended to be a less welcoming atmosphere. The mandatory chapels do start to drag on and it's really difficult to stay caught up on projects and the like when there's so much time devoted to chapels. The lack of diverse activities is uninspiring and if you don't get involved either in the school sanctioned culture of the underground culture it's a very lonely experience."
College Junior,2,"Roberts has double standards for its students and holds certain groups to higher regard, such as the athletes."
College Freshman,2,"Roberts likes to keep their students on campus.  There are people that commute from their homes near by, but that is a bout it.  In order to live off campus you need to be living with a family member, married, or go through a lot of work to get the permission to do so.  I don't know of many people who were able to just buy an apartment and live there.  I know of an apartment complex about 10-15 minutes away as an option but that's about it"
College Sophomore,2,My financial aide person is not helpful and tells me that there are not any scholarships for me because my parents make too much.
College Sophomore,2,The meat is almost always undercooked and there is no variety.
College Sophomore,2,Food is poor and there are not alot of options to choose from.
College Sophomore,2,We are not tecnaily allowed to to live off campus.
College Sophomore,2,There is definatly more guys than girls and it is noticeable. 
College Sophomore,2,they are small abd the food is not very good to eat. 
College Sophomore,2,The winters are long and cold and it is hot in the summer. 
College Sophomore,2,"Dining is alright. As far as option you have a lot. Quality, depends on what you like."
College Sophomore,2,Student life greatly depends on what you like to do. 
College Sophomore,2,The guys on campus are attractive and there is a good amount of personalities to match what you like.
College Sophomore,2,The wireless internet is slow when there are a lot of students using it at one time.
College Sophomore,2,"The campus brings in a lot of international students, but in terms of ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation, there is little diversity."
Junior,1,"If I had done my research before attending Roberts, I would have gone to a SUNY college. I feel that the education I'm receiving here is not worth what I'm paying, and I feel foolish for not understanding that there is no need to fear public college as long as you know who you are morally and the kind of people you want to associate with. Here’s instructions for finding an identical education at a public college: Join the right crowd and a spiritual life group for spirituality and dating.  For a respected degree, just go to a SUNY college or another good school. For organized activities, there’s nothing special here that isn’t anywhere else. For sports, go anywhere else. Sports is nothing here. For safety, just act responsibly at a public college and you'll be quite alright. For good professors, use RateMyProfessor at a public college, you should have no problem."
College Junior,1,"Racist professors in certain majors and corruption in order to force black students out. Favoritism shown (lengthy extensions) shown to certain students but not others. There is a very interesting version of ""Christianity"" at play at RWC! 

(I am Caucasian. I have just witnessed much racism here.) 

Many professors are disorganized/unprofessional.  

Save your money; go to a different school!"
College Freshman,1,Our school doesn't offer greek life so it lacks the social experience that other colleges have.
Recent Alumnus,1,if you are different people will hate you
Recent Alumnus,1,"Faculty is bad, professors are good"
College Freshman,1,We aren't allowed to live off-campus
College Freshman,1,There aren't parties on campus
College Freshman,1,I do not like the food!!!!!!!!!
College Sophomore,1,"The closest bus transportation is 4 miles down the road. The only campus-transportation is to and from school events, even then seating is limited. "
Recent Alumnus,1,"At Roberts, you cannot live off campus until you are over the age of 21. Once you reach that age you can easily find an apartment in the Rochester area, but being able to afford it may be tricky for a college student."
College Freshman,1,"The only way you can live off campus is if you live with your family or with a faculty member. Some faculty members rent out their houses, but not many. I personally don't think that it should be decided by the college where we live."
College Junior,1,"You Cannot Live Off-Campus If You Are Under 21 – It is quite an annoyance. Room and board are very expensive, but are required if you are not a commuter. Even upon special request, you cannot get an apartment. My close friend was planning on living in an apartment with his sister this year, but the school would not allow it, even though his sister was 21. Even after his parents called the school to try and arrange the situation, they denied their request."
College Junior,1,"Needs Improvement – The college is in the transition to the NCAA (DII), and it is hard to imagine the teams being very competitive at that level, at least right from the start. The social life of the school makes it hard to bring in real top level talent, and that shows in the schools performances. The administration seems stuck between wanting to keep their certain view of what the Roberts student should be, and with wanting to create teams that can actually compete.

Facilities are fair, but not outstanding. The school needs to look into expanding their offerings with regards to weights and cardio equipment. A larger stadium would also be nice, but the lack of crowds at major events makes that hard to justify.

That same lack of crowds points to another issue, a lack of campus support for athletes. Since it is a small school a fair number of students are involved in sports. With such a high percentage involved the ""allure"" of being an athlete is diminished. Also crowd support at competitions is very low, people just don't turn out for games or other events."
College Sophomore,1,"There Is No Night Life – If you want to have a good time near our campus, make sure you go off of it"
College Senior,1,"I really don't care for the parking situation at my school. There is not much competition for a spot on any given day. However, they charge us $100 just to park in ONE specific lot. They ticket ridiculously as well. I work very late at our library as well and when I have to walk across campus at 2am to my assigned lot it peeves me!"
College Junior,1,"A lot of people have cars at Roberts... However, there is VERY limited if any public transportation. Since the school has a tight knit community people tend to get rides from friends. However, there isn't a lot of accessibility to buses or ways to get out of North Chili."
College Freshman,1,"Cold an Windy – If you don't park on campus, good luck with the weather! It's so cold and windy here. You will wish that your car was right next to you!"
College Freshman,1,"You ""Signed the Waiver&quot – You sign a contract before being allowed to attend classes that you will not participate in drug or alcoholic activities. Thus, if caught doing so, you may get expelled."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Allowed! As students of Roberts Wesleyan College, we are not allowed to have off campus apartments unless it is with a parent or some sort of family member."
College Sophomore,1,"No Drinking or Drugs on Campus – Although it is forbidden for anyone on campus to drink alcohol or do drugs, there are a few students that are known for drinking and smoking off campus. The rule is set in place but we are treated like adults and are allowed to make our own decisions while off campus. But if you are caught smoking, drinking, or just high or drunk, you will be kicked out off school."

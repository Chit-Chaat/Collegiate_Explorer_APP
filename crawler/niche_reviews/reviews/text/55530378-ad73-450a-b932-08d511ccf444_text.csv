Alum,5,"I didn't take online classes at WWU, although I'm sure that their program would be really connective just like the in-class experience."
Alum,5,"I had a tremendous experience at WWU where I gained practical experience in the radio business, in which I've had a 30 year career.  The faculty and staff are highly engaged with individual students, not only helping them achieve in the classroom but learning to navigate life."
Niche User,5,"I really like how inclusive it is. I haven't started school there but from the moment I applied, students and faculty reached out to me to make sure I feel welcomed."
Sophomore,5,"The diversity and inclusive atmosphere is such a breath of fresh air from high school! I love the helpful staff, knowledgable professors, and amazing mentors."
Senior,5,"Walla Walla University is a great school with a good foundation. The teachers here care about your success. They do whatever they can to ensure you succeed in life. The campus has a great atmosphere and everyone is friendly. The only thing I would change about the campus is the cafeteria food selection. Other than the food, everything else is good."
Niche User,5,It is a great school if your looking to grow spiritually and if you want to pursue any degree. The school has great Professors that actually care about their students. They are really focused on individual success and make sure you are an fully rounded student.
Freshman,5,"Walla Walla is a great college community. I've never felt so supported by a school, such as Walla Walla. The professors are very passionate about what they teach and there are many reliable sources for help when you need it."
Alum,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed and have been blessed to be able to attend WWU. I enjoyed a year studying abroad in Argentina and took a year to go through the Student Missionary program they have. In both experiences I learned about myself, the world and its different cultures, and graduated knowing service to others is a value I want to keep throughout the rest of my life. The academic side is solid and prepared me for my graduate studies."
Freshman,5,"I love my university. The environment is incredibly friendly, all the professors are amazing, academic quality is great."
Senior,5,Very good Christian community. They will do whatever they can to help you succeed. The professors are very approachable and willing to help students.
Sophomore,5,My experience at Walla Walla University has been an experience that surpassed my expectations. I absolutely love this school. The community and the staff are absolutely welcoming. Relationships are something big for me that I have found at Walla Walla. I know I now have lifelong friends.
Freshman,5,Walla Walla University has been very accepting towards the people who attend. The faculty and students make you feel very welcomed. The only thing I would want to see a difference in  is the hours of the library.
Freshman,5,I've only been here for a year but I already love it. This school has given me many opportunities to make new friends and grow closer to God. Everyone here is very friendly.
Sophomore,5,"Walla Walla University is a private school and many things are based on the Adventist church guidelines but it is a great school overall. The area is beautiful, the people are nice and the community and activities around are always a fun adventure. I personally love Walla Walla University because it has a very diverse set of students but everyone is friendly and are treated the same. There are always things to do and people to do it with. You never get bored or lonely because there are plenty of opportunities for fun everywhere you go."
Sophomore,5,"Walla Walla University is an excellent University to attend if you are passionate about your relationship with Christ and are serious about getting top notch education in not only your desired field,  but also in religion and other life applicable areas. They are very well known all over the country for their School of Engineering, which is the reason I am there, and I have to say I am very impressed with their organization of classes, schedules, and events not to mention how excellent the Professors are. Most of them have their Doctorate and are knowledgable well above their years. If this sounds like a University that fits you, I encourage you to give it a shot for yourself and take a tour here sometime. You won't regret it!"
Sophomore,5,It's a nice small University just outside of the city of Walla Walla. The small university allows for more chances for students to connect and make good relationships with their professors.
Senior,5,"The professors go out of their way to answer your questions and make themselves availible.  The cafe is the primary on site eating location and has good fold; however, it would be nice to have additional more on-site eating locations, but for the limited size it makes sense."
Freshman,5,"Walla Walla university is one of the best colleges I went to. Everyone on campus is very friendly and nice. The tutoring center is almost always open which helps a lot when it comes close to midterms. And the professors are all nice and understanding and explain everything very well. There is no party scene here which is very good. The campus cafeteria is vegetarian which is a downer but there are many choices and there is always something yummy to eat. The local area is very beautiful there are mountains near by and lakes, the city is about a 40 minute drive which makes it nice to go do more things. Its very nice community that surrounds the campus. There is a club for almost everything and if we don't have one you are looking for then you can make your own. "
Recent Alumnus,5,"The sense of being in this with everyone was incredible. Every finals week there are encouraging notes posted all over campus and ridiculously fun activities (ex. races using discarded hospital beds, bouncy castles). You can find support pretty much anytime you need it and most of the people are super friendly. There are a few less-than spectacular professors but they're pretty easy to avoid - just ask a couple older students for their recommendations. The cafeteria food is even getting better, although you still can't find meat there."
College Freshman,5,This is a safe place. There was one scare recently about an armed prowler but security handled it appropriately and in a timely manner. Administration works hard to keep this a safe place and students appreciate the amount of safety they experience.
College Freshman,5,I have not had an experience with the career center but there are great opportunities for employers recruiting on campus and securing jobs after graduation. Employers and graduate schools appreciate the skills and well rounded personality that student acquire at this institution.
College Sophomore,5,The gym is up to date and well kept.
College Sophomore,5,"People are very friendly, campus is beautiful, academics are a challenge but that's a good thing."
College Sophomore,5,"Counseling center can be very helpful, career prospects are good, they can help with that."
College Junior,5,"The professors are really kind and accommodating, they make sure to pray for you and listen if you need extra help."
College Freshman,5,Lot's of fun activities put on by ASWWU
College Freshman,5,The rules are there to ensure the best opportunities for students
College Freshman,5,They are genuine in their care for their students
College Freshman,5,"It's great for Theology, nursing and engineering"
College Freshman,5,It is probably the best in the SDA Church presently
College Freshman,5,Walla Wall University is really helpful
College Freshman,5,"Safety is a big deal on campus, so if something isn't safe, it's taken care of."
College Freshman,5,The learning that can happen here is amazing.
College Freshman,5,People are genuinely nice at WWU
College Freshman,5,It's not hard at all
College Freshman,5,Just ask to talk to the Enrollment office

College Junior,5,I've really enjoyed my experience here and would come again!
College Freshman,5,I do plan on having an internship and I can easily get connected to one when I go study abroad in Spain with my school's program.
College Freshman,5,I am confident it will be the best for me.
College Freshman,5,I can walk it at anytime and for any reason and I will be helped.
College Freshman,5,I was automatically considered for scholarships for my grades which I really appreciated.

College Sophomore,5,"Four seasons, great small town feel"
College Freshman,5,"The off-campus housing selection that Walla Walla offers is really great because there are so many options to choose from. There are three different kinds of apartments, with different accommodations, different sizes and of course, different prices. Also, there are several houses, for if you want to live with several people. They are all walking-distance from campus and very affordable. It is so convenient because you are free from curfew, from having to eat the food in the cafeteria, and you don't have to put up with distractions that you would at the dorm. You live by your own rules!"
College Junior,5,I am very happy about my program. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. I don't have any concerns about finding a job when I am finished.
College Junior,5,I love my school. The faculty and staff  are amazing. I couldn't be in a better place.
College Sophomore,5,a lot of variety and help getting into your housing when needed
College Freshman,5,"The Walla Walla University experience is unlike that of any other SDA campus. The balance of spiritual, academic, and social life is absolutely perfect! I would not want to go to any other University!"
College Sophomore,5,"I would declare an English major again in a heartbeat. Everything about the subject I love. My goal with my degree in English is to become a writer for a travel magazine. I would love to be able to travel the world, meet new people, eat new food, and see new things and be able to write about them and inspire others to go and see for themselves. My only concern is that being a writer, especially for entertainment, is becoming obsolete because not many people today read magazines or newspapers. Everything is online these days."
College Senior,5,"Given that this campus is a Seventh Day Adventist University, the drug scene at Walla Walla University is not big at all. Visibility and usage is rather rare and if found, policies are enforced in their full extent."
College Sophomore,5,Campus Not Divided – Walla Walla does not emphasize Greek life.  A few of the clubs take on greek names but there is not a strong greek force.  It makes the campus feel more united instead of different groups of people.
College Sophomore,5,"There is not an issue with anything of the sort, there is no drug scene on campus, those who indulge cannot find anything there. Same story goes foralcohol consumption."
College Sophomore,5,"No Drugs on Campus – Since this is an Adventist campus, there are no usage of drugs on campus. Most students comply to the rules and follow the no-drug policy."
College Freshman,5,"Multiple Clubs – Incredible amount of clubs including Black Students United, Keep your Asian on, Hispanic Ministries, and Gay straight alliance group"
College Freshman,5,Community Loves the School – The community loves the school and works greatly to accommodate students and events that students have. There are multiple stores within walking distance as well as coffee places.
Graduate Student,4,I do not begin until Fall 2020 so far with all online services needed with Walla Walla the program has been smooth and very helpful for me in completing my application process.
Niche User,4,I haven't been on campus (coronavirus) but I have seen a virtual tour. The campus seems quite nice and inviting.
Sophomore,4,"Most professors were patient with the transition process into online learning. It was a difficult transition, but I felt that the students were given the necessary grace."
Junior,4,"The nursing program is fabulous!
I would suggest living off campus though, the Women's dormitory is too strict."
Junior,4,All of my professors were very understanding with all of the complications we faced with having to be online this quarter.
Freshman,4,"What I loved the most about Walla walla was their spiritual aspect. Vespers and community were my favorite programs. Although it was not a very diverse school, people and students at walla walla are kind and they simply cared about you. The teachers go out of their way to truly make you feel welcomed."
Senior,4,"I have had an excellent experience here. Overall, I have had the honor of interacting with committed and intelligent professors."
Junior,4,"I love Walla Walla University. The atmosphere is so welcoming and friendly, I have never been in such a positive environment as Walla Walla has created. That being said, it is not a very racially diverse campus, and that is something that needs to change. Walla Walla does do its best to make sure the non-white students are involved and have many outlets to share and express pride for their nationalities. Even still the minority is extremely outnumbered and Walla Walla should do its best to bring in and give more opportunities to the minorities."
Niche User,4,"it was fine for a freshman year. Since i am not into the party scene at all, it was a good environment. the academics are stellar and the professors clearly know their material and are passionate about their subjects and students."
Senior,4,I love Walla Walla University. I am a Biochemistry major and love the small class size and the help I can get from my professors in a small department. The student association (ASWWU) is great and students are very involved in leadership.
Junior,4,"The rules are kinda strict but the campus life is great. The cafeteria food is awful and there's a mandatory meal plan if you stay in the dorms, but if you're old enough/have high enough class standing you're allowed to stay in an apartment and then they can't make you eat in the cafeteria."
Junior,4,"My experience at Walla Walla Univeristy was great. The atmosphere and the environment was very welcoming. Professors are very helpful. They want you to succeed. There are free tutoring sessions for most of your classes, free of charge! Walla Walla Univeristy may be the right school for you!"
Senior,4,"I like the community atmosphere and the faculty at WWU.  I think it is a great place for an undergraduate education, and I am very grateful that I chose to come here."
Niche User,4,"I really  like it since, the campus and spiritual life is awesome, its pretty good with its food, and just everything."
Freshman,4,"The academics and staff in regards to academics and learning is fantastic i love the environment. Im pursuing a an aviation major and the classes and professors are amazing, They get to know you here at Walla Walla. You arent just another number or name to them. They help you seek out understanding and further knowledge when your confused and help push you to be better. The athletics side of the school is slightly less impressive. Due to a small budget and less care for sports it makes student athletes like myself struggle to stay in school. The expense is worth it but with less help from sports it becomes difficult to continue pursuing the many fantastic majors this school offers."
Junior,4,"This is a great school, especially if you are a 7th-Day Adventist. It is good for Nursing, Engineering, and Business majors."
Freshman,4,"Campus is great, the enviornment is perfect if you're Seventh Day Adventist. The town is quite small and quiet, there's not much to do. But the education recompensates this issue."
Junior,4,"Overall it has been a good experience.  The people are friendly. The dorm life is ok, there are just too many rules associated with it. The food is ok, rather meatless and sometimes tasteless, but the employees are very friendly. Most professors are great, some are too hardcore and seem as though they are expecting you to fail. The environment is usually good, although they force community on you and that can be time-consuming ."
Alum,4,Fairly small school so you get to know a lot of people closely. Rather conservative. You have to live in the dorm if you are a freshman/sophomore or under a certain age. With strict curfew.
Junior,4,Walla Walla University has an extension at Portland. The portland extension is so convenient because everything you need you can just buy in stores close by. Faculty and Staffs are great.
Junior,4,"Walla Walla University is a great school academically and socially. The classes we are required to take in are specific major well prepare us for are future careers. The classes challenge you academically, which is very beneficial. The relationships you build with professors will help you in the long run especially since most professors can help with internships and job opportunities. The students are extremely welcoming and polite. The atmosphere of the college may come off too protective, but I feel like I appreciated this the most. This college cares about the balance between school and personal life. In some classes even professors give pointers for incorporating a healthy life style like incorporating god and working out into your schedule. Overall this university has impacted my life positively in so many ways and I appreciate the time I have spent here and the time I have left here. The connection I have made with fellow students and professors I feel will last a lifetime."
Sophomore,4,"I love Walla Walla University. WWU quickly became my home because the people and the teachers all so nice, the campus is beautiful and I feel safe, there are so many study spots to choose from, and it was easy to keep focused on my studies bc I was not surrounded by negative influences. My favorite thing is That it's so easy to stay spiritual and maintain a relationship with God because there's so many spiritual activities. At Walla Walla University I am happy."
Junior,4,Walla Walla University is a great place to get a meaningful education with real life applications in a Christian environment. There are so many opportunities to get involved in various activities and the professor's make themselves available to answer questions and mentor students.
College Sophomore,4,Most of the professors want you to succeed and are more than willing to help. You just have to be willing to admit that you need help and ask. There are a wide variety of courses and you can really explore different areas of study  to get a nice diverse range of skills if you so choose.
College Sophomore,4,"Walla Walla University is known for its engineering and nursing programs along with others. The prospects of getting a job at the end of your student career is depends on how much effort you put into it.  Just like most things in life, you have to work hard for something if you want to succeed. The University offers many tools that you can use to reach out and secure a job when it it ready to enter the workforce."
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy dorm life. It gives you a chance to put yourself out there and get to know other students. There are advantages to living in a dorm full of girls including: borrowing clothes, forming study groups, and just overall companionship."
College Sophomore,4,"I was very nervous going in as a Freshman in college. Both students and professors were very welcoming and helpful. It is a place that encourages excellence and success. There are many different tools to help you succeed such as helpful professors, tutors, and students that are passionate about what they are learning."
College Freshman,4,Love it people are so welcoming and caring
College Senior,4,"The Campus Security staff work hard to make sure that our campus feels safe. While there have been several incidents on campus since I began attending in 2012, I would say that campus crime is low (except for bike theft) and the safety measures help students feel secure about our campus."
College Senior,4,"The career center on campus is very effecient and provides ample opportunities to students. Tips for networking and interview preparation are readily offered, and the process for finding internships was hassle free and very successful! The alumni network is strong, and alumni from all fields visit campus often to lecture on their experience in the field and provide networking opportunities. The resources available to students are remarkable!"
College Senior,4,"I have not lived in the campus housing, but spend much of my time with friends who do. The housing is a great deal for students, and the buildings are well maintained. The atmosphere is quiet and friendly, and the apartments are equipped with washing machines! The students like this feature a lot. 

I spent two years in the dorms, and while this was also a good option, I did not enjoy the thin walls and somewhat constant noise."
College Senior,4,I am not involved with sports at Walla Walla University primarily because I am involved in other activities. The facilities are very nice and renovations to older areas of the buildings happen on a regular basis. The fan support has increased over the last couple years.
College Senior,4,"My experience has been an incredibly rewarding one. Walla Walla University offers many opportunities to travel and experience other cultures. Through the encouragement of my professors and fellow classmates, I have been able to study abroad in Spain and volunteer on an island for 10 months. The extra curricular activities that are offered students are rewarding and educational, and I have very much enjoyed my time working as a student senator for the school body. The teachers are fabulous and genuinely care about the success of their students. I feel privileged to learn from them."
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's a small town, so it's not like the ""bad"" part of town is super far away, but we've not had an assault that I can recall. Once or twice I've gotten an email alert that we should be on the lookout for someone suspicious but I don't think we've had any real trouble."
Recent Alumnus,4,"If you're going into medicine or engineering especially, this is a great school. It's fairly well known even among non-Adventists and the chances of being accepted into a graduate school or of getting a job seem to be pretty high."
College Sophomore,4,It really all depends on your program and the classes you take.
College Freshman,4,"I haven't heard of a lot of crime, or anything like that happening here, so no complaints."
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of things that could improve the experience here, but overall it is pretty great."
College Freshman,4,"I like the variety of worship opportunities, the atmosphere, and the teachers."
College Freshman,4,The professors I have had are very knowledgeable and have great experience in their respective fields. You can tell that they genuinely desire the success of their students and that they are committed to delivering the best education possible.
College Freshman,4,Most everyone here is friendly! People are very helpful when you need to figure something out or just need help. There is a distinct Northwest culture to the school and while I appreciate that I would like to see more diversity. I have appreciated my teachers the most because even in general studies you can tell that they want you to retain and use the information they are passing along.
College Sophomore,4,"It is a great school with a heavy emphasis on the Seventh Day Adventist religion. The campus is very up to date, however it is an expensive private Christian school."
College Sophomore,4,"Good and varied athletics, intramurals are a big thing on campus."
College Sophomore,4,The health office is open to all students for all their needs.
College Sophomore,4,"No drug usage that I know of, the school is a safe environment."
College Junior,4,I feel very safe on campus
College Junior,4,Lots of internship opportunities for my major. Very strong alumni community.
College Junior,4,The class sizes are small. The teachers care about your education and most will stay with you for hours to help you with an assessment. Nice variety of classes and class styles.
College Junior,4,Very strict on campus. We need to earn a certain amount of worship credits per quarter but it's not too hard to achieve. The dorms are okay. They are a good size and we have sinks in our room. Everyone is friendly in my hall and respect quiet hours.
Recent Alumnus,4,"WWU is a fantastic place to grow, if you're into the culture. There are a lot of ways to get involved in student affairs, and a lot of ways to get help if you need it. The academic culture is friendly, helpful, and non-competitive. The courses provide depth, and the teachers are fair, and concerned about your learning."
College Sophomore,4,The atmosphere and the welcoming presence of the faculty and students are what really make the school shine.
College Junior,4,"There are many opportunities to work with professors and interact with other intelligent students on campus. The activities put on by the student council are pretty fun, and the academics are just challenging enough. Also, the students are usually friendly and easy to talk to."
College Freshman,4,The variety of off-campus dining is good.  Gets repetitive sometimes.
College Freshman,4,"Because I have a unique situation, it takes me longer than most people to go through the process, but I still got the financial scholarship that I needed."
College Freshman,4,"Dorming is great if you enjoy being with people.  Also, if you dorm, you are required to eat at the cafeteria."
College Sophomore,4,"It may be hard to get into, but once you're in, you're in! The apartments are well maintained, and for the price its a great deal."
College Sophomore,4,The computer labs around campus offer quick easy access to students.
College Sophomore,4,"The cafeteria is a bit small for the campus it caters to, but if you don't mind long lines... its great!"
College Sophomore,4,"Walla Walla University is a great place to pursue higher education. The faculty are great, the study body is as a whole very positive and the campus is always kept clean."
College Freshman,4,The SAC and DX are awesome
College Junior,2,"Not a lot of people attend the women's sports teams. However, the sports for the men are usually filled up. There is school spirit all over the campus. The sports teams are okay. I enjoy attending the games."
College Senior,2,There is not a lot of financial aid available. That's why I'm doing this survey.
College Senior,2,There is definitely not enough  parking for the amount of students on campus.
College Freshman,2,"There is a curfew at the dorm. If by night life you mean a trip to get food, then yes, there is a night life..."
College Junior,2,"I have a car.  There is no decent public transportation, but there doesn't have to be for the town itself."
College Freshman,2,People you are aquainted with most likely use drugs like cocaine and heroine and most everyone you know drinks alcohol to the point of getting drunk.
College Sophomore,2,"I go to a Christian University. There aren't many evening places for college kids to party. People sponsor parties at their house or apartment and everyone brings food. Hardly anyone goes to bars from my school. For upbeat fun, campus owns buildings where students and community members can listen to music, dance and praise God."
College Sophomore,2,People go there for a quality education.  WWU does not draw the best athletes but we still support them.
College Student,2,I got some financial aid but there weren't any scholarships available for my major.
College Freshman,2,"Walla Walla is not really a town for the Nightlife. There are a couple bars, but no clubs or anything else of the sort. The only public transportation available is the city bus system, which largely shuts down at five p.m."
College Senior,2,"I am not really sure what public transportation is around Walla Walla.  I see a lot of people who live on campus with bicycles, which i really like.  Although I drive a long ways and it would be nice for gas consideration in our financial aid packets."
College Sophomore,2,"Its Cafe Food – Its almost never great, but at least edible in most cases.  When you are cooking for that many people you can't do a whole lot.  There are always healthy options and many choices each meal, so that is a plus."
College Sophomore,2,The Town is very small and there isn't much variety.
College Senior,2,"The food is okay but after a quarter or two of eating it, you are sick of everything they make."
College Senior,2,Fairly Safe – The campus is in an area with low crime but does not have much security.
College Sophomore,2,"Walla Walla is surrounded by little farms. There isn't that much to do in Walla Walla. Our school is like the center of the entire town. There aren't that many places to shop or go around and hang out, which is sort of disappointing. The weather during Fall, Spring, and Summer is nice because there is a perfect amount of rain and sunshine. During the winter, the snow is very icy because it isn't cold enough so the snow melts and becomes ice. There aren't a lot of activities to do nor is there any diversity in Walla Walla. But, despite all the negativeness, Walla Walla is a very safe town because the Adventist religion is the center of everything there."
College Sophomore,2,"Foreman and Conard Residence Hall – The girls' dorms in Walla Walla University are noisy, they don't have hot water, and all the girls are really noisy."
College Sophomore,2,"Rains All the Time – It rains a lot here in Walla Walla, and it's usually really cold, like in the 30 or 40. It doesn't start warming up until spring/summer, and even then, it still rains sometimes. It also knows a lot, for like all of winter and some of spring quarter."
College Senior,2,I Shouldn't Have Come Here – The school is decent for health stuff but not that great. Its one of the worst Adventist schools in terms of getting into Loma Linda and stuff. the teachers just aren't helpful. or smart.
College Sophomore,2,"Sub Par Social Life – A social Life between undergrad guys and girls is hard to have. The rules are very strict when it comes to curfew, dorm visits and parties. But if you are really into the whole church scene its a great place for that."
Niche User,1,"This school is awful from top to bottom.  The kangaroo court Student Conduct Board can accuse you of violating school policy and kick you out of school based on unverified and unprovable testimony of one person.  Our school's entire basketball team was recently suspended for breaking school rules prior to the school year even starting.  The rules are incredibly authoritarian, and the administration has no problem kicking out students who fail to stop other people from violating school rules (as if its the student's job to enforce the school's rules).

The priorities of the school don't favor the students, they only are concerned with making sure the religiously conservative alumni continue to give the school money, which only happens if the school keeps strict rules over the students. Do yourself a favor and stay far, far away from this school."
Junior,1,"The academics are very good and the professors genuinely care about you, but everything else sucks. The food is beyond terrible (they simply heat frozen and canned food and serve to the students) and the dorm deans and RAs are obsessed with keeping track of every single part of your life (such as how many times you have been to church, whether you are being a good Christian, what are you eating, who are you talking to, curfew, etc). The administration also does not care about social activities at all. Being an Adventist school there is no Greek life and no normal parties, but the school also does not sponsor any activities in which you can get to know more people. There aren't many restaurants in town or anything to do, so you're looking at driving to Spokane or Seattle for anything fun.  If you are a white Christian person who likes the countryside, look no further, this is the place for you. If you are literally anyone else, please do yourself a favor and stay away."
Senior,1,"The school gets one star for its decent academic programs, and that’s it. Just about everything else sucks. The school does its best to police every part of student life by forcing everyone but seniors to live in the dorm, and subjecting students to apartment searches and other invasions of privacy at the administration’s whim. They take it upon themselves to treat adult students like children and enforce curfew and other  ridiculous attendance requirements. If you’re looking for a school with good teachers and good people, look no further, but beware of the over zealous people at the top who will screw you over if you dare try to think for yourself or make adult decisions."
Senior,1,"They can come into your apartment without any kind of notice and take anything that is not allowed according to the ""policy."" A friend of mine had some expensive alcohol that was a gift from his parents and they dumped it down the toilet and then said they could deny him his degree because of it even though he only had to finish his senior project and then he was done. So up until the last minute they are able to scree you over and 0% care. Mind you, this is not the teachers but the administration. If you don't show up for everything you are supposed to they can tell you to take a quarter off. If they think you're drinking they make you take an observed urine test and if you can't because you don't have the time due to classes they just tell you that they will consider it a positive test. Caf is $250 cheaper w/o meal plan. Basically, the school is supposed to be a Christian school but if this is what it means to be Christ-like, I want nothing to do with it. Enroll at your own risk."
College Sophomore,1,"As stated before, there are little to no parties..major ones at least. If you know people you can find some."
College Sophomore,1,"There are the occasional house parties off campus, but as a whole there are none other than the ones the school puts on."
College Freshman,1,There are no fraternities on campus.
College Freshman,1,"There aren't school sponsored ""parties"" in the popular sense of the word."
College Freshman,1,This is an SDA Institution so there is no Greek life.
College Senior,1,"We are an Adventist school. We don't do the whole Greek non Greek thing, nor do we have fraternities. "
College Sophomore,1,"Being the tiny town it is, College Place doesn't have many restaurant options. What they do have is very good, though. We have great Hispanic and Thai food options in town, as well as the typical fast food. Though a large percentage of the student population is vegetarian, there aren't many veggie options in town. Hardly anything is open late, either. For a simple restaurant that will treat you like family, here's the place."
College Sophomore,1,"Nightlife in Walla Walla is very limited. There are very, very few places to go. No one ever hears about nightlife."
College Senior,1,"Few Good Teachers – The faculty are always fighting the academic dean. Meanwhile, students are forgotten and shafted."
College Senior,1,Weak Program – The professors in the social work program at WWU are focussed on the graduate students so undergrads get ignored.
College Sophomore,1,"There really isn't a night life in Walla Walla, some students usually go to Tri Cities where there is a mall and a lot more to do.

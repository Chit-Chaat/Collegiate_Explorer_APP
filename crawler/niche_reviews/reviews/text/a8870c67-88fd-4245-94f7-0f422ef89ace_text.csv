Senior,5,It's a great college to become an adult at! The town is small and safe so it's not overwhelming. The class sizes are often small and the professors care about you and want you to succeed. I had a professor who offered me tea every time I went to office hours.
Junior,5,It is a small town school that is perfect for everyone. With smaller classes you really get to know your fellow students and professors. (which if you are looking into going to grad school will help you with great recommendations that are actually meaningful). Additionally since it is part of the UofM system there is that much more internships and travel opportunities other colleges can't offer. Though its a small town there is always something to do and some sort of even to go too.
Alum,5,"My experience at UM Morris was excellent; from the small class size, to the small town setting, to UMM Homecoming- it was an excellent place to go to college. I return every year for homecoming since 2005, with my college buddy Joey."
Freshman,5,It’s a really really good school and it has a beautiful campus and really hands-on teachers who care about making sure you succeed in life and in school
Alum,5,"The faculty and staff truly care for students, and all so many opportunities are given to undergraduate students that would go to grad students at a larger institution."
Freshman,5,This college gives free tuition for Native American students. Being a Native American it has really helped me with getting a great education. Minnesota-Morris also gets everybody involved with different activities and things to do around campus.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Morris has been welcoming as a first year by the welcoming ness of the staff, professors and other students. I was so nervous coming here and I couldn’t believe how welcome I felt when I got here and started making friends. I love the small campus vibe"
Sophomore,5,"Loved the small town atmosphere, and all of the professors were very helpful. They were also extremely flexible with athletes' schedules which was helpful. Other students are all very accepting of others, and on campus activities occur often and are very well put together."
Senior,5,"It is a very open, fun loving atmosphere. The dynamic between teachers and students is not like many other colleges. It has the opportunities of a small private college with all of the benefits of a large public university."
College Junior,5,"Due to its small size, it is easy to get help from professors at any time. Every professor has office hours which you can go in to get help. You can address professors by their first name and they are very helpful at all times."
College Junior,5,"It is one of the most safe cities and campuses that I have seen. There are really no concerns with safety, however, measures are in place in case there is a problem."
College Junior,5,Campus has police that work 24/7 on campus and there are emergency phones around campus for students to use if they need them. I've never felt unsafe walking through campus at night. It's a small town and mostly everybody knows everybody. It's well lit and buildings are very close together so it's never a long walk in the dark if you need to do it. Police will provide an escort for you if you feel you need one and they have a cell phone that you can call after hours if you need them for something that is non-emergency. Doors to all of the residence halls lock and only the students that live in those buildings have access with their keys and U-cards.
College Sophomore,5,"There are frequent emails about potential jobs or internships one can obtain based on a specified major. Many alumni have opened the doors for better networking for current students to have available to them. Job fairs and other employment opportunities are planned throughout the year. The career center has few people in there when I have walked by. I wish there was better communication for these types of things, but if a student cares, the opportunities are there if one wishes to seek them out."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors I have had are engaged in the subject matter. Class sizes range from small to large, but questions and discussion are commonplace no matter how large a class is. There is a nice variety of classes to choose from to meet requirements and allow diversity in your schedule."
College Sophomore,5,"I got a single dorm assigned to me as a freshman, I love it."
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe off and on campus
College Freshman,5,We don't have greek life
College Junior,5,"Drugs and alcohol is something that students can participate in if they'd like, but they certainly don't have to. If they're feeling pressure, then they just haven't found the right group of friends yet. People can have wonderful Morris experiences without drugs and/or alcohol."
College Junior,5,"Morris is one of the safest schools and safest towns I've ever lived in. I've walked home drunk and alone at 2 in the morning (hindsight, bad decision), but I never questioned my safety. Off campus, although dark, is very safe; nobody really fears for their safety off campus. And on campus is always very bright and safe. I cannot stress enough how safe this area and this campus is."
College Junior,5,"I love the campus, the academics, the community, and everything else. The only thing is it's super cold in Morris, but that's not Morris' fault..."
College Sophomore,5,There are so many great classes that are offered!
College Freshman,5,I feel that I have the opportunities to get involved in research and internships.
College Sophomore,5,There is rarely trouble on campus. I feel extremely safe here.
College Junior,5,"My experience at UMM has made me a better person in every way, it has challenged me intellectual, and it has given me wonderful friends."
College Freshman,5,Morris is an amazing school. The small student body provides for a good community. The academics are great and I feel like I have learned a lot.
College Freshman,5,I am unsure about my major right now. I am thinking of changing. So far the workload and curriculum have been very doable. Internships are required for some majors and are readily available.
College Freshman,5,The classes are interesting. Professors care. The work is the right amount. It's all good.
College Freshman,5,No problems getting into my major. Just declare it and you are good to go.
College Freshman,5,"Ethnically people are typically white, American Indian, or Chinese. There is a growing Latino population within Morris. Most people who come to Morris are from Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, etc. A majority of people at Morris are from the twin cities. There is a LGBT* presence on campus. Politically, Morris is quite liberal. There is little representation from republicans or conservatives."
College Freshman,5,I LOVE MORRIS. It is the perfect school for me. The small size and tight knit community is just what I wanted. The professors know you by name and are always willing to help you work towards your goals. The people at Morris are all unique in their own ways. Everyone is different and has something to offer to the group. The price to come to Morris can't be beat. The school is comparable to private schools in MN. College is what you make it. Morris supplies you with opportunities to make college a success!
College Freshman,5,"Living in the dorms is great. Freshman dorms are Indy hall, Gay hall, and Pine hall. Sometimes Blakely hall has freshmen. Spooner is upperclassmen. Green Prairie has a freshman floor and then the rest is upperclassmen. The on campus apartments are for upperclassmen only. Green Prairie is probably the best option on campus as it is the newest dorms. Gay and Indy each hold around 250 freshmen so they are the largest dorms on campus. People who stay in Pine hall are generally artsy and are close to the arts building."
College Freshman,5,The strictness on campus varies. In general it is not very strict if you are being smart. The dorms have quiet hours and no drugs/alcohol policies. Drugs and alcohol in the dorms does happen though. There are CAs(community advisors) that do rounds every night to make sure nothing is going on that breaks the rules.
College Freshman,5,The majors at Morris are all top notch. Biology is the largest major here. The other departments may be small but that just means you get better personal attention. Internships are required for some majors and professors have the means to help you find internships.
College Freshman,5,I have never felt unsafe at Morris. Walking around at night is no problem.
College Freshman,5,The professors are all very nice and helpful. The curriculum is always challenging but doable. The registration process is as streamlined as possible. The workload is manageable and there are a million nice places to study.
College Freshman,5,My major is environmental studies. There are plenty of internship opportunities and the workload is more than manageable.
College Freshman,5,Everything you need is here on campus. It's beautiful and very eco-friendly.
College Freshman,5,"The Environmental Studies program is amazing. I enjoy it very much and the advisors are extremely helpful. There are hundreds of internships to choose from, and since they are required, your advisor will help you find and complete one."
College Freshman,5,"All I had to do was sign up. It was a very easy process and changing majors is just as easy. As for admissions, have good grades and test scores. Also, it doesn't hurt to have been a part of something environmental in high school."
College Freshman,5,I think everyone feels very safe here and anti-violence is a big thing.
College Freshman,5,I live in Pine. Besides the bells in the graveyard that go off every 15 minutes it's a fantastic place to live for science and art majors.
College Freshman,5,As long as you're not doing anything terribly wrong and obvious you're fine.
College Sophomore,5,I really enjoy my campus life.
College Sophomore,5,It's considered one of the top 100 small colleges in the US. The provides a liberal arts education in a public university setting.
College Junior,5,Not difficult to change majors at all.
College Senior,5,"I love it at UMM, and if I could do it over, I would. This school is either a complete hit or a miss with students. If you're looking for parties and a very happening social life, this is not the place for you. Morris is a tiny town, and students do pretty well in classes. You do have a social life, but its nothing like what you would find in a big city. The classes are pretty good - some really great professors who can make you love learning, and some bad ones. Student body is very involved in clubs etc, and its a great way to meet new people and develop new interests and experiences.

Because classes are small, you get to know teachers quite well, and its not uncommon to have meals etc with your teacher. Morris is a great school for someone who is okay with sacrificing city life for a few years. I like the school enough to be a campus ambassador and convince other people this is a good school. Enough said."
College Freshman,5,Johnson Independence Hall is the best freshman dorm. There is more room.  My best friends have been people who lived on my floor. Right next to the dining hall and class buildings.
College Freshman,5,Morris is one of the best liberal arts college in the state.  The academics are better than most public and private schools. Workload is not too overwhelming.  Professors are very nice!
College Student,5,"Out of all of the schools that I apply to, Morris is the best."
College Freshman,5,"The music program is amazing. Not extremely competitive, but enough that you can still feel challenged."
College Freshman,5,"There are plenty of labs if you don't have your own computer! Our tech support is great and always helpful! WIfi is never a problem. If one connection is slow, move to one of the other 3."
College Freshman,5,"We have a great observatory, green house, pool deck, our music area is top notch. Every practice room is equipped with a grand piano."
College Freshman,5,Everything is kept in top notch shape. We have some of the best facilities a college can offer!
College Student,5,"The process of getting financial aid is pretty simple and stream line, now if only it was all automatically done."
College Student,5,"I love the lay out of the buildings, how they seem to flow into each other. The Gyms are free! My Favorite 4 letter word"
College Student,5,"Plenty of parking. If you park in the parking lot, good luck trying to find a spot close to the buildings"
College Junior,5,The school prides itself on interdisciplinary study. It is not unheard of to be pursuing double or even triple majors. Courses are rigorous and enjoyable.
College Junior,5,"Parking is reasonable and available. Parking overnight is the only time that a parking ticket is needed, and the rates to keep a car are very reasonable."
College Junior,5,"Perhaps there are not a whole lot of choices, but those that are there boast increadibly good food."
College Freshman,5,The scholarships they offer make the school extremely affordable.
Junior,4,Morris has a very nice campus which is small and quiet. It's the perfect place to immerse yourself in your studies and be free of distraction. The community is also very welcoming and helpful.
Senior,4,Most classes are done over zoom but there are some issues that make learning difficult. The professors are doing their best and are available to help almost all the time
Junior,4,My professors were really able to adapt to online learning in a way that you felt like you were still in a classroom with other students and could ask questions easily. School work was given in a way that you could learn and succeed whatever your circumstances.
Sophomore,4,"I love the UMN Morris! Not only is it a very accepting and diverse community, but that there is something for everyone! The campus-community is absolutely amazing and welcoming. With the transition to online classes, Morris has been very thoughtful of its students with trying to keep a smooth transition as well as the professors working better with students under whatever circumstances."
Sophomore,4,I love how close-knit the community is and the easy navigability of the campus. I love being a part of an institution that is laying a huge role in sustainability and seeks to improve green energy.
Freshman,4,"Student Activities and events at Morris provide an incredible opportunity for students to get engaged with their peers and life on campus beyond the classroom. The staff, instructors and my fellow students are all amazing."
Freshman,4,"Smaller sized campus.  Friendly staff and students.  Focuses on being real rather than trying to define the status queue.  Located an a small, quaint town, about an hour from regular civilization and Walmart."
Sophomore,4,I love that the class numbers are small so there is more interaction between student and professors. This makes for a better learning experience.
Sophomore,4,"Small classes and easy access to teachers and help is a huge benefit.   As a new student, it feels like the teachers and staff really want to see the students reach their full potential and succeed.  Teachers seem to make an effort to really know the students by their first name and offer help when needed.  The university seems more like a family atmosphere than a college campus.  The student body though small, does offer diversity and the on campus clubs reflect this. These clubs are very inclusive and welcome all. For a small campus is laid out for easy movement between classes."
Junior,4,"I love the curriculum at this school. It provides a great class environment for learning, however it bothers me how they claim to be diverse, but they really aren't."
Freshman,4,"It's a great school in Minnesota. All the the staff  love it here or at least pretend to. The people are great, the town's great, and I have a lot of fun. Great price too."
Junior,4,"UMM has a lot of good things going for it, and is striving to be better and more diverse, which will make it a great place to study.  I have loved all of my professors, and have made connections with them, and UMM has given me many opportunities.  However, UMM could do better when it comes to taking action, as I have heard that some people do not feel 100% comfortable."
Sophomore,4,I love this school a lot. the profs are all very accomplished in their fields so I feel the education received is quality. It's a small school so you will need to make your own fun sometimes but it's easy when you make friends off and on campus.
Junior,4,"This university provides a high quality education at an approachable price point.  Morris is unique in many ways, but most importantly in size.  Small class sizes allow students to form relationships with faculty which can lead to research and creative opportunities that undergraduates would never have access to on larger campuses."
Freshman,4,"University of Minnesota, Morris has a good academic program for the price that you are paying for. The professors are good and understanding. The campus is small so you generally don't have to worry about getting to class on time. I wish there were more scholorships"
Sophomore,4,"Fantastic school for academics, But there is very little to do off campus on weekends, especially if you don't like to party. Campus is extremely liberal, typical of a small liberal arts school.

The dining hall is very bad and very expensive, although the people who work there are delightful and try their best.

It is far cheaper to live off campus than to pay the ridiculous rates for room and board in the dorms."
Senior,4,It's been pretty good. There are a  lot of things to do on campus even though it's a really small town. The professors are great and the people are very nice and welcoming. 
College Junior,4,Professors or your major make sure to set you up with great opportunities so that you can be successful upon graduating.
College Junior,4,"Campus housing is a great opportunity to become close with other people. It is cheaper, after your first year, to live off campus."
College Junior,4,"While it is a small school, the environment is perfect for learning. It has a very calm atmosphere and most professors are very easy to talk to. The classes are challenging but there is always help available when needed."
College Junior,4,"Networking is really easy on campus because you meet so many people and know almost everyone you graduate with. The career services does a really good job at giving announcements about internship and job opportunities and gives you access to the job fair at the Twin Cities campus during spring semester. They hold cover letter and resume writing workshops to help learn how to do that better. Getting on campus jobs is very easy. In fact, it's so easy that most people I know have more than one job or internship."
College Junior,4,"Class sizes are small which makes it easy to get a lot of one on one attention from the professor if you need it. They're really good about having plenty of office hours and they're willing to work with your schedule for appointments when necessary. The professors go above and beyond for their students' success and they really want to see you achieve your goals. The only thing I don't like is that a lot of the classes are small and discussion based so as someone who hates discussion, it's really hard to hide in the numbers with such small classes."
College Junior,4,"The dorms are a really great way to get to know and meet classmates, especially freshman year. They aren't remodeled or modern rooms, but they give students enough space to live and store their items. The office of residential life is pretty good about getting students a single room if they need it for medical or mental health reasons, but it's a little harder to get a single room just because you want one. They encourage you to have a roommate to meet people right away. In my opinion Indy Hall is the best for freshmen because the hallways are wider and they're straight. It's not confusing to navigate like Gay Hall can be. Gay Hall is very similar to Indy but the floor sizes are bigger and it can be confusing at first. Everyone who has lived there has loved it and learns navigation very quickly. There aren't many amenities but there are things like ping pong, TVs, foosball, and air hockey to use for free. There's laundry in every building and it doesn't cost quarters. The social atmosphere is great because there are lounges and kitchens on every floor where you can meet and hang out with your floormates and others when you're not in class."
College Junior,4,"Morris is a good school for a lot of students. There are a lot of activities offered and clubs and since it's part of the U of MN system, there are a lot of resources to draw from for research, academics, or study abroad. The class sizes are small and it's a small community feel and for the most part everybody knows everybody. It is a small town and you have to be able to make your own fun to enjoy your time at Morris. Athletic teams are not top of the line, but they're fun and free to watch and there are a lot of intramural sports offered for students to make their own teams. Students are often overly involved in clubs and activities outside of class making it a very active campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus Police are available to assist students and make them feel safe. People who have targeted vulnerable students are usually found and held accountable for their crime. People help to prevent these things from happening by walking with friends, or attending a party with other friends to make sure everyone has fun and is okay."
College Sophomore,4,"What I enjoy about Morris is its small size. Walking to class is fast, so being late is rare even with tight schedules. The dorms aren't ideal, and in my opinion, the meal plan isn't worth the money. I will be moving off campus for this next school year, and I know I will enjoy it more than being on campus all the time. Perks of a small town though, it will be easy to walk and bike to class. I enjoy the campus, especially playing pool to pass the time between classes."
College Junior,4,Professors are genuinely attached to their students and are excited about the subject matter they teach.
College Junior,4,"Morris feels like a very safe place. Campus Police is accessible and easy to talk to,."
College Junior,4,"Living on campus is extremely convenient, you can walk across campus in five minutes. The dorms are average college dorms. Pine Hall, Gay Hall, and Independence Hall are the typical first-year dorms and they are typical residence hall living. Green Prairie houses both first-years and upperclassmen and it is a newer building with nicer accommodations. Spooner and Blakely are the upperclassmen halls with typical accommodations. The on-campus apartments are a nice option for students who want to be more independent while still living on campus. The Morris website has good information about all of the living arrangements. The social atmosphere depends on the building in every case, also on the year. Spooner typically has a studious environment, Independence Hall tends to be a fun first-year hall, Pine tends to be very close as a building, apartment residents typically keep to themselves. The housing process is fairly easy."
College Junior,4,"Morris is a gem on the Minnesota Prairie. It is filled with unique people who are passionate about their studies and are driven to succeed in life after college. Morris is not a large town, but students can find multitudes of things to do, if they know where to look. Some of my favorite experiences have been: going to a midnight showing at out local co-op theater from the 50's, going to the farmer's market where there is live music, and checking out local art at the PRCA. If I could do it all over again, I would pick Morris again in a heartbeat."
College Sophomore,4,"Great professors and class options, i feel challenged"
College Sophomore,4,"Im having a pretty good time here, im considering transfering only because i dont like living in a small town"
College Sophomore,4,This is a very respected school so a degree from here gives you lots of options
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't had any problems, but im like the only hood bitch on campus so"
College Junior,4,"Don't worry about safety. It is just middle of nowhere, so there is no one to harm you."
College Junior,4,Well everyone knows UMM is one of the best liberal art schools.
College Junior,4,Well Indy and Gay hall are two best dorms in my opinion. But I prefer apartment. Since campus is not that big proximity to classes is not a big problem.
College Junior,4,"Campus might look so small but has wonderful buildings and environment.

Professors are awesome. 

The only problem I feel is it is just middle of nowhere. Too far from the cities. But that is all."
College Freshman,4,"The professors are amazing, the school doesn't really help with internships. I am a psych and french major and it was basically just one teacher from each that would send out internship emails all the time although all of them are not really for freshman theyre more aimed to seniors. I have always gone to my professors directly for career questions because the services we do have are less than adequate."
College Freshman,4,I feel safe walking around campus. At night I am just scared because of my own insecurities- nothing to deal with the school
College Freshman,4,I love all of the Alumni events because we get to understand what we can do with different majors.
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy most of my professors. One I had wasn't very helpful in any way.
College Freshman,4,I really like it here even though I had some roommate problems
College Freshman,4,"Morris is not all about their sports but it is important. The school supports its sports and the community is very involved in them. The faculties to exercise are easy to access and enjoyable. The fans are supportive, the school spreads the word and everyone enjoys the sport. The dance program is huge and many people enjoy a sport along with the dance program."
College Freshman,4,"Morris is exceptional for being open and flexible to students of all sorts. They put the students first and it does not matter gender or race. Morris is looking for students who take their education seriously and that was to be apart of the community. Which is why it is somewhat difficult to get into but it is is worth. There are so many activities to be involved in that there is little time in the day for them all. The dances and activities Morris puts on is not for students but also to bring the college and community together. Plus, the history of Morris is important for students to diversify themselves and their experience for their career."
College Freshman,4,"Love morris, sad i am transferring to twin cities, but they have too small of a political science department"
College Freshman,4,"It is a challenging school, but very accepting, and lots of diversity"
College Freshman,4,"I haven't really gotten into the athletics at my school, but it seems to be a big part of the school life. There is a free gym with lots of facilities and equipment to use. There are also lots of sports teams with lots of support from fans and students"
College Junior,4,Depends on what you majored in and how hard you're working to find a job!
College Junior,4,"The academics at Morris are very good. Professors are dedicated. The curriculum is for the most part clear if you talk to the right people. Registration is stressful, but all of the online stuff is easy. The workload is manageable. Lots of study groups and areas dedicated for study."
College Junior,4,"The campus is overall very accepting of people with diverse backgrounds. However, there's not much diversity in terms of ethnic/racial diversity. We have a large percentage of international students, but besides them, our percentage of ethnically diverse people is a little low. However, we have lots of people with different political beliefs, religion, sexual orientation, and economic backgrounds."
College Junior,4,"The housing is really great. It's a little bit expensive, but to those continue to use it for multiple years, it's worth it. The most important thing about it for me is the proximity to classes and to more social parts of campus."
College Sophomore,4,I always see the campus police walking around and on call. They have phones placed all around campus in case of emergencies and many of the RA's and CA's give out their numbers as well in case of an emergency. Overall the health and Safety at Morris is very good!
College Sophomore,4,The courses and professors at Morris are great! I love the class sizes - they aren't too big and overwhelming. The professors give one on one time with all of their students. Which is really great!
College Sophomore,4,Athletics are great! However the facilities need an up to date.
College Freshman,4,Living on campus is great. The dorm that I live in is the smallest one on campus and a little further away from the classes that I need to get to but it is the perfect one for me. All of the people in my dorm are fantastic and everyone gets along. Most of the students are freshmen or transfer students and that helps a lot because most people are facing the same challenges and can help each other get through it.
College Freshman,4,I attended a few varsity sports games this fall and enjoyed them. The fans who showed up to the game were great in supporting the team and providing a fun atmosphere. Intramural sports is a big thing on campus with over half of the students participating in them. I took part in doubles badminton this fall and was thrilled with how it was run and how things went. This spring I will also be playing for the varsity baseball tem and look forward to the opportunities and challenges it brings.
College Freshman,4,So far school has been great. All of the guys on my floor in the dorm I live in get along great and that has helped make the switch from high school to college much easier I believe. My favorite experience up to this point has probably been a game on campus called humans vs zombies which came during the week of Halloween.  I believe that the Minnesota Morris gets it uniqueness comes from the people that attend the school. Everyone at the school brings a different personality and style to the school but everyone is nice at the same time even if peoples ideas and values differ. If I could do it all over again I would choose Minnesota Morris again because every student and professor brings their own personality to the school and it provides a truly unique education.
College Freshman,4,Students are very accepting of others that are not the exact same as they are
College Freshman,4,"UMM was not my first choice and when I first visited I could not see myself going here. The school continued to reach out to me and I went back to visit 5 more times and met with some professors and realized UMM could be the right fit for me. The town may be small but don't let that scare you away, the students find ways to make their own fun. I am very happy I picked UMM and if I could do it over I would do the same."
Junior,2,"Completed two years at Morris and now I'm transferring. It's bad enough that there is nothing to do, but the student body is essentially a hive mind. In Morris, if you don't go with the status quo, you are ostracized from the community."
Freshman,2,"The University of Minnesota- Morris is a good school but it is very small. Classes are good, but you dont get to meet many new people."
College Sophomore,2,"I was told I would have a single room with no other roommate, but when I arrived on move-in day, someone was already living in my room. The room was a single, with two beds shoved in it. We got ants because of poor sanitary practices by our fellow floor mates. People disrespected the janitor by leaving large messes for him to clean up, failing to take care of their own messes. The floor above ours flooded because someone threw a ball and it hit the sprinkler. People don't know how to cook food, also sending people outside at odd hours of the night."
College Freshman,2,"I tried to reach out to as many people as I could but it was very difficult to find others that were open minded. Many people were very clicky and it was hard to make friends for me no matter how hard I tried. The girls here that I've come in contact with I do not connect with really on any level. I truly love all of the professors and that is the only reason I decided to continue an education here but I am transferring in the spring because I feel as much as I love the professors and small classes being miserable and having no friends here is not worth it. The professors here are wonderful, they're all very easy going and understanding. I have never had a lot of homework in any of my classes, at most I would have 2 hours a week. There is basically no party scene and the parties their are are extremely lame and gross. The disability office is terrible and there is basically no accommodations for anyone with physical disabilities."
College Freshman,2,Our teams are bad so it's not exciting at all
College Freshman,2,I only stayed because I loved my professors.
College Sophomore,2,The parties are dingy and disgusting.  You are much better off just getting a few beers and chilling with your friends.  However the Monument can throw a decent one every once in a while.
College Freshman,2,The dining hall food is one of the only things I dislike about Morris. The food is hardly ever healthy. There is a very limited amount of vegan foods. The staffs knowledge of vegan food is very limited. There are no labels that tell the ingredients of the food. Sometimes separate foods intermix. The staff also cross contaminates a lot of foods by not changing gloves when they go back and forth between food. The staff in General is not knowledgable about the food that they are serving. The dining service does attempt to work with you to satisfy dietary needs or requests. The dining hall in general needs a lot of work. The stir fry is really good though!
College Freshman,2,Morris is a small town. There are maybe ten restaurants in town. None of them have healthy choices. If you are going to college for the off-campus restaurants Morris might not be the best place for you.
College Freshman,2,We need more vegan food. I'm sick of pizza and subway. Can we get a Chipotle please!
College Freshman,2,There aren't many parties going on and it's hard to find them. Unless you know the right people.
College Senior,2,The Greek Life here at Morris is basically non-existent. There are a couple organizations but they are mostly academic based and they are pretty small.
College Student,2,"Some places are pretty small, but it is a nice little town so they are safe places."
College Freshman,2,"The weather can get pretty crazy out on the prairie of the University of Minnesota, Morris. I In Late summer it's still warm and sunny and lots of people will be outside. When fall starts to hit it varies a lot. Some days it might seem like summer, and others there may be frost on the ground. Once it starts snowing they do a good job of plowing all of the sidewalks so it's still easy to walk around and get to class. When it snows a lot, it's actually a very beautiful campus. It can get very cold out, but if you bring the right clothes, it's not so bad. Overall, it's always windy out which can make it seem cooler than it actually is, but you get used to it."
College Sophomore,2,"Nothing to Do – My school is on the prairie in a boring setting and there's never anything to do. You have to make your own fun, which is hard in the cold winter weather in Minnesota."
College Sophomore,2,"My financial aid office is really accommodating with helping me when I'm having trouble getting money for tuition. The business office also helps so that I don't have to pay late fees and it won't ruin my credit. I wish, however, they'd give more scholarships and opportunities to get grants, loans and scholarships."
College Junior,2,Just Hanging There – Nightlife is not the biggest thing on campus. There are a couple of house parties here and there during the weekends but its not what i'll call exceptional
College Freshman,2,"Wind, Snow, and Beautiful Days – Because the school is located on the prairie, it is a rare day when the wind is calm. Some days it almost knocks you over when you leave the dorm. There is a ton of snow during the winter, which affects transportation and getting to class. But on the days when the weather is beautiful, you don't even want to go to class."
College Freshman,2,"Few Options, None Open Late – There are very few restaurants that are in Morris, MN.  Unfortunately only one restaurant is open until 2 a.m. and that is Jose's Burritos.  If more restaurants were open late, they would make a lot of money because college students are looking for a place to hang out at late at night"
Junior,1,The transition to online learning was a joke. Most people skipped classes and for the most part learned nothing.
Niche User,1,"The school is absolutely awful.  I went into this school an ambitious, happy individual in the fall of 2015, and I left after my first semester.  About 4 years later I am still trying to fix the damage this school left on me, now clinically diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and PTSD from my experiences there.  
Teachers and students continuously told me my beliefs would be the downfall of mankind (I'm a conservative).  Teachers reprimanded  me for asking questions and preached in class about their atheistic beliefs. The school was supposed to be accepting and supportive to all individuals, and this is far from the truth.  I was targeted and hated. The school system was terrible; I could never get a straightforward answer on basic questions without them sending me back and forth between offices until I mentioned needing to bring the Dean into these unresolved issues.  An overview: a leftist, biased, hateful school."
Freshman,1,It was absolutely horrible. I was given false hopes of how great it was going to be and did not meet any of my expectations. I will not be returning for spring semester. Small racist white town.
College Freshman,1,We do not have a greek life
College Sophomore,1,There are no Frats or Sororities on Campus.  Makes for a pretty tame party atmosphere.
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid at this school is a complete joke.  Scholarships are not given to students who work hard and earn it.  Rather all of the money is given to the ""underprivileged students"" who have done nothing to earn it and often piss away their grades at parties and other non-constructive activities.  Even 4.0 students with national merit SAT scores who don't qualify for financial aid can not get scholarships to help them pay for their college education because the school had no provisions for students who actually seek to set themselves apart from the crowd with intellectual rigor and hard work."
College Sophomore,1,"There is absolutely nowhere to eat in Morris other than Pizza Ranch, DQ and one small town diner."
College Student,1,Dining hall is not the best.
College Freshman,1,"Drugs are barely found on campus. If you want them, you can get them, but you have to go off-campus/have connections. I have no interest though, so don't take my word for it."
College Junior,1,"the only reason it is bad is because we have no greek life on campus
 "
College Student,1,I have not seen nor heard of drug use at this school.
College Junior,1,"There is essentially nothing to do in town, besides the bars, sports events, and a community run movie theater. There are no attractions, no real shopping opportunities, no culture in this town."
College Sophomore,1,"Morris Has No Where to Eat – The title pretty much says it all. There's no where to eat unless you travel about an hour to Alexandria and even then, you're better off driving the 1.5 hours to St. Cloud since there's more variety."
College Sophomore,1,"They enforce visitor parking way too strictly. I had a parking pass when I visited before I went there, and still got a ticket."
College Freshman,1,Not Sure of Drugs – There is no drug use that I know of but people do drink but not excessively either so............
College Sophomore,1,There is nothing to do after 10pm. How ever we students make up for it by being very social. People are usually game for movie nights and study nights but as far as a club scene: We don't have one.
College Freshman,1,"ITS a BORING SMALL TOWN – Do you think the wind turbine is fun?  Do you think that Pamida rocks?  Do you like having the option between five crappy fast food places that all close at 9-10 every night?  Would you like to shop in the captivating Morris Mall that only has three crusty stores open?  Oh, but if you want to have some REAL fun you can drive 45 minutes to the EXCITING Alexandria!  ALEXANDRIA KIND OF SUCKS SORRY.  I'm a woman from the suburbs and I recently learned that I will never live in a small town ever again."

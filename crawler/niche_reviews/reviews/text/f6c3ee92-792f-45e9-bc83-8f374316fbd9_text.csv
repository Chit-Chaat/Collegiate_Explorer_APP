Freshman,5,I have been here for one semester now and I have enjoyed every bit of it! The professors try to work with you to help get your grade up!
Freshman,5,"I like how small the campus is. The teachers actually care about me and my grades. They are available anytime through email, and even come in on their days off for additional help. Every teacher is knowledgeable and can relate their skills practically."
Freshman,5,"Baptist Bible College is a tight-knit community with incredible professors and staff.  Itâ€™s a warm, family environment where there is a desire and drive to see students succeed and reach their goals."
Junior,5,Baptist Bible College allowed me to further my learning experience. That is only the half of it the staff and fellow peers allowed me to become a better human.
Sophomore,5,BBC has changed my life! I now have a growing and burning passion for Christ and His call in my life. I look forward to working in full time ministry !
College Freshman,5,There is 24/7 security that is provided on the campus. There are cameras located all around the campus and someone is watching the cameras at all times. There is someone that watches the parking lot and another person that walks around campus. We have a security phone number that we can call at anytime. I feel extremely safe when I am at my school.
College Sophomore,5,Living on campus is the best. The family like relationship you make with the girls in your dorm are friends that you will have for a life time. There is a unity and a place where you feel safe.
College Sophomore,5,I love my program. I think it is one of the best. I am using my 5 years of schooling smart. I think that they work well with you at this school and show you how your classes are going to be laid out for you over the next semesters.
College Sophomore,5,"There is every place to eat you could imagine.  A mall, a movie theater, everything right in the town over."
College Sophomore,5,Our Christian atmosphere does not tolerate drug or alcohol no matter what age. It is not allowed on campus and It is never seen or even considered.
Recent Alumnus,5,"BEst kitchen I saw, great variety and tasty. Looking for it most"
Recent Alumnus,5,"Tons of parking place all over the campus, at the dorms, near the classes and behind the cafeteria."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Has its own security service, always present, kind and ready to help. Didn't encounter any crime so far."
College Sophomore,5,I'm in the Elementary Education program and it is an excellent program! The advisers and Professors are always available to help. The program offers many opportunities to have hands on experience volunteering in schools before practicum. All of the Professors have been elementary education teachers in the past and offer a lot of wonderful experience and knowledge.
College Senior,5,"Being in the Intercultural Studies program at BBC, students are required to not only attend classes, but also do some hands-on work, such as a ""directed field study"". This is where students take part in a trip the is more than a missions trip, but is also educational in the aspects of learning how another culture functions and how to adapt to it. Classes are geared toward learning about culture, how to apply the bible to a culture, how to learn a language, how to survive culture shock and how to effectively minister to people. The professors are amazing and so helpful. They genuinely want you to learn and they have much experience in the area they are teaching. Many of them have been missionaries themselves or worked within another culture. Their knowledge is invaluable."
College Senior,5,"I am really happy with the Intercultural Studies program. I love learning about the Bible and other cultures around the world and being able to experience them too. I hope that I will be able to have the chance to travel to different countries and be a servant to the people and use what I have learned in class to reach the people. Finding a job with this specific degree might definitely be a challenge, but my goal is not to become rich, but to be involved in ministry, which is far more rewarding than having money. It's hard sometimes because there are many people who don't understand why I would want to be in a position that could be hard and doesn't pay well. There is much disapproval, but I know that if I follow what God wants me to do, he will take care of me."
College Freshman,5,Students have their own vehicles so get around town or go home as needed.
College Freshman,5,"We have a small campus, not even taking up one block of property. But being a smaller Christian school, the family feel is awesome. Everyone knows everyone and there's nothing really hidden between people."
College Freshman,5,"They are very affordable, many offering student discounts. It's never a problem to find something cheap, quick, and even healthy."
College Freshman,5,The weather is not affect of what i have seen. All i have ever needed was my winter coat.
Senior,4,"Baptist Bible College, like any institution, has various strengths and weaknesses. One of its foremost strengths is the atmosphere of mutual encouragement and friendliness.  The campus is small and very familial. The school's emphasis on brotherly love and the ""one-anothering"" commands of the Bible create an excellent learning and growing environment. I've made lifelong friends here who want me to serve God and love people better everyday. 
The main downfall to the school is its lack of funding, which results in the invitation of speakers who do not adhere to the same hermeneutical principles being diligently taught. While the speakers' donations are helpful,  the double-standard presented by administration decreases the school's integrity. It is quite a shame, because most professors here are of superlative quality and character and do well to teach good handling of Scripture. 
I would especially recommend the Biblical Counseling degree to anyone."
College Sophomore,4,"No complaints about our housing. It's roomy, communal bathrooms but they are cleaned daily and well maintained."
College Student,4,I love the atmosphere this school gives off. Everyone makes you feel like you belong.
College Freshman,4,"Being at a Christian college, there are very strict rules. I love the fact that there are rules and regulations that every student is expected to follow. They have a no tolerance rule on drugs, sex, and alcohol. Having strict rules and having high expectations for the students provides an environment that I love being in."
College Freshman,4,"I grew up in the town that my school is located in. I love the town and the people here, but there is not much to do in Springfield, Missouri. We are a pretty big city, but we only have movie theaters and a mall."
College Sophomore,4,"Our school is very strict and has a very big handbook. We have curfew dress code, limited skips to classes, and in dorm rules such as what music, movies, etc we entertain in."
College Sophomore,4,I love the program I am in. I am already started in the masters program for my major and the Professors are very helpful and understanding.
College Sophomore,4,The work load and library is great! I enjoy the curriculum and also the personal relationships you build with your professors.
College Sophomore,4,Our classrooms do not require you to bring your laptops to class. It is optional if you would like to keep notes on them or not.
Recent Alumnus,4,"A top class library, teachers who know theri stuff, what do you need more?"
Recent Alumnus,4,Who really does use computer labs? Everyone has his own notebook and a tablet. The Wifi covers the whole campus with a good speed.
Recent Alumnus,4,"For admission you have to prove your qualities. If you are sure in your calling, there should be no big deal with it."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The cost might be a cocnern, but living conditions are great. Only in winter it is a little bit cold in there. But the cafeteria is great!"
Recent Alumnus,4,The school makes you feel very comfortable. The school policies support and maintain an enviroment ideal for learning and teaching. 
College Senior,4,I received the FAFSA pell grant
College Senior,4,"There are actually many different opportunities for internships offered at BBC. Students are required to intern at their local church in ministries to gain practical experience as they learn in class. The students at BBC are normally very enthusiastic about doing internships because they are excited to learn more. There are very rarely offer any paid internships, unless it is a privately offered one, by a pastor or another leader seeking to help out a student. Required internships usually last 8-12 weeks with a certain number or required hours. Other internships widely vary in their time commitments. I plan on interning through my church for a semester and then also seeking an internship immediately following graduation."
College Freshman,4,"The school is over 50 years old. Like every school, it has its positives and negatives. But its a great place to spend your college years, and the at home feel is awesome!"
College Junior,4,I live off campus. I hear great things about living on campus.
College Junior,4,"Our campus is located on a main street, so we have a lot of food options. Many of them are not nice, sit-down restaurants, but for college students, the dollar menu is great. If the students wanted a nice place to go eat, they wouldn't have to drive too far (about 5-10 miles)."
College Junior,4,"I attend a Bible college, so no drugs are permitted on campus. I have no doubt that some people do drugs off campus, but on campus there are none. If the school finds out about any drug abuse, the student is asked to leave the school."
Recent Alumnus,2,"On-campus housing is reasonably priced for a suburban campus. However, the social atmosphere is toxic. Gossip, cattiness, self-righteousness, judgment, pride, etc. You've got it all, and it is all largely ignored by leaders. Moreover, the administration makes it nearly impossible to live off campus; they REALLY want you to have the ""full experience."""
College Sophomore,2,"There are a lot of options around BBC for off campus housing. However, BBC has strict rules for living off campus. Unless if you are a resident of Springfield and live with a legal guardian, you have to be 24 years old to live of campus."
College Freshman,2,There is only one parking spot and the students have to park in the back after curfew but during the day we are more then welcome to park in Donaldson or the cafe pit. there is no cost to get a parking permit but if you don't park in the back after curfew you are fined.

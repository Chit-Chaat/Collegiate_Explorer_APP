Senior,5,"A few things I enjoyed about Kean University was the convenience of being able to attend through the satellite campus at Ocean County college, the low cost of tuition, and the high quality professors."
Senior,5,"Taking online courses at Kean University is very convenient and I have had nothing but good experiences with the professors. Additionally, every online course I took through Kean University was well-structured and had reasonable expectations similar to an in-person course."
Senior,5,They understand which time zone you live in and are very flexible. Proffessors often are very lenient if late homework is submitted since we are going through a pandemic.
Sophomore,5,"my experience has been greatful, I started college last year, fall 2019. Currently I am on my third  semester, mi major is computer science and my currently gpa is 4.0"

Freshman,5,I enjoy the fact that they have their own learning platform rather then them forcing us to use zoom.
Freshman,5,Although I haven’t been a student at Kean for a long I believe that the school tries really hard to make you involved and I appreciate that. everyone is very nice and helpful and you get as much help as you need.
Freshman,5,This fall will be my first semester at Kean and so far I already love it there! The advisors and staff I have worked with are so kind and friendly. They help you with any questions you may have and are always there to support you with your college career!

Sophomore,5,"Diverse, with a great atmosphere. The staff is great and the campus is beautiful. Plus the community is very welcoming."
Freshman,5,"Honestly, it is the most diverse school and most affordable in NJ. They offer a lot of resources, the campus is kind of large, but the buildings are not that far apart. There are a lot of places you could go for quiet study time, or if you would like to hang out with some friends. They encourage you to take part in many outside activities on or off campus, just to get involved. Nice school, don't regret going here."
Graduate Student,5,"Although the transition to remote learning was unexpected, our professors were quick to adjusting and made sure all of the students were still getting help and made sure no one was left behind on their work."
Graduate Student,5,"The professors definitely challenge your intelligence, especially at the graduate level. The campus is easy to navigate and the atmosphere is nice. Some of the professors take awhile to grow on you, but they are also understanding and want to see you succeed in their classes."

Freshman,5,"Most of my classes were done perfectly, the professors were straight to the point and taught the lesson with a pre recorded video. They were always available if you needed to speak with them or get some extra help. Everyone was willing to work around the situation we were put into."
Senior,5,I’ve had a great experience taking classes at Kean online. They are already very accustomed to online classes and do a great job.
Sophomore,5,"I love that Kean University is very diversity, the campus is cleaned at all times, and the education system is very great. The professors are so much willing to help with studies, they are available during their office times, as well as they respond to emails withing few minutes. 
The only change I want to see is providing Healthy Food. Students continuously eat fast food because the meal isn't great enough. It is important to eat healthy always."
Junior,5,I am a transfer student to Kean studying special education grades k-6 looking forward to starting fall semester 2020.
Senior,5,I loved my experience at Kean! Its a diverse school with impactful professors if you do your research!

Junior,5,Kean University gives everyone a chance to grow. If you feel discouraged because of previous you made in school they help you make things better to get you on the right path to graduate. Not many schools care as much as these counselors here do. I am grateful.
Freshman,5,Kean University has a super friendly environment. it's my first year and i feel right at home. The only thing i wish would change is how hard it is to park sometimes.
Freshman,5,"I would like to see them finish the buildings that are currently being constructed. Also, more empanadas in the dining hall please."
Sophomore,5,My experience at Kean University was amazing so far. I met new friends and participated in a number of activities. I've done a lot of college homework during my 1 year and a half at Kean. My professors were very helpful and some of them were available to help me whenever I'm having trouble with.
Freshman,5,I truly loved the welcoming environment of Kean and those who go there. There are clubs and organizations for everyone at Kean. The professors are hands on and very involved with the personal development of their students.
Freshman,5,Kean University is a great school inside and out. I fell in love with the beautiful campus and I personally would not change a thing or the people in it !!!

I would highly recommend Kean University to anybody."
Sophomore,5,It definitely deserved more credit than it gets. A greatly underrated university. The environment and professors are great. The opportunities are endless and their global integration is amazing.

Junior,5,"good and affordable university.
the professors know what they are teaching and are help students when is needed. The university is always having events, these events can be to have fun and others to help students to success."
Sophomore,5,"Great sized school, very diverse with staff that truly care. Not much of party school but lots of campus life activities. Many places for studying or relaxing. Super expensive food and the dining food isn't the best for your stomach until you get used to it. Plenty of ways for extra help with tutoring, writing center and professors. Professors truly do their best to make sure you succeed. Residential life is different depending on where you dorm but plenty of opportunity to make new friends. Also a very safe environment with our own police department on campus."
Freshman,5,"Campus life is vivid, and there's always something to do. The professors I have know how to teach and very well-organized. One thing that stands out about Kean is the amount of opportunities they give you to explore your major/minor even when you're undecided. The food places are delicious and vary from many different options."
Junior,5,"Nice decent sized campus, great professors never had an issue with any of my professors. Only a few classes had way to many people in small rooms but faculty does try their best to move to bigger and better rooms for the sake of the students taking the course. Overall it is a very friendly environment with many career opportunities and plenty of active professors always willing to help and answer student's questions at any time."
Sophomore,5,I enjoy the amazing professors. I have always liked classes best when i connect with my professors. All the professors I have had in the last year during my first semester at Kean had been amazing.
Alum,5,I loved Kean!  The teachers were excellent and I received a wonderful education.  Kean has high standards and ensured a quality educational experience.
Freshman,5,Kean has welcomed me as an in coming freshman and I’m so excited to spend my next four year there ! When I first got to the school I was scared but the students And staff  reinsured  me that everything would be ok and it’s very affordable specially for instate student fully recommend
Freshman,5,Kean University offers one of the best experiences throughout your college career. They offer great classes and a good environment
Junior,5,"I love how small the campus is, class sizes aren't too large and intimidating, and my professors have been really there for me! The Environmental and Sustainability Science programs are great, and all the professors in my major are awesome :)"
Freshman,5,I am starting in the summer program.  This allows me to learn my surroundings and experience in the college life. My first experience has shown me how to prepare myself and what to expect.  I am very happy that I decided to enroll this summer.
Sophomore,5,"Kean University is a great campus with teachers who make students feel welcome and heard. Instead of being a number, each student is appreciated and given help in order to achieve their goals."
Freshman,5,I was assigned an amazing admissions counselor who talked me through each thing about the university including the program I am doing.
Niche User,5,"What I liked most about Kean University, was its very sophisticated art department. Not only does it count with several tools and instruments to produce high-quality art pieces, but the professors and staff demonstrated interest, passion, and commitment to guide their students. In addition to this, the facilities at the university's art department were considerably ample, which allows students and professors to interact comfortably while developing each alumn's skills furthermore."
Junior,5,"I loved everything about Kean. The small class sizes, the diversity, the beautiful campus. They have some great professors but also some not-so-great ones. They have a great ASL program as well."
Niche User,5,I honestly have visited many schools and have never felt so comfortable and at home then at Kean. Kean welcomed me with open arms and really showed off what an amazing school they had up their sleeves. The price to go there as well is a lot lower than most place in nj and the surrounding states. The vibe of the school is great and I can't wait till fall of 2019 for my first-year experience
Freshman,5,Everyone here is very nice and open to conversation. There is no need to feel discouraged or scared to ask for help.
Senior,5,"I love that Kean University is diverse. All people are welcomed and treated with respect. The professors are knowledgeable and buoyant. They are committed to helping students to succeed in their academic performance. They are also committed to enhancing student's confidence, workmanship, and agility. You can find a huge amount of resources in Kean's library. The staff members are always willing to answer any questions you may have.
I enjoyed living on campus. It's safe and peaceful. The different choices of food are very good and always fresh. If you are interested in sports or working out at the gym, Kean can accommodate your interest. 
Kean University cares about your goals and your future. They are there to help you make a life-changing decision. If I decide to go for my Master's degree, I most definitely would pursue it at Kean University."
Junior,5,"Kean changed my life. Teachers are kind and very easy to understand. I am apart of 5 different organizations on campus including junior class senator of Student .Org, member of Haitian Student Association, Member of Order of  Melchizedek, treasurer of Leadership and Society, and I’m a member of the Black Leadership Union. I have just got the votes for Senior Class President for next semester! You will love it here. This is my home."
Freshman,5,"Unique , friendly campus with caring staff members. They truly value the students and their opinions. There is many ways to get involved on this campus, and many opportunities within Kean University."
Freshman,5,Kean University’s Campus is a beautiful Campus located between the cities union and Elizabeth. Kean’s campus is located between the cities Union and Elizabeth. Kean id one of the most diverse schools in New Jersey and the atmosphere never makes you feel out of place. The majority  of classes are average size so students definitely get one on one help and support from their professors.
Freshman,5,"I am an incoming freshman for the 2019 Fall Semester at Kean University, and so far they have made my experience easy and welcoming. I am very excited to study and further my education there."
Senior,4,They are very friendly and helpful. Counslors are very personal and honest and they tell you straight up if this college is for you. It is very affordable and is very good if you are first generations student or an immigrant.
Freshman,4,"I have not endured the online learning experience yet, but I have had my freshman orientation online! It went smooth and well and if the classes are anything like the online orientation than I believe it will go swell!"
Sophomore,4,"Pros: Diverse, safe, like 15 min from the airport, like 30 min from NYC, train station on campus, a lot of internships opportunities, a lot of study abroad options and opportunities, newer residence hall buildings are amazing, a lot of on-campus jobs, cheaper than other colleges, a lot of resources on campus for students, the campus is pretty and a decent size, dry campus, a lot of places to study, a really nice library and theatres.

Cons: Ok so the food isn't bad and there are a few different places to choose however, it gets very tiring of the same foods very fast.  The older residence halls are gross. Wifi is absolutely terrible at Kean sometimes service is bad too. The older classrooms are too small with bad AC. The sports are not that great but they are not the worst either. Parking is a mess. There is not nearly enough parking."
Sophomore,4,"During the pandemic, Kean University was very accommodating to students struggling with the transition and offered a great space to get accustomed to attending normal classes online."
Freshman,4,"Kean's campus is very pretty and big. There are many restaurants nearby to grab a snack in between classes. The public transportation is right in front of the school. The school is very fair in terms of tuition, a lot of scholarships are offered."
Freshman,4,"I haven't taken any online classes for Kean University. However, I have attended zoom meetings about certain announcements. These meetings are very informative and professional, your questions are always answered!"
Freshman,4,"The school tried their best to transition quickly from in school learning to online learning. They did a fair job, professors were prepared, the school offered relief money to those who needed it, and they are offering tuition free Summer II courses for those who did not do well on their spring courses."
Sophomore,4,I love the diversity that Kean university brings and they have campus always filled with activities to do.
Sophomore,4,"When corona kicked off and we had to switch to online at first I was nervous. But, overtime my teachers did pretty good teaching me the material. Some courses were harder to learn online then others. Overall, I didn’t mind it."
Sophomore,4,I liked that Kean was a diverse school. This is a university that is open to all people. With some of the people I’ve got a chance to know and become friends with. I’ve learned more about other cultures and started learning new languages with them. This university has already shown it has potential but has not fully lived up to it yet. Some professors and some helpers have given myself and others a feeling that they’re not there for us. Just to waste time and make some money do it. On the other side I have seen some others put their hearts into making sure everyone one of us does not give up on our dreams or give in to the pressure we’ve put on ourselves.
Senior,4,I have to say that the transfer to online classes due to COVID-19 has been pretty adaptable and easy. The teachers were understanding about student wifi and other issues due to COVID-19.
Senior,4,"I really like all that Kean offers. It is a very fun campus with activities, clubs, and so much more to offer. I think as a commuter, it is a little stressful trying to get parking. Even when you get to campus an hour early."
Niche User,4,I would like to see more quicker response through email. and wish they had more opportunities for scholarships.
Junior,4,"Doesn't have the best advisor, sometimes you would have to go to other people to find out what your advisor doesn't tell you."
Niche User,4,I will be a freshman this fall. I been recruited to play soccer for Kean so when I visit the campus it really felt like home. My major is criminal justice which is very  highly rated. My experience so far has been great and I'm looking forward to join the Kean family.
Alum,4,"Kean University was a pleasant school. I received a lot of help from my advisors and their EOF program. The school offers many majors, however, it lacks connection with their professors and students."
Senior,4,"It wasn't bad I learned a lot of life lessons here. Teachers are nice and helpful, but the food wasn't always the greatest here. Dorms were okay they need certain things to be fixed or redone."
Sophomore,4,"Kean is a very open campus. theres always something to do and the campus is very beautiful! Kean cares about its looks and the campus is always well kept. when the weather is nice, the campus is a hot spot and kids love to hang out, get work done or just enjoy themselves whiles being at school. the professors are great and the staff is great as well."
Freshman,4,"Its a friendly environment with good food. Offices can be a little slow. there are different options at Kean that can improve your future. as an example, i am a bio/pre-med major. the professors truly insure that all students grasp the information that they are learning. there are different opportunities to partake in school activities that will advance your learning"
Junior,4,"Kean is a very solid college in a semi-dangerous city. The campus itself is kept very clean and organized, however, I wish the classrooms were not designed as if it was a high school. Campus life is good and so are the availability of classes."
Junior,4,"Kean University is the first and only college I will go to. The tuition is cheap in the sense that it is in state and they have a joint relationship with the campus located in Toms River, Ocean County College. This campus makes it easy, not only for me, but all other Kean students that live in the area an opportunity to stay near home. The commute from one campus to the other is a long drive considering traffic and the time of the day. I know I will have to commute eventually if I want to finish college. However one somewhat confusing part about Kean is that they use a website called BlackBoard so that students can see all their assignments and submit them to their Professors. BlackBoard can be very confusing and difficult to navigate through. Overall though the odds beat around 80/20. I am glad to know I can trust Kean."
Junior,4,My experience at Kean University has been overall positive as being a part a big community like this has opened the doors to so many opportunities and has also led me to meet some amazing people. Kean University gives you all the tools to go far with your career and allows you to become a more well rounded person.
Alum,4,I enjoyed my time here at this university. Being a student working while also participating in clubs while still going to class and studying for exams. I always had my plate full because there is so much to do and get involved in at Kean
Junior,4,Kean University is an amazing school with caring and knowledgeable professors. They all really care about their students and are aware of different teaching styles. The campus is beautiful with a lot of places to go and study and an active student life!
Freshman,4,"I love being at Kean! The dorms are nice, the campus is beautiful. The dining hall isn't great, but there are lots of other options around. The biggest problem I've had is the lack of activities/events on the weekends. As a resident student with no car, I'm pretty much stuck on campus with nothing to do every weekend."
Junior,4,Some of the profesor are qualified in the subject they teach but they don’t know how to teach it to students that are new to the subject.
Freshman,4,"I’m happy at Kean. The academics are relatively good depending on what program you are enrolled in. Athletic facilities are great, and games are fun to go to. There isn’t much else to do other than watch sports (no activities ran by student government or any other organization on weekends). If you’re not an athlete, most people go home on the weekends. Cougar Hall is brand new and great to live in, everywhere else is older and a little more run down. Party’s are every weekend, frats and athletes host off campus."
Senior,4,"The innovation that took place as the campus expanded. It gave an entire student body an unforgettable experience because many have witnessed an empire like
KEAN UNIVERSITY, In the making."
Junior,4,"Kean was not my first choice, I wanted to go somewhere else but my guidance consular thought it would be best for me to go to Kean, and I'm really happy I followed his advice. Kean is a really good school, it's affordable and for the past three years I've had an overall great experience. I'm a Biology major and I've enjoyed a lot of the courses I have taken not only are they interesting, but I have had some incredible professors. The professors I've had were nothing but kind and helpful and I've never felt that I have had a horrible experience with any of them.  I've lived on campus since I've started, and it’s been a pretty good experience. The dorms themselves are pretty nice and pretty affordable. When I first went to Kean I was afraid I wasn't going to enjoy my experience but I'm happy to say that since I've been their it’s been great!"
Freshman,4,"I am new to Kean but I do really like it here. The campus is beautiful. It is very diverse. There are many options for food. However, all of it is a little pricy. I'm still looking for more affordable food options."
Freshman,4,"I admired the atmosphere on campus and the rooms. The people on campus are very massive and kind and I appreciated that a lot.  While I was there, I learned the importance of organizing yourself and making sure you're prepped for college. They said that once you put your money into it that it's not a game. It ain't high school where you go there for free, you got to get your moneys worth or else there's no point."
Sophomore,4,I am going on my second year here at Kean University. I love the diversity the students are very friendly the campus is overall safe. I play on the women’s soccer team and the facilities are really nice for a Division III school. The New Jersey state schools seem to really put money and resources into making the college experience the best they could be. I am from New York and tuition is very competitive from other schools I looked at. I am really enjoying my experience at Kean. The school is looking to always add and make additions to the campus. Looks like there has been a nice financial investment in the area To making a desirable Destiination for choosing to further your education.
Niche User,4,"a nice little college with some stuff to do, including a pool but only if you belong to a sports team but i could just do swimming"
Junior,4,Love the diversity and how close New York City is to campus. Kean offers great education at a moderate cost.
Freshman,4,"Kean is a nice school in a great location. The school is located on a New Jersey Transit rail line and close to NYC. Kean has a large selection of majors to pick from. They also have one of the most divers student populations. Kean is a great school if you wish to become a teachers. They have a great art and theater program. Kean University is a wonderful mid-sized School that offer individuals exceptional education. The class sizes are perfect for students who want to work closely with their professor. The career development resources are also amazing. At Kean as long as your willing to work hard you will do great!"""
Junior,4,I love the campus of Kean University there are always beautiful flowers everywhere. All of the professors are willing to work with you if you are struggling in their class or if you just need help. Being an athlete professors are very understanding with our schedules. Also everyone in the athletic department
Graduate Student,4,I enjoyed my time at Kean University. All the teachers were very helpful. The tuition was reasonable compared to other schools in New Jersey. They offered a variety of classes that can fit any schedule.
Freshman,4,The teachers are amazing and i love the class size. The only reason it may not get a 5 is because of the unnecessary GE 1000 course and the attitudes of the people working in their accounting office.
Junior,4,Kean university is a great college to attend very affordable for anyone. I would recommend this school to attend no matter what kind of life style kean will ensure they provide you a great education.
Sophomore,4,"So far, as a sophomore at Kean University, I have enjoyed the environment as a whole, as it is filled with friendly and diverse students. The professors are up to par and very informative, and the activities on campus are fun and engaging. Despite being a big school, which would be a difficulty for some students, it is actually a benefit for me, as I get to socialize with different people everyday, rather than sticking to the same group of people. Also, there are plenty of eating spots around campus, in which they serve delicious food that I always enjoy."
Senior,4,"Great campus and people that go here, I've seen the student focus become the main focus and that really helps when it comes time to choose a school. The programs offer a variety of subjects that people can take and range from As - Doctoral programs."
Graduate Student,4,"I love the education certification graduate teachers, they are very approachable. Also, they grade very fairly and give students a chance to really do well regardless of their age of background. As a returning adult to college, I feel every comfortablt at Kean and the professors are very knowledeable.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in obtaining a teaching degree as full time student, part time or certification program."
Sophomore,4,"Kean University is a very diverse school with 3 locations, one being in China. I recommend this school to those looking for a beautiful campus to attend all while getting a good education."
Senior,4,"Entering my second semester as a transfer student here. Good so far, I had straight A's in my first semester. Hopefully that'll continue."
Sophomore,4,"Kean university is a very welcoming and comfortable environment to learn in. Academic life is very resourceful but one thing i would change about Kean is the unnecessary spending on things student's don't need. For example, many of the dorms have mold and bad air conditioning but Kean would rather spend money on pointless statues and building student lounges."
Sophomore,4,"Kean University is a very diverse school and I’m proud to be a student there. The campus is beautiful, especially in the spring and the summer."
Junior,4,"I originally applied for acceptance into their new Online Degree Program as a transfer student from an online school that recently closed, but I found they appear to be working out some growing pains as it is a new curriculum set-up.  Ultimately, I changed my major to commence classes both on campus and online.  While going through the process of changing my major I discovered I was a great candidate for a double major with all the transfer credits I was able to transfer in.  So, while my initial encounter was a bit of a bumpy start, I am well on my way to begin classes this Fall 2019 and I couldn't be happier.  I highly recommend Kean University, but I'd give their online degrees program a little patience and time and I'm sure they will deserve all five stars."
Junior,4,Kean has given me so much opportunities in terms of my field (architecture) even despite being such a new program. The faculty at my department really care and put a lot of effort into each course session. I enjoy being a student here.
Senior,4,"Professors actually care about the success of the students. Professors are willing to work with the student in whatever it may be that the student is struggling on. A ""in and out""  kind of school though. You come in, go to class and then leave. Not alot of student to student activities."
Sophomore,4,"Kean University is an alright school. The people are nice but, a lot of the professors are no help a huge portion of the time. The academics are a bit slow so most people can catch up quick. This university has a lot to offer to its students. Commuting can tough for those who drive (parking is an issue), but if you're able to take NJ Transit then definitely do it. Kean has helped me immensely from not only an academic standpoint but also as an individual. Overall I've had a great student experience here and choosing Kean University has probably been the best decision I've ever made."
Sophomore,4,My experience at kean university has been good so far what ive learn through the years here is that you really have to be on top of your work no matter and no distractions. I would like to see more activities for students who live on campus
Junior,4,I am so glad that this school is as affordable as it is. I have been lucky to have mostly caring and compassionate professors who understand the struggles of a long commute and working full time.
Freshman,4,Kean University is a great college but there are some minor things that should be fixed which is the food on campus is alright but could be better and have more variety. The upperclassmen dorms needs to be renewed!
Junior,4,"Kean University is very diverse. There are many clubs and activities to do on campus. Teachers pay attention to your needs and are very communicative. The best way to know more about the campus is by getting a campus job. Union train station is located right on campus as a plus. The campus is very huge; thankfully, there are many campus shuttles that drive you from North Campus to East Campus. However, finding parking is a very huge issue. If you don't show up at a certain time, you will not find a space. I wish there were more varied and healthier meal options on campus. As a student, it would be beneficial to learn how to meal prep."
Sophomore,4,"Professors are great and very helpful. Kean is an extremely diversified campus. Dorms are very spacious, but the cafeteria food could be better."
Sophomore,4,"For starters, the program in which I am currently in, Architectural Studies is an amazing program with tons of opportunities. Aside from that, the campus is beautiful and I've had an amazing on-campus experience so far."
Niche User,4,Something I liked was their ability to give cheap tuiton and be helpful with every question. Something I would change is their athletics.
Senior,4,"A very good school- would recommend anyone to go here, given the low tuition costs which can help tremendously with budgets, etc."
Senior,4,"I love being a student at Kean University. They have campuses in Union, NJ and in Toms River, NJ, as well as online learning. The professors are knowledgeable and friendly."
Freshman,4,"Kean University, so far, has been a good safety school to attend. Their major range from science to business to engineering, etc. They are even expanding their campus to obtain more classes and more majors. I am a freshman and all of the supplemental activities and services are very beneficial from tutor to a one-stop service where all types of questions are answered. A library that offers quiet rooms to rent and not to mention all the food available for purchase right nearby."
Sophomore,2,"I took online classes due to the pandemic. I do not know if it's the same as regular online classes, but I really hate them so far. This school has been trying everything it can to not lower tuition and refund students. Many teachers clearly don't know what to do with an online class."
Sophomore,2,"With COVID-19 we all unfortunately had to be forced to take our classes online. With myself being unprepared with the overwhelming amounts of work I was given. My grades dropped because of it. Some professors were lenient with their assignment while others weren’t. We were given new rules that we have to predict whether our computer dies or our power might go out, but these were things that we didn’t have to worry about at Kean, because they had a library and computer stations for us to work out in case this happened."
Freshman,2,I would say my kean experience started out great but toward the end of my first year I am thinking about transferring out.
Niche User,2,Kean has a very dry campus. As a freshman it was hard to make friends and become involved in the community because there weren't a lot of events going on.
Senior,2,"I am a senior at Kean University and I have had nothing but problems. I would love to see more helpful staff and staff who actually care and speak English. Many of the advisors are not helpful and give students conflicting information. Some of the professors barely speak English which makes learning very difficult. Overall, it seems that no one really has any answers about anything. I also would love for the tuition and books to be cheaper, or to see my tuition money spent on something other than flowers and pointless buildings."
Junior,2,"I have been attending Kean Ocean for 2 years now, and overall have had a very disappointing experience. Maybe if I attended the main campus, it would have been different. But at the Ocean campus, the education I feel I am receiving is below-par. There is a terrible lack of guidance, and very low morale among students."
Junior,2,"My experience at Kean Ocean has not been very positive. I want more than anything to earn my bachelor's in education but it is taking 2 years longer than it should have due to lack of guidance. I had saved enough money to finish in 4 years, but am now struggling to come up with 2 more years tuition."
Junior,2,"While it is only my first semester here I have found some drawbacks to going to Kean at Ocean. While it is nice to stay at the same location and be able to go to a four year school I have ran into some problems that have left me with a bad taste on my tongue. One of the biggest issues is that the class selection is very small due to the school not wanting to compete with Ocean County College. Therefore, many classes are not offered at this location, like religion and anthropology classes, which are only offered at the Union location. However, I feel that this defeats the purpose of having Kean at Ocean, because some students may have to take classes at the Union site or be unable to take a certain class. "
College Freshman,2,"I had extreme difficulty scheduling classes because I placed out of prerequisite courses, and my advisors offered little help with the courses I was supposed to take."
College Sophomore,2,"stay on top of every form you fill out! make sure all completions of ANYTHING* get sent to your email as proof. Try to be nice, it helps."
College Freshman,2,The process is hassle to find out your statement often have to check the kean wise or directly with student account .
College Freshman,2,It is the same thing everyday and there isn't much to eat for those who don't eat pork. It's a lot of pork here.
College Freshman,2,The financial aid office at Kean is probably one of the most frustrating things you would have to deal with if you came here. I think that they are unorganized. They cancelled my financial aid because of lack of communication. Which i think they should work on.
College Sophomore,2,Most houses are small and need a few occupants to pay rent.
College Junior,2,"To expensive, you dont get enough considering how much you pay, meal plan is terrible and parking"
College Junior,2,"Kean picks and chose how much they tolerate certain things, some things like ""parking violations"" hold more value than attendance because they make money off of parking violations, you also incur a late fee of 50$ if you dont pay your parking violatin"
College Junior,2,"Dirty, not to close to public transportation, not to many shuttles, food is bad"
College Sophomore,2,"Im not part of the Greek life, and for a good reason too.  I particularly dislike greek life, mostly because of the initiations to be ""trusted"" among a group.  That's just me though.  Others have the time of their lives and are involved with the best groups of their lives."
College Freshman,2,The town of Union and Elizabeth are really sketchy and scary with NOTHING to do. I wouldn't walk around there. However NYC is like a half hour train ride away for like $13.
College Freshman,2,"Wifi sucks, as a student you can only connect two devices to the wifi which is your phone and laptop sorry if you have a playstation or anything. And it doesn't work the majority of the time, also when you take your laptop to a new building you have to reconnect each time. Theres like 3 open computer labs all night, and some have macs. The printing works sometimes but is free. You don't NEED your own computer cause there are so many labs but having one is preferred."
College Sophomore,2,off-campus housing is ok if you can afford it. It gets you through college is all I can say.
College Freshman,2,Theirs no point in applying if you even think you're parents make too much money. It's just a waste of time
College Freshman,2,"I think it's way too expensive. It's not even the great, just your basic necessities. Also it too far to go from the parking lot to the dorms."
College Freshman,2,When it's freezing outside the walk to classes are horrible. Too cold to walk in. Buildings are sometimes way too far away.
College Student,2,"I'm just gonna mention the lockdown that happened when there was a suspected man armed with a shotgun on campus and my professor didnt even bother to close and lock the door after everyone got the alert call. It was a false alarm, but you think people would have treated it more seriously. Students have no idea what to do in the event of a lockdown or fire drill. Car jackings are common and stuff gets stolen frequently."
College Student,2,Parties happen frequently and I have friends who talk about the dealers on campus. I do not participate in these activates and this makes me uncomfortable. Some have come to class drunk/high.
College Student,2,"New Jersey is tough. It can get hot in the fall, but spring comes late and winter hits hard. This year we've had snowfall at least every week and it's absolutely freezing walking around campus. Spring will bring relief, but the winter is not fun. No one likes 2 degree weather or wind chills. The snow horribly affects parking as well. No one can see the lines and students cannot tell if they are parked in a faculty spot or not."
College Junior,2,the nightlife is really non existent near campus. Most people who are looking for nightlife take the train into New York City. Kean does have a train station in walking distance from the campus.
College Freshman,2,"This would probably be the biggest problem I have encountered at my school , there never seems to be enough parking , I would usually have to arrive at campus an hour earlier to find a parking spot . Of course in the big scheme of things, parking is not that serious of a problem and there are other option such as parking a bit further and then taking a shuttle but at times it seems inconvinient."
College Senior,2,Mostly off campus from what I see
College Junior,2,I received a little less than half. Its decent to get you on your feet but they do not really get all the stress of the payments off your chest. Also since the majority works and commutes most students are not as focused as they could be. The good thing would be to check in and see if they can help you out in any other way!
College Sophomore,2,"I don't drive just yet, but my my, students have been late a lot due to lack of parking."
College Sophomore,2,Im sure you can find an apartment somewhere but on campus housing is just the best bet
College Senior,2,"Classes are rarely cancelled for snow, and if they cancelled they announce it an hour before they close the school. Very inconvenient for commuter students. When it's nice the campus comes alive and everyone is outside enjoying the weather, playing volley ball or basket ball or just hanging out around campus."
College Junior,2,"They are very stuck up. There are some that only care about collecting your money. There are also some that degrade you when pledging. They say they break you down to build you up, but it seems as if they just want to humiliate you."
College Junior,2,"There is no real Greek life at Kean, but one can find a ton of professional development events offered for free by the University. It really helps to expand ones mind and resume."
College Freshman,2,Very bad communication skills and some teachers are very rude.
College Junior,2,"I have had several awful experiences in computer labs on Kean campus, the technology is outdated and constantly having errors"
College Junior,2,Most students are commuters and live far from campus constantly complaining about parking to get to class on time and fitting together their school and job life. No one is happy here
College Junior,2,Few care about the athletics on campus and most students are commuters
College Freshman,2,the food is the same thing over and over again. you get sick of it after a while. they need to mix it up a little.
College Sophomore,2,To find parking most people have to come before class.
College Sophomore,2,NJ Transit doesn't always have reliable bus service and isn't dependable at times. The train is a little bit better. There is no bus services after 9 on weekdays and on Sundays
College Sophomore,2,"There's a lot of parking at Kean, but unfortunately the spots are taking up quick and the parking spaces are small to point that drivers have to be caution about hitting other people's cars while getting out. You must register your car to be on campus if you are a commuter or if you need a car to be on campus for a specific reason if you are residence, such as work on the weekends."
College Freshman,2,the reason by why this recieves a C- is due to the fact that you do pay for it aside from your tuition and well its is very difficult to find parking and must arrive very early to find a long walk away from your building type of parking
College Junior,2,"The parking at Kean is hectic to be honest; the spaces are tight and you have to get there early in the day for guaranteed parking. You can find one most of the time, but it will usually be far from your destination."
College Senior,2,Th food is not really worth the price they charge for it.  They constantly serve the same thing week after week.  I would rather order out or eat out than to spend my money at Kean.
College Sophomore,2,"there is hardly anything to do at unless you plan to do something off campus and come back, which a lot of students do since the college is centrally located around of local social areas."
College Freshman,2,Unless your around the gym or any of the athletic girls most of them are pretty ugly
College Junior,2,"I have only received about $700 my first semester at Kean. Besides that, I never had anything paid for me by financial aid. I have 2 siblings and one is in college right now. One used to be in college, but we have never received anything. I have gotten a few attitudes from people at the financial aid office as well which wasn't pleasant."
College Senior,2,There are not many options available for off-campus dining.  There are two famous franchise restaurant nearby and some no name diners.  I rarely go to the famous franchise places nearby and never go to the diners.
College Junior,2,"Kean U. is located in Union/Elizabeth/Woodbridge. There are plenty of things to do off campus and lots of traffic whether it's on Rt. 22 or the parkway. Elizabeth is not the nicest area; it's pretty rough and can be dangerous but Union and the other area is acessible and easy to get around, plenty of places to eat and shop and there are some rather dismal parks scattered throughout. There is a Colombian section of town within a 10 minute walk of the campus where there are eateries and they celebrate a Colombian festival in the summer."
College Sophomore,2,"the food is inconsistent. It can be good one day, but terrible the next"
College Freshman,2,"Cafeteria is not so good and very dull, other eatery is good but can get pricey and you cannot use $1,000 plus meal plan you have."
College Senior,2,"Business Professors Aren't Active Helpers of Stunner in the Business Field. I have spoken to people from other universities that have had career work shops with professors in the business field, and they sounded very involved. I then compared that program to my school. The most I see are flyers informing us of job fairs. If you want assistance in job outlook, you have to search and find out yourself rather than information being in front of you."
College Sophomore,2,Sports are not that important but fun to be involved in
College Senior,2,Cars and Trains – The train station is on campus so I know a lot of people use it. The only bad thing is they cost a lot of money and the times the trains run do not always match up with the times of classes. Almost everyone uses their cars. I have an hour communte to Kean but overall it isnt too bad. The worst part about driving is the Kean has no parking! If you want to park your car anywhere you have to get there super early. Most of the time there is no parking on the main campus at all. I have to get to school about a half hour to an hour early to try and find parking and then make it to class because I end up having to park far away or on another campus.
College Senior,2,"Do They Even Give Money? At Kean I feel like the only time they give money anywhere is to the sports, building new buildings and landscaping. I have not been informed of any grants or scholarships. I don't think I would get one anyway because I am white and a major that is not science."
College Sophomore,2,Not That Great – Friends of mine who commute say the parking isn't that great. The only way to get parking according to them is to come to school extra early and there will be an abundance of parking.
College Senior,2,"Confusing, Limited, Useful – There are a lot but the school is cutting some majors."
Freshman,1,"Horrible communication, staff is rude and extremely unhelpful, overall a poor education experience. Wish the staff and faculty actually provided help and information. Financial aid, one-stop,  registrar, and RSS have all given me problems. And I’ve been here for a semester. Needless to say, I’m transferring next year."
Freshman,1," The school is completely unprofessional,  they bring in the worst of the worst students, I guess you get what you pay for because I've never seen such a disgrace as a university.  It seems like they try really hard to  keep up this fake ""world-class education"" but in all reality they have no idea what they're doing and have no idea how to conduct a university full of students. "
College Junior,1,"Unhelpful staff, barely any class options, and poor educational experience."
College Senior,1,they barely offer scholarships for students
College Freshman,1,The financial aid is very horrible. They don't care if you owe a few dollars they want their money when they want their money. They don't have any consideration for the students. HORRIBLE.
College Sophomore,1,The school kept telling me they didn't get the information and forms I sent.
College Junior,1,"Kean university cops are EVERYWHERE EXCEPT KEAN. I always see Kean police in elizabeth, deep in the other end of union, ive seen some in newark, theyre patrolling everywhere but kean, they dont take their job seriously,"
College Junior,1,"School financial aid offices are ALWAYS closed,  the people who work in the offices are always ""out sick"" on ""vacation"" everthing is done very slow, response time is SLOW"
College Freshman,1,I haven't had any internships yet but hopefully I will get one soon.
College Student,1,"I have gotten hardly any financial aid, and have even had to pursue loans from a private lender in order to ensure I can pay for me tuition."
College Sophomore,1,"I may be over exaggerating, but the dining hall is one of the most repetitious food spots I have ever seen. Eat there a few times, its fine. But for those with meal plans, many will throw up because of the food."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't drive, but I hear nonstop complaints about lack of parking spaces, how bad people park, and how hard it is to find parking if one does not come to school early."
College Freshman,1,"There's no parking ANYWHERE on week days, but it is free. The cops are horrible with ticketing, which are at minimum $50, and never give you a break."
College Freshman,1,"There is none. I WISH Kean did. I would move out of the dorms in a heart beat. The dorms are way to expensive and the RA's treat it more like hotels. Very quite and dismal. However they're nice. But as far a as off campus housing goes there's none and you have to find your own apartment/ house, which is near impossible because everything in the area is over priced and not nice at all. And the surrounding town is not that safe. And we also don't have a greek row or set athletic houses so all the houses are scattered around the school. Most are pretty far away, and in dangerous areas."
College Sophomore,1,"I absolutely need money, and financial aid is not cutting it. I am trying to search for scholarships and grants and am not getting it. It is possible for me to get booted out of college because of overprice tuition. I do my best to stay in this college life, get the degree and experience I need, so I can run a successful job."
College Freshman,1,"To add on top of not much parking, their is some type of construction going on in the Vaughn Eames parking lot which is causing even more of a raucous. Parking is ridiculous, usually should come two hours before class to find parking."
College Junior,1,We are in union-elizabeth. It is a very scary and dangerous environment.
College Junior,1,They are never available. There are not enough. They never work.
College Senior,1,Very un organized. They are more concerned with what your doing in your free time than helping you get through school.
College Senior,1,This is the worst part of my school.
College Freshman,1,"If you have mid-day classes than get here as early as possible. University is 75% commuters and parking is very difficult to find mid-day. Around 5:00 pm parking clear out so early morning class, or late afternoon classes are the best if you are commuting."
College Junior,1,"I transfered to Kean. I applied for the Spring 2013 semester and somehow they got the impression that I was applying for Fall 2013. I fought with the school and showed them my application and that I applied for Spring. They said ""ok, but you need to contact someone so they can look at your transcript"" I said alright no problem and then I got the ohh sorry they're on vacation and there's no one else who can help you. I highly doubt only ONE person at Kean has the power to look at someone's transcript. I made many phone calls and finally someone was available to look at. There is no important criteria or an abnormal application process for my program of studies. I do offer tips! Follow up with administration!! They are nice people but they always seem to mess up. Follow up, send emails, make phone calls. Go out of your way to contact someone or else you will wait forever to get a response."
College Senior,1,"Parking is free, but you need to get a decal for your window. In the morning there are no spots after 10am. Get to campus at least a half hour before your class starts and you might be on time. They are strict with enforcing parking rules, they give out $50 tickets for violations. If you live on campus you really don't need a car and would be better off without one unless you need it for work or something else."
College Sophomore,1,"The the diversity around kean university is mostly 2 solid backgrounds of ethnicity: black and white. Because of the even mix of students being black or white, there leaves no room for racism and such. In retrospect, there doesn't seem to be a major diversity in religions. Most are either catholic or have no religion at all. The sum of the lack of diversity unites the students in a way. It allows for more bonding because of students having more in common."
College Sophomore,1,There are some events going on but it's really a commuter campus so there isn't much to do on a weekly basis. There is a train station next to the campus so you can go to New York whenever you want
College Sophomore,1,They have computer labs that students may use however the computers and internet service move at the pace of a turtle. They have WiFi yet it never seems to work.
College Freshman,1,"This is a Division 3 school.  No one has school spirit because all of the teams basically suck.  Sports are not a big thing and the only thing good about homecoming is the concert.  Although we do have a wonderful gym, gorgeous fields and a very nice training room, no one cares about sports here."
College Junior,1,"The parking at Kean U. can be a pain but as soon as you have been going to this campus for a few weeks or so; you'll know what the high volume periods are for parking - be sure to be here earlier than that time. But despite what you may think, there is ALWAYS parking available. It might not be in the spot that you want, but there is a place for your car. We have parking on the main campus, at east campus, at the train station; if they gave us anymore parking then there would be not room for classrooms!"
College Sophomore,1,"I don't know too much about off campus housing, but when I was looking for an apartment the area around Kean is not the safest/nicest place to be in so I decided to commute to school. Surrounding areas include Elizabeth, Newark, Irvington etc. More of the urban areas."
College Sophomore,1,"it is so bad. The spots are tiny, there are never any spots and the tickets are out of control. It is a nightmare. I actually spent 45 minutes one day trying to find a spot"
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking is the worst element for Kean. Always plan to arrive at least 15 - 30 minutes early just to give yourself time to try and find a spot.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking can be miserable. So you have to leave very ,very early to find a space.....if you don't, you WILL be late for class."
College Junior,1,"Campus Life Is Smaller Than What People Think – Since Kean University is a majority commuting school majority of the people that you may see everyday in class, you do not see later or any other time other than class. which makes campus smaller than what we may think. relationships spread like mad-fire, and the guys are disgusting, females and well. majority of the people on campus are african american considering where the university is located."
College Junior,1,There is no way that they can stop more than half of campus. too many people on campus smoke marijuana.
College Junior,1,"Process Was a Pure Headache – i have no idea how anyone is suppose to get financial aid from Kean University. Instead of them giving scholarships, or financial aid they take more and more finances away from students/parents."
College Senior,1,Not Worth It – The dining experience is terrible.  Many students have become sick from the food and it is very unhealthy.  The one place on campus where the food isn't awful cost way too much and students can barely afford it.
College Senior,1,"Crowded, Not Enough Space, Selfish People – There are people who leave there car on campus, taking up parking spaces. The school should make more room for parking."
College Junior,1,"Better Luck Next Time – Parking on campus? Forget it. The minimal amount of spots that are available are tiny, and that's not the only problem. In some cases, you'll be driving down the lane and think you see an empty spot ahead only to find out once you get there that the guy who parked next to it pulled in too wide and was too lazy to fix his parking job, thus taking up two spots. There are simply not enough spaces nor lots to compensate for the amount of students."
College Student,1,"There is NO assigned parking for a university's whose students are mostly commuters, causing chaos in the parking lots. There is little availability in the morning and afternoon. You must arrive before 8am to park sans stress."
College Freshman,1,"Parking I must admit is pretty crazy. You have to come to school really early even If you don't have a class early just to park. Also, the Kean police are really strict on students waiting for one to mess up."

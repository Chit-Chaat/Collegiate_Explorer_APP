Freshman,5,Tennessee Tech offers many choices when it comes to your education and offers various resources to help you reach your goals.
Freshman,5,"Online classes at Tech are great, because the professors try really hard to accommodate for the needs of an online class, and are willing to help if you miss out."
Freshman,5,I have not taken any online classes with Tennessee Tech. If I have it would probably be great because they are an amazing school.
Freshman,5,"As an incoming freshman with special needs they were very helpful and made me feel like this was where I wanted to be. They helped walk me through orientation, schedule and set up with online due to the Covid pandemic. As a Fine Arts major they helped link me up with an advisor to help meet my needs."
Freshman,5,I am taking all of my classes online this semester. I live and take care of my grandparents and didn't want to risk bringing Covid back home after daily trips to campus. They could not have been more helpful in getting me up and running. As with everything there are bumps in the road but they walked me through it and I like how the programs are adapting in the time of uncertainty.
Alum,5,"Tennessee Tech was a great place to begin my education. With many opportunities to network, a nationally ranked business program, and the affordability of the school, Tennessee Tech should be considered by anyone exploring their undergraduate degree."
Freshman,5,"Tn. Tech is a very good school with a lot to offer its students. With a welcoming campus and a friendly faculty and staff, you know you will always get the education you need/desire!"
Freshman,5,Culture and community is amazing. Administration does everything in its power to ease the transition for incoming freshman.
Junior,5,I love the small campus. Nice and quiet. Not too much goes on there. Great education and nice people. I wish that there could be more diversity.
Freshman,5,"Other than choosing the close proximity to home, Tennessee Tech has, no doubt, some of the loveliest people you will meet. The faculty and staff are the nicest people, and everyone is so kind on campus. It is a wonderful environment to learn in. You can really tell that they care about your personal success."
Senior,5,"Tech felt like home from the beginning. The campus is very easy to navigate, staff is super helpful, and students were always very outgoing. Best choice ive ever made. Wings up!"
Sophomore,5,This was the college I have always wanted to go to. You get your money’s worth of education plus some. The professors will help you get the grade you want only if you put forth the effort. Tech faculty and staff are very friendly and will help you or try to find help for you. Even though we are an academic campus. We take pride in our sports teams. And LOVE to show support.
Alum,5,"I came to TN Tech from overseas because I got a good scholarship and didn't expect much, but I had a great time and learnt a lot! I definitely think it's a blue collar school that attracts more local, lower income students, but the engineering program is well known in the state/region and I learnt a lot while I was there. I was worried going to graduate school at a larger land grant university afterwards that I'd know less than other incoming students, but that was not the case at all. In the end, Tech's a great school to graduate with a solid degree for relatively cheap."
Niche User,5,The environment of the school is great. The people are friendly to get along with and they are extremely helpful when it comes to finding buildings around the school.
Alum,5,"It feels like a close community and has ""big city"" feels without it actually being big. The faculty actually care about your success and the campus is easy to navigate. Staff are super helpful about everything and you never feel lost. The town is a total college town with tons of activities, food, and a cute little downtown--just about every place has student discounts. The atmosphere of Tech is really happy and spirited all the time. I loved it and would recommend it to anyone who wants to get away and to get the vibes of living big without it actually being the case."
Freshman,5,Tech is a great place to call home. Everyone is so nice and helpful. I have really enjoyed my time at tech.
Freshman,5,"Tech is such an amazing school. I've been planning to go to tech since i started high school and when i finally got here,I was not disappointed.The grounds are beautiful and well kept with squirrels running round everywhere.The Professors are nice and work with me whenever to help me succeed.After class when i'm hungry,I can go to the cafeteria to get a nice buffet meal from many different options.After that,I can go to the beautiful libary to relax,catch up on schoolwork and curl up with a good book.I love being a college student at TTU."
Junior,5,I love the program I am in! The 2+2 is an easy way for me to get my bachelors without having to live and pay for on-campus requirements.
Alum,5,"If you invest in this place and the people here, you will not regret it.  Cookeville is a quaint college town, but I loved the time I spent at Tennessee Tech! It is a great school!"
Freshman,5,Campus is very diverse. Classes are very close together. You have a lot of resources to help you with academics. The campus offers you free tutoring which is very helpful.
Niche User,5,"I have a very positive opinion of Tennessee Technological University. Since I started my process of securing my future with them, they have held excellent communication with me. While touring their campus, they seemed very organized and were very friendly individuals. I am, overall, very pleased with them."
Sophomore,5,"I love Tennessee Tech! All of the professors are amazing, and the campus is beautiful. Overall, a wonderful place to get an education beyond high school. Tech yeah!"
Freshman,5,"I haven't been accepted to TN Tech yet, but I have been preparing myself self for my first day on the campus. So far from what I see, everything is amazing! The campus small but it's also large at the same time. In other words, you get the size of a big time university all while allowing a personal, more private experience. TN Tech also provides the number 1 education in TN for chemical engineers; along with having great nursing and health programs. The school is well rounded and everything a student could ask for. It's affordable, provides high quality education, and personal. The food is also amazing!!!"
Freshman,5,"I love Tennessee Tech, because the student body makes the transition from high school student to college student as smooth as possible. The college is also very responsive when it comes to returning emails and answering phones. Additionally, the campus is very safe and very social. Although there is not a traditional party scene, there are plenty of opportunities for students to reach out, make friends, and connect with a variety of people."
Sophomore,5,I loved everything about Tech. Meeting new people was a great part about transferring. I feel at home even being 1 hour away from my family. I couldn’t be happier being here at this campus.
Senior,5,Tennessee Tech is very student-oriented. All of the professors want to see their students succeed. There is a major for everyone and people can make friends here that last a long time. The campus is beautiful and renovations are being done to enhance the campus for current and future students.
Junior,5,"I like Tennessee tech because It feels like home to me . I leave for the weekends and I want to go back, not just for friends but for the scenery. This place has a lot of wild life there and they just come up too you ."
Sophomore,5,"So far so good! Campus is great and classes are small. The atmosphere on campus is incredible, especially compared to some of the other schools I have toured. As a student that lives on campus, it's very nice having everything so close. Nothing is more than a 10 minute walk from my dorm!"
Niche User,5,I very much enjoy the campus and all of the different majors offered here. The professors are friendly and the food on site is fantastic.
Freshman,5,I enjoy the size and style of the campus and particularly the opportunities for art classes at the Center for Craft in Smithville.
Junior,5,"I have been attending Tennessee tech for three years now and overall, it is a great school. The size is perfect for me and everything in Cookeville is five minutes away."
Freshman,5,Tennessee tech is an awesome place. The campus is beautiful and the people there are very friendly and nice.
Freshman,5,"Tennessee Technological University has many clubs to offer. My advice is to try and join as many activities on campus as you can. There are activities or events to do at least everyday on campus. The food is really good, and they have a  chick-fil-A! Tech has free tutoring which is very helpful. I would use it as much as possible if you’re struggling in a class! My dorm experience has been pretty good, I love my roommate. She is the nicest person and we get along really well. Tech also has many things to do in the town as well as many job opportunities. If you like nature there are many places you can go exploring or if you like waterfalls! I wouldn’t change anything because I love the University a lot."
Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere at Tech. It has the feel of a small college with most all of the benefits of a large public university.  Living on campus is an amazing experience because the food is always good and there's plenty of events or people to hang out with. The Cookeville community is also pretty safe and laid back. As someone who doesn't enjoy parties, this is perfect for me. All in all, it's a solid option to consider if you live in Tennesse and aren't entirely sure what you want to study."
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere on campus.  professors are always willing to help out no matter what.  everyone is super friendly and understanding with everything that you have going on in life.  I have yet to meet someone that just wasn't the best thing.  campus is very homey feeling and I always feel welcomed no matter where I am at on campus.
Senior,5,"I love TTU. The environment and dedication the staff take into making your college experience the best while also making sure you have all the tools and resources to be successful in your course of study. So many different organizations to be apart of that make it easy to meet new people, get yourself out there and figure out what is your calling."
Freshman,5,"There are a lot of thing to do around campus like hiking, canoeing, camping, and more. The physics department is extremely tough from what I have heard, and is best to just take it online or at a community college. General chemistry 1 isn't as bad as physicists, but it is still difficult unless you took chemistry in high school. Parking is a problem because of all the construction that has bee going on. 
So far, all of the professors that I had were fantastic. The advisers there are extremely helpful when scheduling for your classes and changing your major.
Over all, I think Tennessee Tech is awesome."
Freshman,5,"I love the campus, professors, and overall atmosphere. So happy that I chose Tech to my home! So fr, all of my professors are willing to work with me on any issues that I have. The dooms I live in are great! The food has its good and bad days but overall it is pretty good. I really didn't want to go to a big party school and tech is just that. It is more academic based and that's what I love about it."
Niche User,5,It has a wonderful campus that's pretty big but not too big. There's many different things to do on campus and the people are very nice
Sophomore,5,"The campus is smaller than UTK so you can walk to class with ease. There are also shuttle buses that run routes around campus so if the weather is bad, you won’t be caught out in it if you ride them. The library has 2 floors open to students: the ground floor which consists of a café, IT, printers, computers, and group or solitary study areas, and the “quiet floor” which consists of bookshelves, the i cube (a really cool technology center with 3D printers and VR tech), and tables to study at. The fitness center is really nice, and they’re building a new one. There is some construction as of right now, and the projects are in varying degrees of completion. For the most part, the professors make an effort to be friendly and learn your name, and they actually care about you. All in all, a great public university!"
Freshman,4,"I love the campus. The campus was clean, they are doing construction but it will look great after the construction is done. Everything is close and it all is safe."
Junior,4,"Classes are pretty good at Tennessee Tech, but there is not much going on in Cookeville. The cafeteria foods quality drops anear the 2nd half of each semester as well."
Sophomore,4,Tech is an awesome place to find a great community and get involved in different organizations. The professors want to see you succeed and will do whatever they can to help you.
Sophomore,4,"Due to changes in learning platforms, as a result from Covid-19, my classes had to be online in the Spring semester. The professors made the switch pretty smooth. For most of my classes, the professor would record him/herself teaching and have notes available to print out and follow the videos. Then he/she would have office hour zooms for those who wanted or needed more clarification."
Freshman,4,"Personally, I haven't taken any of their online courses, however, I have heard several good things about the experience."
Junior,4,"The campus is my favorite part about Tennessee Tech. It is relatively flat and beautiful year-round, making it an easy place to walk from class to class. The teachers and staff are for the most part great, but of course there are a few bad ones out there. You can tell the staff care about their job and the students. The food is a bit expensive, but that is something common to every college I think."
Sophomore,4,I would like to see Tennessee Technological University become more diverse in terms of student attendance.
Freshman,4,It applied to my major. It was cheap for me to go to because I am a resident of Tennessee. It is close to my home. There are a lot of engineer majors.
Niche User,4,Tech has an amazing campus and the programs are very diverse. I spent a week there over the summer and it was great.
Niche User,4,This is Very wonder place. It is full of great people and has a great atmosphere. it is not to big and not to small. Everything is in walking distance. The food and cafeteria is one of the best i have seen.  They have a great sports program and tons of clubs free to join in. It is a great place to go to further your education and make friends.
Sophomore,4,"Tennessee Technological University gave me my home away from home. Regardless of the small town, Tech provides you with plenty of opportunities not only to meet people but to be able to meet people and interest yourself in something you love to do. I came to Cookeville, TN only knowing one person in the entire county. Now, I have a group of loving friends who push me to do my best."
Junior,4,"The campus is small which makes it easy to move around. Once you know all of the buildings and where they are, it takes no time for people to get to their classes."
Sophomore,4,"Amazing university with great and caring professors. Awesome nursing, engineering, and STEM programs. Parking is crazy, and the activities in the local area are minimal. Overall, it is a great school to attend if you are mainly looking for a great education and an awesome student atmosphere."
Junior,4,"The school's atmosphere is overall a positive one. Tennessee Tech cares about their student's achievement and success. The professors are kind, caring, and helpful. The staff at Tennessee Tech are nice as well. I am currently attending Tennessee Tech and am loving it so far. The few times that I have been to the campus, its appearance was very nice and clean. The people that I encountered there were very nice. When you ask the professors or advisors for help on an issue/inquiry, they are very helpful and try to help in the best way they can. Overall, I am enjoying my experience at Tennessee Technological University."
Niche User,4,All in all a very great looking school. I would really like to be able to attend there. I really enjoyed the food and the setting. Cookeville has always felt like home to me and the people at Tennessee Tech were so nice. I have a long line of family who have went to Tennessee Tech and have achieved so many goals.
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at TN Tech majoring in business. When I was at SOAR their orientation program, they were very helpful and very interactive with the students and parents. They wanted every parent to know what was available to their students and what their goal was. Tech prioritizes student's safety, health, and any other of their needs. The campus is kind of hard to navigate around because all of the buildings look the same until you get used to it and can recognize buildings. Every professor wants all of their students to pass and will help the student if they need help. However, some professors don't want to help the students which may make it difficult to pass the course. Due to this when you make your schedule use RateMyProfessor to choose the best professors that are willing to help students pass their course. Overall it is a wonderful school and you won't regret attending here."
Freshman,4,"Beautiful campus, friendly faculty and staff. Made lots of friends! Focused on truly helping students unlike a bigger university."
Senior,4,"I loved everything about it. The way the buildings were set up, the classes, it has honestly been one of my favorite colleges I have ever been too."
Junior,4,"I started out in the computer science program for my freshman year, and there it seemed outdated in what they are teaching. What they teach initially for the first two years is content that most employers I talked to and people who worked in the field didn't care about, except the government. Which makes sense for them to teach that because they have a ton of grants with the government so they teach what the government will want their employees to know. Now though I am within the accounting program and I absolutely love it. There is so much support from teachers and administration, they really want all of their students to succeed."
Alum,4,"Tech is well respected for every ""real"" major offered. Its College of Engineering is especially well regarded. For example, I heard from a reputable source that Tech's computer science program is as difficult as more ""typical"" high-quality universities', such as MIT's. Most of Tech's professors are both incredibly qualified and incredibly kind. I was grateful to receive a full-ride service scholarship, and I thoroughly enjoyed and gained many skills from my work assignment (tutoring). One of Tech's offerings that I do not recommend, though, is the Honors Program. It is quite disorganized, some of the faculty are condescending, and Honors requirements often conflict with graduation requirements. Speaking specifically for the computer science program (since that was may major and its enrollment is growing quickly), it seems to be more or less a pipeline into software engineering or maybe IT security; it is not geared toward mathematically inclined students."
Senior,4,Plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus. Great atmosphere and great programs. The food is lacking especially the cafeteria. Excellent college for the price.
Junior,4,"I really like Tennessee Tech's affordability for the students. My roommates and I are very grateful for the price our education is offered for. Other colleges  would have taken us hundreds of thousands of dollars into debt. I also really appreciate the professors in the music department for their great teaching methods. However, Tennessee Tech could use a lot of work when it comes to the  funding of smaller departments. The engineering department receives a lot of funding, as do the science and nursing departments, but the music and art departments are terribly underfunded. I work on stage crew, and a lot of the equipment we use like lecterns, risers, and microphone cables are usually broken. The instruments we have to rent out to students are incredibly sub par. Students from Tech have gone on to become music directors and symphony players across the state and around the country, but the funding often limits what we can do. That is why Tennessee Tech only gets 4 stars from me."
Alum,4,"Lots of major options, tons of teachers, great location for hiking and camping, bike friendly, decent student hangouts, and awesome student programs."
Sophomore,4,"I am very pleased with my experience with Tennessee Tech! For me personally, the classes and professors have been pretty good, along with the extracurriculars and student life on campus. If I had to change one thing about Tech, I may say something regarding all the construction on and around campus. As nice as everything looks when its complete, it seems like the construction is never-ending."
Sophomore,4,"What I was really surprised about attending Tennessee Tech coming from a rural town is the variety of college activities and people. The campus is open and easy to approach, reeling you in with how everything is only a short walk away while not being crowded and cluttered. The campus is also vary well maintained, with groundskeepers working around the clock to provide comfortable areas to gather outside. 

At Tennessee Tech they put an emphasis on community by pushing dorm residents to know each other and to associate with the various student organizations. From my personal experience, teachers do their best to deliver lessons in both clear and entertaining ways."
Sophomore,4,I love campus life. And almost every teacher will try and help you as much as they can they do care and want to see you succeed.
Sophomore,4,"The school is very nice, but as for the town around it, there isn't much to do unless you have to means to travel around. It's very easy to make friends and hang out with people because its like we're all one big community."
Alum,4,"I went to Tech for 2 years and it was a great experience. I am only transferring because I have to, but I wish I could stay at TTU instead. It is a great school with a beautiful campus, great professors, and Cookeville is a great town."
Sophomore,4,Very decent class sizes. Accessible staff and instructors. Very nice and friendly campus.  Many social events and outreaches for the student body
Sophomore,4,"The school is a very good school. It has plenty of clubs and activities to help students feel like they are connected and not isolated from others. However, I feel like there was no easing me into college. I feel like the second I got there they expected me to have the same knowledge and experience as a senior who's about to graduate. Other then that the school is fantastic though."
Junior,4,The atmosphere overall is wonderful. The school is small so there isn’t much to do other than be focused on your schooling. Some departments are definitely seen as more important than others which is a disappointment.
Freshman,4,"The University was able to help me find my passion, and help me to make my dreams a reality. The staff are very helpful and understanding, and their means of connecting to the potential students make them feel like a family. Tech is small enough that you won't feel like just a number; however, it is big enough that you won't be surrounded by the same people all the time, allowing for students to make new connections."
Junior,4,"The courses are structured to be attainable for all students, but the professors expect the students to work to pass the class. If the student does not put effort into learning the material then their grade will reflect that. The staff are very willing to help struggling students and the tutoring center is a wonderful resource."
Freshman,4,"Tennessee Tech is a great combination of the benefits of a large campus with the small town campus feel. There are a variety of on-campus dining options and good ways to pay for various restaurants. Living on campus makes being a students easy to access classes and meet new people. There are also a lot of options for places to study in a quiet or louder environment, with others or alone!"
Senior,4,Internet service at most of the campus are nice and location is very good. The professors is really good but hard too. Even there is several different options of food. And staff are helpful but if one is transfer student don't agree for classess for advisor. Scholarship is hard to receive and if one miss in December not able to receive aid for a year. For transfer student financial aid is hard if once miss never going to receive again.
Freshman,4,I like the small town environment.  The professors have the opportunity to spend time with students individually if needed.  I would like to see more housing facilities for couples.
Sophomore,4,Tennessee Tech is very invested in its academics. There are always students willing to go above and beyond to provide fun opportunities for each other in between classes.
Niche User,4,I went on a college visit there last week. They were very helpful and I'm very excited to possibly enroll there next fall.
Junior,4,my experience at TTU has been positive.  My classes have been challenging and meaningful.  My professors have been knowledgeable and supportive.  I would recommend TTU to my family and friends.
Sophomore,4,"Tennessee Tech has the potential to be a great college, however with the constant construction happening around campus it is a huge distraction when trying to study for classes."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at TTU has been very successful this 2017-2018 year. I am currently involved in my organizations on campus such as the following: R.A.C.E ( Reaching Achievement and Committing to Excellence), N.S.B.E, and NAACP.  In addition, I am an active participant in most activities like intramural sports and college games. I had a great relationship with my professors and dorm neighbors. Most of all, both semesters were vivid and smooth."
Freshman,4,"Tennessee Tech is located in Cookeville, Tennessee. It is a great community and it is centered around the college students which for me is a plus. Many of the local businesses cater to the college students. Overall Tech is a great school and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a small to medium sized college."
Junior,4,"The school has been a stepping stone and a ""jumping off"" point for my future career. I have been able to take lessons that I have learned in lectures and use them in everyday applications for my future career."
Alum,4,"Tech is a smaller sized college but growing quickly, most of the classes are still small and they have a high standard for education."
Freshman,4,The school is very good to focus on your craft and workout at. There are not a lot of things to do so you can find your self with a lot of time. So use your time wisely.
Sophomore,4,"I really liked that Tennessee Tech was right in my hometown. It is affordable, especially as far as universities go, and there were plenty of opportunities available to students. There are all kinds of things going on on campus at all times and plenty of opportunities to be involved in your school and community. There are many ways to get new students plugged into campus life and most of the professors are very caring and easy to work with."
Freshman,4,"Not only is the college cheap compared to other schools, it has an amazing student body. The professors and students all differ widely and generally have a fantastic vibe and the campus itself is fine for the cheap price. This is a cost management school, the most bang out of your buck."
Sophomore,4,"The nice part about Tennessee Tech is that they are undergoing improvements campus wide. Now this is good but also bad, this means that right now the campus isn't perfectly made yet. Along with the noise of construction and closed off parts of parking. But this also gives us the idea that the campus will be better once the construction is finished."
Freshman,4,"I love the school, It is not as diverse as I am accustomed to, but the student atmosphere is very friendly. There are lots of on campus student groups to get involved with, so you should never be bored. If you are interested in the party scene, this is not the campus for you. The town is small but the people are friendly. Knoxville and Louisville are only about an hour away, so that is good for a quick up & back big city adventure."
Niche User,4,I love the food and people. All students are friendly and willing to help. The campus is clean and very beautiful along with the city its surrounded by. There are many activities to participate in while going to Tennessee Technological University.
Freshman,4,"Trash chutes should be installed in dorms, more water pressure out of shower heads, and ping pong tables in every dorm lobby"
Sophomore,4,"TTU is a great overall college.  It is perfectly centered between Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville. Cookeville in its own self is a perfectly sized city. It is just big enough for there to be everything you need plus some options, but also not so enormous that it's impossible to navigate. There is a large selection of professors to choose from and all with their own degrees of experience and knowledge. There are plenty of activities to do, especially with there being clubs for every major and several Greek life opportunities. The campus is beautiful and has plenty of area to relax and study without being bombarded with people. The campus is extremely safe. The University Police are always at most 5 minutes away. The food on campus is fairly average. The only things that I would change is to add more food options and more things to do on the weekend on campus. Campus tends to be empty on the weekends due to students heading home."
Freshman,4,The university has an excellent atmosphere and very good professors.  All of the staff I've encountered this far has gone out of their way to make sure all their students have everything they need to ensure success
Senior,4,"Tennessee Tech offered very affordable tuition rates, as well as state-of-the-art facilities that resulted in an excellent learning conducive environment.  Placed in the heart of the Upper Cumberland of Tennessee, TTU has everything a college student could possibly need for a memorable college experience.  As a STEM major, I had many opportunities to participate in research and even had the privilege to be a teaching assistant."
Senior,4,"Tennessee Tech was an excellent school to get my Bachelor's at. Even though it is a Technological University, the English Department is filled with interesting and devoted professors. The program is difficult, but extremely rewarding. You are provided with a diverse education. However, the selection of classes has been subpar in recent years, and there are a few professors who truly do not belong in the department any more. Outdated teaching methods and archaic forms of grading contribute to this. The meal plans and campus life are extremely affordable and convenient, and it is very easy to get involved. Parking is, however, trash. Construction is annoying. But over all, it's a great school."
Freshman,4,"TTU is a very student run campus where the students have the freedom to decide many things and give input on many of the issues that they are inclined on, but their is almost no party life here very horrible social atmosphere for students to explore and experiment with and learn more about themselves."
Sophomore,4,Tennessee Tech university has a lot of diversity that not most colleges have. They also have a lot of amazing teachers that are willing to work with you if you are willing to work with them.
Alum,4,"My experience at Tennessee Tech was mostly positive. I enjoyed my time, learned a great deal about my field, and made friends to last a lifetime. The area was great for me, as I love the outdoors."
Freshman,4,"The Tennessee Tech campus is laid- back, and you feel as if you are right at home! Each of the offices seem to offer student positions to help cover tuition, it is unlike any other campus I've visited."
Sophomore,4,"I love Tennessee Technological University! There was always something to do and the staff is nice. I would like for more food options and less construction, but overall I love Tech!"
Alum,2,"You do most of the teaching yourself. Spent 5 years here and cost me $88k. Did not get a good experience and literally learned nothing. I’ve learned more in my first 3 months with my job than I did here. Food is not very good and definitely over priced for what you get. Parking is terrible. Dorms were okay, but you’re better off living off campus. Administration is 3/10 and very unorganized and seem very impatient when confronting issues. Cafe staff is rude EXCEPT MS. JANICE. I was mislead by my M.E.T. dept. and ended up taking 18 credits that were wasted due to bad advising, and yes I was on top of everything. I had to take classes off campus at CHEC and the surcharge is ridiculous considering it’s not even Tech campus.  Nothing to do around campus and that’s coming from an introvert. They only care about grad rates which are horribly low as is. I loved the people I met, but staff is mostly rude and President Oldham is not personable or approachable considering his title."
Junior,2,This schools is very over rated. Most of my professors have been less than helpful and most of the learning is done on your own outside of the classroom. The schools is currently very overpriced for what you get likely because they are doing noisy and disruptive construction on every corner and using increased tuition to pay for it. The dorms and the cafeteria are both sub par and make living on campus less than ideal.
Freshman,2,"This school's whole purpose is to churn out engineering degrees. It doesn't offer very good programs for anything else. The food is average, at least there's a Chick-Fil-A on campus and plenty of other restaurants. The town is quaint and nice, but kind of dull with not much to do. There isn't much diversity, mainly white males. The professors I've had haven't been very helpful, sometimes completely ignoring my emails and my requests for help. The administration side of things is either incompetent or uncaring. I've missed out on certain important things because they neglected to send me an email, and when I tried to change majors and switch roommates I was met with a ton of seemingly unnecessary roadblocks and no one to help me. Overall, my experience has been poor, however if you are low income and have an interest in the STEM majors, this school should be serviceable for you. Just don't expect a great social life or fun times out on the town."
College Sophomore,2,My high school football team was better than Tech's team.
College Junior,2,I hate working with the financial aid department!
College Freshman,2,Average dorms for way too much money. Cheaper to live off campus.
College Freshman,2,"Varsity sports suck major butt. However intramurals are quite vibrant, esp. flag football."
College Freshman,2,Our teams aren't very good.
College Freshman,2,The financial aid people were hard to work with.
College Sophomore,2,My LEAST favorite thing about tech is the athletic department.  I want so badly to go to a school that loves going to sporting events and tailgates and looks forward to games.  You will not find any of that at tech.  The only fun game is homecoming football.  Maybe (hopefully) this will change soon.  The department is starting a tailgating competition to get more involvement at games and hopefully that changes things over the coming years.  We'll see! intramural games are fun though!
College Sophomore,2,This is a review for IF you do not get into the new halls.  The New Halls are spectacular and similar to a small new hotel room.  I don't see how in the world Tech finds it fair to only have two new halls and the rest complete crap holes… but thats the way things are.  As for the non new hall dorms they all suck pretty bad.  I had to get switched out after one semester because of how sick I was constantly.  We tried putting dehumidifiers in my room and it didn't help.  I could barely sleep between coughs some nights.  If all dorms were renovated to New Hall quality they would get an A++++++++++.
College Freshman,2,We don't have great athletic teams
College Sophomore,2,no on or off campus needed for this school.
College Sophomore,2,all the extra cost i almost did not get back enouph to travel to school
College Junior,2,Well as a STEM school focusing on engineering the guy/girl ratio isn't ideal (as a guy) and there being so many engineering majors the looks aren't exactaly top notch either.
College Senior,2,The town is too small. There aren't too many local events that meet my tastes. I don't think I'd consider it the safest town. Meth is a huge problem and I'm constantly getting text and email alerts about assault issues on campus. Sports and recreation are available off campus if you can afford monthly/class fees. Shopping is limited because there is hardly anyone in town when school is out of session at TTU.
College Senior,2,"My major is horribly hard at this university.  You learn a lot from the professors, but there is apparent favoritism.  Also many of the assignments seem to be busy work and do not fit in with Special Education curriculum.  The work and grading are hard and sometime very unfair based on the person."
College Senior,2,The dorms suck! Need improving. Close to class though
College Freshman,2,"You walk, ride your bike, or drive yourself."
College Freshman,2,The FA office is a nightmare sometimes.
College Student,2,"Cookeville is a beautiful campus, along with all the surrounding national parks. During the day there are plenty of things to do."
College Freshman,2,Not a large amount of African Americans.
College Freshman,2,only frat houses and one country bumpkin bar in town.
College Freshman,2,Come of my etchers don't even know what my major is.
College Freshman,2,I have a great ACT score and a 4.0 and I do not have any money from the school. It is all outside scholarship. I struggle with the financial aid office every semester to get my money.
College Freshman,2,No one really goes to games and the gym doesn't have near enough equipment
College Freshman,2,Very cold temperatures. Weather changes frequently
College Freshman,2,"There's just not enough options, and most of it is just fast food."
College Freshman,2,"Nothing sets the university apart from any other necessarily. There are a lot of clubs, but they are all centered around the normal."
College Sophomore,2,police give parking tickets out like candy on Halloween 
College Sophomore,2,not the best. there is mold everywhere and the rooms can be small
College Sophomore,2,"There is parking at every residence hall, behind the UC, behind the library, and in front of the fitness center (also behind football stadium).  Yes it seems like a lot but with so many commuters, finding a parking spot in the morning is pretty bad.  In the afternoon it gets better.  I have only known someone to get a parking ticket if they parked in the 30 min parking lot behind the UC and the fee was $25 for first offense.  "
College Junior,2,The only thing that helps some students when it comes to transportation is the taxis. 
College Senior,2,I live in Livingston. I do not park there because I am just a Senior. Haha.
College Junior,2,"The restaurants are average in cost. Most give a 10% discount, but there isn't a diverse variety of restaurants. The food in most of them isn't that great. There are lots of fast food restaurants in the area, but few within walking distance. Cookeville is not a pedestrian-friendly city."
College Junior,2,"Be wary of what major you choose hear. They have the top education for engineering fields and Computer Science majors are really well off. The Physics department is atrocious and to be avoided - there is a huge grading curve of passing with a 30% last I've heard - lowering the bar to increase rates of success is not acceptable. The problem needs to be dealt with in more intelligent manner, like splitting up the insane amount of material into several courses if necessary. Music majors better expect to be very busy with concerts and practice. Math majors will have some difficult courses to cover, but if you have the right teacher and mindset you will prevail. I don't know much about the other majors so I can't speak on them."
College Junior,2,It seems to rain at least once a week. I know my freshman year it almost rained every Thursday my first semester.
College Sophomore,2,The dorm room I had needed painting badly and a broken window blind.
College Junior,2,"Parking on campus can be a battle, especially during the day for commuters. However, they are developing a plan to build two parking garages on campus to remedy the situation."
College Freshman,2,"Cookeville is a nice, quaint town with some places to go, yet it still retains the countryside demeanor. The safety is much higher and more sufficient than in urban areas, although there are places such as ""The Murder Mart"", a gas station where some people got killed. We have plenty of religious affiliations. We have immense options of places to eat in town, and we do have sports and a couple of shops."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is available at TTU, but it is not displayed in an outreaching manner to the students on campus. There are rarely any parties heard of on campus, and most members of the Greek life keep to themselves about their groups, although they are polite and cheerful when asked about their group."
College Sophomore,2,"If you live on campus then generally you will always have a parking spot.  However, if you live off campus, parking spots are very limited and extremely hard to find.  Do not plan to wake up fifteen minutes before your class starts, hop in your car, drive to campus, and find a parking spot because this just will not happen.  Be sure to arrive on campus thirty minutes to an hour early to find a commuter parking spot.  Commuter and visitor parking is horrible at this campus."
College Freshman,2,"The weather in Cookeville is terribly unpredictable.  It could be 70 degrees and sunny one day and snowing the next.  The storms get out-of-hand quite often and it has flooded the area, however classes are never cancelled.  Once there was a tornado warning at 4:30 AM and we were awakened from sleep and asked to go down to the basement of our dorm for about an hour.. Class wasn't even delayed."
College Freshman,2,"Our teams are really good, but the problem is actually getting people got to the games unforunately."
College Freshman,2,"One day it is warm and sunny, the next it is pouring down rain and freezing cold. HAVE RAIN BOOTS & AN UMBRELLA."
College Freshman,2,"Pretty decent you have options so they are not just the samethings. the perch, the grill are most likely your best options though, the cafe sucks!"
College Freshman,2,"We are very close to a hospital, which is nice, but they will not dispatch an ambulance because of our proximity. Which is unfortunate if you find yourself incapacitated."
College Freshman,2,"I Am Still Waiting – I haven't been able to confirm my attendance yet because I am waiting on student loans to come through. Therefore, I don't have the funds to purchase my books either. Schools starts today and I don't have any textbooks."
College Freshman,2,Greek life isn't a very important part of your social status at all.
College Student,2,"Could Be Better – upon visiting the school, i loved everything about except that it had a lot of white people and not that much black people. sometimes i would prefer to see some of my color a once and a while."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a Lot to Do – Aside from the usual frat parties and going to Spankies or one of the other clubs, there isn't a lot to do at night on campus. There is the occasional activity at night that allows people to hang out with others, but that's about it."
Recent Alumnus,2,Classes Are Overloaded. It is very difficult to register for needed classes in every semester.  The majority of the professors are hard to contact for assistance when needed.
College Junior,2, If you need to get something printed off in a hurry you might as well forget it.  There just aren't enough computers to accommodate all the users.  They just set it up recently where engineers can connect remotely to a desktop from their laptop to access MathCAD and other expensive programs and while it still has its bugs it's very useful and convenient.
College Junior,2,"Very Little – There is not a huge night life in Cookeville, TN. Im not a huge partier at all but I can tell when there's nothing to do. The one club we have is eh. We have plenty of bars some places with good drink prices (crawdaddy's) and places with bad drink prices (Bilmar.)"
College Sophomore,2,"We have recently had our windows in all of the computers in the library updated.  However, the printers are constantly down and occasional problems with internet gives me a headache."
College Freshman,2,have to leave earlier to make sure u have parking.
College Sophomore,2,"Rain Rain GO Away – Rain or shine or a crazy snow storm, everyone is expected to attend class, outdoor activities are either cancelled or brought inside, and we put on our snow boots and trail on to class."
College Student,2,"Everyone has their own computers, but you have to hook up to the school's internet. It's slow, and a really big hassle to deal with, and for whatever reason it crashes constantly and can be out for days at a time. The campus computers aren't much better."
College Sophomore,2,I Wouldnt Know – Im not 21 yet so i couldnt tell you what the nightlife is like.
College Sophomore,2,Same Ol Same Ol – Their food is not the best but if you had to eat it i guess you wouldnt die.
Senior,1,I did not Take any online classes. I did not Take any online classes. I did not Take any online classes. I did not Take any online classes. I did not Take any online classes.
Senior,1,"Get ready to fork over all the money you thought you would save from cheap tuition. Tuition goes up and up, yet facilities and teachers are horrible."
College Sophomore,1,Not a fan of those kind of people.
College Freshman,1,don't even think they exist
College Freshman,1,It's awful. Absolutely nothing to do at all if you don't like Bob's.
College Sophomore,1,none that i no of.
College Junior,1,I don't get financial aid but my paperwork has been screwed up at least 7 times in my two years at TTU so I can't imagine the process for long drawn out forms.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I dont party, so I dont know"
College Freshman,1,Parking is always a hassle.
College Sophomore,1,"I have not gotten any aid from this school.  The only scholarship this school has given me was the Tennessee Hope Scholarship which almost everyone gets just for being from TN and going to a TN school, actually the state gave it to me (thank you so much!).  3.0 GPA, 28 ACT and work hours (for the school) could possibly get you $3000 or $4000.  "
College Junior,1,"It was an absolute hassle, but I did receive some aid. "
College Junior,1,There is not enough parking spots for all the students at tech.
College Junior,1,"There is a decent variety, but much of the food is rather bland and the good food isn't the healthiest. The buffet is mediocre, and the pizza and burger place is overpriced. The campus stores are ridiculously overpriced and many of the items can be bought cheaper elsewhere. Meal plans are required the first 2 years so you can't opt out."
College Junior,1,"The parking is atrocious. There are seldom enough spots-the lot isn't nearly large for the number of students there. If you live in the dorms, it will be difficult to find parking close by unless it is a Friday afternoon or Saturday. Give yourself plenty of time to get there early."
College Freshman,1,"This school has people of many different races and religions, but it is still a small part of the student body. I feel very out of place at the school due to its inadequate amount of diversity. As a Pacific Islander-American, I was hoping to find more people like me, but I was disappointed. Although, we do have several different churches, so that is nice."
College Sophomore,1,Parking is hard to get sometimes and there is no system for students
College Sophomore,1,Computers in the library are fine but the Internet in the dorms are very unpredictable.
College Sophomore,1,"Tech doesn't offer many night time options often. There might be at-home sports, special concerts, or guest speakers, but not plentiful enough to make things interesting. Many food places close early on Friday and Saturdays and it kind of dies on the weekend."
College Freshman,1,Most people will agree that there seems to not be enough parking.
Recent Alumnus,1,Tech parking is horrible; probably the most hidious feature of the school!

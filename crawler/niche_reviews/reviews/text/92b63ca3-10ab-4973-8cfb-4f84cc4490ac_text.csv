Niche User,5,Based on my tour guide and admissions counsel say I was very impressed with all the options the school had to offer.
Niche User,5,I loved the campus and the surrounding area. The tour guide and admissions office was friendly and more than willing to answer any and all questions I had. They also have my intended major and certifications I would like to receive.
Freshman,5,"The moment I walked onto the Elizabethtown  College campus, it felt like my second home.  I wanted a place where I felt like I had a second family.  From the admissions to the staff and most importantly the Coach Amy-I knew this would be where my adulthood would begin.  Safety was of the highest priority for myself and my parents.  And I know that once I step foot on this campus, I will be in good hands."
Sophomore,5,"Elizabethtown College is unlike many other colleges because, since it is so small, you know everyone on campus basically. You really become a family on this campus and if I had to choose again, I would pick Elizabethtown College every time."
Works Here,5,"Elizabethtown faculty are nationally recognized experts in their fields with strong publication records, but are dedicated to student learning.  Students are eager to learn and seek opportunities for growth."
Alum,5,"Attending Elizabethtown College was my greatest decision. They are well-known for their Business, Engineering, OT, Biology, and Biochem departments. While at Etown I had the opportunity to play a DIII sport, seek help from professors to succeed in class, serve as a tour guide and tutor, and engage in Christian fellowship on campus. All I would change is to update on-campus housing, which Etown is working on anyway over the next few years!"
Sophomore,5,I like Elizabethtown College because there is so many things for students to do around campus. This college also has professors that want to work with you and you get to know your professors personally because of being able to work with them.
Freshman,5,"Overall the college is wonderful, the campus is beautiful, they are working on fixing up the existing dorms, the food is great, and the professors actually care about their individual students!"
Freshman,5,E-town has been amazing for me! It had the program that I wanted (OT) and has such a warm and welcoming environment! Everyone is friendly and willing to help.
Niche User,5,I just visited Etown and fell in love with it: no other college compares to the cleanliness and organization at Elizabethtown. I am very excited to make another visit and hopefully play on the school team. I met the coaching staff and everyone there is just so hospitable and informative
Freshman,5,"I love it here at Elizabethtown. A great campus and community. Small, but not tiny. Quaint and comfortable. Their Education Department is amazing, sending students out for field work nearly every semester to gain valuable experience."
Freshman,5,great college ....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Junior,5,Most professors are more than willing to take the time to help you learn. I have been able to talk to them about my college and personal life. They have be willing to listen and give advice when I asked.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love it here!! I can't imagine myself going anywhere else. The community is so welcoming and friendly. It is truly amazing to feel like a group of strangers is your family. Truly an amazing school. I could go on endlessly about how much I love it!!
Freshman,5,"I love Elizabethtown College. Everything from the food to the students to the classes is perfect for me! The cafe is open all day, the students are friendly and open, and there are many course options with great professors. There are also many clubs and opportunities on campus too. "
College Junior,5,As a social work major I have been on the field since freshman year. This fall will be my junior year and I have my first internship I will be working with. 96% of our students will have a job or be in graduate school at least 6 months after graduating from Elizabethtown College. I know 3 of my friend were Music Education majors and they had their jobs lined up before they even graduated.
College Junior,5,"We have a ratio of 11:1, an average class size of about 16 students, we also cap our classes at 35 students. Which is amazing! We have an open door policy here at Elizabethtown College and it has been one of the greatest things I think we have here at Etown. Now our professors here and all of our students will say that Elizabethtown has a different feeling from the many other smaller, private schools around the USA. Elizabethtown College is so inviting and you are a not a number here."
College Junior,5,"Elizabethtown College is a phenomenal college and the students, staff, and faculty are the ones keeping the college safe. Of all the schools I looked at, Elizabethtown College was the safest and most inviting of all the colleges. I walk around on and off campus with my over the ear headphones and I even lost my phone freshman year. I got my phone back the same day I had lost it because a student here brought it to me."
College Junior,5,"We're located in Lancaster county and we're affiliated with the Church of the Brethren. With that said, Etown campus is one of the safest and most convenient schools I looked at. We guarantee housing for all four years and we have 8 different housing options for our traditional students here. Within those 8, 6 of them are dorms and or housing has tons of Liberal Learning Communities in them. We do not have any particular freshman dorm, and I as a student absolutely love our dorms."
College Junior,5,Etown has about 1800 students and the professors are always so ready to try and make their students even better! I would choose Etown over any other school time and time again. The Office of Student Activities is also great and keeps students busy during the school year and makes the school year exciting!
College Freshman,5,You get very close to everyone in your building.  All of the buildings are coed so that is nice.
College Freshman,5,During my tours and overnight visits I found that I love the way things work there.
College Senior,5,"Freshman year, all incoming students are required to sign a pledge of integrity. Campus theft was at 0% my freshman and sophomore years, showing that everyone takes this extremely seriously. I have never felt unsafe on campus or in the surrounding area and feel comfortable going for runs by myself, even after dark."
College Senior,5,"Most class sizes are very small, so your teachers get to know you as an individual and are always available to help you. Teachers provide real life examples and experiences that go beyond simply learning from a textbook"
College Senior,5,"Elizabethtown College is a friendly atmosphere with great academics that are reinforced outside of the classroom according to our ""Educate for Service"" motto. I've never had a teacher who wasn't readily available to offer help when I needed it. It's a small school in a small community, but there is plenty to do if you are willing to drive 20-30 minutes."
College Freshman,5,"Overall, Elizabethtown is a very safe campus. I have never felt afraid to walk by myself outside, even at night, although I do make sure to pay attention to my surroundings. Incidents with sexual assault, alcohol, and other offenses do occur from time to time, but Security always keeps everyone up to date and I think there is much less of an issue here than at many other campuses. Most everyone, even the students, make it a point to encourage safe habits here."
College Freshman,5,"For the most part I have enjoyed my classes. Some have been more stressful than others and I have liked some professors more than others, but overall everyone is very accommodating and all professors have been willing to work with anyone who is having trouble. The classes are generally engaging and sometimes even fun, and everyone gets individualized attention."
College Freshman,5,"As a person who dreaded college, I am happy to say that I am very satisfied by the time I have spent at Elizabethtown so far. The work becomes stressful at times and there are challenges, but everyone is so kind and eager to to of service, including both students and faculty. Classes are mostly engaging; I have learned quite a lot in the last few months, both academically and in the realm of life experience. It has brought me out of my shell and encouraged me to communicate with people.  Never have I felt unsafe on campus or in my dorm. Overall, it is just a friendly, beautiful community with much to offer. It may be a pricey school, but it is difficult to find a place that gives so much thought to student safety and comfort. I think it will definitely be worth it in the end."
College Freshman,5,I love the overall feel of the campus. I feel very safe here.
College Sophomore,5,One of my favorite experiences is the Thanksgiving Dinner. It represents the family-like atmosphere at Etown. What makes our school unique is how courteous everyone is towards each other and the fact that our campus smells like chocolate sometimes. I would choose this school all over again because I love the campus and the town itself is adorable!
College Sophomore,5,"Elizabethtown College takes a serious interest in the health and safety of their students. Counseling services are available for free to all full time students, as well as pastoral counseling. While sexual assaults do occasionally happen, alcohol nearly always plays a role, and the school handles the situation appropriately, including providing endless resources to the victim. The school also takes various measures to prevent assaults from occurring, including seminars on sexual assault during orientation. Also, The Well is a great place for student health and wellness. They give away free condoms, cold medicine, cough drops, aspirin and more. They also measure weight, BMI, and can give health and nutrition advice. We also have a Hershey Med drop-in clinic just a block away from campus for student access during the day."
College Sophomore,5,"People usually have no problem getting a job after graduating from Elizabethtown. Employers value that Elizabethtown graduates are friendly, good at communicating, and well-educated in their field. They know that Elizabethtown gives students a quality education that prepares them for the real world, and trust in the value of a degree from our school. Career Services at Elizabethtown is extremely helpful to anyone who needs the assistance. They'll help you with mock interviews, finding internships, writing a resume, building an online profile, and more. There are always career/internship fairs on campus that are looking to recruit students."
College Sophomore,5,"My experience academically at Elizabethtown College has been nothing but positive. The professors are all great, especially in the Education Department. They all take a personal interest in your success and will go out of their way to help you. The classes are at an appropriate difficulty level and you definitely get your money's worth academically."
College Freshman,5,Campus security is very good and cares a lot for the students
College Freshman,5,I loved the Thanksgiving dinner and tree lighting and all of the events
College Sophomore,5,I wouldn't change it for the world
College Senior,5,I absolutely love my department. The business department is amazing and my professors really know who I am. I am dissapointed in some of the things the college itself has done.
College Freshman,5,It's a pretty great school with this. Most people can just ask others to turn their music down and not get security involved. We have different levels of security so you don't have to get penalties against you.
College Freshman,5,"Because I live in a dorm with almost all freshmen, almost everyone talks to each other. So while my dorm is amazing, many other dorms don't have the luxury of knowing their next door neighbors."
College Freshman,5,"I love attending Elizabethtown College. The Professors are the best, and you will get the one on one attention you need. The Professors offer reasonable office hours and will welcome you to see them during the office hours. The class sizes are small compared to other colleges, and it is very beneficial. The campus atmosphere is very accepting and friendly."
College Freshman,5,"I love the one on one attention you get with the smaller class sizes. The CORE program can be a pain, but it can provide you with a variety of knowledge that will help you with other classes and/or your major."
College Freshman,5,Psychology majors have a great education and great professors.
College Freshman,5,I could actually afford to go here without struggle
College Freshman,5,Very specific majors will help us all enter into our desired fields
College Freshman,5,So specific that I feel like it's the best place for me to go
College Freshman,5,So many! Chose to go here because major/profs are perfect
College Sophomore,5,"Very safe campus, emergency buttons are almost everywhere. Quiet surrounding neighborhood."
College Junior,5,Very good with giving out scholarships
College Junior,5,The cross country and track teams are amazing!
College Junior,5,Honor code is taken very seriously
College Junior,5,The biochemistry/chemistry department is one of the best around
College Sophomore,5,The professors are nice and I have never had so much fun learning a language. And I feel like i know so much!
College Freshman,5,Getting into my program was easy. Its an easy major if you find the subject interesting. I love my classes and all of the professors in the program.
College Freshman,5,I am very happy with my program. I would choose it again if I had to  do it all over again.
College Freshman,5,The housing is fine. There isn't any down sides.
College Freshman,5,"Mostly you don't have to go off campus for anything, but if you do there is a shuttle on Monday nights and Thursday nights."
College Freshman,5,I really enjoy my professors. The work load is normal with a very interesting curriculum. Most students graduate with an internship or a job.
College Sophomore,5,You get 20 grand if you're any good at sports
College Sophomore,5,The people you meet are what makes it. Great community makes up for other subpar factors
College Sophomore,5,"Great teachers, great programs, reasonably challenging courses"
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman and have not taken any classes yet.  However, I have had many orientations online and I feel the college has done an outstanding job.  The Staff is so welcoming and organized in how they set up the day.    From this experience, I know exactly what to expect.  During this difficult time with COvid, I feel as though Elizabethtown has done an excellent job of reassuring us that we will have the best experience possible.  I will be taking most of my classes online and feel that the college will do a good job in providing the best possible experience and incoming Freshman could have."
Sophomore,4,"The professors are extremely dedicated and amazing people. They've been the reason why I've had so many amazing experiences, and I have learned so much to prepare myself for the workforce and to be a better person in the world. The only negative is that there is little to do around Elizabethtown for entertainment between classes and examinations, so it can get a little boring."
Sophomore,4,"i always love coming back to campus and picking up right where I left off with the professors and friends. Whether it be a one week break, a one month break, or the entire summer, we all talk to each other just like any other day"
Sophomore,4,"The academics Elizabethtown College has to offer, are top of the line. Professors are always willing to take time out of their day to help students understand the material.  The dorm life is okay at best, the dorms need renovating and updated. The price you pay to attend the college, you do not necessarily get the most ""bang for your buck"", but it is close to home and offers me the opportunity to stay involved at home, as well as get a quality education. The neighboring town reminisces of an old western town that was once a booming town, but is now washed and an empty figure of what it used to be. Having to drive 20-30 minutes to get to the closest Walmart, or super center is definitely a flaw to Elizabethtown College."
Freshman,4,"I have not started yet but I have been on tours, as well as an overnight visit. The staff was really amazing and they made applying very easy. My admissions counselor helped me with every question I could possibly had, and even made it easy to plan an in person interview. When I stayed at the school, the students who hosted me were very welcoming, and they showed me all the fun things that there is to do at the college. I will be attending fall of 2019 and I couldnt be more excited"
Freshman,4,"The loving environment at Elizabethtown College is amazing. I always feel comfortable there and everyone respects each other no matter your background. Although it is a small school, the hearts and dedication to making this school great are so much bigger. I wish other schools would see Etown as I do."
Freshman,4,"It is a small campus that has a beautiful landscape and buildings.  The class sizes are small as well, allowing for a lot of one-on-one time with your professor."
Freshman,4,"I love Elizabethtown College. I study music there and all the professors in the music department the staff that I have encountered are amazing. Overall, it is a great school. However, the financial aid program is not great. They do not provide you additional money to purchase textbooks and accessories. The out of pocket cost is very high. I chose to commute because I could not afford to live on campus. For my spring invoice, I had to pay around $1,000 without living on campus and any meal plans. If I added in living on campus and a meal plan etc., my invoice (or out-of-pocket) cost would be over $7,000. When my financial plan came down, it looked great. That was why I picked Elizabethtown College. But I was let down when I received my invoice and my out-of-pocket cost. E-town is a great and amazing college, but I would reconsider if you will be a able to pay for the invoice that your financial aid does not cover for you."
Sophomore,4,"Elizabethtown College is a great community of academics, people, and passion. Though the facilities are not in top notch condition, the education and connections are worth it."
Freshman,4,Elizabethtown has a very welcoming presence around campus! Attending the college it is easy to notice that most of the professors and other staff want to see students thrive in their majors and/or extracurricular activities.
Freshman,4,"Elizabethtown College is truly the right place for me. I feel at home and welcomed by other students and faculty. I have been encouraged to learn and to chase my dreams, which is exactly what I'm there to do. If I could change something, it would be for the business office to work more efficiently with part time students."
Junior,4,"My experience at Elizabethtown has been amazing. I love the faculty and staff, they are always willing to help students in whatever ways they are able too. They go above and beyond to get to know their students. The campus is beautiful and well kept and everyone is so kind and welcoming. I would love to see more student activity groups on campus, especially directed towards commuter students."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy it here at Etown and all it has to offer me as a student! As an athlete, I got to make a ton of friends from all different sports teams. On campus, there are two gyms that can be used by students, along with exercise classes around campus weekly. The college provides students with games and activities, some including bingo, movies, and shows. Etown also has so many clubs every student can join."
Niche User,4,"Elizabethtown University is a very friendly place with a thriving community around its borders. People always have a cheerful smile on their faces, especially when you can not find your way around on visitation day! Partying is minimum to none so sleeping isn't a problem around student homes. Professors look forwards to seeing you after class. To top it all off, everything is walking distance away!"
Alum,4,"The best part about E-town for me were the professors. During my four years, the professors were extremely helpful and did whatever they could to help me further my career goals. The worst part, however, is the way that money is handled at this school. First, the tuition is outrageous. Second, essential services such as security officers are being neglected in favor of building a new (unnecessary) sports facility."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently enrolled as a full time student at Elizabethtown College, studying Early Childhood Education with a minor in Spanish. So far, Elizabethtown College is wonderful. Coming from a small, private school, I benefit most from the small class sizes and student-teacher interaction. The professors get to know you on a personal and academic level, which I feel is important. In terms of diversity, I wish there was more. This is something that I feel Etown could benefit from and use to their advantage. The community is extremely welcoming and you always feel included despite one's differences."
Sophomore,4,"Elizabethtown College has a great community, staff, and overall a beautiful look. While some of what the college is spending their money on doesn't make sense, it is nice that we have a place that is not only safe but fun to be at for studying."
Freshman,4,"I adore everything about this college except the price tag. This school is my dream school, as everything is perfect: the professors, the students, the programs, and even the dorms are pretty nice. I love it at E-Town, and I'm proud to be a blue jay!"
Alum,4,"Etown is a second home. I loved the welcoming community of staff, professors, and students. I had an internship in my freshman year, which caused me to chose the school in the first place. I wish the community was more diverse and academics more rigorous."
Alum,4,"Elizabethtown College is set in a beautiful town in Southeastern Pennsylvania. I think its biggest strengths are its commitment to service, its engaged professors, and its focus on its students' quality of life. There are so many things to be involved in on campus, from musical groups and dance clubs to intramural athletics and student senate. Everyone can find their niche on this campus. It's the kind of place where everyone knows your name and smiles, telling you hello as you pass them. I think the biggest drawbacks are that it's pricey, although if you're a good student, there is plenty of financial aid available. Likewise, it's not a huge party school off campus since there are very few bars and restaurants in the immediate area."
Junior,4,"I could not imagine being at any other school! I love this college, it has a great feeling of family, you really get to know your Professors on a one-on-one basis. If you are looking into small schools i would 100% recommend taking a tour, and checking it out!"
Junior,4,"Etown is a small school that has a very 'hometown' feel to it. The town itself is small, as well as the campus. However, it is located just 20 minutes from Harrisburg, Hershey, and Lancaster, so there is always something to do whether on campus, in town, or in one of the cities close by. The college's motto is ""Educate for  Service"". Community service is highly encouraged on campus, and ample opportunities are provided to volunteer. Etown is an amazing college and I have enjoyed my time here."
Niche User,4,A good school for online learning that fits my schedule. The adult accelerated program is great. I work full time and went back to school to pursue a BS. I was surprised how many credits I could transfer from my Associates.
Freshman,4,"I love how beautiful the campus is. The campus is well taken care of and so are the buildings. This makes you feel more at home. In the dorms, they try to include everyone and work with them to make sure everyone feels at home, especially the first year students. Professors are not just the people you see in class because they want you to visit them during office hours and you see them walking around campus all the time, sometimes you'll even see the president! The academics are challenging yet understanding and they push you to work your hardest. The community present at Elizabethtown helps student's come out of their shells and make friends faster and with more ease than they thought was possible."
Freshman,4,Elizabethtown College is an extremely welcoming community.  Most of the professors want to see you succeed and will do anything to make that happen.  There are lots of student run activities to do.  There is at least one fitness activity each day which is great.  It's very easy to make friends here because everyone in genuinely nice.
Sophomore,4,"This college has a great atmosphere! Everyone is really friendly and professors get to know their students as classes are usually small. I haven't had a class with more than 30 people in it. The academics are challenging, but not too challenging. I wish there was more diversity, though. "
College Junior,4,I don't necessarily utilize these facilities but they are really great for our both our student athletes and students who want to just stay in shape.
College Freshman,4,We are a big basketball and soccer school.  The games are fun!
College Junior,4,The professors are very knowledgeable and care deeply about their students learning and understanding. There is a great variety of courses offered. However being an engineering major I am more restricted to what classes I can take and have very little room for electives. Class sizes are small.
College Junior,4,I've never felt unsafe on campus. Blue lights are every where and campus security is a very common sight. Safety is so great here people will feel comfortable with leaving something unattended for a few minutes. The mutual respect and community makes student feel welcome and comfortable on campus.
College Junior,4,The professors really care about students learning. The small class sizes allow for one on one with them. The student body is really accepting and friendly. Everyone is just really nice. One of the reasons for not choosing this school would be cost possibly. Without enough financial aid and grants attending can be costly. However the small class sizes and engaging professors make it  very rewarding to go to class and learn.
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of classes available that remain small. Courses are interested and taught by passionate professors. The only problems is that some of the most interesting classes fill up too quickly. Some classes will add a time for more students to take the course, but not all of them will."
College Sophomore,4,"Staff tries very hard to prepare you in as many ways as possible to immerse you in your career. At least one internship, study aboard semester, field research or co-op program within your field is required in the curriculum, and truly prepares you for the future."
College Sophomore,4,Buildings are rather old so a lot could be done to help the housing more accessible to the handicapped/injured. They take health and personal safety very seriously and the neighborhood and campus are always safe and secure. We have very few reports of sexual assault or serious sickness on campus (which they handle quickly and seriously when it occurs). Theft is almost nonexistent. You can save your place at a table by setting your things down. They will still be there when you return.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorm buildings and housing options are all pretty good. Some things are outdated but still work very well. What living options have varies but there is an upside and downside to each option, which makes them almost balanced. One thing that causes variation is your RA. Some are a lot more lenient, which can be a good thing or bad thing depending on who your neighbors are."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a DIII school, but teams have spirit and fun together."
College Sophomore,4,Caring professors and involved atmosphere.
College Senior,4,"Elizabethtown has a good reputation, especially within certain careers. This small town school really focuses on community engagement and learning the soft skills that will help you to become successful. I have never used the career center before."
College Freshman,4,"I have not had much experience in this area yet, but I have applied for a few jobs. Career services is great. I have not had a problem, and all of the employers have been mostly patient and helpful when appropriate."
College Freshman,4,I have not had any trouble in my dorm. Most everyone gets along quite well; my room is comfortable and clean. The bathrooms are clean and easily accessible.
College Freshman,4,I feel safe when walking around campus even at night.
College Freshman,4,All my courses have been at a very high quality of academia.
College Freshman,4,I feel like there are so many opportunities for employment.
College Freshman,4,I got Schlosser its a great first year dorm building!
College Sophomore,4,I appreciate the help the advisers and school have provided to me.
College Freshman,4,"Elizabethtown is a pretty quiet place and generally safe. Campo responses quickly to calls and is friendly. There have been a few incidents, but I don't know that much about them. It is safe enough that I feel comfortable walking around campus alone and leaving stuff in the study rooms if I have to step out for a little bit."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is small, which I consider a good thing. I can stay asleep until the last minute and still make it to class on time. The professors are also really friendly and more than willing to help students. They take a genuine interest in their students and will notice if a student skips class. There are also a lot of opportunities available to students if they look for them, such as internships, research with a professor(s), and study abroad. The staff at Career Services and the Study Abroad Office are very friendly and helpful. The only downsides so far have been how expensive the college is and feeling that it is a little too small sometimes."
College Sophomore,4,Campus security is really on top of things and always adresses issues promptly that are reported. They take student safety very seriously.
College Sophomore,4,"I've only come across one professor I didn't like. The class sizes are small which is great because we get more individualized attention! Don't try to skip class if there's an attendance policy, professors will notice if you skip class!"
College Sophomore,4,Career services is very helpful in helping you examine and decide a potential career path. Internship opportunities are heavily advertised.
College Sophomore,4,I love living on campus!! Most of the dorms are in pretty close proximity to classes except for Royer and Founders.
College Sophomore,4,"Elizabethtown College is a great school with endless opportunities for student success. The community is supportive, welcoming, and friendly. Everyone who works on campus, whether it be professors, the financial aid lady, dining services cook, or the janitor, is friendly and goes out of their way to help students succeed. The people you meet at Elizabethtown are what has made my experience worthwhile, thus far. I am lucky to be in the Education Department at Elizabethtown, which is renowned for being an extraordinary program. My experience as an Education Major has been phenomenal, academic wise. If I had one critique of Elizabethtown College, it would be that the dorms are in severe need of updating. The apartments and quads on campus are great options as an upperclassman. However, the freshman and sophomore dorms are extremely underwhelming aesthetically, with the exception of one building. The scenery at Elizabethtown, however, is beautiful and makes living on campus very pleasant. The campus is known for occasionally smelling strongly of sweet chocolate due to the nearby factory. The classrooms are mostly updated and new technology is being added every day. Elizabethtown is more than your standard small school. It's unique charm will captivate you and comfort you through your four years of quality education."
College Sophomore,4,campus security is very nice and we lave a live safe app.
College Junior,4,"So far, my online courses are great. I loved Microeconomics and I did not think I would. I am looking into that field a bit more. I am pursuing a B.S in Business Admin with a Concentration in Accounting. I may switch to Finance. I would like more information on what exactly I would like to pursue upon graduation. As of now, I know I would like to manage money, people, make important decisions for a company, and advise people about the economy, pricing strategies, costs, etc."
College Junior,4,I do get emails about job fairs on occasion.
College Junior,4,I enjoy online classes very much. They fit my full time work schedule.
College Freshman,4,I love founders residence hall because of the set up and the proximity to your neighbors and the layout of the entire building
College Junior,4,"Elizabethtown is great for many reasons: the food, the faculty, the people and the lab equipment. The unique nature of ""Etown"" is definitely found in its small student body, everyone knows each other, and we all have a sense of kinship. You get very close with your class and the students in your major. The only negative aspects of Etown is the dorms and living spaces. They need a lot of updating, and should be a lot better especially since we pay so much to live there. If I could repeat the college process, while I love Etown, I wouldn't chose it again due to the poor condition of the dorms and the cost."
College Senior,4,The small community made it so that professions and students can form a personal relationship which I believe is essential for student success.
College Freshman,4,"Living on such a small campus has a lot of great perks. First, the dorms are close to any education building. The farthest dorm, Royer, is only a five minute walk to the farthest building, the masters center. Second, there are lots of fun things to do on the weekends. The school organizes lots of games and activities for students to do. Third, everyone is super friendly and everyone knows each other. The cost of this school is a little out of hand, but it's worth going to."
College Freshman,2,Off campus houses are the party houses and they are gross.
College Freshman,2,Campo sucks. They will get you with whatever they can. They treat you as a criminal and don't give you any options.
College Senior,2,"Internship opportunities really depend on your major - the business department was pretty good at placing their students fairly quickly. However, if you are interested in the liberal arts, you're on your own. Career services has a few interesting workshops to attend but there is no placement service whatsoever, just resume editing and advice on how to interview well."
College Senior,2,"I could never picture myself living at Elizabethtown after graduation. Don't get me wrong, it's a cute town in its own charming way, but there is nothing to do there."
College Freshman,2,There are not many parties.
College Sophomore,2,The chinese place on Market St. isn't too bad. Wouldn't go near the diners though.
College Sophomore,2,There are international students but most people are from PA and are white christians or catholics.
College Sophomore,2,Not that many places to go. You could take the train into other towns but the only nightlife is usually on campus in the Quads or Apartments or Off Campus at other living areas like the Wrestling House.
College Sophomore,2,"I have never been so cold in my life, but then again I am new to northern weather"
College Sophomore,2,"I am the only black person in 3/4 of my classes. I guess it's okay, I don't feel out of place. I just feel like a person. It's mostly white and there is a large Asian community. The other people groups and colors are few and very far between, but like I said the students are fine and I even forget about color when I am here."
College Sophomore,2,"Aside from a handful of international students, there is not much diversity on this campus."
College Freshman,2,I am still battling with financial aid. They are the hardest people to deal with on the entire campus.
College Sophomore,2,"For a campus that produces basically zero crime, campo is inevitably useless and more of a nuisance"
College Sophomore,2,Etown is very isolated from everything and since there is no public transportation it is harder for students to enjoy activities not provided by the school.
College Junior,2,"We always have campus security, Campo, patrolling campus. They are not very strict with underage drinking, but they did take some drug dealing pretty serious as the students were kicked out of school."
College Junior,2,"If you don't have a car, there really aren't many places that you can go to. The campus is small enough that you can walk from one end to another, no problem. However, if you want to leave campus, walking isn't really an option. I know some people who will walk to Kmart and the grocery store, but it takes them over an hour to go to and from there. The mall is around a 20 minute drive from campus. There are shuttles that take you to and from the Etown gym when there are classes, and I believe on certain days there are shuttles that will take you to the mall or to the grocery store, but not that often enough."
College Freshman,2,"The food schedule is on a two or three week rotation, so you'll see the same food quite frequently. Dining services usually plans one specialty themed dinner each month, and you don't want to miss these. They bring out the best food at these events."
College Freshman,2,It seems there's only two seasons here at Etown. It's either freezing cold or eighty degrees out. Dress in layers because you never really know what to expect.
College Freshman,2,"There is diversity here on camps, and the school works hard to acheive this. But, still there is a large amout of Whites at the school, and sometimes there are challenges for minorities."
College Freshman,2,"There are parties, but only a few. If you know the right people there are more options but it can be difficult to do things on a whim. Weekends you are sure to find at least one party, maybe two because most party houses are owned by sports teams who have games and practices."
Alum,1,It is pretty funny that Niche devotes 100 characters to this section. There was no online learning in the mid 90's.
Alum,1,"My happiest moment at Elizabethtown College was leaving. I met some wonderful people along the way, but hey, I would have met wonderful people pretty much anywhere. 

The lack of diversity coupled with my department's amazing ability to not prepare me for my field could have been overlooked were it not for the numerous classes where professors just phoned it in. 

I will say this: I take great joy in recommending basically any other school than this to prospective attendees. Consider it my revenge for just how overrated and overpriced this college is for what it offers."
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life on our campus which I'm personally absolutely fine with.
College Senior,1,"I could go on and on about all the problems that campus security has caused me during my college years...they are very condescending towards students, even when they are not doing anything wrong. One time when I lost my phone the campus security officer I asked to help me pretended that they hadn't found a phone and then acted very suspicious of my ID when she confirmed that she had it in her office, as if I was trying to steal the phone, despite having described the phone to her accurately. They take themselves to seriously and treat students like criminals especially when it comes to alcohol and parties."
College Freshman,1,Do not have any nor is there an interest in having any
College Sophomore,1,"Very little diversity, however, the college is working to fix this."
College Sophomore,1,"The merit scholarships you get at first sound amazing, but than tuition increases a ton from year to year, but the scholarship amounts remain the same. I was not able to apply for financial aid and the people at the aid office refused to help me search for scholarships because I didn't apply for the financial aid my second year since I didn't receive any my first year."
College Junior,1,"The school has shuttle buses but since they are never advertised and have inconvenient hours, a lot of students do not use them. Students who do not have cars usually bum a ride off of someone they know or will just walk to wherever in this small town."
College Junior,1,"The town Elizabethtown has probably 3 bars and no clubs.  If you're looking to get your boogie on, you're out of luck.  There are no clubs, you have to go to York, Lancaster or Harrisburg.  The college does throw dances... but they're lame.  The best bet would to hit up the parties thrown at the quads, apartments or in the LLC.  Even then, those are quickly shut down by campo.  This is definitely not the college for those who like to party."
College Freshman,1,"First ill start with the good. On the plus side it is a beautiful campus that offers a lot of scenery and is pleasant to walk through. The buildings except for the dorms are fairly new and updated. The BSC is inviting and is a nice building and has a decent caf. Also because it is small you get to know pretty much everyone and get a closer bond with your peers.

Now for what isn't good about ETOWN. The college is supposedly ""wet"" meaning that you are allowed to have alcohol on campus. a lot of times this means that colleges are more lenient with parties or partying. In this case its false there is not a single weekend that Campo and the RA's let people enjoy alcohol while staying under control. The biggest/most fun week at this school is TGIS. to be honest it sucks. spirit week in high school is more entertaining than this boring couple of days where the college is supposed to be ""cool"" about parties and all that. Parties aren't everything so then we move to other activities... oh wait there are none. The only thing they do offer on the weekends is sometimes dances. the funny thing is that the dances are a collection of drunks that are being more destructive than the people chilling at parties just having fun. other than the scummy dances there are no activities since campo makes sure nothing goes on after 11. The surrounding town is boring and doesn't like the college at all so there isn't much to do there.

In the end Elizabeth town sucks. it is a boring campus that treats the students as if they are at a religious strict college.

College Junior,1,Apartments Don't Exist! Not to mention the 4 year housing contract they make you sign that you have to petition to get out of.
College Senior,1,There is basically nothing going on at Etown. There are lots of parties in dorms and in other residences on campus but generally there is nothing to do.
College Sophomore,1,"On-Campus College – If you are not a commuter, you are required to live on campus. However, if you live in the Apartments or Quads (mini houses), you are considered to be living off-campus because they are in a remote part of the campus. However, they are popular and unless you're an upperclassman, they're really hard to get into."
College Junior,1,E-town is pretty boring unless you find the right friends.  With friends like mine a bad day can turn amazing at the drop of a hat.
College Sophomore,1,"Wireless Availability Is Very Limited. There should be an effort to make wireless available all over campus.  Network plug-ins in the dorm rooms are limited, forcing students to buy more expensive cables that can wrap around the room or go across the room, usually causing a hazard."
College Sophomore,1,"Around Etown, there is very little diversity.  We have a few pizza joints but mostly otherwise just chains."
College Freshman,1,"Not Much to Do – Elizabethtown, PA is very sleepy and quiet.  Unless you have a car, you are stuck on campus.  Public transportation is very limited and there is not much to do off campus.  There are a couple of nice coffee shops, but other than that there is nothing for students.  It is relatively safe, but rather boring.  Lancaster and Harrisburg are nearby and Philadelphia is not too far away."

Junior,5,"Finishing classes online due to COVID 19 was interesting.  It was not something I wanted to do but it actually turned out pretty good.  I was able to access everything I needed, including assistance when I wanted it.  Professors had things well organized and easy to access and easy to understand.  I completed the courses required for the rest of the semester but kind of missed the face to face classes."
Junior,5,North Greenville University has been a great choice for me.   I enjoy the smaller class sizes and the sense of family there.  Academic assistance is available if needed.
Alum,5,"I liked the atmosphere and the intramural sports program. The teacher-student ration was conducive to a great learning environment. I never felt like I was just another face in the room. 
The student life on the weekends needs to be improved."
Sophomore,5,"NGU is honestly just an overall positive environment that focuses a lot on faith. I am so glad that I decided to attend this university, and I sincerely hope that anyone wishing to apply does so. The academics are fantastic and the people here are amazing."
Sophomore,5,"North Greenville is a small college located in Tigerville, South Carolina. It is a Christ-centered community of professors, students, and faculty. When I began my journey with NGU, I was greeted with smiles and and a heartfelt welcome. The light of Christ just radiated all throughout the people there. Christ is most important in my life, so it was awesome to be around others who felt the same way I do. I am going into my Sophomore year of college as a Biology major in hopes of one day being a Neonatal Nurse. Already, my professors have helped me to achieve a successful first year of college."
Niche User,5,what I loved most about NGU was the feel of the campus; you could tell that it was filled with the presence of God and you could tell that the professors really cared about their students. there's nothing that I can think of that I would change about NGU.
Junior,5,"North Greenville is by far the best University in my opinion.  There is so much that you can do.  You can really concentrate on your academics there.  The professors are really nice too, especially mine!  I'm a Music Ed. Major, so it's really important that I understand the material that I am learning at the particular time.  The music professors do a really good job on checking on their students as well as encouraging their students and making sure that they are ok and cheering them up if they are sad!"
Niche User,5,"North Greenville University is a place filled with loving and caring people. Everyone on campus, even down to the landscapers, care about you. They all want you to have the best experience and desire for you to be taken care of. 
The professors are absolutely incredible. Because of the smaller class size, you are able to connect with your professors on a deeper level than just a number. They know your name and recognize you walking on campus. They care about you and your well-being. I have encountered many professors who have invested their time and energy into helping not only with my grades but with my everyday struggles. This is a special place and you will not regret coming here."
Freshman,5,I love the community at North Greenville University! The professors are also very caring and relational!
Senior,5,North Greenville is a great place to learn meet people and grow you faith with the lord. The teacher are always willing to help you they will pray for you.
Freshman,5,I will be attending this school in fall 2019. I am super excited for this semester and I feel that professors really care about me as a student.
Senior,5,The class size was great! Also the professors were all very accommodating. Many were willing to meet with me outside of their normal office hours in addition to all of their many office hours.
Sophomore,5,I go to NGU and everyone is so kind and teachers care about their students. If I were to change something I would change the food.
Sophomore,5,The Christian atmosphere is wonderful and you can feel God move all around. The professors are very willing and eager to help you in any way possible.
Alum,5,"This was a great opportunity for me. I got to travel to Honduras and Israel with the school. I worked in the theater, IT, and music departments. I also had a variety of wonderful professors who talk me not only the course content but many life lessons that I still remember, even four years after graduation."
Freshman,5,"I love the campus, the teachers and the focus on God.  Everyone there seems to be focused on how to help each student succeed and grow closer in their walk with Christ."
Graduate Student,5,"I am at the graduate campus in Greer and like it there! Very friendly staff, a nice building, and a good layout of required coursework."
Sophomore,5,North Greenville is the best college you could possibly chose to go to. I have never heard of a college where the proffessors and faculty care about their students like NGU does. And the campus is AMAZING. NGU is an experience I will never forget.
Freshman,5,"Deciding to attend North Greenville University was one of the best decisions of my life. North Greenville does a excellent job in education, athletics, intramurals, and dorms. Even though some of their facilities are a little run down and can use some improvement, and the food is lacking top quality, it is perfect college for me. I thoroughly enjoy the chapels and the speakers that they bring and i enjoy all my friends i have made here."
Sophomore,5,"NGU is a smaller private university in the upper part of the state of SC. The atmosphere at the school is friendly and caring. Classes are small, giving the students and professors the opportunity to learn names of each and something about each person. A student can communicate directly with his/her professor by email or during office hours. The professors are always willing to help with questions. I can email a professor in the evenings if I have questions on an assignment and usually I get an immediate response. Students, like me, who commute, are kept informed about activities that are constantly occurring on campus."
Freshman,5,"I love it at North Greenville! The professors are caring and Christian leaders who truly care about their students and helping them succeed. Often, professors will start the day off with a devotion that helps remind us about the true purpose in life. It is so nice to be in a Christian environment where I can talk freely about my faith and have faith-based discussions with my peers without being targeted as a ""bible-thumper"" or a "" prude, religious nut."" But on a more practical note, the dorms are very nice and the RAs and RCs are super understanding and helpful. The campus is small enough that I don't have to spend a lot on gas, because I can walk to my classes. Also, there are several spots on campus where you can go and read, think, or hang out with friends. My favorite is probably the Student Life Center. Overall, I love it at North Greenville and I am so glad that God has put me there."
Sophomore,5,I love this school. I am an Education major and love the classes involved. Chapel is my favorite. It always spiritually renews me.
Freshman,5,It's a fantastic university! The professors really care and want to get to know you as a student. The campus life is also great. There is always something going on and there are many clubs and organizations to get involved in.
Niche User,5,"Everyone at NGU was lovely and eagerly helped me feel comfortable on campus. The campus itself is beautiful and there are a lot of eating options. Most of the dorms have suite bathrooms, which is really nice."
Graduate Student,5,This is a wonderful school! I graduated in 2012 and am enrolled again for my Masters. This is a wonderful Christian university! Christ makes the difference at this school. The professors are extremely helpful!
Sophomore,5,"North Greenville is a wonderful school because not only are the professors and staff extremely loving and self-sacrificing, but the college makes serving God their main goal. They are the only school that I have encountered that has their priorities in the right place."
Sophomore,5,North Greenville University is a wonderful school! The faculty and students are great people to be around and everyone is always so nice. There's no other school I'd rather be at.
Sophomore,5,North Greenville seeks to teach its students not only intellectually but also spiritually. There is a great staff who helps their students to success
Junior,5,I love the university and would recommend it to future friends! The professors are great to work with the students and the amount of students versus professors is a nice number to where you really get to know them.
Freshman,5,"I love the Christian aspect of the school and all of the teachers are friendly and really help you with your walk with Christ. The campus itself is beautiful and you get a panorama view of the mountains. But, the cafe food isn't all that but, maybe that is a college thing."
Niche User,5,North Greenville University was a great experience and I felt like I can fit in with the school. They also have my major which is electrical engineering. The college classes are interactive than most colleges I have toured. I think when North Greenville brings fun and knowledge together it bring excitement.  I've also got to talk to the soccer coach about joining the team so I think I'll be fine.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love it here! All of the professors really care about their students, and their success. I love being able to attend chapel every Monday and Wednesday mornings. The food in the cafeteria is alright, but they also have a general store, Papa John's, and an Einsteins Bagels on campus so there are a lot of options. The scenery here is beautiful! I love being able to watch the sun set behind the mountains every night. It is a beautiful little campus that is nice and peaceful, and you get to meet a lot of new and wonderful people."
Freshman,5,"I love it.  The classes really challenge me to work my hardest. The professors are very supportive and helpful and most say a prayer before they begin class. I fell in love with college on my first visit. Everyone is just part of one big family that supports each other and has fun together. This is a place where you can feel really close to God. There is always a prayer said before the football games - at least the home games. I do not know about the other sports yet. I am in the education program to become an elementary/early childhood teacher and I am absolutely enjoying it. If you want to grow closer to God with others, become part of one giant supportive and God-loving family, and be challenged then this is the university you should attend. I should also mention that this is a christian university and Christ is definitely at the center of everything we do."
Alum,5,"The setting of campus although remote, 15 minutes to the closest city, is beautiful as you're surrounded by the Blue Ridge Mountains.  The school has grown a lot since I graduated almost 10 years ago, but still feels like a tight knit community.  With smaller class sizes professors and students are able to interact more and students have greater access to their professors.  I graduated with BA in Interdisciplinary Studies with concentrations in Spanish and Lingusitics and used most of my electives in Christian Studies.  I used to say the degree was perfect for working as a missionary in South America but has also served me well in the US working in the Language Services industry as an interpreter and interpreter coordinator."
Junior,5,"North Greenville was the perfect fit for me. Great small school, no party scene, and great student-professor relationships."
Junior,5,I love NGU! The campus has been great. The food was okay but needed to improve. The professors is great but needed to work together than lettuce.
College Freshman,5,"All great experiences, professors are great and willing to work with you always!"
College Freshman,5,"Athletics are great at NGU, coaches actually care about you and players work their hardest to play as a team!"
College Freshman,5,They know what they are doing when it comes to providing a safe environment for the students. They also make sure to encourage the students make reports if they see anything suspicious or dangerous going on.
College Freshman,5,I am not cramped in a room with my dorm partner because it is two rooms joined by a bathroom. The place is very clean and my dorm room is close to the facilities.
College Freshman,5,The school is beyond safe. I've never heard of safety problems on campus.
College Sophomore,5,Health and Safety are no issue at NGU. The campus is very safe and there is little to no crime at all on campus.
College Freshman,5,"With the alcohol and sex rules in place these issues above are nonexistent, at least to my knowledge."
College Freshman,5,"This university fits my personally and makes me feel like I am at home. I've always looked for a school that the major focuse was on Christ and I found it. It has a beautiful environment and is full of friendly and kind people. What I love the most is that North Greenville is a small university and the professors are always willing to help. When a school is smaller the professors pay more attention to students individually and I believe that has a great impact of one's grades. I am a resident and I love everything about North Greenville University, a place that I can call ""home."""
College Freshman,5,The majority of degrees here have the last semester of your time here as an internship the entire semester where you must go away from campus and gain experience.
College Freshman,5,I feel the safest when I am on campus even late at night. Security does a good job at regulating and keeping us safe and enforcing reasonable rules.
College Freshman,5,Usually there is one class you just don't seem to do well in but the rest of your classes make up for it. North Greenville University fits me perfectly. I love my teachers and the relationships I have with them. My academic achievements are attainable and worthwhile.
College Freshman,5,"I love North Greenville University. I love the people, the teachers, and the subjects. There is such a positive attitude connected with my school. I couldn't have asked for a better education experience."
College Freshman,5,"Everything around here screams ""safe environment."" We hardly ever have any issues. Crime is extremely low and our campus security is fabulous!"
College Freshman,5,"The classes are great. They are challenging, but very worth-while. The environment on campus is one in a million. There is no place I'd rather be. Some of my favorite experiences have been the opportunities presented from guests who set up booths in the cafeteria. The wonderful Christ centered environment and solid courses would definitely be worth choosing all over again."
College Freshman,5,The athletics at North Greenville is very good!
College Freshman,5,"I love North Greenville University tremendously.  It is very Christ centered but also at the same time it rejects no one, anyone can apply and try to get in, they are not religious."
Recent Alumnus,5,I ALWAYS felt saft on campus.  Nobody I knew nor myself ever felt threatened or sexually assaulted.
College Sophomore,5,Crime is extremely low on campus.
College Sophomore,5,"Ngu is a lovely Christ-centered environment. The workload is usually challenging.  However, the campus is beautiful, from the mountains to the fountains to the prayer chapel. The food is good on most days, and the housing is very adequate. Tuition is 27,000 a year, but it is very much worth the Ngu experience."
Recent Alumnus,5,Very challenging academics but the professors are very helpful.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Class sizes are small and professors are caring. It is a fairly long walk to class sometimes, though."
Recent Alumnus,5,Most of the seniors have jobs before they graduate
Recent Alumnus,5,I have been challenged but have been given assistance to meet the challenge. My first semester grades weren't as high as I had hoped for but I believe that they will rise. The professors are helpful and committed to my success.
Recent Alumnus,5,School spirit is high and attendance at athletic events is good for a school this size.
Alum,4,"For the most part I had a pleasant experience with North Greenville University. The professors are very kind and willing to help, but the business office seemed to be the most troublesome part of it all. The cafeteria food was also very bad."
Freshman,4,North Greenville University has a good community that is very welcoming and it is so easy to meet new people and make new friends. There are many clubs to join and many opportunities to explore what you like there. The professors are very understanding and want to connect with their students. North Greenville has made sure to keep in touch with the students during the COVID-19. The community is very nice and the people who work there are so easy to get along with. There is many activities for the students to do and there are great opportunities to be able to share your faith. North Greenville is a good school for students who like a small school and it is not a party school. There are social events so students can have fun and meet people. The school has a good campus security that check on the students and there are also other people on campus that want to make sure the students are doing good not only physically but also mentally. There's someone on campus to help you with anything.
Freshman,4,"I love the small campus environment at NGU, because I've gotten to know so many great friends of mine that I didn't know at the beginning of last semester. I also love going to a school where I can witness God's beautiful creation. Every morning on the way to class, I get a breathtaking view of the Appalachian Mountains; that view never gets old. I have also been blessed with the amazing professors and mentors that have come into my life, as well as a great team of people that make the NGU Chapel experience look like a little glimpse of heaven. Lastly, I am thankful that I can call myself a college athlete, as I have been recruited to play for our men's soccer team as a Goalkeeper. Soccer has been a passion of mine for the past decade, so I am grateful to be given the opportunity to continue my career for the next few years."
Freshman,4,I love NGU! It's small and feels like family. The staff truly care about the students and want them to be successful and help them grow in their faith while in school.
Junior,4,I absolutely love this University. Being in a Christian environment has allowed me to grow in my faith and meet people that push me to be the best Christian that I can. The classes are small which makes learning easier and more fun.
Niche User,4,"I think that this is a very beautiful school, I haven't gotten treated badly here and the staff and faculty are very kind."
Senior,4,NGU has a great and safe environment. Their education program is amazing and gives great field experience opportunities. Professors are always willing to help and classroom size is perfect. The only downside is the financial aid staff. They don't seem to be on the same page and have had many misunderstandings with several students.
Niche User,4,"It is such a great college. There ideals and the way they run things are perfect! I love that though they are in a small part of South Carolina, that they are super super close to pretty big cities, like Greenville and Travelers Rest. One thing I think they could improve is the dorms but that's really it."
Alum,4,I loved my time at North Greenville and they are making great strides in making campus more inviting and fun. Especially since there's literally nothing else around. The faculty are the best part about the University. They genuinely care about their students and every professor I had there were both great instructors and great content experts. My one recommendation for North Greenville would be to update and modernize campus more often as well as work to improve their online and hybrid course offerings.
Junior,4,"I transferred from a small 2 year college my junior year of college. It was very challenging, but the professors, staff, and students made it all worth it. The professors generally care about your success and the staff is always there ready to lend a hand. Although, the food could be improved."
Junior,4,"NGU is a great school to go to. Everyone there is always nice, and the professors are always willing to talk to you. The class size is normally small so there is always involvement."
Sophomore,4,"North Greenville University is a close-knit school where everyone truly cares for everyone. You can see the dedication to the school in the faculty and staff, the students, and the student's parents. It is a school that encourages the students to step out of their comfort zone and reach beyond the stars."
Senior,4,"North Greenville is a pretty nice school, its in a location where there are a lot of mountains and wilderness. The people are really nice, and the classroom environment is good. The ability to have one on one time with teachers is one of the best things about the school, whenever a student needs to see them about something or about what was discussed in class they can go schedule an appointment. The athletics there are ok, its still a program that is being developed and in a few years will probably be something great for any student that wants to play a sport and for the ones already on scholarship."
Niche User,4,"I love North Greenville. The campus is smaller but the people are wonderful.  It has a beautiful view of the mountains, and isn't far from Travelers Rest and Downtown Greenville."
Sophomore,4,"I like that it is a relatively small college and getting to know the professors are easy.  This is important because when it comes time to needing a letter of recommendation, my professors can honestly write about me."
College Freshman,4,this school is amazing. the professors are very helpful. but it is also very challenging
College Freshman,4,"Very respectable college, internships are easy to come by while attending this university!"
College Freshman,4,"I feel very great when on campus! Campus security is always on patrol, very safe environment!"
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is great, NGU has on campus houses! So not having to live in a dorm is great!"
College Freshman,4,"My experience is great, smaller classroom sizes means more one on one time with teachers!"
College Freshman,4,"It nice and they make sure to cover any job or career that someone may be interested in. They even have engineering, but it is a dual enrollment with Clemson which is also very nice."
College Freshman,4,I love the school and I am very appreciative that I am able to attend such an university and love the way they do things at North Greenvillle University.
College Freshman,4,This school tries to get everyone involve when it comes to social events. They try to help you if you are lost in class. Since the ratio is 14:1 it is also easier to learn from the professor. The students helps one another on their spare time. This the facilities on the campus are pretty close to each other so it makes it easy to get around. Overall this is probably one of the best Universities I probably have ever attended.
College Senior,4,"Good times so friends, loved histo department."
College Senior,4,I haven't heard about any sexual assaults. I feel safe and the rules about male/female interaction seem to halt any assault.
College Freshman,4,The professors here are second to none they truly care for your grades and life.
College Freshman,4,In ministry you can get plenty of jobs because you got a degree from North Greenville.
College Freshman,4,This school is unique because the actually care how you do in class and not only that but they care what happens in your life.
College Sophomore,4,I feel that my degree hold a lot of value and I think that I will not have any trouble finding a job once I graduate. The professors are very good at helping the students find jobs in their desired fields.
College Sophomore,4,Courses and professors are very good. Professors in-particular and very helpful and knowledgeable about subject matters. There are some courses that I feel are pointless to my degree but what colleges don't have those kind of courses?
College Sophomore,4,"As an athlete I get a first hand view of the athletics at North Greenville. The facilities are immaculate and the athletic department continues to make strides to make things better. While the facilities are amazing the financial side of the athletic department.....i.e. scholarships for athletes and team budgets, are lacking tremendously. With being a smaller school I feel that it is harder to get support from donors for all of the sports and that is why the majority of the sports are underfunded."
College Sophomore,4,An amazing but growing school has a lot of potential to be a very great school in the future but definitely some issues with the school as a whole. Those become obvious once you are already a student. Besides that the professors are great and the student body is overwhelmingly friendly!
College Freshman,4,"Many classes are great but there are some where you can tell people don't want to be there but they have got be. The topics are diverse, professors are usually great, the sizes are amazing. So overall everything is good when it comes to classes and professors."
College Freshman,4,Im a commuter but i am moving on campus for the convenience. It will be easier and better for me to live as a resident
College Freshman,4,"This school is absolutely wonderful! The only challenge i face now is finding money to pay tuition. Besides that, everything at this school is meant for me"
College Freshman,4,"I love the fact that the rooms are so big compared to other schools. The bathrooms are huge and there is alot of storage place. The only thing I dislike about the dorm I'm in is that it is one of the oldest and could be a little bit cleaner or maybe could be renewed. Other than I love my roommate, my room, the atmosphere,etc."
College Freshman,4,"I have no idea how the athelics work in the school, but I do know that it is a big part of campus life. I see atheles all over the campus. Some professors may say that they expect more effort from atheles because they already know how to manage time and other necessary things used in the classroom. The teams' fans are all over the place, the students are very supportive and demonstrate enthusiasm in doing so."
College Freshman,4,We practically never have to worry about anything on this campus.  We can focus solely on furthering our education and getting our degree.
College Freshman,4,"This campus is a great overall place to be.  The professors love to interact with us, students often get into study groups, there are many course offerings, and class sizes are not big at all."
College Freshman,4,Living on campus allows you to interact with new people and become a more well-rounded person.
College Freshman,4,I love being at North Greenville University because it allows me to get a degree while growing in my walk with Christ.
College Freshman,4,"I am a freshman so I am still learning to get around, but everone has always been helpful. There are so many opportunities  all you do is have to go for them."
College Freshman,4,"Even for those who are not very involved in the athletic programs in school, you will still be able to see the results of hard working students and share in the passion they have for their athletic choices. There are so many opportunities for non-athletics to be involved as well."
College Freshman,4,"I love living on campus. Yes, some of the dorms are old, and yes some of the rooms could use more storage, but it is great. The sense of community is strong in the dorms."
College Freshman,4,"The school is horrible at helping find internships, etc but do help get jobs after graduation."
College Freshman,4,Really good school. I enjoy the people and most of the teachers.
College Freshman,4,Love living in the units. Nice housing. Fairly clean and spacious.
College Freshman,4,"Athletic facilities, etc are great for everyone. Athletes and non-athletes both have very nice facilities."
Recent Alumnus,4,I loved my professors.  They cared a lot about me as a person.
Recent Alumnus,4,I've been very happy with NGU.
College Sophomore,4,The facilities are nice. I enjoy going and watching the different teams play!
College Sophomore,4,North Greenville has been a wonderful college experience so far! The professors have your best interest in mind. My favorite part of North Greenville is the campus is so God centered!
College Sophomore,4,Class sizes are small in number of students. Professors will do whatever they can to help you succeed.
College Sophomore,4,"It isnt amazing, but i think most of it is very nice."
Recent Alumnus,4,Some of the residence halls are showing their age while a few are brand new and nice. Apply for one of the new ones early.
College Freshman,4,"The school is actually surprisingly lenient on some rules and the students are not judging and is very accepting. It is almost impossible to go thru freshman year without meeting all kinds of people and making a very diverse group of friends. We are far away from almost everything so it is hard to hang out with out-of-school friends, but the campus is so beautiful and fun that there are barely days you miss going off campus."
College Junior,4,"Great people, great friends, great job, great teachers"
College Freshman,4,"Most places around our school you have to drive at least 10-15 minutes to get anywhere. But, then it is mostly fast food. So it is mostly cheap and convenient."
College Freshman,4,I love living on campus! Everyone is super nice and easy to get along with. The dorms are mostly clean and have plenty of space!
College Student,4,The campus does have strict rules but I feel safe.
Freshman,2,"It's not a terrible school but some people have a twisted view on religion and they're either ""if you don't believe this than you're wrong"". 
The ""cultural events"" are required but they're too late so anyone that doesn't live on campus have a really hard time being able to go, much less know what they are."
Sophomore,2,"I went to North Greenville University hoping for a Christian education. They do that very well, but I didn't even think about the possibility of corruption. I suppose I was naive. There were a couple of professors who I felt really cared for me and that was nice, but overall they didn't seem too fond of me. So if you're Southern Baptist or really conservative this school is a great pick. If not, reconsider. "
College Senior,2,We do not have Greek life so this does not apply.
College Student,2,It is a very small town and off campus housing is non-exsistant.
College Sophomore,2,"Not much nightlife on campus, unless study parties with friends and classmates counts."
College Sophomore,2,"There really aren't any transportation options, which is fine if you're on campus, because everything you need is within walking distance. However, people often want to go off campus because there is not that much to do on campus, and this is pretty much impossible if you don't have a car or a friend to drive you anywhere. But I will say that I will be a junior this year and I have gotten along perfectly fine without a car so far. You can walk everywhere on campus, and other students are more than willing to drive you somewhere if you need them to."
College Freshman,2,It is not healthy or filling.
College Sophomore,2,no one has school spirit. no one.
College Sophomore,2,"Security is never around when you need them to be. When you call and ask for assistance, its best to be prepared to wait a few hours."
College Sophomore,2,"The school does not provide any choices for off-campus housing for students. Students are allowed to live off campus on their own if they are a certain age and if they live a certain distance away from the school, which makes it very difficult for many students to live off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Our campus is extremely strict. There is a strict dress code enforced for guys and girls. There is also no alcohol, drug or Tabaco use, or sex on or off campus. If a student is caught doing any one of these on or off campus during their time here, they are sent home immediately. "
College Freshman,2,Most of the guys and girls are average. 
College Sophomore,2,"I gave NGU a C- because the school is at a miniumum of 10-15 minutes away from any apartments. The ones that are available are pretty decent but they are so far away. Also, it is very hard to really enjoy an apartment at NGU because to live off campus you have to be a senior, and everyone knows how crazy busy your senior year in college is. The only other way to not live on campus is if your permanent address is somewhere nearby or you get married."
College Sophomore,2,"We don't have much variety on campus. We have a dining hall where the food is good sometimes and we have Einstein bagel shop, kind of pricey. We have a grill also know as the Stud. That's where most people eat. Its quick and good but gets old."
College Sophomore,2,NGU has some good majors but they don't have many. I was recruited by ans admissions counselor who told me they had an Athletic Training program but that was not the truth. So Beware
College Sophomore,2,Parking sucks. There a few parking spaces in front of dorms and being that boys and girls dorms a separated they have an issue with the opposite sex parking in a girls dorm area. During class times which is 7-5. We are not allowed to park in majority of on campus parking because they use it for teachers. Its inconvenient on both parties.
College Sophomore,2,"Its a variety of people at NGU. You can find all sorts of people but most are  stuck up. The school is very cliquey. Everyone has there own ""crew"" to hang out with. Being that the school is very religious mostly everybody there acts very ""holier than thou"" and are coming to college to find there husband or wife. NGU preaches abstinence instead of celibacy. They make females feel bad if they have had sex before. And everybody is waiting around for a ring. So you have people getting married at 18 and 19 just to have sex. Its like a cult. But don't get me wrong, you do have a small group of people who are rebellious and don't give into the NGU template. They enjoy turning up and don't care about getting engaged freshman year . I mean really !"
College Freshman,2,"As our school is growing, parking is becoming more of a problem. There is always a place, but you may have to drive around the lot a time or two."
College Sophomore,2,"The town of Tigerville is very small and there is not much to do in the area. The closest town with any attractions is Greenville, which is about 20 mins. outside of the proximity of the university."
College Senior,2,"While the campus is extremely isolated, owning a car is not necessary at North Greenville University. If you are staying on campus, every building is within walking distance. However, if you want to travel off-campus, no Greenville buses run by our school, so you will need a car or call a taxi."
College Senior,1,"We don't have fraternities. A few academic disciplines do have honour societies/fraternities,"
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life on the campus of North Greenville.
Recent Alumnus,1,We did not have Greek Life.
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life here.
College Freshman,1,You need a car or you will never get off campus unless a friend drives you.
College Freshman,1,You almost are not allowed to if you are not married.
College Sophomore,1,"once its dark, everyones asleep."
College Sophomore,1,The food is terrible. literally- dog food.
Recent Alumnus,1,This does not apply to NGU. We do not have these clubs
College Junior,1,"Our school is located in the middle of the woods. It takes approximatly 20 minutes to even reach the town and a extra 10 minutes to reach a few fast food places. While the downtown area has very nice resturants, most are pricey and hard to afford. Whats even more rare is finding a resturant that offers student discounts that isnt an hour away."
College Sophomore,1,"It is a private christian university so there aren't any big parties, no bars and there is no nightlife."
College Sophomore,1,"The food has been described as ""prison grade."" I personally avoid the cafeteria at all costs."
College Sophomore,1,Nightlife at NGU is non-existent unless you sneak off campus. Everything is forbidden here
College Sophomore,1,Too many RULES ! Campus security sucks all they do is write tickets. And break up anything that looks like a fun time. They gave us rape whistles. Like what the heck thats going to do if I'm getting raped
College Sophomore,1,There are many different ethnic cultures on campus. But as far as religious views go there is only one and if your not Christian they believe in converting you. Homosexuality on campus is not tolerated if you identify on campus or online as a homosexual you will be kicked out of school. My friends were kicked out for Lesbianism. They have one way at NGU. There way
College Sophomore,1,There is no transportation options. Either you have a car or your friend does.
College Sophomore,1,"The area is full of apartments. You have Greenville, Greer and Traveler's Rest. The bad thing about it though is the fact that the school puts a restriction of how far you can live from school and you have to be a certain age and even if you live with your parents you still have to stay with in the schools perimeter. It sucks ! The school doesn't actually provide of campus housing . You pretty much go find it on your own."
College Freshman,1,There are really no off campus housing for North Greenville Students unless you are a commuter and already live close by.
College Freshman,1,"The transportation around North Greenville is very poor. The school does not provide any transportation to get around town. To drive to a fastfood restaurant, it is around 10-15 miles away. To go on a date or eat something more fancy, the drive is around 20-30 miles away."
College Freshman,1,"There is little to no ""partying"" that goes on that the student body is aware of as a whole. Certainly where I am, I have not seen one girl come into the dorm drunk. Also, there are barely any establishments that carry alcohol in a 20 mile radius."

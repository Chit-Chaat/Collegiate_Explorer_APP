Graduate Student,5,"It is a very cheap school, but don‘t let that make you think that it is bad. The professors there are absolutely wonderful, and almost all of them are experts in their fields, while the others have real experience in their fields. While it doesn‘t have dorms or sports, it is a great school to go to if you‘re reasonably local."
Sophomore,5,"Housatonic Community College is a great school. It is very cost efficient and the teachers really care about your education and helping you get ahead. they provide tutoring sessions and emails so you are able to reach out to your professors with any additional questions if they arise after class hours. new buildings have been made, expanding the campus site and making it look more appealing. new classes have been added such as surgical technician. Housatonic is a great Bridgeport school and I am proud to attend."
Alum,5,"Tuition cost is affordable, the courses they offer helps build your educational foundation. Faculty is great with their job."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Housatonic Community College has overall be a great one. I have had the opportunity to still achieve my goals by attending part time with flexible class schedules that Housatonic offers. The teachers have been a great help and really care about the students understanding the material and passing their classes. Some teachers can be very stern and tough on the student, but that just means you must buckle down and study a bit harder. As far as the Financial Aid Department, they too are very helpful. There is a bit of a process you must go through, although if you are on top of getting all the information needed for them to make their final decision in supplying you with aid, the process goes very smoothly. The best part that I feel has helped me the most is being about to set up a payment plan with the register’s office. Classes can get very expensive and having to pay them all at once can be very stressful. The option of a payment plan takes a load off."
Freshman,5,"In transferring to HCC, the experience(s) i've had have been amazing and more welcoming than I had expected. The environment is very healthy and everyone is nice to one another."

Sophomore,5,"Housatonic Community College is a great  place to start your college career or to continue. The professors want to really help you succeed and the advisors are a help too. Just may sure that you do your own research on the classes you need to take. As a returning student and a mom I had to make sure I got the classes that I want. Also my professors where very understanding when I had to leave class, not attend class, or I was late when it came to my child."
Freshman,5,"I loved the diversity of the college. Its a college that is filled with people from all over the world. Nothing to complain about when it comes to meeting new people. The atmosphere is pleasing. I am in love with their art museum, gives me something to do when I have free time. The professors listen to you, which I think all professors should. The college staff are up to date on whats going on with the student. The environment is very welcoming and it makes you want to learn."
Freshman,5,"The College is close to home so that is really convenient. I love the fact they're having all these events and programs before school begins to make it a lot smoother for all the students, especially new students. The campus itself is beautiful for a Community College and really big."
Alum,5,"Staff is friendly and helpful. Knowledgeable, and do their best to find someone who can help you if they can't. Everyone working there seems to have one goal, and that is to make us graduate.

It is close to home, easy access by public transportation, and reasonably priced. They have a state-of-the-art campus and a very friendly staff. I will be attending this school to complete my core classes before moving on to a larger school. The staff has been incredibly helpful and are very involved with ensuring that I achieve my goal. Appointments are simple to make with the staff to discuss my finances or education."
Sophomore,5,I really enjoyed my past two years at Housatonic Community College. After I graduated High School I was unsure of what I wanted and Housatonic was a perfect place for me to continue my education. I have grown a lot these past two years and I'm currently transferring to a 4- year institute to major in Bimolecular Sciences. All the faculty and staff at HCC are wonderful and will go out of their way to help students. I strongly encourage people to attend HCC to start their college and career paths.
Sophomore,5,"As a graduate of Housatonic Community College this upcoming may, I could not be more thankful for my experience and all that Housatonic has given me. Many doors were opened and I was able to engage in so many new and beneficial opportunities, all of which will better myself towards my career. Although attending HCC wasn't in my original plans, I am so happy with my choice of transferring here for the past four semesters. The academics are good, the professors are great, and diversity is truly present in this college. Many degree programs are offered and there are many fantastic pathway programs for an easy transfer to the surrounding Connecticut State Colleges and Universities."
Niche User,5,"The neighborhood in which Housatonic is located is a bit scary, but the College itself is great. The courses offered are as good as any other school out there and the current administration is very helpful."

Freshman,5,"I had a wonderful experience at Housatonic. Enrollment was straightforward and communication from the school was much better than at Gateway CC. I loved my microbiology professor, Sandra Barnes. She was amazing and provided so many resources for us. Literally the only downside to my experience was the construction going on at the school at the time I was taking class."
Alum,5,I'm very happy with the fact that Housatonic was the school I went to before I headed to a University. It most definitely was the perfect place to do some growing up and it is the place where I found where my passions lie. I got an amazing foundation in the major that I'm studying that I do not believe I would have received anywhere else. I don't believe I will miss the current university I am enrolled in as much as I missed HCC.
College Freshman,5,I believe the staff is what makes Housatonic unique because they're all very helpful to everyones needs.
College Sophomore,5,"Some of the things that I loved about my academic experience was the fact that my art professors had their students exposed to the different types of artists, art forms, etc. There was a few things that I disagreed with as far as the necessary materials needed for class, and yet most of the materials never was used for the entire semester. A lot of the things they asked for us to get were too overpriced. Since I come from a family with a struggling financial issue, I had to work to get these overpriced materials. The facility regarding the art program is actually small, but Housatonic will be getting their own art building. The workload wasn't too bad; it's very much doable if you're always on top of your art homework. However, what really made their art curriculum good is the professors. Amazing staff, and they really go out of their way to help students."
College Sophomore,5,"Amazing professors. They cared about my educational plans, and really cared about their students' learning."

For the same education that you'd get at a fancy university for 40k+, you get at Housatonic Community College. The financial aid office is nice, they are always willing to help and explain things to you, even help walk you through it or give your directions on how to. I would suggest FASFA for HCC, as it'll cover all of tuition and some."
College Student,5,"The professors are fantastic! The work is hard and sometimes heavy, but the results are always worth it. There is a whole section of the college dedicated to the arts, and it's even better when part of the campus is dedicated to being an art museum.

Sophomore,4,"the classes are hard af. the professors are fair. the class times are fair. i dont really have much to say. im anemic, always tired, broke, and out of financial aid. so im here begging for money"
Sophomore,4,Overall had a great experience at HCC. The professors I had really cared about their students and seeing us succeed. Obviously the price tag can't be beat. The  downsides are that the area around campus is kind of sketchy. And on campus there aren't a ton of exciting clubs or anything. I never tried the food.
Sophomore,4,"The greatest aspect of Housatonic Community College is the professors. They are understanding and personable. Professors know all their students by name and take their student's life outside of school into account. Housatonic Community College is a relatively easy campus to get around. The only downside, in my experience, would be the financial aid office. They are not the best with communication. There have been experiences when I have gone to financial aid and they relay their information through students who work at the front desk."
Niche User,4,the people are very friendly. they are also very helpful and resourceful. This is where I want to spend my first few years of college.

Sophomore,4,"My school is one of the few that has great professors at the lowest rate at a  higher education institution in CT. At HCC I have seen great innovations, after they won an Aspen Prize in 2017. HCC has various curricular and extracurriculars to choose from, giving the students lots of ways to develop their  leadership. The college has a student senate, which I am part of and it has various clubs based on the different interests and majors at HCC."
Sophomore,4,"The ground themselves are nice, and so is the staff. So helpful when I was first applying. The classrooms are nice, tidy, and seem up to date in terms of technology"

The faculty at HCC has assisted me in every way that they can in order to help me to become a more successful student and achieve my goals. The students as well as the faculty are very friendly. It is evident that the faculty and advisors at Houston Community College care about your personal and academic success. The professors are willing to go above and beyond in order for you to excel in the class. If I were asked to recommend a 2-year college to someone, Houston Community College would definitely be at the top of my list."

The tutition is a lot less exspensive yet has the top proffesors from Yale and Harvard teaching some of the English and math classes. I am so honored to be a student there.

There is also a wide. Variety of courses taught at this college. I think Housatonic has the ability to move to  give bachelor programs.
College Sophomore,4,The staff of Housantonic make every effort to assist in forging an excellent career prospect for the nursing degree . They invite College and University representative to have discussions   They also host varied amount of career fairs.  Work ing hard and getting a good job isnthenresponsibility of the student. I think the staff really make an effort to assist here.
College Sophomore,4,I am now siting the pre-requisite course for nursing at Housatonic .  The classes so far are great. I particularly enjoyed my microbiology class. My Professor is so well knowledgeable in the subject area. I would have considered major in microbiology if Inhad met her earlier. Anyway think nursing has the upper hand and I will stick it. TheEnglish and Public Speaking classes were also excellent. These professors are striving to get excellent college graduates
College Sophomore,4,"The class sizes are average; nothing special. The professors and the courses are good; top quality education but it's only good if you put in the work. Lots information given, and professors are very helpful. I don't know what class styles means, but the courses offered goes from painting to sculpture to graphic design, photography, drawing classes, etc. Lots of art courses."

I enjoyed my three years there and i would do it all over again. The cost of tuition is affordable and it is a great experience.

College Junior,4,"The quality of the course is great, I haven't any problems with the courses at all. The professors are helpful, they try to teach you the appropriate way.

College Junior,4,Everything for the most part is all laid out for you. There are no surprise fees.
Freshman,2,"Housatonic is a somewhat okay college. However, they could at least add more majors and try to at least make class material less expensive. The same goes for food as it is also highly expensive to buy even a small meal. They could try adding more affordable options for low income/no income/ poor students. Because despite the fact that a college is a place where a student's success depends on them it must be taken into consideration that there are a lot of high schools that don't actually prepare their students for college."
College Sophomore,2,I'm not a fan of the online courses because I feel as I wouldn't be able to learn or comprehend the subject I'm learning.
College Sophomore,2,"Peer-to-peer interactions are non-existent. Registration process is automatic, workload is sometimes overwhelming but forgivable, no unique features, and professor/student relationship is average."
College Sophomore,2,The worst class I took was an online psych 101 course. The professor could not have been less involved in running the class.
College Senior,2,Most kids just were lazy in high school and that's why they're here.
College Senior,2,The wifi always kicks you off constantly. Sometimes the printers in the computer lab's do not work. 
College Sophomore,2,the reason why i give them a C its a lot of work but they do their best on the students . they answer some of our questions but over all they are help ful to us
College Sophomore,2,"i enjoyed my classes and did good in most of them. this ""c"" however came from one of my english teachers, who didnt want me to get what she needed for my grade to remain a ""B+"". what sucked the most about it was that i never got less than a ""b"" on any paper i handed in, in that class."
College Junior,2,"I wanted to score lower but it may reflect the ""people"" in the financial office and I would not want that.They have been wonderful (especially AMY)< however the process has been detrimental to me since there was a hold up on both semesters that I feel could have been taken care of if handled as an isolated case. I have extenuating circumstances regarding getting loans and aid.I am entitled to take loans as a returning student to get myself prepared for nursing school so I can financially be responsible for my children since my husband chose to leave the burden on me when he left. Due to the retrieval tool I had difficulty providing a transcript (which is an extenuating circumstance), and without the exceptions of different situations for all students ,I was left in a huge financial deficit at home. It has made it difficult to concentrate but managed and my eye is on the education."
College Freshman,2,Work Load – My school as far as work in the degree program i am in is an good amount of work and will keep you busy.
College Sophomore,2,I love the fact that my school is so close to were i reside.
College Sophomore,2,Convinience for a Commuter – My school is so conveniently close that i prefer to walk and exercise to stay healthy. Is a + for people who walk or have no kind of transportation as i do.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I only gave this a low rating because I took an online course once and it was a bad experience. It was my first time but, I'm more of a traditional classroom type of learner. I also wasn't interested in the course i took. The workload was a bit hectic. The registration process was easy. Not much communication went on if you weren't active in the discussion boards."
College Freshman,1,"Not for Me – Complete waste of my time. The prof was good, one of the best supposedly in the school, but I learned nothing except that I didn't want to major in the subject (and it had been my first choice of major). It was all writing papers; nothing I couldn't already do. Tests were open book and the intellectual ability of the students in the class was disappointing. These credits are also harder to transfer"

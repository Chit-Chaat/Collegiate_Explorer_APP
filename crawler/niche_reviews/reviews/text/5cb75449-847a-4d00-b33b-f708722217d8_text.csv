Senior,5,"Mount Mercy has provided me with so many great opportunities. The smaller campus size offers a smaller student to staff ratio. This has made such a difference for me. Faculty are easy to get into contact with and can provide a much more individualized experience for students. There are also many different clubs that students can join. I work on campus as a work study student which provides flexible hours between classes. Also, MMU has so many great sport teams. I've met so many great people by being on the soccer team. My college experience has been great due to Mount Mercy."
Senior,5,My online experience has also been great. The faculty are great with communicating expectations and are available for questions.
Sophomore,5,"During Covid the entire school switched to online learning, this is not a way I enjoy trying to learn at all, but the way they handled online classes was amazing. I was still able to learn and receive help from any staff member, they even kept up the student involvement activities online."
Sophomore,5,"It is a small tight-knit community, the entire school feels like one big family. Though it is a religious school they do not force their views on you and are actually very lenient. The staff wants to watch you succeed and will work with you and your schedule."
Junior,5,The teachers and staff really care about you as a person. The academics challenge you but still allow you to succeed. However it is expensive to go there.
Senior,5,"Mount Mercy is great! They have a lot of great professors that believe in your success, I’m constantly being complimented and brought up to believe in myself."
Niche User,5,"A fantastic school, very open to anyone and everyone. Amazing staff/faculty who makes sure each and every student feels secure. They are great at making people want to go there, but for good reasons. I love their programs, and I get to do what I love there!"
Freshman,5,"The professors are amazing and approachable. Every staff member from facilities, security and student services are very helpful"
Niche User,5,I have yet to attend school. but from my experience with the staff and fomerstudents. I can say Mount Mercy is a sanctuary for learning and interesting interactions with everyone there. I attended Scholarship day at the Hill and met with faculty and staff members who were more than willing to help me find my way around campus. I had the opportunity to interview with former students who Knew how to make you feel welcomed to the school attending or not. Overall my Experience at Mount Mercy has convinced me that this is the school for me. I look forward to attending this fall.
Freshman,5,"Everyone at mount mercy is very friendly and nice to one another. everyone knows each others names. All of the staff there, is there for you and will help you with anything. This school helps people find jobs and internships to help you find the job that will set you up for success."

Junior,5,Mount Mercy University is great at making you feel at home.  The university embodies a close-knit community of faculty and students.
Alum,5,The education program really gets you ready to enter the field. The small classes and dedicated professors make for a great experience.
Alum,5,MMU is an excellent place to get your degree. The faculty and staff truly care about your success and will help you achieve your goals. The campus is easy to navigate and tunnels are a bonus!
Sophomore,5,This is going to be specific to nursing majors. Everyone in the department is lovely and the professors are amazing.
Freshman,5,"I am currently a Freshman at Mount Mercy, and I've absolutely loved every minute of it. I've been treated in the best ways possible, and everyone from the music faculty, to the psychology professors, to the admissions staff, and even the president of the school know me, and many others, by name. I've gotten and educational experience that is almost unheard of for a freshman from this school."
Niche User,5,"I have not yet gone to Mount Mercy, but I have visited and it is really friendly and educational. It offers tons of opportunities that I would like to explore when I do go there in the Fall of 2018. I have also heard that the teachers are really helpful and kind."
Freshman,5,I love the small community feel of the campus and feel at home at MMU!! The teachers and classes have been great so far and the friends ive made are even better!
Junior,5,this school is amazing and it offers many classes for anyone who is interested in college.  The staff is hard working and available to speak anytime. The campus is well built and safety is important to the campus. The bookstore is great and offers great prices on books.
Sophomore,5,I like the small school feel of Mount Mercy University.  The teacher to student ratio is excellent and the campus feels like a second home to me.
Sophomore,5,It is a small private university but it is full with possibilities. The professors help with everything you need. As a private university it is expensive but they offer aot of scholarships.
College Sophomore,5,"i get on very well with professors, one of my favorite classes was intro ethics, which challenged my thinking and helped me learn different ways to approach situations in life"
College Sophomore,5,The educational system is far from easy and therefore makes us students equipped with the analytical skills needed in the work place. Many of my friends have went on to find great jobs.
College Sophomore,5,It very safe on campus with rarely if any violence or crimes taking place. Lovely friendly environment where people care for others
College Freshman,5,"Coe is down the road from us and everyone who wants to party goes there or in certain dorm rooms. If you are like and would rather not party, you could get annoyed by loud people that return from parties all the time. Also there are quite a few bars within 10 miles of us but it wont effect you until you live in lower capmus housing."
College Freshman,5,I've had great experiences in all of my classes but one. It was a writing class and it honestly made me feel like I was a better writer before the class than I am after the class.
College Freshman,5,Everyhting you need to have access to if the event of sexual assault were to ever happen but it hasnt happened very recently and currently everone takes the issue very seriously.
College Junior,5,I would definitely choose Mount Mercy again and again if I had the chance. It's a nice small town University that offers many wonderful courses. The professors and other student are ready and willing to help students at any time- everyone really cares about everyone here. I feel safe and appreciated here!
College Freshman,5,The teachers make you feel welcome and like that what to help you succeed. That is not something you find in most high schools.
College Freshman,5,The financial aid people were very nice and easy to talk to.  They didn't try to cheat you.
College Sophomore,5,We have student's from all over the world. I haven't run into anyone who wasn't accepting or was at all racist.
College Sophomore,5,i was very easy. I know many people who have switched majors many times without a hassle. Just do well in high school and know what you can 'offer' to the school.
College Sophomore,5,We always have campus security around but it's not too much
College Freshman,5,"i dont have to go outside, ever!! we have tunnels!"
College Freshman,5,In Cedar Rapids you can get any type of food you would want. There are food chains that the cost is average. There are also many fancier spots in the area that are not to expensive for price.
College Senior,5,"Getting into the psychology program is as simple as signing up for it. That's all you really need. I met with an advisor prior to being admitted, but it wasn't necessarily make or break interview. They just like to ask a few questions to make sure your very interested in the program. It took me about ten minutes in total. But they are willing to accept anyone interested."
College Senior,5,"One thing that is cool about Mt. Mercy is that all of the buildings are connected by underground tunnels, so there is no need to go outside from building to building in the winter. I also love the small classes, as you can get extra help you need from teachers and really interact with your peers."
College Sophomore,5,"Maximum Security. Mount Mercy University is in the most beautiful neighborhood. Students have no concern as to whether they're safe living on campus because of the personal security the campus offers. Security is always on duty, day and night. They may not be serious law enforcers, but the comfort of always having somebody to walk you from one building to the other in the dark is incredible."
College Sophomore,5,"Mount Mercy University is, in my opinion, one of the prettiest places to be in Cedar Rapids. Not only is the University updating, adding on, and renovating buildings, but in addition to that they're improving the landscaping and walking/sitting areas all over campus to enjoy it no matter what the weather is. In the rain, sunshine, and especially fall and winter, Mount Mercy University and it's campus isn't affected. Either way, it's a safe & secure and beautiful place to be."
College Junior,5,"My school is VERY strict when it comes to behaving and looking professionally. We don't mind it--we know that when we get out into the community, we will project professionalism with confidence."
Alum,4,"The nursing program is worth the investment. Local hospitals love to hire nursing students from this program. They challenge you daily, and prepare you to pass your NCLEX from day one."
Alum,4,Online learning was facilitated just like every other online classes I have taken. Faculty are always up to answer your questions and will reply to your questions/ emails in a timely manner.
Sophomore,4,"Mount Mercy is a very peaceful and friendly catholic campus, I would like to see more of college life, we don't have much things to do around. Cafeteria food could be better and we should have better options to eat. Professors are friendly but courses in general are not the best, we don't go in deep with classes generally so I don't feel I learn fully about the field I am studying. In general, people are really nice I can't talk bad about it but there are many things it could improve as a university."
Sophomore,4,Amazing experience so far in and out of the classroom. Lots of one on one teaching and tutoring available to help you succeed.
Sophomore,4,"At Mount Mercy University, the staff members and all of the professors seem to really care about your learning and want you to succeed! They appreciate when students use their resources to get help at any time. You are never doubted to succeed."
Sophomore,4,"I couldn't imagine going to any other school! There is such a warm environment and you immediately feel welcome. The tunnels are an added bonus. One thing that I don't like is housing and food. With Mount Mercy being a small school, it's kind of hard to find a good roommate. My sophomore year I got paired up with someone I went to high school with even though I chose a random roommate. The dorm life could be better."
Junior,4,I love the small school atmosphere and being able to really get to know my professors. It has made a huge difference in my educational experience and I have scored much higher academically because of it.
Junior,4,"For the past two years Mount Mercy University has played a pivotal role in my journey to becoming a nurse. Mount Mercy University offers a strong nursing program that allows student to achieve not just an RN, but their BSN in only four years. The campus is close and easy to navigate. The faculty and staff are eager to help students to achieve their goals. The only thing that is hard about any college is the tuition. I almost didn't attend Mount Mercy University because I believed it to be too far out of my price range. However, it's an amazing university well worth the expense."
Freshman,4,I really enjoy the small campus and the people there. The staff seems really involved and they want to help you. I can’t wait to start!
Senior,4,Mount Mercy University is a great school because of the small class sizes along with its great academic programs. The instructors know you by name and show deep compassion into helping us become prepared for our careers
Freshman,4,"I feel if there was more diversity the school would be so much better. Putting forth that effort and making it seem like they care would change my opinion as well as other minorities in the school,making a difference in the school as a whole. Many issues have surfaced as far as that but, other than that the education is great, I'm learning and for now that's what counts the most."
Senior,4,Mount Mercy University has been the best school I've attended thus far.   I went to a community college and transferred after unsatisfactory conditions and couldn't be happier.
Niche User,4,I really enjoyed how small and close-knit the campus is. The school is small enough where the professor knows everyone's names and I enjoyed that as well.
Junior,4,Professors are very helpful and have personal approach with every student. If you need help they are ready to offer it.
Freshman,4,"I am a Freshman at Mount Mercy University and so far I have had a great experience. The Mount Mercy community is amazing and everyone is so welcoming and friendly. I chose Mount Mercy because of the great atmosphere, when I came to Mount Mercy I just felt like I was at home and it was the right place for me. At Mount Mercy there are so many great opportunities to get involved, faith groups, athletics, academics, clubs, fundraisers, about anything that you can think of Mount Mercy has. The one thing that I want to help change about Mount Mercy is the student engagement in all of these activities. This school has so much to offer an unfortunately student do not take advantage of it. Mount Mercy has turned in to what we call a ""back pack school.""  Overall I love Mount Mercy and it has brought me to some of my closest friends. I cannot wait to continue my education at this school."
Freshman,4,Fantastic school. Teachers are wonderful and classes are fun and challenging. Only downside is the price. But they make up for that with the free tutoring and fun stress busters.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus and they provide many good services that make you feel safe.
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics department is great, with a very outstanding Mens and Womens basketball teams, who made it to the nationals  last year. the coaches are very supportive and encourage us to get good grades."
College Sophomore,4,"Mount mercy is a great school, with not only a great educational program, but a great athletic program. Additional there are many international students which make the school very diverse."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is definitely a different experience than living at home. When I first came to Mount Mercy, I didn't know if I was going to like living by myself and away from my family, but I love it now. Living on campus has given me a chance to meet some new, pretty amazing, and crazy friends, who I can tell are going to last a lifetime. They have honestly been the highlight of my year. The dorms here, are kind of small, but it really depends on how you set up your room. Living on campus is so convenient because it's nice to have somewhere to go to when you have break between classes, or after classes and to have a quiet place to do homework."
College Freshman,4,"The athletics here at Mount Mercy are great. I've only ever been to a few basketball games, but from what I saw, the team puts in 100% effort and they play as a team, not as individuals. When you're on the Mount Mercy campus, almost everyone is wearing some type of athletic wear, whether it's boys or girls basketball, track and field, bowling, baseball, softball, etc. Everyone is supporting everyone on those teams, and it's a great thing to see. It's like we're all one big family and it's another reason why I love it here at Mount Mercy so much."
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience at school has been great so far. When I first came to Mount Mercy on a visit, I fell in love with the campus and how friendly everyone is here. Once school actually started, I was nervous about starting a new school, and meeting new friends, but now, I LOVE going to school here at Mount Mercy, and I wouldn't change the friendships I have. I didn't just come to Mount Mercy to pursue my career in nursing, but I also wanted to continue bowling. Bowling here at Mount Mercy is definitely different than high school bowling, but I love it so much. I have met so many great people on the bowling team and I can tell that no matter what, they will always have my back. I'm so glad that I came here to Mount Mercy because it has definitely been a year to remember, and I can't wait for the next three years."
College Freshman,4,We have quite a view great athletics and are currently trying to get our own atheltic complex.
College Freshman,4,"Going to school here is great, you are surrounded by a lot of caring people. At the same time though that is all you are paying for it seems like. Some classes are great and others make you feel like you will never learn or get better at that course."
College Freshman,4,Most of the alumni come back just to visit their teachers and some even work here themselves. Others work somewhere lese to return and some keep working outside the school.
College Junior,4,"Workload is tolerable, but you have to be willing to put in effort."
College Junior,4,I feel safe on campus.
College Junior,4,The dorms are nice and close to all of your classes. Regina and Andreas are the best!
College Junior,4,Food is cheap and good
College Sophomore,4,There is a wide variety of off-campus dining options. At the beginning of the year the students receive a card that includes discounts for students. Cedar Rapids is very college friendly food price wise.
College Freshman,4,"I think that the rules are appropriately enforced, but I know some people that fly by unseen."
College Freshman,4,"Since I commute I like going to the Hilltop because it is cheaper. When I do go to the cafeteria I like the variety, but now it seems like they always have the same foods."
College Freshman,4,"The food is pretty average.  It's good food and it has variety, but they use a lot of grease.  They are very considerate to allergies and styles of life."
College Senior,4,"Cedar Rapids is the second biggest city in Iowa. The city is very friendly and the shopping is very good. The city's museums are of excellent quality, and there is lots to do around town."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel safe walking to my car at night. Campus takes issues like crime, safety and safety measures seriously."
College Junior,4,Everyone is pretty fair and equal on campus and converses with other students when they can. Pretty friendly atmosphere.
College Junior,4,"Small school, many students get involved in activities and sports on campus"
College Junior,4,Knew what they were talking about. Great help
College Junior,4,smaller school promotes more individual support
College Junior,4,Great instruction and individual support/help
College Junior,4,"Small, provides individual support to all students"
College Junior,4,School is open to all types of students attending
College Sophomore,4,I havent seen or heard any drug abuse issues. The students ive had class with have all been very respectful and i dont foresee them putting peer pressure on anyone.
College Sophomore,4,Cafeteria food is decent. The cost is low and we have a wide range of options. The staff is very friendly and knows most students by first names.
College Sophomore,4,There is almost always a scholarship available no matter your income. You just have to put in some effort to get it.
College Sophomore,4,I love my program. The teachers are helping me find what future job i will want and will help me achieve my goal of getting into that job
College Sophomore,4,There are many activities to attend which i have and have made many friends through it. The school is unique based on the 'sister/nuns' who live on campus and are very friendly.
College Sophomore,4,"Student's attend mostly events on campus, some go off to the off campus events. Soon Mount Mercy will have a brand new facility that will house softball, soccer, and baseball. They will have their own place to practice instead of sharing a field."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my program. It's hard but not too hard. You are taught what you need to know for the real world and teachers are always around to assist you if you need help or have questions. Plus, we have job opprotunities sent to use every week."
College Freshman,4,not many guys but pretty laid back lifestyle
College Freshman,4,sometimes to strict but necessary
College Freshman,4,i get bored of tacos at night
College Junior,4,There are people here from many different areas of the world. Diversity is a big part of the culture at MMU.
College Junior,4,Most of the students on campus are here for sports.
College Junior,4,Weather is not much of an issue here because of the underground tunnels students can use during snow or rain. Students will go sledding down the hill during snow.
College Senior,4,"lots of spots to park, but get there a little early before they fill up."
College Senior,4,lots of places to go!
College Junior,4,"I will plan to student teach Fall semester of my senior year. I have placed requests for which schools I want to be at, and they will take it from there. "
College Junior,4,"Much better than other 4 year universities! Mount Mercy is build on a hill, so once you park your car you get to tromp up the hill, but other than that, it is great! "
College Junior,4,"Cedar Rapids has a ""city feel"" while still being a fairly small city. Small towns and rural areas are not far away. A couple of malls, plenty of restaurants, gyms, etc..."
Sophomore,2,"I have to say that a majority of the true professors there are very caring, but as soon as they find out that you're looking at other schools, the toss you like a hot potato. I didn't find any professors here that seemed to genuinely cared about the students which is disappointing, but that could just be a flaw of mine.

The 'public safety' is a joke. They're so lazy that even though they say they give rides from the parking lot at night (I've never seen), they complain about helping shovel a car out after a snow storm in the day. There was a scam email incident and I was having issues with that so I frantically emailed public safety and 3 months later, still no response.

The food is not good and there have been constant issues with Mount Mercy accepting anything to do with the LGBTQ+ community.

The campus is beautiful and nursing program great, but so many cliques.

Not a great college and way overpriced. Didn't refund all my money after being kicked off campus due to corona."
Freshman,2,"MMU has a very supportive staff and faculty and I enjoyed my professors very much. However they also made me take a class I didn’t need. Social life at MMU is nonexistent. Friend groups are very closed off. A party is drinking in a dorm room or a house. Going to MMU feels like going to a boarding school for high school: it’s high school and you sleep there. I left after just a semester because I was not getting the college experience I had always wanted. They don’t have enough room to house all the students. They’re shoving 12 people into a suite (3 triple rooms) which is way too crowded. However, if you want to live off campus they reduce your scholarships by 3,500."
College Junior,2,"Not many scholarships offered, unless your a freshman"
College Sophomore,2,"The administration is not focusing on the right rules. There are people who are doing drugs, but nobody cares, but if a person parks on a line, they will receive a ticket."
College Sophomore,2,Students have parties on campus in dorm rooms with alcohol and isn't very safe. Student's also bring drugs into dorm rooms. There should be more room checks during the year to prevent students storing items likes this in their dorm.
College Junior,2,I don't know if we have greek life
College Junior,2,It would be nice if security was a little more present. I would feel more comfortable handling situations myself rather than calling them.
College Junior,2,"Technology at MMU is very lacking. We pay a $75 fee every semester for ""technology upgrades"" but nobody has seen any improvements yet. It is very frustrating! "
College Freshman,2,"The parking lot tends to be packed full with commuters during the day, but it is the only parking lot we are allowed to park in. This makes it difficult for the residents when we have nowhere to park. The ticketing is also very random and never done fairly."
College Junior,2,Housing Grade – It can be hard to find houses off campus. When you do they can be expensive around campus.
College Freshman,2,Underaged students are not allowed to have alcohol. The only way you can have alcohol without getting in trouble is if you are 21 and have it in your appartment and nowhere else. In Resisdence Halls every night the RA's make a round to check on students. Plagerism is highly enforced.
College Freshman,1,I believe we only have 2 chapters and they are never spoken about and no one really talks about them.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have a greek life.
College Sophomore,1,"There are very few options and most of them are unhealthy. The alternative dining sites are the same, and we are no able to have more than $25 built into our meal plan, which is not very much. Hours for the dining hall are terrible.  The food is awful. There is nothing good about it in any way."
College Sophomore,1,"Cedar Rapids is a city with no culture, full of chain restaurants and fast food, with nothing to do unless you want to spend money."
College Junior,1,"Although the University does provide many different places to use computers on campus, often times it takes an extreme amount of time to print or sign on to the computer. Also, the network often fails preventing you from logging in and printing necessary materials. The wireless access on campus is pretty much nonexistent, even in the library. In the dorm rooms you must use an ethernet cord and they do not allow you to provide your own wirelss router. Overall, I would say it could be worse but on the otherhand, for how much we pay to go here I would expect better resources."
College Junior,1,"Lots of White Students – Since this is a private catholic college, there is very litte diversity on campus. A majority of the student body is white. Those that are a minority are involved in athletics."

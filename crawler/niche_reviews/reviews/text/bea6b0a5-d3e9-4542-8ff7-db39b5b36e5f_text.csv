Niche User,5,"The college is difficult but rewording. Small but fulfilling. There truly is no better college, TMC has everything you could ever want in a good school"
Niche User,5,"TMC has one of the most rigorous academic course of any college I know. This is however, a good thing, because you learn a lot of it you work hard, you won’t fail as the teachers are very interested in the success of every student. The college is small with just over 100 people but that simply makes it all the better, and if you really want it a little bigger, I heard they are planning to slightly increase that number."
Alum,5,"Other larger institutions may claim they have a good community, but it is only at Thomas More College where the student encounters authentic community."
Alum,5,Great college for those that want to learn and take their education seriously.  TMC grads gain admission to the top law/grad schools.  You are part of a community that takes a vested interest in your growth as a student as well as a person.
College Senior,5,"Thomas More College is a near ideal place to learn the best that has been thought and said, and to live a good and virtuous life."
College Junior,5,"I love all of my classes and the professors are fantastic. Every one of them is an expert in their field and they genuinely care about your progress.They are more than willing to help you with anything and everything. The Socratic method promotes genuine learning as opposed to simple memorization and it involves the students on a deeper level. Class sizes are small, which encourage participation and facilitate more intimate discussions."
College Junior,5,"I love my school because it's one of the few places I've seen that aren't simply telling you to memorize facts or accept ideas because ""that's how it is"" or some other such nonsense. Their use of the Socratic method ensures that you are presented with ideas, both ancient and modern, but are able to choose your own side through logical reasoning. So long as you argue rationally, you are permitted to present any side of any argument. This teaches you to think, listen, and learn, much as you have to do in real life, rather than sit, memorize, and repeat like robots as seen in other schools."
College Freshman,5,TMC offers one of the best liberal art educations in the country.
College Freshman,5,A great education that promotes students to think beyond the text while also leading students to a personal discovery of truth and the good life.

College Freshman,5,"No drugs are really noticeable on campus. Some students may partake in them, but it is not prevalent on campus."
College Junior,5,"The application process is typical.  There are a series of essay questions, transcript submission, and letters of recommendation. The students at my college are clearly geared toward a focus on academics and a lot of reading, especially in classical texts. Applications that show a seriousness for learning will have a better chance for success."
Freshman,4,"I really like Thomas More. It's a very small Catholic college, and they're really big on community here. There are only about 100 students altogether, so you get to know everyone well while you're here. The professors are really invested in your intellectual growth and there is a big emphasis on participation in class. The campus, the different guilds we are offered, and the traditions here make the experience a complete one. We went hiking in the White Mountains for orientation, and one of the classes that we freshman take is one about studying and getting closer to nature. I would reccomend Thomas More to anyone who is interested in a solid education and who dislikes the huge numbers of students and the routine and somewhat rushed nature of many large colleges and universities today."
Sophomore,4,The small community lends itself to true engagement with the classics and fosters the necessary tools to encounter and express ideas.
Freshman,4,"It was one of the best experiences I have ever had in my life.   I truly believe God meant for me to see this place, because after I experienced the college and its community, I became a better person.  I appreciated my homeschooled education more because of Thomas More College.  It's not the easiest thing for me to explain, but I know I was meant experience such a place as Thomas More College."
College Junior,4,"Students graduating from this school are general well-spoken, intelligent, and hard workers. They make excellent material for any job they care to undertake."
College Junior,4,I feel perfectly safe on campus.
College Junior,4,"Personally, I love the dorms. They're small, but cozy, and the common areas are right outside your doors instead of long hallways. There are always people chatting, sharing snacks, and drinking tea, and you're always welcome to join them. Everything on campus is close together so I can simply carry my books for one class at a time and walk back to swap books in between classes. Your assigned room is always easy to find, and anyone who isn't a freshman is always more than willing to help you if you have any questions."
College Freshman,4,Small classes allow students to get to know the professors and be able to converse with them in and out side the classrooms.
College Freshman,4,The education promotes one to seek out and learn of the good life and then use that to contribute to society.
College Freshman,4,That campus life is has a great atmosphere which is made stronger through christian companionship.
College Freshman,4,I have no reasons to feel unsafe on campus.
College Freshman,4,Majority of the students on campus are very good looking. Most of the men are athletes. Also a lot of the women are involved in sport. The student are very nice and pleasing to be around.
College Freshman,4,"The options are pretty good , but the are very familiar to me because I have lived in this area since I was a child."
College Freshman,4,The scene is average. Some people find more party times then others.
College Freshman,4,"I don't live on campus, but I hear great things about the living spaces."
College Freshman,4,We have more than one facility available on campus. Also the facilities meet the needs of the students very well.
College Junior,4,The Thomas More College of Liberal Arts is School that teaches the student how to learn and become a better human being. The Academics are strict forcing the student (at any level really) to raise thier standards and meet the constant requirements.
College Junior,4,Down the road either way there is a Dunkin' Doughnuts.  There is also an Italian restaurant and a pizza restaurant nearby.
Alum,1,"I came to TMC through the most unlikely of circumstances. My time there had ups and downs, but it was one of the most challenging and informative experiences of my life. Since I graduated about almost 6 years ago, I have become disappointed with the direction it seems to be going. The professors an honest bunch, concerned with truth and not indoctrination. 

That all seems gone now. The open but faithful examination of the truth seems to be subordinated to a political ideology now. It is strange that, in 6 years, a school that changed me so much and caused me to question so much about the world and what I thought I knew could sell out so hard to political ideologues and even employ them. 

TMC used to be better than real. It provoked beautiful changes. Now it is another factory for cultural warriors and adding to the looming student debt crisis."
College Sophomore,1,"Overall it is difficult to attend this school and stay satisfied. There is not much allowance for independence or individual thought. Much of the day is structured and you must stick to it. The campus is teeny tiny and only about 100 students total in attendance, so you get to know everyone a little too well and they can become annoying, like having a second, weird family."
College Sophomore,1,Not Available – If you need transportation bring your own vehicle or be prepared to borrow a vehicle from someone else or pay a taxi.

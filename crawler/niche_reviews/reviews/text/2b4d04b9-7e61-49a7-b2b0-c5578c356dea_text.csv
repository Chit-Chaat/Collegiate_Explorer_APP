Sophomore,5,"Very beautiful campus and easy to get around. Got everything out of my courses so far that I would want. Professors are engaging and feel like they care. Dorms are clean and feel safe. The on-campus food options are varied and good, though expensive without a student discount."
Freshman,5,So far everything is very nice and easy to understand. I have spoken to some of my teachers and I feel a great relationships in the making. They are trying their best to make our classes go smoothly.
Freshman,5,"The campus is very safe, and is close to Harrisburg area that has a great local scene. I have not personally lived in the dorms so I cannot comment on that. But the professors and academic advisors here always make you feel comfortable and are great in assisting you towards your goals."
Freshman,5,"I am just about to get enrolled to Penn State College, but I'm excited about there programs and so far people I communicated with seem helpful."
Freshman,5,I liked the option for virtual tours and being able to see that the school will indeed be a good environment for me. The amount of activities and resources provided for students seems limitless.
Junior,5,"The campus is very inviting and I am enjoying my time here! The gym could be a little bit bigger considering the amount of kids that use it, but it's still nice. MY professors are very understanding and make me feel comfortable in the classroom."
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy the campus at Penn State Harrisburg. It is always very clean and groomed. Everything is very easy to get to and the campus is very easy to navigate. It is not too big or too small.
Sophomore,5,"Academics- excellent! would be same as main campus
Diversity- tons of asian kids 
Athletics- may not be good but I know my  school has potential, and I think Track is currently the strongest
Professors- great! it just needs more professors because campus is growing and exceeding 5000 students.
Commuting- not bad but takes 25-35 mins for me. I take toll now to save myself from traffic which happens quite a lot around 7-9am and 3-6pm
Safety- safe as it can be
ROI- very affordable campus
Campus- beautiful but really tiny. should do more landscaping and be more enviromental
Party scene- i dont go but it seems okay 
Local- yikes boring town ever......
Campus food- i mean amazing chefs!! but seriously overpriced..i just bring but it really expensive
Student life- great due to you being somebody and not a number, free or very cheap trips, and they do a lot but i hope they add more things because this is why i love PSH."
Freshman,5,"Helpful faculty, friendly students, clean campus, beautiful landscaping, and delicious food make Penn State Harrisburg a great place to go to college."
Junior,5,"As an adult student attending Penn State Harrisburg has been challenging and rewarding. Everyone of my professors have been outstanding. Their knowledge, professionalism, and teaching ability has exceeded my expectations. Penn State and its professors give you the tools needed to succeed and attempt to help you to do so. Personal issues have hindered my ability to complete classes last semester. Because of this Penn State took away my student aid. Naturally I am biased for myself, but I do believe my student aid should've been reinstated."
Sophomore,5,The thing that I like most about PSU is their small classes that allow students to interact with each other in an academic atmosphere.
Freshman,5,I love the diversity I saw on the campus.  Everyone was so friendly and focus.  I also loved how what ever assistance you  need there is some on to help.
Senior,5,"Penn State Harrisburg, is conveniently located off the local highway making it easy to access. All of the professors are always available to help no matter if its school or personal life related. The campus is beautiful and student friendly. It is also the only Penn State campus in the area offering second degree accelerated nursing"
Freshman,5,"I liked the cost of it. It's very cheap, and also since it is so small its been easy to make friends."
Niche User,5,"The focus on academic excellence is revering. In addition to the heavy focus on academics, this college provides students with a plethora of activities outside of the classroom. Students can join clubs, participate in sports, and be part of a musical ensembles. The faculty members are always there to aid students struggling with their academics through tutoring and even provide services such as mock interviews to prepare them for the tangible world. All in all, PennState gives students the full college experience, while preparing them for what is to come in their future."
Junior,5,Penn state Harrisburg is awesome! I'm in the kinesiology major and all the  faculty is super knowledgeable and willing to help. Everyone is really helpful and the environment is really nice.
Freshman,5,"I have since moved on to University Park, but I loved my experiences at PSU-Harrisburg. Being a commuter, I do not have much input on housing or parties, I found it very easy to obtain any assistance that I needed from professors or college staff members. The food was always good when I stopped in, there is a pretty good selection for campus size. Middletown is a very quiet neighborhood, and I was actually considering staying long at this campus due to loving the area."
Sophomore,5,Penn State Harrisburg has a very supportive staff willing to work with you in any circumstance. The community is very nice and I feel at home.
Senior,5,"Penn State Harrisburg has, overall, provided a great college experience. It is relatively small, but makes it easier to create personal connections with professors. There are many events throughout the school year as well to meet new people."
Alum,5,I transferred to Penn State Harrisburg my sophomore year and loved it. They offer a variety of classes and class times that fit your schedule. Smaller class sizes allowed me to establish a connection with my professors and felt comfortable to go to them with any questions.
Freshman,5,"I love this campus! If you're looking for a small, friendly, lively school, come here! The campus is very diverse and over 20 nations are represented in the student body. The staff are all wonderful and really want to see you succeed! The students on and off campus are friendly and helpful. There are over 30 clubs, free tutoring, therapy services, and trips available to just students. Penn State Harrisburg is a great campus!"
Freshman,5,"Safe campus, not overly crowded, excellent teaching, plenty space for exercise or activities, friendly, diversity, convenient transportation including air, train, and bus."
Freshman,5,"Great school, challenging courses but not too hard, and great faculty.  Good course selection, simple online system, and great food and campus.  One of the safest campuses in the state, and great atmosphere.  New buildings, maintenance is impeccable, and library system is great."
Sophomore,5,This is the best college to go in. Its fun and lively and has greatly qualified professors. They have a nice environment and overall a good college degree value for future.
Freshman,5,"So far I can't find anything wrong with this school. While it is expensive, it's rightfully so and also gives a fair bit in scholarships. The Professors are fantastic and engaging while the student body is Diverse and Caring."
Junior,5,"I liked everything about Penn State Harrisburg. The campus is beautiful, the staff is very friendly, and the students that help with tours of the college are very helpful and know what they are talking about. Overall, my experience at PSU Harrisburg has been excellent."
Freshman,5,"I recently started going to college @ Penn State Harrisburg and I couldn't be happier! It is truly a great school with great professors! I graduated high school in 2013, so my adjustment has been made easier due to this great school!!"
Freshman,5,Penn State is a great College to interact with other and looking forward to your intended major. It offers many opportunities and flexible hours. You can join sports and professors are always their to help you in what they can. It is a divers campus class are smaller with means you get much more communication with proffesors.
Freshman,5,"I think Penn State Harrisburg is the best branch of Penn State. It is a small campus that offers a ton of opportunities. The smallest campus size brings unity with the students and professors. If I had to recommend a school to anyone, it would be Penn State Harrisburg."
Sophomore,5,I like this university because of the very well educated and established teaching staff and the small class size offers more one on one and more learning opportunities no matter your field of study
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are better than most college professors, and they really care about the students. If you express to them your need for help, they will be willing to help at any time."
College Sophomore,5,"I believe that I will be able to get a job out of college with no problem, but the options are available whenever I would like to start looking."
College Sophomore,5,"It was rated the safest college in the nation, and I completely agree with it. Never have I seen a problem on this campus."
College Sophomore,5,"I've been to a variety of colleges, and this campus has the best housing I've seen. A lot of effort and work has been put into these dorms."
College Sophomore,5,"There is always a new person to meet, and always something to do. If you're bored or lonely, you're not using your resources well enough."
College Sophomore,5,The Kappas are pretty popular
College Sophomore,5,There is seriously no alcohol or drugs on campus.
College Freshman,5,school spirit in football games is very high a lot of students attend and enjoy the games
College Junior,5,We were rated the safest school in the United States
College Junior,5,"Perfect place for an Engineering Student Like myself, and even if you don't like it after a year you can transfer ALL of your credits to University Park (Much Different Atmosphere). Come here if you get the chance! You won't regret it!"
College Junior,5,"Perfect place for an Engineering Student Like myself, and even if you don't like it after a year you can transfer ALL of your credits to University Park (Much Different Atmosphere). Come here if you get the chance! You won't regret it!"
College Junior,5,"Friendly Students and Faculty, Great Post-College Employment Rate, and Cheap Tuition. The School is constantly growing with a new building that opened last year for engineering labs and a new Student Center opening this Summer. Plans are for even more buildings to go up. The Social Atmosphere here is great. Not a ""Party School"" per se but if you want to have fun there are plenty of parties as well as school run activities and bars around town. 15 minutes away from Harrisburg. Great school for Engineering, Biology, Criminal Justice, and Political Science. Other programs may be just as good. Plenty of ways to get jobs on campus, intramurals on campus, sports teams, and clubs."
College Freshman,5,the campus was rated #1 in safety last year!
College Freshman,5,I love Penn State! The professors that I've had so far have been great and so helpful whenever i need the help! The career services center has already been a great help and I'm only in my first year! They lay out an academic plan for you right away which is very helpful when it comes to scheduling!
College Freshman,5,"I am in my freshman year, so far I am having a very postive and enjoyable experience."
College Junior,5,Everyone at Penn State loves Penn State. I'm not a sports person but even I get caught up in the hype.
College Freshman,5,The campus is very diverse there are a lot of people from different countries.
College Freshman,5,"We do have a lot of fan support and the team performance is good, it could be better but they are good enough."
College Freshman,5,It's a very safe campus also it was voted the safest campus in Pennsylvania.
College Freshman,5,The courses are very easy to understand and the professors will help the students out a lot but you have to ask for the help.
College Student,5,I feel very safe on campus. We have the campus police and there are many phone stands around campus if you need help. There is little to no crime on campus.
College Junior,5,Very prestigious internationally renowned school
College Junior,5,Professors are really involved in one understanding and learning the subject at hand and succeeding in our career goals.
College Student,5,"My overall experience in school is great so far. In high school, I didn't have many varieties of classes where I could choose to take, it was mandatory to take English, Math, History, and Science. Taking those 4 subjects I wasn't able to take enough other classes which made it a little bit dull. In college, I'm able to choose all the classes I want to take and I'm having a great time taking the classes. I am able to experience in being independent living on campus. There aren't many events in college, but some of them really catch my attention and interest, especially the Trivia that I have been attending every week. Our school is pretty unique because it's in a rural area and I have lived in the city/suburbs so it is a new experience for me. I would choose Penn State Harrisburg again because if it wasn't for this place, I wouldn't have met such great people."
College Freshman,5,So many different opportunities availible !
College Sophomore,5,"I LOVE Penn State Harrisburg.  I am learning new things school related and non school related,  I live in an off campus apartment right next to the campus and can walk to school, everyone is very friendly and I am meeting some of the greatest people ever. Both teachers and students !"
College Sophomore,5,Im currently at penn state harrisburg and the campus is so unique. The people here treat everyone with respect and care. The teachers here are very helpful in class and outside of class. Im currently on the track team and we are pretty good this year. To be at penn state harrisburg for my first semester it sure feels like im aroumd family and friends that I have known my whole life. If i could choose between penn state harrisburg and any other school I would gladly stay where im at.
College Junior,5,All the off-campus housing selections were built recently so they are modern and high quality. There is even another housing choice being built right now. The parking is great for all of them. Some have their own security guards that drive around the outside to just maintain order and actually to try to settle issues without getting the cops involved.
College Freshman,5,"I love everything about this campus! The social atmosphere is superb, and I feel at my best here"
College Freshman,5,"I live in campus heights, I found it very easily and love it"
Junior,4,"Great campus, not too large but stingy about aid. Athletics and surrounding area are really lacking but the professors aren't too bad and there are lots of opportunities for students"
Freshman,4,"I really love the communication at Penn State Harrisburg. It’s been a crazy start to my college experience but they answer all my questions, respond fast, and I feel very comfortable."
Senior,4,"Offers a Penn State experience with fewer crowds.  The diversity is unexpected for the location, but appreciated.  Depending on the class type, class size can range from 20-140 students."
Senior,4,"Considering my professors never taught online, classes were okay.  The only difficulties experienced were for group projects and presentations.  Besides those issues, classes felt as normal as possible."
Freshman,4,"I have started taking classes online. I personally prefer in person, but Penn State has made an effort to make Zoom easier."
Freshman,4,"online classes seem interesting, and very helpful that If I get stuck on a problem they will give me time to solve it while also helping me understand the problem."
Freshman,4,"Pros: Beautiful campus, wonderful professors. My advisor is always there to help. Lots of resources for students. With so many clubs and events even this 24 year old freshman didn't feel out of place.
Cons: upperclassman dorms are about 1 km from the main building and PA winters are cold."
Sophomore,4,My experience as a freshmen at Penn State Harrisburg was pretty good. professors are very out going and they are very helpful.  The students/ class-mates are nice and out-going. What I like about Penn State is that its very diversity.
Sophomore,4,"The only online class that I took was in second semester. Actually everyone had to take their class online due to the corona virus. All of my professors were pretty understanding with student's problems, and they were pretty cooperative and helpful. Though it was kind of hard to learn everything online but all my professors tried their best to teach us in their best ability."
Freshman,4,It is a good school. There are a lot of great activities to explore on campus and the educators offer good opportunities.
Sophomore,4,"Harrisburg has a great community of people here. You could get along with anyone and find so many groups to be a part of, you'll constantly have friends to talk to in between classes. The professors range from incompetent to amazing, check out rate my professor to make sure they don't have an accent you can't understand."
Freshman,4,"The food is ok. The people are really nice. The professors are really nice and helpful. Just about all the workers here are really helpful, like you can go up to anybody and ask a question and they’ll try to help you out. It’s a little small, but peaceful campus. Nothing much really goes on. There are also all kinds of events going on campus sometimes, like a lunar new year celebration or a south-East Asian food thing. It’s really cool. The food is ok tho. They have like meal plans here and tbh only get the first meal plan because it’s a lot of money to spend."
Sophomore,4,The school has a small issue in communication between class times. If you follow the recommended academic plan you may result in classes that over lap (which it shouldn't).
Freshman,4,"I'm looking to transfer in the Fall of 2020, but from my visits in the winter i'm really impressed with PSU Harrisburg. The campus looks small but very diverse and everybody seems friendly. I was a former recruit for basketball and a high school standout so im looking to continue hoopin for a college. The academics seem solid. Heard it was hard, but heard the professors are very helpful and connect to your learning needs. Will look more into it but it seems like somewhere that I can transfer to and finish out the rest of my college career."
Freshman,4,"As a High school senior, finding the correct college or university is hard, but when I visited Penn State Harrisburg, I felt like I was at home (literally!). Of course it is a small campus, but because it is small, the close-nit community feels perfect for a first-year student."
Senior,4,"This is a great campus to study at, especially in terms of Engineering. It gives the feel of enjoying a rather big campus, environmentally, without sacrificing a one on one relationship with the professors/instructors."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Penn State Harrisburg is that there are a lot of resources for students around campus, such as career services, student life services, tutoring help, and many more."
Sophomore,4,Penn state harrisburg has been a good experience it is not like the main campus I think maybe half or more of the students are commuters and most live in off campus housing right next to the school. On the bright not as many scandals as a result
Senior,4,I would love for this campus to be more sustainable. I would like for us to start a campus community garden where students and the dining hall can have access to fresh produce to increase sustainability.
Sophomore,4,"Small enough where you don't need to run around to find your classes, great people and teachers. they have a very small gym and not many food options. Not much to do in the area surrounding the campus unless you have a car or commute."
Freshman,4,"The thing that I liked most is the campus. The campus is nice and quiet. There are also plenty of things that go on around the campus that keep all the students involved and together. Also, the sports are very good, they have several championships."
Senior,4,"I enjoy going to school at Penn State Harrisburg, I went to another college before this one and I like it here a lot more. The layout of the campus is easy to understand and access. I think the population of the school may be growing too much."
Sophomore,4,I am bee in garden here since three semester. I got transfer credit from another state college. Some credit helpful but some doesn’t.
Sophomore,4,I love the small class sizes. It allows for more interaction between the professors as well as other classmates. It makes the environment easy to learn in. The free tutoring is a major help because it gives students all around access to the study tools they need.
Alum,4,"The location of the campus was very nice. Still a growing campus.  Largest branch campus.  Lots of student activities to keep busy and feel included. Intramurals, clubs, sports, are all offered to students.  Professors are very willing to help and genuinely want the students to succeed."
Sophomore,4,"I love Penn State Harrisburg because there are so many clubs, activities, and opportunities on campus that will provide fun, experience, and growth as a person. There is also male and female Greek life that adds a flare to the campus. I would like to continue to see the campus grow as it does each day."
Junior,4,"Penn State Harrisburg has faculty that cares and devotes time to your education like no other place. Unfortunately, it doesn’t allow for much of a social life considering it’s a fairly isolated campus."
Sophomore,4,"Love it. So much to do on such a small campus. Everyone is friendly, and knows each other. Time flys when you have fun at the Burg!"
Freshman,4,"I think overall Penn State Harrisburg is a great school. The students and faculty are nice and helpful. However, personally I think the new student orientation is excessively long."
Niche User,4,"Campus is very nice and kept clean, all of my professors seem to know what they're talking about (and they also all have doctorates), the library is very niceAnyways, I wouldn't recommend this school if you're planning on living here. Especially when you can hear everything your roommates are doing at all times, it gets extremely annoying (I've lost so much sleep). The school clearly does not care about nutrition so don't be forced into buying the most expensive meal plan in the US. The academics are the only decent pro here, so if you're a commuter then the school is fine. However , do not come here if you're planning on living here."
Niche User,4,Penn State Harrisburg has very good environment for studies to learn. They have variety of clubs and organizations and other events for Penn State students to participate. They however do not offer many majors.
Freshman,4,"I love the smaller class sizes and academic focus on campus.  I also like the quietness experienced (work-focused atmosphere).  I don't like, however, the lack of activities to do on or around campus.  There are literally no parties even if I wanted to go and the town near campus is not one to really hang out in.  Great for my grades, but not for my social life."
Senior,4,This campus isn't nearly as busy as University Park.  Depending on your colleges goals that might be a benefit or   detriment. The professors and academics are great.  The academic facilities aren't world class. Classes can be very full and rooms to small.
Sophomore,4,Penn State Harrisburg offers a variety of courses at their campus. A great off campus site to commute. Would like  to see more scholarships offered to students from middle class families.
Freshman,4,"Penn State Harrisburg is a wonderful campus. From it's rolling hills across campus, to its active organizations and events throughout every week, PSH is a great first campus to attend. While there aren't many clubs, maybe about twenty, every club is quite active. Administration, professors, and even upperclassmen are all very helpful and friendly. I wish I could complete my degree [Global and International Studies] here but the campus is primarily science and engineering based."
Junior,4,Penn State Harrisburg has a good community with having most of the student housing close to each other. There is a bunch to get involved with at the campus but the campus is not good at making it easy to get signed up and spreading the word about clubs and events. All of the building are very nice and are well kept. The housing is probably the best part with having very nice apartments and dorm living.
Junior,4,Penn State Harrisburg is not bad. The campus is kind of small. On campus dorms are okay but Juniata Hall is pretty nice. Most students are commuters. Student life and the party scene are not live.
Freshman,4,"Penn State Harrisburg is a very welcoming campus. The students are all very friendly and it is easy to meet so many new people. All of the professors are willing to give extra help to anyone that needs it whether it is in regards to more explanation about the course material, or just help with any personal problems. The campus is in a nice location, close to a train station, airport, a few restaurants, multiple gas stations, and a few grocery stores all within a mile or two of the campus. There are multiple places to eat all with a variety of foods. The main dining hall always has different food options every day which is great. Overall, Penn State Harrisburg is a great school, small, welcoming, allows you to be who you are, and gives you so many opportunities to try new things and expand your horizons."
Junior,4,"PSH is great if you want smaller classes and one on one with professors. all classes are taught by a professor. It's a small campus but located 15 minutes from harrisburg,pa. I would want the school to improve their own campus activities and food."
Freshman,4,"Nice, small school. Very safe, and friendly environment. Professors are interactive, and quick when it comes to teaching the material."
Freshman,4,"For reference, I'm from Southern California before I moved out here to Harrisburg. The campus is aesthetically nice, everyone is very helpful for the most part, and every teacher i've had has been extremely insistent on helping their students as much as they can. It's more on the isolated side, you'll get that hint when you see the fact that we have a cornfield on campus. "
College Sophomore,4,"There is a huge fan base for the sports, and never a lack of school pride. There are too many sports to follow though, but there's something for everyone."
College Freshman,4,"Most of the classes i am satisfied. Though some of them are a little disappointing, or the style are not appreciated by many of the students"
College Sophomore,4,i have not encountered and assaults
College Sophomore,4,Our Basketball team wins most games
College Junior,4,Penn State Harrisburg is a small school with great professors and a nice atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,"professors enjoy teaching class rooms are average size which allows you to get to know your professor and your professor to get to know you easier, a huge variety of courses are offered"
College Freshman,4,penn state has one of the biggest alumni networks
College Freshman,4,"there are buttons all around campus that you can press if you feel unsafe or are in trouble and security will come and walk you to your dorm, or if you are not sober and can not make it safely to your dorm there a phone number you can call where campus security will take you to your dorm"
College Freshman,4,"the dorm rooms are very nice, they just built a new student center thats amazing, the campus is clean and easy to navigate around"
College Freshman,4,the greek life is full of great people and bring a good atmosphere to the school
College Freshman,4,good school small good for an incoming freshman
College Sophomore,4,"I don't know much personally about this, but athletics seem to be big on this campus."
College Junior,4,"Division 3 School and alot of student athletes, but nothing compared to University Park. Fan turnout is great taking into account campus size. Teams are not always so great... The Gym is sometimes crowded during the early afternoon but has everything you need and more if you are a Novice or Regular Athlete / Body Builder. Intramurals are a fantastic way to meet people and get involved and NEVER conflict with classes."
College Freshman,4,"This campus has many fitness classes to offer! They have P90X, a spin class, yoga, zumba, core abs class, and even insanity! The fitness loft and the weight room are super nice but I prefer going to the classes personally. They are awesome and super fun!"
College Freshman,4,While I am not involved in any athletics I know that athletics are a fairly important part of campus life. All fields are nice and generally well taken care of.
College Freshman,4,I like how the small school allows for professors to know individual students and also gives them the time to meet with them when necessary. Professors are all very passionate about their students and ensuring that they succeed.
College Sophomore,4,Known for safety with a police station very close. I feel no need to feel unsafe.
College Sophomore,4,Penn State is a great school to come from and it does not matter which campus.
College Sophomore,4,They have nice layouts and it's nice to have separate rooms.
Sophomore,2,Took the second half of a semester online after the initial outbreak. Felt it was a big step down in quality and not worth my time or money to continue taking them until normal conditions return.
Alum,2,The academics did not prepare me for graduate school or the academics a University Park. There were no to very few opportunities for students in science that did not plan on going into medicine. Most faculty was very unhelpful and absolutely did not care about the students. They would hand you an A so you wouldn't complain about the class or so their ratings went up.
College Sophomore,2,This campus does not cater to non-traditional students very well.  It's been a struggle to get anything done or get ahold of someone to help me figure out schooling and school-related issues for as long as I've been a part-time/non-traditional student.
College Junior,2,Only about 10% of students can be in the on-campus dorms with no guarantee for freshman. Off-Campus Housing is OK however Management sucks there.
College Senior,2,"I have never paid attention to Penn State sports, so I can't really speak to this issue."
College Junior,2,"This campus is absolutely awful. They don't seem to care about their students needs at all. The food in Stacks is nasty, the advisers do not do their job properly, and it just seems like they make college life WAY harder than it needs to be. It seems that just about everyone here has a hard time e-mailing you back in a timely manner, besides my Psychology professor Dr. Harrison. When I talked to my adviser about transferring, she did not even try to talk me out of it, she just signed the paper and sent me on my way. Which is fine with me because the sooner I get off this campus the better. As far as campus jobs, the bookstore seems like they don't want to hire anyone, since I never heard back after they told me I would. I would not recommend anyone go to this campus unless you are commuting. I am glad to be leaving next semester and I do not plan on attending grad school here."
College Junior,2,The only place for food is Stacks and it is expensive.  There is a new building that is being built right now and they are going to have a few more food options for campus.
College Freshman,2,"There needs to be more options. They need to speed up the expansion and addition of dining halls, because the current one is beyond mediocre. It's sad, really."
College Freshman,2,"Hardee's isn't very good, and can get repetitive. I expected more of the mom and pop pizza shops, and everything else is just sad. You have to go all the way to Harrisburg just to find something decent to eat."
College Junior,2,Greek life has very little influence on the campus. There are a few sororities and fraternities but they do not have their own housing as of yet.
College Junior,2,I commute to campus so I do not regularly attend parties every weekend on campus. I have heard from multiple students that the parties are very small and there are usually only 1-2 to attend to per weekend.
College Junior,2,Harrisburg and the surrounding areas are starting to diminish. There is very little public transportation and night life is non-existent. There are a few semi-pro sports teams for amusement but other than that the city of Harrisburg is in a downward spiral.
College Freshman,2,The food is way over priced and they don't have a lot of GMO free options.
College Sophomore,2,Not much that is close to school
College Sophomore,2,Middletown is the definition of the middle of nowhere
College Senior,2,"The school is in Middletown, a town in close proximity to Harrisburg. Middletown in a rundown town that only has grocery stores, wine and spirit shoppes and several small retailers. This town is a far cry from the college town surrounding nearby Elizabethtown. There is nothing to do on weekends, as a result, many students go home every weekends. Harrisburg doesn't fare much better and is a really sketchy place. If students don't go home, they flee to main where there are endless things to do. In the past year, the owners of apartment complex for students has begun to provide events such as trivia night on Thursdays during the spring semester and a ""block party"" at the end of the spring semester. It's not much, but its a start."
College Sophomore,2,The drug scene is not bad. I never see any drugs anywhere.
College Sophomore,2,There are no good diners around. Some times I dont even eat for days at a time.
College Sophomore,2,"The academics are great and 

I think that more people should come here."
College Sophomore,2,The computers are very slow. The internet rarely works. I really wish they would upgrade them.
College Freshman,2,Really not much in middle town for dining but I don't live or eat much here so I couldn't be wrong
College Junior,2,it's penn state....we party but there are severe consequences if you're caught.
College Sophomore,2,There are no local attractions unless you want to travel to Harrisburg.
College Freshman,2,"barely anything around here, only a hardees, mcdonalds, taco bell and a wendys."
College Sophomore,2,"Again, I commute.  If it is snowing, freezing rain, etc. it makes the commute horrible and dangerous."
College Sophomore,2,"Judging Penn State Harrisburg food, and the worst restaurant that I have ever eaten at, there is no comparison. They both suck. It is also over-priced, if you live off-campus or are an upperclassmen, you have a better choice cooking your own meals. You will save a lot of money compared to buying a meal plan. "
College Freshman,2,They play themselves up a lot but as soon as you touchdown they have no mercy and don't really care about anything about collecting their money.
College Freshman,2,We've had a couple overdoses this year.
College Freshman,2,Bad food and very expensive unless you have their on campus meal plan.
College Freshman,2,Nothing to do in town and there just isn't much to do.
College Sophomore,2,Not many places close to campus.
College Senior,2,"Not many options, city is very dangerous."
College Freshman,2,There are SOME scholarships but not many.
College Freshman,2,There really isnt much on campus other than Stacks.
College Freshman,2,There aren't many sports to do here besides some inter-murals. The main sports are at University Park
College Junior,2,"The athletic department is very political. Which is a shame for a DIII school because students that want to be athletes should be fun and get sufficient amount of playing time, but this is not the case.
Some facilities are very well kept others are not. Team performance from my own experience is almost nonexistent, mostly because of the politics. The student body is supportive and is in high attendance for games/matches."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is fine and understandable during the school semester. Otherwise during the summer it becomes a pain and burden for those who do not go to the school. For instance for a friend to come and use the gym or track area, parking has to be paid. That is not fair; for parking should be opened for all during the summer."
College Sophomore,2,"Dining at Penn State Harrisburg is fine for the first month or two, but then it becomes a routine. The same types of food tend to appear."
College Sophomore,2,"Without the campus shuttle and personal friend rides, transportation at Penn State Harrisburg is not applicable."
College Sophomore,2,"When winter comes, snow follows, and unfortunately classes don't get cancelled. When summer arrives, the sun shows up, all dread being in class, and you get to see and meet Penn State Harrisburg students."
Alum,1,"My main problem with the school stems from the quality of education, because the atmosphere and diversity are fine. The mechanical engineering department has too few professors for the amount of students in the program. Profs try their best but most are teaching in excess of 6 classes. There are so few profs that it is very common to not get into a class because there are a limited number of seats and sections. Additionally the school thought it would be okay to schedule non engineering classes in the ME computer lab. This lab has ~40 seats for the 200+ students in the program and then they allow unrelated deciplines to host classes in a lab that is already difficult to find time in. Basically if you are going for engineering, just go to main campus. Also my tuition increased significantly every year i attended."
Sophomore,1,"If you are interested in outside of school activities, other than studying and going to class. DO NOT GO HERE. The people here and generally friendly, however there are a lot of people who are also rude as well. There is no party scene here, as the cops patrol every hour or so, even in off-campus housing. The parties are generally busted within an hour or so. The parties also have no women that attend, it is primarily guys at these parties. The chemistry department is mediocre here. There is absolutely nothing to do downtown, and barely anything to do in Harrisburg City as well. The nightlife is nothing compared to Philly or other major cities. The bars and clubs are not the greatest and it is not safe downtown. Most of the people here are extremely dull and very very very immature."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life here consists of doing stupid, embarrassing, and dangerous (amongst other things) things that have nothing to do with being a Greek. You don't get the true experience of learning and proper (non abusive) discipline that was once held up by Greek Life"
College Sophomore,1,Get all the paperwork and necessary things done early incase you run into issues
College Senior,1,Parties at this school consist of people standing around in one of the off campus apartments and drinking. All people do here is hookup and complain in their cliques. You see the same faces an do the same things every weekend. It is pretty boring here on the weekends. Students need an opportunity to bond and relate with others and even if given the opportunity they are on their phones snaphatting with people somewhere else.
College Senior,1,"This town does not have much to offer in terms of food. There is one local pizza place near by which is pretty good and one Chinese restaurant which is subpar. The local Giant has great Chinese food however and is open 24/7 for any late night munchies. Those are your options if you don't have a car. If you have a car, the neighboring town has a few interesting places  and lower swatara has a shopping mall with really good chain restaurants. Harrisburg doesn't fare much better than the town, though they have plenty of bars. This part of PA doesn't make organic or vegan options very available. Though there are some farmer's markets nearby as well as the Farm Show Expo every year in January."
College Senior,1,"There is only one fraternity and one sorority at this school. Consequently, they have very little impact on the social scene here, which sucks anyway. However, they are attempting to increase their presence on campus through events."
College Freshman,1,"I don't like how I recieved no scholarships or student aid. I have a good grade and my dad makes good money, so somehow that means I don't deserve any. I pay for college not my dad"
College Freshman,1,There Is very little Greek life at this branch campus
College Junior,1,I do not live on campus.
College Sophomore,1,I receive no financial aid.
College Sophomore,1,Our campus has very limited class offerings.
College Freshman,1,Very few greek choices and very little events.
College Sophomore,1,"Not much to do in Middletown, PA. If you're 21+ ok"
College Freshman,1,This place is boring ! it's in this small town called Middletown Pa. If you're from a big city like me this place will bore you to desth
College Junior,1,"It's middletown, PA....there's an air port and saturday's market"
College Junior,1,"I've seen a few people walk around campus wearing frat/sorority clothing, but not the school for greek life."
College Sophomore,1,"No Good Options – There are a couple buses that take students to the mall where the megabus picks them up, but these buses only run at a certain time.  Students can call a taxi but that can be pricey.  There is a train station about a fifteen minute walk away.  The prices all vary on how far you are going.   It s easy to walk anywhere on campus, but if you want to go out to eat or anywhere not on campus, you need a car."
College Sophomore,1,"Very Safe, but Even More of a Sleepy, Boring Town. First of all, PSH is not located in Harrisburg. It is located in Middletown, PA. Harrisburg is about fifteen minutes away. In Middletown there is very little to do; far from a college town. Most places close early and there is nothing really ""college student"" friendly going on. Even though Harrisburg is about 15 minutes away, there is also a limit on things to do there as well. If you're into big city living, this is not the place for you."
College Freshman,1,I know of very few Greek students or associations on campus.  The few that do exist aren't very active.

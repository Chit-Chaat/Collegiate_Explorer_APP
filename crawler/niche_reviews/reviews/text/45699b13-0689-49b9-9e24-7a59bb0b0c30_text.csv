Graduate Student,5,Very clean local community college teacher’s and online programs are also well explained i learned alot about mote than what I attended to study for
Graduate Student,5,The classes are always available very short and it doesn’t require you to be on a time limit with the programs that have to be read the testing are always took inside of a class but the learning of the online lesson is very explain it well detail for instructions
Sophomore,5,"been here for 1 year, my professors have been the best instructors i ever have and it's a good commuter school."
Sophomore,5,My college experience at College of Alameda is very interesting. I meet different people everyday. The campus is pretty laidback and it is not hard to look for classrooms. They also over different workshops that can help me for my classes.
Junior,5,"Your in control of your own destiny. That's one of the biggest lessons I've learned in my life since enrolling in this school. I've been attending this school on and off since 2014 and its been everything I've made it out to be. When I first got here I would just go to class and go home or to work, I didn't put in the effort  to become social and meet new people and I also didn't take my education seriously. However the moment I decided to focus and take my education seriously I began to see all of the tools and resources that here available to me , and I went from a 1.4 gpa to currently a 3.2. I realized that my teachers and councilors actually cared and they motivated me to not only become a better student but a better person overall."
College Junior,5,Peralta colleges offer the best options. As mentioned Peralta system allow students to attend any class at any of the four campuses. I am a mother figure to two boys which means I need a flexible schedule. With all classes available on any four of the campuses it becomes really helpful when I can't make it to one class here but I can make to another.
College Junior,5,"I've worked with many people who work at big companies such as Google who have went through the Peralta system of transferring. If they can do why can't I. I have the best instructors, professors, staff and student support behind me."
College Junior,5,I do not regret saying no to UC's and CSU's for this place.
College Junior,5,"I appreciate the options of campuses. As a Peralta student I have the option to attend four different community college campuses which means I have the option of learning from instructors and professors from four different locations. At first I was skeptical in how picking classes at four different campuses were going to work out. However in the end I figured my way through passport and was completely comfortable with all four campuses. My favorite campus is the College of Alameda. The atmosphere is very chill. College students who have to juggle social life and academic life need chill spaces to learn. And lastly, the staff at College of Alameda. My professors were honest and up to date with current life situations. I appreciate the little things that this college has to offer."
College Junior,5,"I prefer  Hybrid classes because you get a combination of online learning in addition to the traditional classroom experience. In a hybrid class you will meet up once or twice a week to have class discussions, ask questions, and go over new material. You can still interact online with fellow students, responding to each other's forums. My favorite online class is math because you can keep working the problems until you get them. there is a wide variety of class lectures, tutorials, and videos that help you solve the problem."
College Senior,5,I love studying in College of Alameda because of the great professors! They have been extremely helpful and are always willing to help and sometimes even if it's not during their office hours. They explain the material very well and give a fair amount of work.
College Senior,5,College of Alameda has the best people that help you with any academic programs.. They are very knowledgeable and offer different programs like EOPS to help students. The counselors go above and beyond to help the students make their educational plans to attain academic goals. A good number of people show up to campus events.
College Junior,5,There is always more than enough who work in the career center. There is a job for every field. There is a workshop everyday to ensure that your resume is correct and that you have the proper interview skills and how to dress appropriately.
College Sophomore,5,I've applied but I haven't taken my classes yet and things are still blurry to me.
College Sophomore,5,So far I haven't even started but I do need a scholarship in order to go to school.
College Sophomore,5,"I have a very busy workweek working 50+ hours trying to support myself, so the flexibility and self-paced features of the online course are paramount to my success in the course. I would say that there is probably more hours spent on homework in this online class than a normal in person class, but I feel like it helps to make up for lecture time. My teacher is really awesome and makes herself very available for questions and also provides times to chat online and in person throughout the semester to help students. She is awesome! My classmates and I have got to know each other through the online exam forums and bounce ideas and questions off of each other. I always benefit from explanations from peers as much as or even more than my professor's opinions. Online courses have been a real blessing for me in terms of time management for my schedule!"
College Senior,5,"My overall experience with this school was great, because staffs were helpful and very considerate. They would put out their own time to help students and overcoming their struggles. This school is unique, because it is small but very diverse. Everyone were very kind, and doesn't discriminate one or another. Classmates were big helps, because they understand the situations other were going through. Overall, the school deserve an A. I would definitely choose this school again if I had the choice, because I've save a lot of money and met a lot of nice people. I am very satisfied with the pace we were going through and how the school is being run."
College Sophomore,5,"Social Work and Other – I'm gonna become a social worker, and my classes are what i expected so far. I have no electives for now because I'm trying to cover first my weakness. In fact, all of my classes i'm taking this semester are related to my major, which is nice because the material is super interesting to me. The workload is not heavy but is lightweight it all depends."
Sophomore,4,The professors are really understanding when it comes to late assignments when you work a lot. instructors really understand that many of the students that are taking there online class know that they are probably working some crazy hours so a lot of the professors are really understanding of late assignments
Junior,4,I enjoyed the campus. All the professors were very helpful and I enjoyed the small classroom setting. The counselors at the college were also great. They helped guide me through my course plan and transfer plan.
Freshman,4,"College of Alameda is a very calm place, you can go and sit down any where and you'll have peace. The professors are great, some can improve on explaining their selfs a bit more but in general the professors are good to get along with. The food here is pretty good, i really like the crispy chicken burger more than anything. Administrative office is very good at helping you if you have any questions, and the counselors help you out on choosing the classes you'll need for your major."
Niche User,4,"I have had a great experience with the College of Alameda as a dually enrolled student, especially since my high school is right next door. The professors and administrative staff are very understanding and work actively with my high school."
Sophomore,4,College of Alameda has a very nice staff and counselors there to provide you help. There are many helpful resources if you are struggling in your classes as well such as the Writing Lab. Professors are also really push you to do your best no matter what.
Freshman,4,"Although community colleges are known to not pit effort in teaching its students, college of alameda is different. Progessors tale theor work serious, & they teach teach teach until we seem to understand it. They’ll always be there if you need any assistance"
Freshman,4,I'm a freshmen in Alameda it's also my first semester as well. So far its been a really good experience got all the classes I wanted and the teachers really do help you out a lot.
Freshman,4,College of Alameda is a great place to go to take courses in order to transfer to a 4-year institution. It has many of the classes you need and teachers that care about you. The students there are also very nice and hardworking.
Sophomore,4,This community college has a small community that is kind and close knit. Teachers there really want their students to excel and achieve their college goal plans. They take time out of their day to help their students. Students in return get good grades and gain knowledge which they can use when they leave College of Alameda.
College Junior,4,"I am a psychology major. I plan on transferring to a four year university in the near future. Some things that helped me along the way were the helpers at EOPS and the student center. I am the first in my family to go to college. I did not know a thing about apply, accepting and attending college. Then I came to College of Alameda. The staff and students were helpful and friendly. Appyling for EOPS was a breeze. Working w/ my councilor Mary Shugessy was even better. She guides my fluidly through class choices and academic advice. She evens phones me when I'm running late or when one of us is absent. My experience here was better than I could ever imagine. Most of my friends attend Laney College. They complain about terrible classes, long lines for help and terrible parking. I'm not knocking Laney College for being so packed but here at College of Alameda it's nice to be in a quiet intimate settings."
College Junior,4,"College of Alameda is equipped with some of the best instructors and professors I know. Last semester I took ART 4 w/ Drew Burgass, INTRO TO STATS w/ Vanson Win, PSYCH 12 Elham Chishty and ANTHRO 1A Dr. Nathan Strong. ART 4 covered modern art starting from neo-classicism to modern day minimalism. I never understood art and why certain art pieces were worth more than my tuition but after taking this class I understood that art is feeling and emotions. One does not pay for the piece but the feelings that come with it. And that is priceless. INTRO TO STATS was amazing. I'm not one to exceed at math so when Instructor Vanson lectured I was so surprised when I understood it all and passed with an A. PSYCH 12 was fun. I am a psychology major so I'm a sucker for a good psychology class; and I found a great one and passed with an A. Lastly, ANTHRO 1A was interesting. Many students claim that Dr. Strong is elderly and unexciting. I on the other hand appreciate his ripe-ness. Everyone see the old man who teaches boring things. No one quite see the older man who wakes up in bad conditions and teaches the youth although he is in bad conditions. I appreciate Dr. Strong and hopes he stays at College of Alameda. We need him."
Recent Alumnus,4,Work hard study hard will help
Recent Alumnus,4,Love it great for me
Recent Alumnus,4,Love the school and saff
College Junior,4,The teachers are all very helpful and offer their free time to help students.
College Sophomore,4,"Compared to Laney, there's a lot less distractions. At Laney I always felt like I had to watch my back for enemies, but over here I haven't seen a single one. I can focus on my education, and the campus here is nice. It's right next to target & safeway so I can do grocery shopping before or after class."
College Junior,4,"Although you can easily get lost at Alameda, I am finding a lot of students who share my major. Not only is sociology a common major, it can also be a focal point that can help you network. My sociology classes are always more fun than all my regular classes because the students are focused and share a common interest. If your majoring in Sociology the College of Alameda is a perfect starting point."
College Junior,4,"Financial Aid assisting and Admissions/Counseling assisting are beyond helpful, fast and accurate."
College Junior,4,"in the are of class flexibility i really could not ask for more because there are many classes to choose from, and at many varying times. I have found it very easy to schedule my class to fit around my daily life responsibilities. "
College Junior,4,"The wireless access is a bagillion times better that connecting to the computers on campus. It's easy to connect to if you are in range, and there are several access points on both campus facilities. The computer lab is a place I rarely go to, because several bad apples make it hard to work there. "
Graduate Student,2,Teachers are still learning the basics of the canvas website but are very understanding of the student's problems.
College Student,2,"The teachers are not the best. Every teacher except one has been rude and obnoxious in the middle of class. I was cussed out by a math teacher for correcting him even though he said that if he's wrong, we should correct him.  Most teachers are late and don't care about the time they wasted."
College Junior,2,Printing costs should be lowered.
College Junior,2,There isn't a wide variety of courses offered.
College Student,2,"My mathlab courses are hard to follow, and it'll be my third time taking the same math class. I know how to do it, it's the site that will mark you wrong when you're right. I have proof. The teachers are not extremely attentive, when asked a question it may take weeks to get back to you."
College Student,2,There are two computer labs and one is for assessment testing. 
College Senior,2,I think the schools tuition is really high especially since there is a very low chance of finding a job in this economy.
College Sophomore,2,"Registration Process Needs to Step up! I wish that the class registration process was easier for students. It is usually done by EOPS students first, then it goes alphabetically but I feel that there should be one registration date and then everyone can try and register as they please so that it could be first come, first serve. I wish the professors used their textbooks more rather than having their own philosophy because I noticed that sometimes you find that they don't know what they are talking about. There are some programs at our school such as Nursing and Dentistry but they are so hard and difficult to get into because there are so high numbers. I wish that more class sections were offered in each subject for our school and I wish counselors and professors would advertise scholarships and different classes to take so we can advance in our careers as well."
College Senior,2,"Not the Best – I am a business major and except from taking econ 1,2 i haven't had the chance to take any business class because the classes fill up too fast  , tuition keeps going up and too many classes have been cut. The econ teacher was nice, but he was old and I don't think he cared much about if his students were getting more knowledge or not."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Much Experience – I hardly know anything about the extracurricular activities and campus resources at College of Alameda. There are nice fields for baseball and soccer, and I believe a track around the soccer field, but I've never even been in the gym.  Almost the entire campus seems fairly old and slightly unkempt. I've only seen a few campus-wide activities, which included a teacher talent show, a Cinco de Mayo festival and a car show. I've only been in the student center a couple of times for class, and in the library for group projects, so I don't know how useful or helpful these resources are."
College Sophomore,2,"Most Logical Step – In all honesty, there doesn't seem to be anything special or unique about College of Alameda. However, after returning home from California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo, sttending COA was the most affordable and sensible decision for me. I've saved a lot of money living at home and being able to work while taking classes there, and it gave me the time I needed to figure out that my original major wasn't right for me. College of Alameda is not my ideal school, but I would do it all over again because I know it worked out best."
College Freshman,2,"The counselors are TERRIBLE. They confuse you so much that it's better to research it on your own. Most of the things they tell you, you already know. It's as if they DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. The only thing they're good for is getting the papers you need to transfer. Also, they take a long time to talk to a student and give little information. A student is better off asking counselors from different schools within the Peralta Community."
College Student,1,"Some quarters certain classes are available, sometimes you need to wait for three more quarters to roll by. It's really frustrating. A two year college is turning into a five year process."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Ethic Sudies Program – Due to budget cuts. The ethinic studies classes, are not available and is required, for me to tranfer into my major."
College Junior,1,the school sucks. it makes you want to give up on life.

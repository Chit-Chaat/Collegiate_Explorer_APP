Freshman,5,"I have been taking online courses due to COVID-19 and my experience has been great. Despite being online, all of my teachers have continued to deliver high-quality course material. In addition, my teachers have been actively engaged, supportive, understanding, and caring. I am very appreciative to have teachers that care about my academic understanding and success."
Freshman,5,"Although it has been harder for teachers to deliver the same material through online courses, I believe I have still gained the same knowledge/growth that would be received in person. Through the two virtual conference courses that I am taking, my teachers have made sure to create a positive experience by putting a lot of effort into their lesson plans."
Sophomore,5,I never feel too overwhelmed. I found at the professors realize you have other classes and so the work never feels like it is being piled up.  The professors respond to emails very quickly so I never have to wait too long.
Sophomore,5,"I loved my experience at College of DuPage because it was a fresh new start and there is so much to do. If you don't feel like being confided inside the walls of the building you have the opportunity to go out and enjoy the fresh air with a view of a nice fountain and garden area, etc. The gym is also a great place to bust your stress after classes, which I always looked forward to. Last but not the least, I have to mention the excitement of getting some good hot Starbucks before classes during Chicago's crazy winter days. I loved how it was easily available to the students!"
Sophomore,5,The professors are doing the very best they can and putting their utmost effort to make this experience easy for us students. I can see the hard work they are putting through from the other end as a student because I am learning just as much as I would in person.
Freshman,5,"I was doubtful that my first semester at college would be rough, but the professors at COD do everything in their power to ensure you are getting the education you need to succeed."

Graduate Student,5,"COD is a place where you get what you put in. It is a place that allows students to get on the right path for their aspirations.

They have some amazing classes if you are into music and the arts, and one of the best forensics and speech team! Go Chaps!"

Freshman,5,I'm not too sure about their online school program because I was never interested in attending college online so therefore I have no knowledge about their online learning experience at College of Dupage but based on their on campus education and since it's one of the best community colleges in the nation I highly believe that it's online learning experience is one of the best as well! Therefore I will do my best now that you bring it up to research it a lot better since we are facing a pandemic at the moment.

Sophomore,5,"When College of DuPage shifted all their classes to online due to the pandemic, I was not sure how would it exactly be, as I personally don't like to have a class online. To my surprise, the college did a fantastic job on executing all the classes very well. They made sure that we as students do not feel any kind of difficulties during this time. They delivered online video classes in such a way that we did not feel we were far away from each other. The professors made sure that we had a comfortable environment to study in. They made sure to clear all our doubts about the concepts being taught clearly and concisely by replying to emails quickly. The college also provided laptops and internet connection to all the students in need during the pandemic. The college went up and beyond to make sure every single student was helped and satisfied and I am truly proud to be studying in this college."
Sophomore,5,"Going to COD was probably one of the best decisions I've made. Its so much cheaper and honestly the campus is really nice. There are a ton of free students resources and random free food and events. There a ton a great study nooks and the cafeteria is definitely decent. Professors are almost always willing to meet with you after class. For a community college, this is as good as it gets."

I’m confident in the colleges ability to provide me with the best education even though I’m not sitting in class.

Niche User,5,"It’s a big school, with a lot of student life academics and activities that plenty people are able to enjoy"
Freshman,5,"This institution is the perfect place for incoming college students. The class sizes are small, which allows students to create a good relationship with their professors. The College of DuPage offers numerous resources for your career path, transfer students, class selection, and much more. Attending the College of DuPage before transferring to a 4 year school has been the best decision I could've made. This school has amazing academics and is more affordable than alternatives."
Freshman,5,What I like about College of DuPage everyone there seems to care about every student especially every counselor. They want all the students to be successful and accomplish their dreams especially there is great professor that teach every good and if a student is struggling they have the time to meet them up somewhere to help them to understand the topic. I won't change anything about this campus because it is great college to go to honestly. Especially if you want to get to know the campus you can set up a meting for a tour so you won't get loss at all.
Sophomore,5,"College of Dupage is a great community college, not only is it very diverse and has many international students as well, but surprisingly is also very diverse when it comes to the professors. I have had professors from Depaul University to University of Illinois- at Urbana Champaign professors, to professors who are heads of a department from Yale University. The professors are great and I have academically achieved thanks to them, the advisors and the college community. As an incoming freshman at COD I was not thrilled to go to a community college ( like every incoming freshman) I wanted to obviously go to a four year, but I was not financially stable, thankfully I have realized that attending COD was a smart move and not only did I save thousands of dollars but I am now financially, and academically prepared to transfer and the community at COD has grown on me that as I finish my last semester, I am sad to leave the beautiful campus."
Sophomore,5,"At College of DuPage, I was able to expand my creativity by experimenting with classes to find the right fit for me. I had the opportunity to complete Service-Learning for one of my classes where I volunteered at the DuPage Children’s museum. Many of these classes went towards my Associates Degree which I received in December 2019 after three semesters at College of DuPage. I decided on Accounting for my major since I love working with numbers and with people. I could not have done this without going to College of DuPage first. The teachers were all so caring and there were so many class options so I could make a schedule that was right for me and allowed to work at night. This current semester, College of DuPage is doing a great job in helping me prepare for my transition to a four-year university with excellent counselors and resources to find out which classes transfer for my major."
Freshman,5,"College of Dupage has a clean Environment, I’m on the football team and it’s the only community college with a football team to help get full ride scholarships to D1 and D2 football programs.

Sophomore,5,"College of DuPage is an amazing school with even more amazing professors. All my favorite teachers I have had here. The classroom sizes are small, they offer so many fun activities, many job fairs, and just overall provide a great environment and atmosphere for students. The school always has something for the students to do to take their mind of school and relax. There is always someone near that can help you find the place you're looking for, talk to, or help you plan what you are going to do in the future. My mom went to this school, my siblings have, and now I have, and we all have loved COD."
Freshman,5,"I love this school for its affordability. The class sizes are small, compared to other colleges, even in your intro classes. There were like max 50 people in my chemistry class. You are taught by the professor and not a TA. This place is amazing if you take your academics seriously, you get out what you put in. In regards to the social scene, this is a commuter school so don't expect any parties or people to be too crazy about socializing here. Most of the students here have jobs/other obligations as well which keeps them from participating in campus events. Don't get me wrong, the school does try hard to organize fun events, it is just that the turnout can sometimes be poor because of this fact. I don't care about this and just care about the academics so I give this school an A+."
Niche User,5,College of DuPage is one of the best Community schools in Illinois. This school is located in Glen Ellyn. All the students here are well educated and taught. The professors are masters at their specific subject and try their best to pass on their knowledge to their students.

The resources there are incredible! Everyone is willing to help and push you to take on challenges. There are so many classes to take and at any level."

I'm involved in sports and that's been a positive because I got to know the campus before classes started and the coaches are supportive.
Sophomore,5,COD has opened a lot of doors for me not only as an academic student but also as an individual. The organizations and clubs in this community college are life-changers! My expectations were absolutely satisfied.
Freshman,5,"Although only a 2-year institution, COD's campus, facilities, and student resources make it truly seem like a 4-year university. The Professors are extremely helpful and knowledgable (many practicing in the field in which they teach). Overall, an excellent school especially for those looking to transition to a 4-yr university program."
Niche User,5,"I like college of Dupage, I like how it has many clubs and organizations for student life. The counselors are always willing to help you in your future classes and transferring advise.

Graduate Student,5,College of DuPage is a great College! They hace many oppurtunites for a wide varieties of options for education. They are very helpful and want all students to succeed.
Niche User,5,"It's a very bright environment, the people are very relaxed, and the teachers are mostly good. There’s a building for every specific major, the arts building, culinary arts, physical education, health and sciences, etc. The buildings are all connected through tunnels one way or another which is very convenient when the weather is not cooperative. They have many resources, from the study rooms in the library to the gym. I love the arts building, it is such a bright environment and so colorful. Also, Einstein bagels in that building is very good. Overall, I rate the college a 10/10."
Sophomore,5,I'm new to the school but everything is going great so far. There are A LOT of resources to help you through college.
Graduate Student,5,Great college if you're on the budget. Everything is very organized. Campus is nice and clean. Professors are knowlegable.
Sophomore,4,"When taking classes online, the teachers I had were organized in the work that needs to get done for the class and what we need to learn. These are for general ed classes. For classes such as music being taking online it can be difficult. Music classes involves in person interactions and are meant to be taken in person. But for these troubled times, it's very clear that all the music teachers give it their all to give the right material and education for their students need. This is something I really appriciate about the teachers at this school."
Sophomore,4,College of dupage is a good school for students who plan on transfering to 4 year universities. The school has nice people. It feels very safe. People involved in the Fine Arts are wonderful people who are very dedicated to the arts.
Sophomore,4,I am doing COD all online right now. I like it a lot I like that I get to do things on my own time. I am also working 30 hours a week so having the online classes are really helpful. The website they use for class work is very easy to navigate I had no problem with it at all.
Junior,4,Most of the teachers were very helpful and committed to helping students succeed. There are many programs and staff available to help students with any challenges they may face.

Sophomore,4,Very affordable school. Many professors care about their students. Diversity is insane! And offers many resources to help their students succeed.
Graduate Student,4,"Online classes are only as good as the professor in my opinion. Luckily College of Dupage has a terrific and dedicated staff. During the first wave of Covid-19, I didn't think I was going to stick with my on-campus classes that forcibly switched to online ones. My professors made it easy for me to transition, with the help of zoom calls and blackboard. I was able to contact my instructers during set times most days of the week, which made it easy when I ran into a problem that needed some troubleshooting. Overall I feel like online classes can be just as affective as on campus classes."
Junior,4,"Online classes were great. They were definetly hard, and time consuming, but that is to be expected with online courses. The professors were personal, helpful, and interacted in the online class. The way in person classes switched to online classes due to COVID-19 was very impressive. They didn't skip a beat. Though some professors had a harder time than others, they did not stop working with each student and producing a class that students can be successful."
Alum,4,"College of DuPage is affordable, offers great education, and full of opportunities. Almost all of my professors were wonderful, helpful, encouraging, and desired to see me achieve. COD also has many clubs and extracurricular activities in which I was able to participate in as well. Not to mention, COD is VERY affordable and the education that is offered at a community college is competitive, well respected, and stands strong against other community colleges. I haven’t had very much complaints or worries going to college here and I’m very grateful for the education I received as well as the professors that encouraged me along the way."
Sophomore,4,I took several general education classes online with great success. The teachers communicated efficiently and provided guidance. Small class sizes meant reaching out to my professor was simple and I received adequate attention.
Alum,4,"I only rate online experience with 4 stars due to the fact that I tend to lack motivation if my classes are online. However due to the most recent COVID-19 pandemic, it was unavoidable to go online. I commend the teachers for taking the time to figure out how to successfully transfer their courses online with the resources they had."
Junior,4,There are many opportunities for any kind of student and the campus is very diverse. You can get involved in a variety of clubs and activities while making new friends. The overall atmosphere is welcoming.
Freshman,4,"College of DuPage is a very friendly and relaxing college to start off a students journey into the whole college experience. It's a great way to experience college at a slower pace, yet giving you the experience and credits you deserve. Everyone is so friendly, kind, and willing to help out in anyway possible. The college have a variety of different majors and programs that aren't offered at most community colleges. As well as a variety of different events and clubs to participate in. College of DuPage is a great college to attend if you are undecided on what to major in, what career is for you, or just need some extra high school or college credits. Class size is about 20 students, which is great. Professors get to know there students and what to help out as much as possible."
Sophomore,4,Great college close to home.  Campus easy to navigate. Easy to register for classes! Reasonable tuition and good teachers.
Sophomore,4,"Easy to apply and register for online classes.  Good resources for online courses. Instructors place their curriculum on the blackboard. Easy to navigate through, submit assignments. There is online tutoring available in many subjects.  Teachers post syllabus, lessons and requirements."
Junior,4,Like the small class sizes and the teacher are willing to help students out. Which they would have note different times and promote clubs better and had more opportunities to get involved
Sophomore,4,"I really liked the flexibility the school had. They made it available for all their students to have the choice to take online or on campus classes. Therefore, I was able to work while getting a degree. All my professor helped me learn more about my major and made my classes very interesting.  The professor really cared about their students. It was an easy compute for me and extremely affordable, which made my experience that much better. The only thing I disliked about this college was the layout of their MyAccess website where they have you enroll and look at your schedule. It is very confusing and hard to navigate. In conclusion, I had a great experience at College of DuPage."
Senior,4,"I transferred into College of Dupage about two years ago. It was a pretty difficult transfer as some of my credits did not transfer from Florida however they did count as credits. Overall I spoke to a few students on campus and found a great advisor to assist me with my transfer to Lewis University and continued to support my vision over the years. The college itself is very informative with events, fairs, and any national news such as COVID-19. The school took action right away during the crisis and made sure students still had online and virtual tutoring available during the crisis."
Sophomore,4,I liked how at COD everyone is free to be who they want to be. But some changes definitely need to change and that would have to be parking because as much parking as we have. It just isn’t enough sometimes which always makes it a hassle to find a spot.
Freshman,4,"Took some courses at CoD to prepare for enrollment at a four year-college. It's a very good school with challenging courses and friendly instructors. Campus is large, clean, and modern. The college was equipped with a large library, friendly peers, and lots of online resources that make taking courses there a breeze."
Freshman,4,I like how the school is very modern and clean and that they accept anyone who is willing to learn regardless of background.
Freshman,4,The school is a good environment and most people are very nice and helpful. Great place to save some money
Freshman,4,"I really appreciate the teacher to student ratio in the majority of your classes you take here, it creates a much closer knit atmosphere."
Junior,4,"College of DuPage is very very fine institution. I have had many great professors, but also a couple who seemed to just be there for the paycheck. Over all a great college to start at."
Sophomore,4,"The campus at COD is absolutely beautiful. It has so many different people and so many different options. There are clubs, groups, and activities for everyone. The classes are amazing and there are plenty of options for whatever subject you're interested in. The staff there is wonderful and caring and I've had great experiences with the counseling office. It's a great school and I really enjoy my time there."
Alum,4,"Very good school overall, a few issues regarding interactions with student services and financial aid. Pretty LGBTQ+ friendly, but you have to advocate for yourself if you want your preferred name displayed places. Professors are great, students are mostly good. The campus is really nice but it can be hard to find your way around at first, but once you figure it out it's easy."
Sophomore,4,"For the most part, it's a nice school with very good opportunities for people who want to earn their Associate's. It's also ideal for students who want to transfer to a university and save money. The thing about the school is that the STEM clubs are kind of lacking good opportunities."
Freshman,4,I like Dupage for their diversity of students and affordable classes. They have creative and interesting events that go on throughout the year such as spirit week and events created by clubs to advertise their group.
Niche User,4,I'm in my first year returning to college to study culinary arts. So far I'm excited to return at age 55. Navigation is easy and the faculty is experienced and very helpful in terms of guiding me through some career decisions.
Sophomore,4,"College of Dupage is a very clean, safe, beautiful campus. The classroom sizes are small, making it easy to obtain extra one on one time with professors. Extra help is always available. However, the financial aid office is terrible to communicate with. It seems they hire anyone. Nobody can ever seem to point me in the right direction when speaking with the financial aid office."
Freshman,4,It is a great way to save money and get a great education too! The college has lots of clubs and activities that can help you reach your career goals and network. You can meet people from all around the world due to the diversity at COD!
Sophomore,4,College of DuPage is a community college that allows you to explore your options in your career choice and you are welcomed to change your major at anytime.
Sophomore,4,I loved the ease of community college. The neighborhood feel to it really made it welcoming to go to class.
Freshman,4,"I go to COD at 2014 and graduated in 2019 with Associates for Applied Science with High Honors. Graphic Design being my major of study.
 
Great school to start with especially on general education and choosing your major. The tuition is better on the prices as well. I always hangout at the student life lounge to play video games with my friends. The student life always have an event every month giving out free food. The professors will know you better treating you as a student not number. The area is drivable as well since I'm like 20 minutes driving distance away.

My only complaint is that it's only a 2-year school program. But there are some majors that has the 2+2 or 3+1 program where you can get a bachelor's in another school while attending in COD."
Alum,4,"College of DuPage is a great junior college. The academics there are amazing and most of the classes can be transferred over to a four year institution.  I believe that you are definitely getting your moneys worth if you have no idea what you want to do as a career. For me I was apart of the honors society, but anything other than academics this college is decent. Nothing fancy. There are no dorm/ housing provided to students."
Sophomore,4,"I’ve had a great experience at College of DuPage and have gotten very lucky with my academics. The professors are often very good teachers and they always want you to succeed. If your not sure what career you want to pursue or your not ready to go to a university, I suggest going to COD first. It has definitely prepared me for my future and has made me sure if the career I’m  pursuing."
Niche User,4,I found a professor here that inspired me to change my major and career path. Eric Martinson was unlike any other professor I have ever had and I feel incredibly lucky to have been taught by him. He continued to support and encourage me throughout my undergraduate experience. He wrote me a letter of recommendation to my graduate school and truly embodied what it was like to teach at the College of DuPage. His passion for his subject and institution is what has encouraged me to return and teach here once I graduate with my master's.
Alum,4,"For a community college, DuPage has it going on.  Academics are good quality and accepted by nearly every university in the region.  Advising is top notch and always have answers to questions.  Financial aid can be a tad difficult, but I find this at nearly every higher education institute.  Campus has nice facilities and it is a safe campus."
Sophomore,4,Great intermediary step between high school and a 4-year college. Plenty of course variation and educated teachers to give you a taste and understanding of what the field you are interested in can be like.
Junior,4,"The campus itself is really nice, and easy to navigate. The social areas can be a little hectic because of the people that can hang out there. The teachers are generally good, but they can also be hit or miss."
Sophomore,4,"College of Dupage is a wonderful institution.  Quality education at a very affordable price, however they lose a star as the social environment is horrible.  Don't expect to make any friends unless you really work for it.  However, education is perfect."
Freshman,4,I love the resources the school offers. Some of the staff have been their a long time and seem to be burned out.
Sophomore,4,College is Dulage does an excellent job at giving you a well rounded education. By offering small classes it allows for teachers and students to maintain materials better. As well as give students and opportunity to ingauge in the classrooms.
Sophomore,4,I really enjoyed the open school environment with very good class schedules. Very affordable and was able to pay for tuition without need for loans. I would really like to see some professors do better to make their classes seem more important. Some teachers seemed unmotivated to be there which passed of to me as a student.
Sophomore,4,College of DuPage is an excellent school for those looking to make college a more affordable experience. It's highly regarded in the state of Illinois allowing for easy transfer to other universities.
Freshman,4,This community college is very good when comparing it to the price. So far I've had very good professors in their fields. Most of mine had their doctorates
Freshman,4,great school and would graduate in the top 10 of year 2020 we all deserve the chance to feel expressed
Junior,4,It's an excellent college to get introduced to the college life. If you are undecided on your major then this is an excellent place to get started and learn about the different fields. Their website if very easy and lot of information is available on there to help you succeed. The counselors are extremely helpful and they will guide in the right path to transfer with the maximum credit. Another important factor is that you will save a lot of money in 2 years doing the General Education.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is very large. I attended a local university before and it was quite small compared to CoD. In addition to being large, the campus is well  maintained and clean providing a suitable educational environment."
Sophomore,4,Most of the teachers were great. A lot of the kids there aren't too smart. Great idea to save money. Go here 2 years and then transfer.
Sophomore,4,"The teachers at COD are very well educated and kind people. Classes are at a reasonable price. The campus is quite large and its clean. The library is a great place to get homework done. Student life is a little lacking, and parking is terrible after 9:00 am."
Alum,4,College of DuPage wants its students to succeed but it can be tough to get assistance from the office workers depending on the office you go to.
Alum,4,"College of Dupage is a good school. The campus is huge, and beautiful! there are a lot of clubs and course offered. If you wanted to you wouldn't have any trouble getting involved in the school. Many students were in and out of their class, so not that many people came to make friends. They focus on their classes, then go home or to work. For the most part the professors are great. Out of being a student for two years at COD I had only three professors that weren't too caring or nice. overall COD is a nice school to do what you have to do, then continue on with yourself and your day."
Sophomore,4,My experience in College of DuPage was amazing. College of DuPage is pretty reasonably affordable and also the class is small.
Sophomore,4,"College of Dupage is great school.
I learned a lot and experienced a lot.
Strong recommending school"
Sophomore,4,"CoD has a vast amount of resources that not many students take advantage of. Most of the professors truly care about the success of their students and teach life skills applicable to the working world. Tuition is very low for a great education. So many degrees offered here. Basically, you get big bang for your buck."
Sophomore,4,One of the reasons I like COD is because of the small class which helps us learn the material more & the professor is able to help us.
Junior,4,"COD is a starting point if you have no idea what you want to do coming out of high school, and the price is relatively reasonably."
Niche User,4,"It's pretty good, suburban location, works with it's students on making a smooth transfer, not much else. Apparently it's the best community college in the country so thats pretty cool. Nice campus, tons of classes and programs."
Sophomore,2,with corona the whole thing was kinda a mess I basically had to teach myself everything i needed to know for exams.
Sophomore,2,The school itself is nice and the teachers vary. The schools polices and willingness to help student is terrible. I am a 4.0 student and had a very minor issue while enrolled in the nursing program. NO One would help me because it was during summer classes. Counseling is terrible and so are the department heads they are unwilling to help student all the want to do is collect your money. I would not send my future children here no matter how cheap it was.
Freshman,2,The teachers are not helpful when you have an IEP and they know takes you a while to understand things and you ask to stay and if they can help you they just say to ask a classmate. Not all students are friendly i have been made fun of because of my disabality by several student workers and i have talked to their managers about it and the managers rarely do anything.
College Junior,2,A degree from COD or Lewis University isn't eye grabbing on a resume.
College Junior,2,The computer classes for my major suck. the professor shows a power point the whole time rather than hands on learning. didnt use the book. professor for CIS SUCKEEEDDDD.
College Junior,2,"If there is a career services section of College of DuPage, I have never encountered it."
College Sophomore,2,"This school is hit or miss.  Every department, counselor, or class interaction is great or a total disaster.  Once a counselor told me to drop a class because I did not need that particular class.  Then the next time I was told I needed the class & lost $1,000 right there.  Some teachers are great!  They expect you to come to class & actually teach you what you need to know.  Then after some hard work & study time put in they where always available via email or office hours.  This worked great & an A was attainable based on the effort.  Other teachers just give vague information or don't teach at all & tell you to just read the book & whatever you don't understand ask, but then never answered emails or kept changing office hours or never showed up."
College Senior,2,I don't think I would have many prospects through just COD. I am transferring to a different university this fall.
College Junior,2,There aren't many opportunities as such as this school.
College Senior,2,"the classes and professors at this school are half way decent, most of them don't really care"
College Senior,2,"I haven't taken any classes for my major yet, only general educaiton classes"
College Senior,2,Its cheap but social life is seriously lacking
Recent Alumnus,2,I haven't heard anything of post-grad or any graduates from cod. My knowledge of it is lackluster or its not that big.
Recent Alumnus,2,Honestly I haven't really heard of any alumni network or internship prospects. Maybe that's just me but I guess you have to really seek it to find it.
College Senior,2,"They have a career service website, but it is a 3rd party and its hard to actually find student work or an entry level position."
College Freshman,2,I've had a difficult time connecting with people at COD. I am a very social person but most people there are there to get in and get out.
College Junior,2,I wish I was able to get scholarships or fasfa money to ease the load.
College Junior,2,I wish the school offered dorms. This would make students actually look forward to attending school.
College Junior,2,Scholarships are offered but FASFA and financial aid are not helpful
College Sophomore,2,"Overall, I ended up here as an adult due to weird stuff in my life. There are many other adults like that, and if you could try to take more classes with those adults, you're better off that way. No offense to the majority of students, but it's demoralizing to be surrounded by lazy and dim people when you have more drive than everyone in the room."
College Sophomore,2,"Some professors are great, but they're too far and few in between. Too many adjuncts; hire some real staff! The variety of courses is pretty good for a two year school. Class sizes have been ok. It's just tough to swallow the cost of tuition when it's worse than your high school."
College Sophomore,2,"Can't wait to leave! No lasting friends here. Just a lot of lazy people or non-lazy people who have more important things in their life than learning anything here. Won't miss the parking lot. They'll build everything but a bigger parking lot, so it's just like a mall on black Friday every day. Sick of the incompetent student workers giving me the run around. Sick of reading about this place in the news for all the administration corruption. I hope going here doesn't blemish my transcript - that's not a good deal!"
College Sophomore,2,My high school was harder so I feel like the classes are a waste of time.
College Freshman,2,"Alumni have no interaction with College of DuPage whatsoever. The career center helps, but for the most part, students are on their own when it comes to finding employment."
College Freshman,2,"The online class that I am taking has very little interaction with the teacher. How this class is run is that the student reads the textbook, submits the according online assignment, and then takes the exam. The teacher seems to simply exist similarly to deism: where he exists and creates things, but does not interact with the students."
College Freshman,2,"Many of the students here are ethnic. I walked into class the first day, and I was the only student who had blonde hair. Don't get me wrong, the diversity is amazing and extremely interesting, but it was just slightly weird to me at first, since I had come from a high school where a vast majority of the students looked like me. Also, all of the students here commute. Because of this, students seem to only be here to go to class, and then they go home and do whatever it is they do. I've also experienced, as a female, that many of the men here are disgusting when it comes to how they view women."
College Freshman,2,"I strongly believe that in order to get a good job, one requires at least a bachelor's degree, which is not possible here at the College of DuPage. Although I believe that the school does a decent job at connecting students to possible employers, I believe that obtaining a bachelors degree or higher from another school would be more beneficial to receiving a better job."
College Junior,2,Havn't really heard of any
College Junior,2,"Too much paperwork, go online."
College Junior,2,"I had to send my transcript to COD twice before they received it from the University of Missouri. In addition to that it took about 6 months before my classes were in the system, this process could be better utilized and much more efficient."
College Senior,2,I don't feel like I was given any leads or real help in regards to finding a job or an internship from college of dupage. I took a semester off to try and find an internship or job after completing my associates degree and didn't find a thing even asking for help from a counselor
College Freshman,2,"I really didn't enjoy my experience here. Reasons being: not everyone has the same fighting for, people don't appear to want to be there, the professors generally seem to be in it more for themselves than any of their students, and the opportunities don't appeal to many students because most are there for school and that's it."
College Freshman,2,I was misinformed of credit info. in the beginning
College Sophomore,2,"I went to the advising office multiple times to ask about what I was supposed to be doing to transfer/ get my associate's degree by the end of my second semester. I didn't find out until right before winter break that I needed to have my official transcript from my previous school sent in to be evaluated, and then I could apply for an associate's degree. I feel like the counselors I talked to didn't really know what I was supposed to do."
College Sophomore,2,"I find that the school is not ""friendly"" to adult learners.  I also had trouble with my disability status. "
College Sophomore,2,"Can't get the internet in certain parts of the school, even when you're on your wifi. "
College Sophomore,2,"Student resources, such as business office, not open on Saturdays. "
College Sophomore,2,"I had a first year professor accuse me of plagiarism after I questioned her methods.  When another student questioned her on something, that student received a bad grade on her final.  Felt the school didn't handle the professor very well. 

Also, the school isn't really set up for working adults.  Most of their extra-cirricular activities are scheduled for the day, which is not conducive for a working adult.  And the offices where you have to take care of school business, open only during the week.  Disappointing. "
College Junior,2,People mostly do their work and then leave. It's a community college so there's not that many people that want to stick around.
College Freshman,2,"For the most part its average, I'm mainly there just for education and not really for that ""college"" life aspect. "
College Freshman,2,"Although I've heard great things about our internship and career programs, I have never need access to them. "
College Freshman,2,"For the most part, the courses are pretty standard for general studies courses; however, a majority of my teachers have no training in actual teaching and don't really enjoy being there. Workload for most of my courses is pretty bare-able although it is quite hard curriculum considering it is a community college and these are first year classes."
College Freshman,2,"I am currently enrolled at College of Dupage, which is a community college, and although it is priced low compared to 4-year universities it is quite expensive for a community college. After Spring 2014 semester, I will be transferring to a 4-year university and I find it difficult to pay for the tuition, housing, and book costs."
College Senior,2,The flexibility is nothing extraordinary. It is completely up to the student. There's nothing forcing students into specific classes.
College Senior,2,The facilities are what you would expect for a community college. Nothing more. Nothing less.
College Sophomore,2,"When it comes to network reliability, some days the network works other days it doesn't. That to me is very annoying, but then again we have free wi-fi and many student use it at the same time.  "
College Sophomore,2,"In my school the student body pretty much has cliques. Because it is a community college people know other people from the previous  high school they went to. So it isn't always easy to meet people, or stay friends with them. But their are lots of different people and races that make the atmosphere interesting."
Recent Alumnus,2,The facilities on campus are currently being remodeled so we don't have much only the library which is real nice because it is new this year but other than that everything else is getting worked on since I start school in 2011.
College Junior,2,These resources are there but many time we don't even know these resources exist. I understand we are college students and are responsible for ourselves but it is like they just have some programs there so they can say they do.
College Junior,2,the library is under construction so everything is all over the place
Recent Alumnus,2,"They Are Not Very Available – Since most people only stay at my school for a few years, most for Associates, the post-graduation/career services aren't really advertised. TO be honest, I don't even know if it is offered."
College Freshman,2,I'll say a C because the books are a lot more expensive here more then what I paid for at joliet Jr college and the parking is horrible
College Sophomore,2,"the student body at Cod is diverse but it feels like high school all over again. it seems no one is happy there. you go to school then you go home. You do not come there to meet up with friends and study in the library because you do not do that in high school. my point, it feels like high school yet really we are adults getting an higher education."
College Freshman,2,The network is constantly going in and out only big complain on computer network at COD.
College Sophomore,2,"I am getting basic courses done. Lots of lectures, not interactive, not challenging"
College Freshman,2,"There really isn't anything unique about the campus. Its mostly just a school where you go to your classes then drive home. Most of the people who go here are really awkward to talk to or there just really quiet. No one ever goes to college games like a football game or a basketball game, so the atmosphere is pretty quiet. Overall, the college experience most people look for is not at college of dupage, this is a college just to finish your general eds for a cheaper price."
College Senior,2,"It's a long process that the staff can't really explain when asked. After you get through it the first time, it's a breeze. I just buy books with my own money and wait for the rest of the financial to get back to me because getting a book voucher is annoying, especially if they don't give you enough to get your books."
College Senior,2,"There's so many low-income, ethnic, and drug-involved students here it's a joke. Upper middle class white girls stick out a lot. Also, be ready for constant cat-calling and guys hitting on you."
College Senior,2,"Its a lot, but if you receive financial aid you should be ok but your paying for your education so it important"
College Freshman,2,I believe that the education I'm recieving is worth the money I'm paying even though it is a little pricey for being a community college but no one ever said that college was going to be cheap. I applied for financial aid and I had some trouble with the information put on it so I had to turn in a few documents for them to figure it out. It would be very smart to apply for financial aid at least a year in advance and to make sure all your information is correct.
Niche User,1,"The program advisors are rude and misleading. When ask if there is another option to schedule a advising session they would reply back that there is only 3 option and if you can't make time for this how can you deal with classes. Well excuses me there are people who struggle with their schedule who have work and kids they can’t simply take off or change. Well that in fact they are not friendly and understandable.
So I highly recommended take take your money and go to another community college. If they aren't going to help you and work with your schedule, they are not worth it to invest your time and money into."
Sophomore,1,There is no consistency with the online learning right now (9/2020). I have professors that do online lecture and have online videos and then teachers that will leave to your own devices and tell you to just read the book and go on Khan Academy (math department is extremely guilty of this). Some teachers are unforgiving with technology issues when there really needs to be some leeway for the given situation. I will not return in the Spring if it is online because the education is no longer fully effective and financially worth it.
Sophomore,1,"WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD. NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT THE HECK THEY WERE DOING. 
Multiple employees gave me conflicting information. The college never once reached out to me after sending out there generic welcome letter."
Freshman,1,"Students are not friendly at all. Many teachers can't even speak English and they are TERRIBLE at explaining any topic at all. Most teachers are nice people, just terrible teachers. CoD also does not help financially AT ALL. I got a 32 ACT and 4.14 GPA in high school and revived ZERO scholarships. I had to pay full price and honestly barely saved any money compared to a 4-year university. I had to transfer out after 1 year because I was so miserable."
Niche User,1,"I applied to College of DuPage (COD) to take a cake decorating class. Soon after enrolling,  I was required to buy a chef's uniform (despite not being a culinary major), shoes, a kit that the professor wanted is to use (from a third party), along with the class and lab fees which were associated. Spending close to$1000 for one class, I began having second thoughts (What else could come up)? After my second class,  I had to drop due to outside occurring events. Attending only two classes out of 15 (Labor Day during16-week course), I applied for a tuition appeal. In the mean time, COD continued withdrawing money from my account to pay for the class. When I found out that my tuition appeal was accepted, I unfortunately found out I was only ""awarded"" half of the class fees alone. Additionally, at one point I updated my account for charges to come out of a different account, however charges continued to come out of the original account."
College Senior,1,There were no post grad services. It's very hard to get an applicable answer from the advisors.
College Senior,1,"Its disgusting, there is no career center or alumni network i don't think"
College Senior,1,I have yet to find any sort of help from this school to find a job
College Sophomore,1,"Aside from the adults going back to school (who's family lives are far more important than anything to do with COD), there's pretty much no drive or motivation from anybody. This ain't Harvard. Maybe honors classes are different."
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid office is totally incompetent, just like the cashier's 'office'. Student workers that don't know anything are the majority of your interactions. Everybody you talk to will tell you something different so you never know what's happening. Scholarships? Forget it. They've got a few 'Scholars Awards' for recent high school graduates. Adult going back to school? Just eat cake. There's over 20,000 students enrolled here, so what percent do you think get a Presidential scholarship? There were 130 awarded for 2014, so that's less than half a percent!"
College Junior,1,Financial is is almost impossible to get. I never talk to the same person twice in the financial aid department and they always contradict each other. The cashier department is okay; the dates they give me for reimbursements are always on time.
College Sophomore,1,I hated my online courses mainly because of the copious amount of homework they assign and the fact that you basically have to teach yourself in the process. Will not do it again.
College Freshman,1,"For the most part, my teachers are very harsh with due dates and getting the right kind of education for our exams. "
College Freshman,1,"Nobody actually likes being there because everyone my age would like to be able to move out of their house and go to a 4-year university. Everyone simply just goes to school and then goes home, nobody really wants to get to know anybody its quite awkward and distracting. "
College Freshman,1,"Professors at College of Dupage are hit-or-miss. I have quite a few professors that are very enlightening and offer great assistance for their classes; however, there are also many professors who overall just don't care about their classes. 90% of my workload is all online, why am I paying for someone to teach me who can only offer me assignments on the internet?"
College Freshman,1,"WIFI on campus is the worst, it barely works and when it does being able to get access to printers or computers on campus is very difficult. "
College Senior,1,"It isn't the bottom of the collegiate heap, but it's nowhere near the top. It's a community college and it's literally exactly what you think it will be: a stepping stone, nothing too significant, a financially smart option, a use of time."
College Senior,1,"The student body is diverse, but it is a community college. There are two types of kids who go to COD: The kids who just don't care (didn't in High School either) and the kids who care but don't have the money for expensive 4-year colleges. Your class will contain at least 2 stoners, if not more."
College Senior,1,"It's a community college. You can't go in expecting anything fantastic. If that's how you approach COD, you'll be just fine. But if you go there looking for a thrilling educational experience, you're going to be disappointed."
College Senior,1,"English and communications are largely neglected. There is more focus on technical majors, mathematics, and the sciences. Liberal arts are the red-headed stepchild of the school's curriculum."
College Senior,1,There's nothing extraordinary about any of this. It has the basic necessities.
College Senior,1,The network/wifi fails constantly. The IT dept. at COD must be completely daft because I could make this stupid wifi network run faster and more efficiently than they try to do and I don't even want to major in anything technology related.
College Senior,1,"Horrible online courses. The teachers in charge of the online classes seem disappointed with having to teach online classes and do everything begrudgingly. They are also not opposed to publicly humiliating students on blackboard for either asking ""stupid"" questions or making mistakes in private papers."
College Senior,1,"They will help you find a job locally. However, if you're looking to do anything out of state, all I have to say is ""Good Luck""."
College Sophomore,1,"When it comes to tutors and the learning commons it can be difficult. For math classes they have this thing called group tutoring, to me it isn't helpful. So i tried to schedule a tutor for another time, the office told me they don't have anyone available. That to me is frustrating. Other wise the counselors can be helpful but theirs so few of them that its hard to get an appointment right when you need help with an issue."
College Sophomore,1,We really don't have any student life or anything like that. Sure we have a few clubs here and there and we have some sports teams that by the way never play in the STATE. which then makes it near impossible to go and watch them. so we have some of the things actual colleges have at there schools we really don't have any student life here.
College Sophomore,1,"I tried to study music in the Fall of 2012, but I just couldn't understand what was being taught and there I had a very rude piano teacher who just expected the students to practically teach themselves. I am re-taking those classes, with different teachers, this Fall and I am much more determined to pass my classes. The teachers I have now are more reasonable with how advanced and un-advanced the students are."
College Senior,1,"Just because my parents are middle class means nothing in reality. Upper class can afford to spend, meaning more opportunity with less risk when it comes to money spent for college. Lower class gets finical aid and pays very little to attend College Of DuPage. I pay in full and get no finical aid. This is unfair in the sense because I pay for my college, not my parents, but finical aid is based off of what they are making. In the end saving money is the same regardless if i'm lower, middle, or upper class. In my opinion finical aid frustrates me, because it only helps the lower class despite a lower class child and a middle class child may work the same hours and get the same pay rate."
College Junior,1,"Although there is a program that helps you find a job within the community, there isn't much of an alumni network. This is also a commuter school so many people just want to get in and get out."
College Senior,1,I have not had any interaction with the career services department whatsoever.
College Senior,1,"It's a community college. I mean, it's way far above a 'normal' community college, and there's some attempt at school involvement/spirit, but mainly we're all here to transfer in a year or so."
College Senior,1,"The gym, library, and auditorium are all under construction this year."
College Senior,1,"I chose this school because it is the only accredited sonography program in Illinois that accepts respiratory as a previous prereq., otherwise I would have had to go get another A.S. degree.  If I had other options, I would be there in a hot second.  I feel trapped and this program director and teachers are so unfair about everything.  It is not just me, but the entire class.  5 people are currently looking to transfer mid program."
College Sophomore,1,"Horrible Connection – Although there are a lot of computers at COD, they are always occupied. Whether it be in the library or the computer lab, it is almost always difficult to find a computer that is not occupied. Because of this i started bringing my laptop to school. The only problem i found with that is the wireless access was very slow compared to the school computers and it was almost always difficult to get work done on the internet due to the horrible internet connection. Printing is an easy task but it can also be frustrating since you have to pay for every page you want to print out."
College Senior,1,"Post-Grad Services – The career center will post a few job openings available in the community, but most turn out to be dead ends. Job prospects are slim to none."
College Junior,1,It Is Ridiculous – Most of the people that go to my school are right out of high school and are very immature and promiscuous.
College Sophomore,1,"After multiple times going into the office and asking them if that was everything, things were still missing.  They would misplace papers and took forever to be filed."
College Freshman,1,Campus Activities – Most of the students here appear to not be involved with any activities outside of their classes. They basically just leave school and go to work. I think activites should be more encouraged by faculty and staff and they should be advertised in a more appealing way.
College Freshman,1,Not a Good School – if ur not a cop. or an undergrad going to a different college for your masters. this is a bad choice. very low grade teaching
Recent Alumnus,1,COD doesn't have any outstanding programs that set it apart from other schools. most students just go there to get their associates (like myself).

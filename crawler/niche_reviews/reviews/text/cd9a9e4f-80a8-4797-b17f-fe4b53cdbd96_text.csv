Freshman,5,SFC is amazing just amazing. It’s the perfect college to build long lasting friendships and connections with your peers and your mentors. It’s the small college of big dreams!
Freshman,5,SFC has been very professional about the online learning at its college. Online learning for the most part has been successful although I would rather have more on campus classes. We are also moving towards a hybrid model hopefully in upcoming fall.
Sophomore,5,I took online classes and the professors tried helping the students in any way possible. they tried to make it as hands on as possible
Freshman,5,"I have a lot of experience to took online classes.  I was easy to learn and understand.
I took IT class I was more quizzes than in College, but it still more experience."
Freshman,5,"I m a transfer student and I was too pleasure meet with admission command. They do great job very fast and easy to admit. Also my pleasure was to meet with Meaghan, she is the best she always answer to your question."
Sophomore,5,"The best college ever! Transferring here was the best thing I ever did, Although tuition is expensive it is not stopping me from attending this school and pursuing my education here, as a nursing major the professors and students are all so nice and supportive. One day I am going to look back and be glad I got my education here, I got to follow my dream of getting into the nursing program at this school."

Sophomore,5,"I admire that we are a family at the end of the day. The professors treat us like we are actual people and they acre about wether we learn or not. The class sizes are decent , every professor I have had knows me by name. We take our sports very serious and overall it is just a welcoming environment to be in. It is easy to get help if you need it no matter what time of day it may be."
Junior,5,"St.Francis College is one of the best colleges in Brooklyn. The professors are full of knowledge, experience, and dedication. There are numerous student activities happening daily in the campus, which makes the college experience awesome. Safety of the school is excellent. The area of Brooklyn Heights is one of my favorite neighborhoods in Brooklyn."
Freshman,5,I really enjoy all of the outings and events they have to offer for students. All the staff seem nice and are very helpful.
Junior,5,"Amazing University, perfect location. Ready to enter in the business world, and where is better than New York??"
Freshman,5,I absolutely love the diversity of St. Francis. It’s one of the main reasons I applied. I also like that it’s small so it’s more of a little community as oppose to a huge campus where nobody knows anyone.
Niche User,5,I liked the friendly atmosphere the school has to offer. They were very welcoming and kind during the open house. I enjoyed the thorough tour they had of the campus and explanation of student life. Scholarship information was easy to understand.
Junior,5,"St. Francis College has offered me the opportunity to study and pursue my career. They have great many scholarship opportunities, and flexible payment plans. The professors here are great, and are able to know you personally, due to the small class sizes. I am enjoying my experience here."
Senior,5,"The small school provides a caring learning environment. We are not a number like many other colleges and universities. 90% of the students commute so it could be hard to find a good clique to hangout with. Once you get ingrained into your major you will find your life long buddies. The teachers at SFC are 70% amazing educators and 30% crazies. There are so many resources and people that will help you get to where you want to be. Whether it be a study abroad, an interview, help on an exam (from the professor), or job connections. Lastly, Saint Francis College has a beautiful diverse student body."
Senior,5,"I transferred to SFC in 2016 because I wanted the small, personal experience. I should have transferred sooner!"

The professors pour so much effort into lectures, which makes going to class worthwhile. I enjoy coming to class each and every day. I love how the classes are small because it gives the students and professors an opportunity to easily interact with one another. It's literally the small college of big dreams because my professors are constantly pushing me to work hard and focus on my career goals."

I will recommend St Francis College Brooklyn Heights to every freshman who is looking for a home from home.

College Freshman,5,The school gives the students resources if they were ever to be involved in a situation like this. The school makes everyone take a survey or test online about sexual assault and other matters before school starts. We do fire drills once in a while. The school is very safe.
College Sophomore,5,Our school has a lot of energy during the games.
College Freshman,5,security guards and id scanners
College Sophomore,5,"I'm a mathematics major, so the majority of my classes are math classes and i enjoy them very much. i have had no major problems with any of my math professors. they were all helpful and friendly. my other classes were a bit hard because the courses involve writing, however with help from tutors, i am able to pass them all."
College Freshman,5,"The career center helps you prepare for the future and the faculty is very welcoming and help you organize a road to what you want to do. There are plenty of job fairs where they recruit schools that interview people to work at a company or go to medical school. You can apply to work study and there are volunteer work and everything is available, you just ask for help and they will guide you."
College Junior,5,I like my school a lot. There very helpful in all aspects.
College Sophomore,5,"i love the atmosphere of the school, everyone is so nice."
College Freshman,5,"The only reason I went here was because they gave me four full years for free, it the only reason I go to this hell hole."

College Senior,5,I love my campus. They make sure that each student and professor are following all of the rules and regulations.
College Junior,5,"I feel as if the guys and girls are totally diverse, yet, everyone  gets along fairly well, although there are cliques they are open to everyone."
College Sophomore,5,This school is really diversed
College Sophomore,5,"There are many things to do in this  area. Many places to eat, bars, and minutes away from New York City."
College Freshman,5,You're in the city! Everything  is amazing
College Freshman,5,Literally there is everything !
College Freshman,5,"The school is very convenient to public transportation; the 2,3,4,5,A,C,F, and R trains are all within a very short walk. Several busses also stop nearby."

College Junior,5,The strictness keeps students out of harm.

College Junior,5,The atmosphere is very young and trendy.
College Junior,5,There all types of cultures and resturants.
College Junior,5,I love the fact that the small is small and the professors are willing to help as much as possible.
Recent Alumnus,5,This school is very diver all throughout. It's one of the positive aspects about SFC
College Senior,5,"This area is full of activities, cultural events, shopping...everything! You name it, it's there!!!"
College Senior,5,I've never even heard of any crime or issues of personal safety on campus! It's like you're in a utopia as far as health & safety are concerned.
College Senior,5,"I always see parties/events and interest meetings hosted by the Greeks on campus, but I've never been treated poorly for choosing not to participate.  They are definitely present on campus and can easily identified by t-shirts, jackets, and cute tote bags!"
College Senior,5,"I am a psychology major and I am confident that the program, workload, and curriculum have helped prepare me for graduate school.  Initially, I wondered why it was so much, but after talking to friends about their programs, I've come to realize that I might find myself a bit more prepared for grad school."
College Senior,5,"Take your pick! Dell or Apple! There are computer labs all over the building and they are indeed reliable.  I choose to bring my own laptop and only use the school computers when I need to print, but I wouldn't say that it's 100% necessary."
College Senior,5,You will definitely experience all four seasons...not a problem for me!
College Senior,5,"There are very reasonable rules in place for the benefit of the students on campus. If you follow them, you'll have no problem."
Sophomore,4,"Awesome. school to attend but there is no campus or dorms. However, the school does partner with a nearby hotel in order that students have forming. The school does offer opportunities to meet other students and the RA's are great with bringing together students. I am currently a IT student but is considering transferring because my courses aren't concentrated. Proffessor are available but tuition is pretty expensive coming from a single parent home."
Sophomore,4,Online learning is available especially during this covoid period that we are in. The teachers are struggling with the computers but so far so good.
Sophomore,4,The professors care about the students deeply. They tried to make sure that their students learned even through the virus ruining everything
Junior,4,It is a very small tight nit community. The college is what you make it so go in with optimism and intention to mold the school into what you want from a college.
Freshman,4,"The professors at St.Francis College are astonishing. they are always there for you when you need help. when they professors lecture they don't sound boring or rushing to get the lecture over with. They like to take their time and they know how to deliver the message. one thing that I would like to see change is the campus, the campus is very small.  between my class, I have nowhere to sit but the library and the library are where everyone sits so it is very crowded and there wouldn't be seated at times. the college needs to make more seating areas or outdoor seating as a seating option."
Sophomore,4,"So far, my experience at St. Francis College has been life changing! The diversity here is quite impressive, with clubs catering for cultures as well as religious groups. The professors are super friendly and very approachable; they always have an eye out for you. The classrooms are the perfect size for someone who is shy or anxious to give a class presentation; it holds about 30 or more people as compared to other institutions with lecture halls holding as much as 100 people!"
Freshman,4,There’s a lot of community involvement at St. Francis. The campus is clean most of the time. There’s also a lot of on campus events.
Senior,4,"St. Francis is a wonderful place to begin your college experience.  The staff and security are very welcoming and friendly, and they truly care about each and every student. The small environment and comfortable class sizes provide the ideal learning environment for student engagement.  Caring staff professionals and experienced professors are unique, lifelong mentors that motivate, aid and encourage students to maximize their opportunities while in school, and after they graduate.  There are a wide variety of majors and minors to choose from at this seemingly small college that provide strong, useful and meaningful foundations and experiences to career minded graduates.  These invaluable positions allow students to quickly apply what they have learned while making connections and developing a strong, competitive skill set that will serve them throughout their lives.  St. Francis is like having a home away from home!"
Sophomore,4,"I love the culture at St. Francis. As an athlete, I feel at home in such a big city due to the love and support from the SFC community. However, some of the academics could use improvement."
Freshman,4,"The location is great, only five minutes from Manhattan. The best thing is the small classes, so you get more personal attention. Making friends could be a little hard because it is mostly a commuter school, but there are dorms off campus which I heard are decent."
Junior,4,What I like about St. Francis College is the warming welcome I got to the school. I was a transfer student and didn’t know much and people went out there way to make sure I knew where I had to go. I would like to see a change in the school is the athletic programs. They show a lot of favoritism to certain teams and many other teams don’t get acknowledged. Also another thing I didn’t like was how some accounting professors assumed that their class knew exactly what they were talking about. The professors as a whole need to understand their class before they try to teach new material.
Sophomore,4,"I transferred to SFC, and as my first semester comes to a close I can say that so far I am liking my experience here.  My professors have all been wonderful and are available if you need help.  The advisors that I have had thus far have been so great at creating a 4 year plan for me. I will admit it is difficult to meet students because it's a commuter school, but there are plenty of clubs to join.  The school area is fantastic as well and there is so much to do!"
Sophomore,4,"St Francis college is a small college,the benefit of a small college is that professors knows you very well. This show a good relationship between a professor and a student. St Francis need to open more classes."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletic facilities are very popular in school. They always have games, practice and try outs. Sports are a big deal at school and the school is well known for having great competitive teams. School spirit is one of the main factors of being a student at sfc."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the school that I attend now, everyone is very welcoming and friendly. Some professors really caring about their students, they also are very willing to help out as much as they can. Every school is unique in their own way. For my school, the faculty shows interest in their students education and personal life. They try their best to make every student's experience at sfc unforgettable."
College Junior,4,"A lot of the professor want to see you succeed, so they do everything they can to help you."
College Junior,4,"Very diverse, everyone is welcoming."
College Junior,4,You don't see much drinking and drugs
College Junior,4,The student professor ratio is perfect. There will never be too many students in one class. I feel like this really helps the professor to know each and every one of their students.
College Junior,4,Safety has never been an issue
College Junior,4,"I love the class sizes, they're close and you get an one on one with professors. Professors actually know your name and that feels great. You have really great professors just wish there were more options for different times and not just one time and date that you need to take a certain class."
College Junior,4,I believe the school is pretty safe. I never feel like I'm in harm or I should be scared of something. We have security in the front where everyone accesses the school. And each student has the number to security if they need it.
College Junior,4,The school has a lot of things to offer. People are there to answer any questions and they actually want to help you. I would chose my school again despite the parking situation because the school feels small and grounded and that's what I was looking for.
College Freshman,4,The Greek life have fundraisers and fun activities for the school. They encourage people to join Greek life and show that they have a great experience and great brotherhood and sisterhood.
College Freshman,4,"The registration process was a little stressful because if it's your first time, sometimes you make a schedule and the schedule you make, you may not get. Once you get the hang of it, it's not that bad. The workload is a lot because if you procrastinate, there is so much work and stress, it's overwhelming. The professors try their best to assist the students if they don't understand something and there is academic available if you need. Everywhere I'd useful to study, depending where you like to study. Some people study in the cafeteria, others prefer the library, academic center, the lounge and outside if the weather is nice."
College Freshman,4,i don't have a dorm but i did tour it and it looks really good
College Sophomore,4,My dream is to get a bachelor degree in mathematics and then a master degree in civil engineering.
College Sophomore,4,Athletics at my school is a big deals. Almost everything on campus revolves around them. however I am not interested in sports so I do not know much about the sports or fundraising activities.
College Sophomore,4,My favorite experience at my school was my freshman years in. I made many new friends and great relationships with my professors.
College Freshman,4,I have nothing but good to say about the professors that I have had.
College Freshman,4,"For the most part I had a great experience with my professors, except for one. My biology professor was tough and did not benefit the class much"
College Freshman,4,St. Francis always alert studnets of new oppurtunities for jobs and/or internships.
College Freshman,4,"My experience with the courses was intimating because I didn't know what to expect. The professors challenged the students but also made the class very entertaining. Some of my classes were difficult at first but then I learned how to adapt. The professors helped every step of the way, if you didn't understand something they will take time to explain it. The class size was reasonable, since there wasn't too many students in the class, the teachers know your name and face. The classes were very entertaining especially the science lab, which opened our minds to why the human body is so amazing."
College Freshman,4,"Transferring from high school to college was difficult and frightening because I didn't know what to expect but St. Francis College was very welcoming and comfortable. Everyone is very nice and want you to have a good time. St. Francis is the small college of big dreams but its very comfortable environment. There are people there to support you and encourage you to grow. The courses they have is very interesting some of the courses I disliked in high school and I enjoyed here. During finals week, they have a de-stress week where they have activities like massages, snacks, and tips to relax before a final or use it on a daily basis when you feel overwhelmed. St.Francis is very unique because the people you first meet in your classes will become long time friends. Choosing St.Francis College was a good choice because I felt comfortable and the students and faculty are very helpful."
College Freshman,4,The teachers and students are nice and the teachers are willing to help you because they want to see you succeed.
College Sophomore,4,"Transitioning from high school to college I was apprehensive about staying home. So many of my friends were going away to college and I was nervous about going to a college- essentially in the heart of my city. To my dismay, I fell in love with St. Francis. The ""Small College of Big Dreams"" truly lives up to it's motto. Classes are small and teachers quickly learn your name. My school is unique for it's undeniable closeness. Despite being a college, you can walk the halls and be able to look up and wave to a fellow student or professor. Teachers are readily available to help you after class and take the time to really get to know their students. In addition to this, St. Francis is truly unique for being so versatile. Being in the heart of Brooklyn Heights, you still manage to get an ""away at school"" feel between amazing NYC and all it has to offer. If I had to choose my school again, this time I wouldn't be so hesitant because St. Francis is the best academic decision I have ever made for myself."
College Senior,4,"there are lots of places students can go to eat.... there's shakeshack on Adam street, and not too far away is Panera Bread, and also there's nature's grill which is two and a half blocks away. also there's places where you can use your student id to get discounts. and also there's Perelandra juice bar and Hale n Hearty."
College Freshman,4,Professors are awesome buy I really don't like the campus and school overall.
College Senior,4,Brooklyn Height's is a really nice area.
College Senior,4,I enjoy living off campus
College Senior,4,All of the Athletics at my school are really good at hwat they do and they are also kind and friendly.
College Sophomore,4,"I have only completed my first semester and enjoyed the majority of my classes.  There were experiences with two professors which I don't think is appropriate to discuss but I will avoid taking them again. My work load was fine, I never felt burden due to a work overload."
College Sophomore,4,I just completed my first semester and enjoyed the school very much. I enjoyed the classes that pertain to my major.
College Sophomore,4,The average student at St. Francis College style of dress range from athletic to casual business.
College Sophomore,4,I have not experienced any issues in regards to any of these issues.
College Sophomore,4,I don't live in housing
College Freshman,4,Some teachers really care and will help you.
College Freshman,4,I did not hear about any drug scenes
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of people from outside the U.S who play for our school
College Sophomore,4,It can get excruciatingly windy in the winter since we're so close to the water. But spring/summer here is pretty amazing. It's so beautiful out.
College Freshman,4,The school is generous with scholarships
College Freshman,4,There is plenty of shopping in the area as well as multiple places to eat.
College Junior,4,People off all different backgrounds.
College Junior,4,I Don't live on camps
College Junior,4,"It's hard to get pass security, if you are not a student. you can't just walk freely into the building without rectifying exactly what your business is with being on the campus"
College Junior,4,There's always a computer available whether it be the computer labs or the library there are many different locations within in the building that helps aid students with access to a computer and printing.
College Student,4,There is a great diverse of students
College Student,4,It is New York City. Its great
College Freshman,4,"The food around the are of the campus are exceptionally well, could be a little pricey but hey it is New York."
College Freshman,4,The people at Saint Francis are great and really fun too hangout with.
Freshman,2,"I had the worst experience at SFC. Feels like a high school with all the drama that goes on. if you're looking to go to a college with a small community and child like adults,  St Francis is the place to go. there are not many clubs that I felt like I fit into, but thats personally speaking. the food in the cafeteria is a bit overpriced and the size of the school is about the same size as my high school."
Freshman,2,"Administration keeps putting in my major wrong. Teachers are so incompetent that it affects students averages. The school is designed that you need to go into the school with a major, so most people either transfer out or graduate in 5-6 years.  The school offers nothing interesting. The fact that Manhattan is walking distance isn’t the only thing that keeps me going. I can’t wait until I transfer out"
Sophomore,2,"Academically the school is amazing, but the school itself is pretty bad. The students basically all come from Staten Island and they already have their cliques and people they talk to before they even get to school. Nobody is open to conversation with people they see sitting alone or something. The students are really stuck up."
Sophomore,2,The professors are not great as well as the entire nursing program. Some of the requirements to apply for it are ridiculous.
College Junior,2,"Too expensive, not many students dorm due to this."
College Senior,2,"I have heard horror stories of rape and sexual assault by athletes and students not getting help they need, but no personal experience with it as I am a late 20 y/o student"
College Freshman,2,They only have a the generic sports and you have to know God to get on the teams if you're any good.
College Sophomore,2,I live at home and would not even attempt to live off campus in the Brooklyn Heights area. The cost of rent is extremely high in Brookln Heights.
College Freshman,2,It's not your typical Greek life
College Sophomore,2,"Everything is so expensive around the Brooklyn Heights area. If you dorm, it's a very upper class setting full of wealthy small families and even smaller dogs. Not too many relate-able people, but there are a lot of nice old people roaming around here and there. DUMBO is the ultimate hangout spot when it's warm outside. Tons of good restaurants if you look hard enough. But as I said before, everything is a bit pricey due to the prestige that comes with living here."
College Freshman,2,There is limited street parking however it is only 1 hour muni-meter parking and there are loads of traffic cops circling the neighborhood.  There are a couple of parking garages nearby but they aren't cheap.
College Sophomore,2,"It is so difficult dealing with financial aid, but I go through it because I need it."
College Senior,2,"Most of the professors I have encountered are great. However, the quality of students at St. Francis lack motivation in their studies, so classes that could be great are dull and boring because everyone is more concerned with their outfit then their education. The athletes at the school also add to this low grade. Administrators overlook the behavior of the basketball team and put many of the student who dorm in danger. With such amazing faculty, I really wish I could give St. Francis a better review."
College Sophomore,2,"It's on the border of Brooklyn and Manhattan so it's very busy. It's very fast pace but there is also a plus to it being that you have many food choices, shopping, etc. It's rich and exciting to someone who hasn't been around it for their entire life."
College Junior,2,"Computer Unreliability – IN addition to there being computers in the library, there are computer labs with specific hours. The problem in that many times several of the computers in the library are nonfunctional. Network reliability is ok, but wireless access in rediculously slow. Personal computer or printer not necessary as there are plenty in school. However, not without issues and don't expect to have the best wireless access."
College Junior,2,"For maybe 2 months out of the year the weather is nice... it's warm outside and the sun is shining. Then it snows. The snow is nice for the first couple of days but after a foot or two it just gets old and it sucks walking to class in it.  They usually keep up on the de-icing and everything but that just means that classes don't get cancelled very often, if ever."
Senior,1,Nursing program is pathetic. I don’t have enough room to explain how seriously pathetic it really is. Spend the extra money and go somewhere else it will be worth it.
Senior,1,Online has been okay. Teachers don’t tell you what’s due or anything coming up they just assume you know. Also the nursing program sucks.
College Freshman,1,There is no parties as far as im concerned.
College Freshman,1,You have to come extra early to find parking.
College Sophomore,1,"Our RA's are horrible people, to be completely honest. A few of them abuse their power and force students to perform sexual favors to prevent having to write them up. Once you screw up once, they hold it against you. Most times that can prevent you from getting help any other time. Especially since they talk amongst each other. There super strict about the usage of marijuana, and unnecessarily so. You're subjected to having the police called on you. A lot goes on here, and because we have such a small school people try their hardest to cover it up. I would recommend living elsewhere. It's cheaper, and you won't have to worry about anyone trying to police your guests. It's usually not even about safety, these guys are just assholes."
College Sophomore,1,"It sucks. Nobody cares about Greek life unless they sell food on specific days. There isn't much appeal to them, as a whole."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking at SFC should be avoided if possible. SFC is in the city, and a fairly busy part of the city as well. I don't drive to school but I am positive finding parking even remotely near the building would be a nightmare."
College Sophomore,1,"Since it is technically a commuter college there really isn't a nightlife. However, the proximity of the school to places like Park Slope, Brooklyn(great bars) and lower Manhattan, make it easy for you to hang out with some of your friends after classes or on the weekend."
College Freshman,1,"Horrible. There is no school spirit here whatsoever. The only people who show up to basketball games are the players' family members. Some people make an effort to go to soccer games off campus, but rarely. Water polo is a thing here, but I haven't seen anyone go to games for it either."
College Freshman,1,St. Francis does not really have a night life its mostly a school for commuters who have their own friends and social life out side of the school. I never hear of any parties or anything going on. But since the school is located in nyc you can always find something to get into.
College Junior,1,"The cheapest parking available is metered parking and it's only an hour at a time. There are garages, but what student wants to pay NYC garage prices to go to school. Train station is up the block."

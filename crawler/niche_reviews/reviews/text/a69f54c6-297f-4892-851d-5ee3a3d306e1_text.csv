Freshman,5,"I have enjoyed every part of getting to know my college, Barnard College. It is welcoming and inviting."
Freshman,5,I am an incoming freshman and have therefore not taken any online classes through Barnard College of Columbia Univeristy.
Freshman,5,"Barnard is a great place for your voice to be heard. The people are supportive, the environment is cozy, the school is right next to Columbia uni and students have access to every resources there. It is a jackpot really. You get the small liberal arts college with a big institution there to support you as well."
Sophomore,5,Professors have done a great job at adjusting to online learning and it doesn’t feel that different from the real thing. The university’s decision to make pass/fail mandatory for everyone was very kind and helpful.
Sophomore,5,I genuinely can’t think of a better combination for a school. The small liberal arts college community with the benefits of the large research university of Columbia is incredible.
Sophomore,5,"I've had extremely supportive and understanding professors ever since we moved to online learning. Even though I'm in a very different time zone, my professors were all very accommodating and gave me all the support I needed."
Sophomore,5,"I have really enjoyed my time at Barnard College so far. The community at Barnard is very unique, and it truly feels like people care about each other here. Barnard students take pride in their community and connection with their peers and this creates a very supportive environment, even when the larger Columbia/ New York City community can be more competitive and overwhelming"
Niche User,5,It is an academic rigorous School. But the transition from high-school to college went well.There are a lot of programs to keep students busy and productive. In addition the dorming systems are highly secured and the cafeteria food is not bad. The campus is very beautiful and many of our classes are inside of Columbia University since we are their sister School. If you want to study psychology this would be the place because their Humanities programs are very strong. If you want to study music they also have an exchange program with Juilliard. We also have a Columbia dorming Exchange program as well.
Niche User,5,"I visited Barnard College about 2 years ago with my high school on a college tour. I was immediately impressed with the campus and its location, as well as with the leadership and kindness of the staff in the admissions center. As we were led around campus by a Barnard student, we were able to observe an active campus and witness the excitement of experiencing such an excellent liberal arts education combined with living in the vibrant City of New York. New York City's resources make going to school and living in the city more convenient than ever. I especially like the city's options for commuting to and from school/work. I had never experienced an all-female environment, therefore making me unsure if Barnard would be the right fit for me. But, as the curriculum and atmosphere were more thoroughly explained, the idea of being surrounded by and learning from such influential and independent women captivated me more and more."
Sophomore,5,"i just finished my first year at barnard college, and it was a really great experience! going to school in new york city is truly a unique experience, and i'm so glad i chose barnard. the professors and students at barnard are all great - seriously, the people are some of the most ambitious, passionate, motivated, intelligent, and creative people i've ever met. there's never a dull moment at barnard!"
Freshman,5,"I've always wanted to go to a school with an empowering community and I found exactly that. I didn't think it was a possibility for me to find a close-knit school that was also academically challenging, but I found the perfect match for me."
Niche User,5,I liked the diversity of the classroom and how small  teacher to student ratio was. I felt comfortable in speaking my mind as a woman of color.
Niche User,5,"great school academically, filled with great people. community sense is strong and everyone is very welcoming. living in New York city is an incredible experience. campus is realIy cozy and beautiful, the place feels like home.
I LOVE IT!!!!"
Freshman,5,"Barnard is such an incredible school--as soon as I stepped onto the campus, I knew it was exactly where I wanted to be. The fact that I will graduate with a diploma from an Ivy League is a bonus, but I chose Barnard because it is Barnard, not because it is Columbia. The women I’ve met here are absolutely incredible: their passion, independence, and intellect are inspiring. 
Barnard is NOT the backdoor into the Ivy league. Barnard students choose Barnard because it can offer us things we value that Columbia College cannot. Barnard is not a second choice, it is a first choice in and of itself. Of course, having Columbia resources is a plus, and Barnard benefits greatly from them, but Barnard's merit comes from its unique mission to further women's education. I find myself spending most of my time at Barnard (not only because the new library is literally heaven) but because the smaller scale, friendly employees, and cozy feel keep me here."
Junior,5,I wish there was better food. The party scene is okay and you have to be connected. The professors are pretty good although they could be better. The food around the area is good especially Sweetgreen and shake shack.
Senior,5,"I love that we are in the middle of one of the biggest cities in the world, offering endless opportunities that are hard to find in other schools. I think going to school at Barnard positions you very uniquely as you are forced to grow up quickly because you are already living on your own in NYC, yet you are still able to learn and take your time becoming an adult and experiencing college."
Sophomore,5,"Barnard is a very supportive community that uplifts and challenges you academically. In addition, you gain skills that allow you to navigate life and Barnard pushes you to feel uncomfortable which overall transforms you. Something that would be improved at Barnard is the diversity while it has gotten better majority of the population is upper class and white. Barnard could add more dorms to avoid crowded and cramped rooms."
Senior,5,"Barnard is iconic. You get every opportunity afforded to you by Columbia across the street, as well as the experience of a close-knit community of like-minded Barnard students. The city is an amazing place to learn and grow both as a student and a young-adult on the cusp of entering the real world. I'm so sad my time at Barnard is coming to a close, but it has truly prepared me for life beyond college."
Sophomore,5,"Absolutely an amazing place. Small liberal arts college with supportive, outstanding community of women within a large Ivy League University, in the greatest city in the world. Didn't intend/expect to go here (i applied last minute on the application due date as a ""why not"" sort of application after being told to apply by my high school teacher) and I can't imagine myself anywhere else. Incredibly faculty, student body, and endless amount of resources."
Alum,5,I got a great education at Barnard and also great advising and support. Also a wonderful location in the city. Small classes. Nurturing community.
Freshman,5,"Amazing school with a strong commitment to improving its students and the community at large. Bold, beautiful, Barnard!"
Freshman,5,"Barnard is the ideal school to study in in New York City. At times it feels frustratingly removed from the fun, active parts of the city, but this makes for a quiet, calming campus to focus on and to return to after a long day. My professors seem to genuinely love the subjects they teach and want to learn about their students. It's a special place."
Freshman,5,Exciting fast paced school for the intellectually curious. The relationship with Columbia cannot be understated as the schools are truly connected. Take advantage of the brilliant professors at Barnard and the small class sizes or the offerings at the ivy with challenging lectures and interesting class perspectives.
Junior,5,I love the time I've spent at Barnard.  The best thing about this college is the passionate and empowered community.  I will always cherish the amazing individuals that I've met throughout my time at this institution because of the way they are continuously inspiring me to make change and work hard and grow and never discount my knowledge or experiences or any one else's knowledge and experiences. Stay bold and beautiful Barnard!
Sophomore,5,"There is no other school like it. It is completely unique as an all women college in a major metropolitan city, with access to an Ivy. Everyone is Barnard genuinely cares and looks out for each other. Ive meet incredible people, who I wouldn't know what to do without. Its nice to have Columbia next door. We get to use their resources, however get to stay in our little community across the street where it is always warm and welcoming. Having Columbia also makes the college experience coed. There is a misconception that all-womens college means no access to guys. A lot of my classes are coed, which is nice. It is such a supportive and incredible school, in the center of the best city in the world.. what more could you ask for?"
Senior,5,"Barnard's selling point is that it's a place for empowering women, with the resources of a large research university, in the heart of New York. And despite some glaring administrative failings, it lives up to it."
Sophomore,5,"I'm a transfer, and after a year at a school I despised, Barnard saved me. The people here are so kind and giving but also incredibly diverse, intelligent, and overall delightful. I could not ask for more out of my college experience (except maybe easier classes!)."
Sophomore,5,"AMAZING school! You get best of both worlds: small, women's liberal arts college with all the resources and facilities of a large, co-ed, Ivy-League university. Plus, you get to live in NYC. You get a campus feel since it is on the Upper West Side ( residential area).

Barnard women get degrees from Columbia University, graduate at Columbia University graduation, take classes at CU and join CU clubs/sororities/sports/ societies. Barnard women can also eat at Columbia dining halls, study in all 22 CU libraries, and use the same academic buildings. Columbia students take classes at Barnard and use Barnard libraries/cafeterias/buildings. It's a great campus environment.

BTW, acceptance rate is 14.8% now (on Niche it still has a very old acceptance rate). Gets more competitive with each year as more people learn about it."
Alum,5,"I like the genuine, motivated, supportive atmosphere at Barnard. The students here are very likely to become successful in life because their professors are of the best quality. The amount of opportunities, especially being in Manhattan, are enormous. Overall, high quality education. One of a kind."
Freshman,5,There is a great environment at Barnard! The community is so supportive and they really stand up for what they believe in. The students and staff are some of the kindest people I have ever met. It's a great place to go to school.
Freshman,5,Barnard is an amazing place for young women to learn and grow within a diverse and empowered community of other women. The resources available are endless since Barnard is a part of Columbia University--a huge research university.
Senior,5,"I feel strongly about Barnard. It is a wonderful place to be. I love my classmates and professors. My experiences with the administration have been generally poor. My time here has been rewarding, surprising, and engaging."
Freshman,5,"Barnard has been incredible. It is hard core. The students are ambitious and extremely intelligent, but competitiveness is not a problem. It can get very stressful, as many of our classes are considered much harder than those at columbia, but the support system within the school, and the community really do help. Everyone has got each other's back. It's a small campus, but having all of Columbia and NYC is so worth it."
Niche User,5,Great school with good class options. Lucky to have a relationship with Columbia University across the street and learning opportunities available throughout New York City. Administration could be more receptive to students. Peers are intelligent and passionate. Great learning environment.
College Freshman,5,It's any Ivy. People care about academics.
College Freshman,5,"Barnard is the best, v bold, v beautiful <3"
College Freshman,5,A Barnard Degree is also a Columbia Degree
College Freshman,5,"Very feminist, very low key, the best I've seen"
College Freshman,5,"I may have just started here, but I LOVE IT HERE"
College Sophomore,5,Students are always informed of ways to speak up. Public safety is always right around the corner to effectively assist with any requests. The safety and respect of students is taken very seriously at Barnard.
College Sophomore,5,"Overall, Barnard is the best. It is a small supportive community where fellow students and professors want to see you succeed. There are a lot of resources you can take advantage of. It is awesome dorming in the city of New York."
College Sophomore,5,"Our classes are generally very small (even in the sciences!) and professors care about how their students do in their classes. We have a wide variety of classes offered at Barnard, but if a student would like to take a class at Columbia, they can do that easily and at no extra cost. Our class registration process is the same as Columbia's, so cross-registration is simple. Many Columbia students take Barnard classes too!"
College Sophomore,5,"Barnard's student employment office is excellent, and they have many training programs and resources available to help students access employment opportunities. There are research positions on campus, and being in New York allows students to find internships in the city with relative ease."
College Sophomore,5,"Public safety officers are always at the gates, and we have a shuttle service to pick up students who feel uncomfortable walking back to campus alone."
College Sophomore,5,Barnard is a close-knit community of women receiving a fantastic liberal arts education in the heart of New York city. Our connection to Columbia University (Barnard is considered one of its four undergraduate schools) gives us the resources of a research university with all of the perks of a small college environment. It's the best of both worlds!
College Freshman,5,"This is an amazing community that fosters academic pursuits as well as acceptance of all individuals. Barnard students have a unique sense of being involved. They are involved in things because they are passionate in them, not because it would look good on a resume. Barnard is better than I could have ever imagined it."
College Freshman,5,"It's there if you want it, but no pressure at all if you don't. I think that being in a city provides you with lots of social/nightlife options - you don't have to go to a basement at a frat party drinking if you don't want to. Bars, clubs, plays, restaurants, etc are available!"
College Freshman,5,"Public Safety is a great resource taken really seriously. The neighborhood of Morningside Heights is extremely safe, and living in NYC you learn about where you are at what time makes all the difference - even if you're from a small town, you'll learn quickly!"
College Freshman,5,"I honestly don't think you can do much better than at Barnard. I'm able to do internships during the year that students from smaller schools can't do until the summer; even more exciting is how respected Barnard students are in New York City and in general!

The Barnard Career Center is usually ranked top 5 in the country, and the alumni network is SO strong. Barnard students love Barnard."
College Freshman,5,"Academics at Barnard and Columbia couldn't be better. There are courses for everything, and you have the option of staying on Barnard or Columbia's campus for classes as much as your like. Barnard classes are generally smaller while Columbia classes are generally larger... but everything depends on the department and what you're studying. My suggestion: follow the best professors, regardless of which school they teach in. 

Academics are challenging but in the best way possible."
College Freshman,5,"Living on the quad freshman year is fantastic - you're right on campus and have the opportunity to really bond with the people on your floor. It's great that you have such easy access to everyone in the quad and you don't have to walk 15 minutes to class. The dorms are small but not cramped, and it's New York City!! Get used to small square footage."
College Freshman,5,"I feel incredibly lucky to be a student at Barnard College. It's a school really like no other - a small liberal arts women's college nestled in Columbia University in New York City. The opportunities and communities this affords you are infinite. There is no ""typical"" Barnard student except that they every student is deeply passionate about something. I've met the most amazing friends here who support me - not compete with me. I know that between the academic, extracurricular, internship and city opportunities I'm on a path not to ""succeed,"" but rather to decide what success means to me and how I want to go about accomplishing that."
College Freshman,5,Having both Barnard and Columbia courses available is amazing.
College Freshman,5,"You're part of Columbia and literally have some of the best resources available to you in the world. It's challenging and fulfilling, but being part of the Barnumbia world gives you an unparalleled education"
College Freshman,5,"I've never felt unsafe on campus, not even walking to my dorm from Butler at 3 am"
College Freshman,5,"At Barnard, they orientated us with the health and safety services quite well. I was impressed with the amount of resources they have for us. Barnard stresses the importance of our physical, mental, and sexual health."
College Freshman,5,"I get a Columbia University degree which is extremely valuable, I am right in the city which has great opportunities, they are endless job resources on campus."
College Freshman,5,"My school is amazing. It has every resource i could've wanted and more. It has a strong sense of community that you'd get from a small school yet it's association with Columbia allows for a large campus, many facilities, and many course offerings."
College Freshman,5,"I love Barnard College, because of the opportunities and choices it provides for me. There is something that meets all my possible interests and needs, from clubs, wellness groups, career development, etc. Barnard is unique, because it offers a strong support network for women by women. Barnard tries its hardest to make sure that all its students are included and welcomed in a safe environment."
College Senior,5,Barnard is the best school in the world. I have grown so much as a person and I attribute this to the empowering all female environment that Barnard offers. I love my friends and I love New York City. I cannot have imagined a better college experience.
Sophomore,4,"I've had a lot of exposure to wonderful faculty and students across the greater Columbia University, and thoroughly enjoyed my classes and extracurriculars. There is a very empowering atmosphere and people want each other to succeed. However, Barnard does not have a huge endowment, so financial aid isn't as freely given and generous as I'd have wished."
Alum,4,Barnard College is an incredible school that builds strong women. The professors have a clear dedication to their students and form close relationships with them. I wish Barnard had had more of a community feel within NYC.
Freshman,4,"The teachers are supportive and there are tons of resources to take advantage of. You can take classes at Columbia and you can also eat at Columbia's dining halls, which is fun! But I prefer Barnard's food, there's also tons of good restaurants around Barnard and Columbia. The academics are definitely challenging."
Freshman,4,"Amazing empowering environment. Definitely more diversity than I expected, which is a good thing. The Foundations Curriculum definitely gives you a lot of freedom when it comes to the classes you want to take, so you have plenty of time to explore."
Freshman,4,As an incoming student with a disability I wish ODS was more flexible with its requirements. Other than that all good.
Alum,4,"Barnard is a great community for learning about yourself and your interests. The students are incredible people, and many of the professors are experts in their subjects."
Freshman,4,"I have really enjoyed my academic experience at Barnard and felt that I've learned a great deal. The professors are engaging and care a deal about their students and clearly put significant effort into teaching. The facilities on campus are of great quality as well, particularly the new library. The student body at Barnard is diverse and incredibly well-qualified for the institution. I have met fascinating, kind, fun people from all over the United States and the world and have formed friendships that I believe will last for life."
Niche User,4,When I visited Barnard I saw a diverse group of students in classroom who actively participated and engaged in the materials that were being taught.
Freshman,4,"I am generally pleased with the organization and structure of the school, although some things definitely took getting used to."
Junior,4,"The freshman year dorms are mostly terrible, many students had heat stroke last week and needed to be hospitalized because Barnard doesn't provide AC to 75% of students. The food is alright, but you have access to Columbia dining halls which are MUCH better. The thing that makes Barnard great, and why I am still here is because of the opportunities it has allowed me. Being in NYC and getting a world class education with tons of resources cannot be found anywhere else."
Senior,4,"Barnard College is an amazing institution. If you want to live in New York City but still have a campus, this is the place for you. I love being able to walk a few blocks away from school and feel like I'm immersed in the bustle of NYC - while still having a quiet, beautiful campus to escape to. 
The English department has incredibly intelligent, dedicated professors.
However - this is not the easiest school if, like me, you have a difficult time obtaining financial aid. Juggling classes, multiple jobs, and multiple extracurriculars can be difficult - but this is a high intensity school in a high intensity city.
I love women's college though! I've learned so much from the incredible women I go to school with."
Freshman,4,"I loved it! The first year curriculum gives a lot of flexibility and opens freshmen up to a wide variety of lessons. You learn to think in many different ways through different platforms. Advisors are terrific, you get one the summer before you start your first year, so you really hit the ground running! The small classes with women add to the experience of being in a liberal arts college. The only thing I did not like was the expense. The school is over 70,000 per year and everyone I know did not receive enough aid. Many students had to take out massive loans, work crazy hours, or put their family into debt/ poverty to pay for an education that is supposed to empower women, when it actually hurt a lot of them financially. I think if you can make enough money after graduating then it is definitely worth it. You get a phenomenal education and world class job opportunities."
Junior,4,"So far, I am enjoying my experience at Barnard. At times it can feel lonely, but when I look around and see the bold, brilliant, Barnard women around me.. I feel inspired. The financial diversity is rather low however the access to Columbia's Libraries, Athletics, and Campus is unbeatable. It is the best of both worlds. A small liberal arts college connected to a large research University. The Barnard professors are hands-on and very accessible. I admire the small classroom sizes and the focus on seminars. The campus is beautiful, however there is major construction at the moment. The areas that could be improved are the dorms and the safety of women on campus."
College Freshman,4,Lots of pride in school.
College Freshman,4,Lots of security around at all times.
College Sophomore,4,"Networking at Barnard/Columbia is never ending. Plus, being in New York, students have access to so many opportunities that others do not. Barnard is well known by many Manhattan institutions, especially banks and investment firms like Goldman Sachs and HSBC and publications like the New York Times, Cosmopolitan, and Seventeen Magazine. Barnard has a very tight alumni network and alums are constantly supporting younger women."
College Sophomore,4,"I've had some professors I didn't like, but for the most part my academic experience at Barnard has been incredible and rewarding. I tend to like my Barnard professors more than my Columbia ones, usually because class sizes tend to be smaller and more student focused a Barnard. I've had great experiences on both sides of the street though!"
College Sophomore,4,"Security is everywhere on Barnard/Columbia's campus. Signing visitors in to dorms can be a major hassle because dorm security is very strict in New York. Morningside Heights is generally a very safe neighborhood, but don't be surprised when you get a mugging alert every once and a while. Also, be careful crossing Broadway."
College Sophomore,4,"As part of Greek life, I am biased. Nevertheless, I have found that social life at Columbia revolves around Greek Life more than some people might admit, but still not to a large extent. Personally, Greek Life has given me a home and a structure that I was missing my first semester of college. The camaraderie is so nice to have, and the internships and connections passed between members are invaluable."
College Sophomore,4,"Barnard is not your typical college. Given its location in Manhattan and its close relationship with Columbia University, the College does not fit the script of the 'small liberal arts school.' While Barnard could be considered small (c. 2500 students), it actually feels as large as the entire Columbia community; that is to say, huge. The academics are rigorous and the social life is sink or swim. Once you get used to it all, however, the possibilities are limitless. Once at Barnard, most students couldn't imagine going to college anywhere other than NYC, and appreciate with a new perspective how inspiring a group of ambitious women can be."
College Freshman,4,The school really cares about you
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the sports activity happens across the street. But the school spirit for homecoming week is way up, almost every students goes to the games."
College Sophomore,4,"Barnard-owned housing is guaranteed for all four years, which is great because New York housing is expensive! The RA's are really nice and they do a great job enforcing rules and creating communities."
College Freshman,4,"I love my professors. They're all passionate about what they teach and they are all very engaging in their lectures. I found the quality of courses to be everything that a top-level college should be. I know that there is major diversity in courses, however since I am a pre-pharmacy student, I am limited in my options."
College Freshman,4,I know that Barnard has a reputable status so a degree from this school is quite valuable. I also believe that Barnard/Columbia does a good job in providing career prospects for their students.
College Freshman,4,"I currently stay in Sulzberger Hall, and I love it."
College Freshman,4,"I think the athletic equipment is up-to-date and clean. I haven't utilized Barnard's fitness center, but I walk over to Columbia and their facility is fabulous!"
College Freshman,4,"I honestly believe that Barnard is the most amazing college there is. It receives the benefits of an Ivy League institution with the nurturing environment of a small liberal arts college. The proximity to downtown New York is just a bonus. Moreover, I identify strongly with the women-empowerment that Barnard fosters and I would definitely go through falling in love with Barnard again."
College Freshman,4,We have a great system in place. Barnard is especially focused on sexual assault prevention and awareness.
College Freshman,4,It has been great so far. I love the buildings and history of campus.
College Freshman,4,Not only do get an amazing education but also you have a great alumni base to reach out to.
College Freshman,4,The buildings are old but there have clearly been modern renovations done for some parts. The community in the QUAD where all the freshmen live is so much fun.
College Freshman,4,"Over 50% of students are not white - which still leaves lots of room for improvement, but is ahead of many similar institutions. There is a lot of diversity at Barnard but also a lot of privilege. We're an incredibly accepting community - open and welcome to everyone."
College Freshman,4,"Greek Life is there if you want it, but you're under no pressure to join - you can have a great social with or without!"
College Freshman,4,"All varsity athletics are run through Columbia University, but in almost all sports, we come in last of all the Ivy League schools. Most students don't really care much about sports or about going to games, but there is some school spirit and bonding in our mediocrity. My favorite line overheard: ""Last homecoming, we weren't losing for the first five minutes!!!"" 

On the other hand, all of the athletes I've met are really articulate, good students who I respect. In addition, there are lots of club and intramural sports so that you can find a team to be part of!"
College Freshman,4,I have had zero troubles so far.
College Freshman,4,You need to know how to handle different types of classes.
College Freshman,4,"Undeniable perks of having an Ivy League ""stamp"" on your degree."
College Freshman,4,Personally worked out great for me.
College Sophomore,4,"I have never heard of any serious incident jeopardizing the safety of students on campus; however, I don't feel very safe in the area around campus (Morningside Heights, Harlem) because of the number of crime reports I get in my email every so often."
College Sophomore,4,My experience so far with courses at Barnard has been great. Professors are all so passionate about the subjects they teach and always willing to help if you don't understand something.
College Sophomore,4,The Career Development Office has been very helpful to me in trying to figure out what careers I may want to pursue.
College Sophomore,4,I really love living in Barnard Housing! The Quad is really close to all my classes and Hewitt Dining Hall which makes everything very convenient.
College Sophomore,4,"I really love the wealth of interesting classes offered here at Barnard. The classes I've taken in religion and gender studies in particular have had an immense impact on me and have helped me to think in new and exciting ways. The diverse but warm and welcoming student body here has encouraged me to not only be confident in myself, but also to be more accepting of those who are different from me."
College Freshman,4,I got lucky and have AC. The roommate selection process people are pretty good at their job
College Freshman,4,"It's definitely nothing like a traditional state school, which is why I like it and plan on rushing."
College Freshman,4,"Only been here for a semester but it's changed my life for the better. It's not like the brochures and there's some things I was disappointed by, but I've felt myself grow for the better and start to feel like I truly belong."
College Freshman,4,"The school is unique, alright. It's wonderful to be surrounded by such intelligent, motivated individuals at all times."
College Freshman,4,"I love Barnard so far.  The vast majority of the girls are really friendly, smart, and looking to reinvent themselves.  I 100% made the right decision."
College Sophomore,4,"I honestly feel that Barnard's housing policy is relatively good. I think that we need MORE housing as there have been problems with students not getting any housing choice and having to be randomly placed, but overall the facilities are great, the staff are great, and everything seems to settle in well."
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't found 'strictness' on campus to be a problem, honestly."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm giving this a 'great' because of Ferris and Diana. Diana, especially, is great for variety and an active, fun atmosphere. Ferris has a pasta bar with an EXTREMELY wide variety of things to order as well as an 'open all day' schedule so you can get food in between classes."
College Junior,4,"It's great because the school's in New York City, but with that in mind it does also get pretty expensive."
College Junior,4,"I come from a single-parent household and really can't afford school, so I get great financial aid. Barnard covers 100% of demonstrated financial need, and even though the office can be a pain to work with, they will usually work with you to get you what you need."
College Junior,4,"It's definitely not the best housing that there is out there, but I feel like it serves its purpose and the dorms are all reasonably decent. The only problem is the Housing staff, which is a nightmare to deal with."
College Sophomore,4,Great healthy options. Fresh and quick
College Sophomore,4,Its great to be so close to classes.
College Freshman,4,"Tons of restaurants around, super easy to order delivery online, however the cost adds up quickly! You can't eat out often if you're on a budget."
College Freshman,4,"It's cheaper than an apartment in the city and very close to all classes. However, rules are strictly enforced and it can be somewhat difficult to sign guests in. The shared kitchen and bathroom spaces are not bad but not always clean or convenient."
College Sophomore,4,Curriculum is rigorous but not impossible. Lots of job/internship opportunities.
College Freshman,2,This school is very pretentious and competitive. It is an Ivy League. People are insecure and try very hard to seem smart. It is a very isolating situation.
College Freshman,2,The old dorms are very dirty and there is no AC which is rough for the first month.
College Freshman,2,"Lol nobody here has any school spirit when it comes to sport except maybe the athletes. The Columbia football team won two games this season, effectively ending our three year losing streak. It's a great school, but if you're looking for a student body that goes to games every weekend, this is not it."
College Freshman,2,"While Barnard is an excellent institution for many young woman, unfortunately it is not the best school for all young woman. Community at Barnard is severely lacking. Despite being an extremely small school, there is a lot of dorm overcrowding and single first-year residence halls are sometimes composed of over 50 students. This makes it extremely difficult to create friendships with fellow hall-mates, and aside from a meeting held during the first week of school, most RAs won't spend the time to get to know you, or even learn your name. The community which does exist at Barnard, however, revolves around a sense of extreme liberalism, often verging on socialism, with a strong focus on popular activist movements. While this is great for many students who share an interest in these values, it can sometimes be isolating if you don't subscribe to such an  agenda. There's no denying that Barnard has excellent access to many resources as well, but with the library and gymnasium under construction for the next 3-4 years, this has again taken a toll on the school's sense of community and cohesiveness. Moreover, there are many fantastic professors, but most teach upper level courses. All in all, Barnard is a great school, but only if you are the proper fit."
College Freshman,2,"The upperclassmen dorms are generally suite-style in apartment buildings. Apartments in this area are more expensive, so it's not worth leaving the campus housing system. Lots of campus housing is actually pretty far away from campus, though I don't think it would be easier and/or cheaper to get an apartment."
College Freshman,2,"I have been to several dorm parties, all have been very small and awkward. I've only ever been to one frat party here and was not impressed. It seems the only way to party is to go out to bars, which in this area one must be 21+. Most weekends my friends and I just end up hanging out in one of our rooms. Also, Thursday is a huge party night because it is common to not have classes Friday, but my schedule has never worked out like that so that may be why I don't have a great party experience."
College Sophomore,2,"It's New York City, small and expensive apartments are expected."
College Sophomore,2,"Being a vegetarian, there is no food variety. It's either eat a salad or have pizza everyday. At Hewitt, once in a while at the ""Home"" station they will have an interesting option. But there is always 1 vegan option, 1 vegetarian option - which could be rice and potatoes. Very repetitive."
College Freshman,2,You don't need a car since public transportation is right there.
College Sophomore,2,"There is no need for a car, and I would not reccommend parking nearby."
College Sophomore,2,"You can pay a fortune and live in a tiny apartment in Morningside Heights or you can pay a fortune and live in a tiny apartment AND commute to your 9 am class. Better make sure you packed all the right books, cus you never know with the 1 train."
College Freshman,2,Greek life is pretty non-existent at Barnard/Columbia.
College Sophomore,2,"There really is no need to drive yourself around campus. The only time I've seen a lot of cars around was during move-in day. The rest of the school year, however, most students walk or use the campus shuttles to get around BC and Columbia, and many take a cab, bus, or subway, to get out."
College Freshman,2,There are many more girls on campus then guys
College Senior,2,You have to go downtown to get to anywhere really fun in the evenings. On campus parties aren't that great.
College Sophomore,2,Barnard guarantees housing for 4 years. Affordable off campus housing is extremely difficult to find. Why leave?
College Sophomore,2,"Very Hard to Get – Manhattan is expensive! Most of the apartments surrounding campus are owned by Barnard or Columbia, meaning that any off-campus housing is quite a commute. Parking is definitely a no."
College Sophomore,2,Atrocious. It's super expensive so don't even bother.
College Senior,2,Women's college provides normal security – It's a women's college so we are expected to act a certain way and they want to provide a certain amount of normal security.
Freshman,1,"Barnard and Columbia are terrible in dealing with anything related to student mental health. There is a 'stress culture' on both campuses that is very dangerous. During my freshman year at Barnard/Columbia there were multiple suicides and the administration do very little to support students. I also never felt the inspiring, positive energy on campus that all those pamphlets and videos talk so much about. I had one professor who mocked the way I spoke in my seminar class every single week. The financial aid department threatened to take away my financial aid as I never had a Social Security No (I'm an international student who did not require one). The Financial Aid office also denied my access to the Bare Essentials Fund, something offered to me in my financial aid award as they changed their mind and decided I ""was not poor enough"" even as a FGLI student. Academically, Barnard is a good institution but I URGE you to consider other options before deciding on this poorly run school."
Junior,1,"If you have a learning disability, you are going to have a rough time—Barnard's disability services are awful.  They're your adversary instead of your advocates like they're supposed to be, and they either don't understand anxiety or don't care—it's so depressing.  It's only marginally better for physically disabled students, but at least they can't deny your condition if you're in a wheelchair.  My advice to prospective students who have learning disabilities: Don't go here unless you have an unbreakable psyche, and even then, get ready for the biggest test of your life."
Junior,1,"Barnard's relationship with Columbia can be pretty tense, and most Barnard students overcompensate for the fact that they are sometimes treated poorly by Columbia students by being equally as competitive and self-serving as the average Columbia student, and, as a result, equally depressed. The culture is enormously stressful, the student body is not at all economically diverse, and the school is lonely, with no long-lasting effort by administration to change this fact besides the occasional, poorly-attended on-campus event. It's a city school, so there's not a ton of campus community, and not a lot of on-campus parties (some at Columbia, none at all at Barnard). Dorms are really, really bad (except for the one newer one). Academics are amazing and professors care deeply about individual students, but the negative campus culture is pervasive and can affect an experience in lots of minute ways. And fair warning: whatever you don't like about Columbia WILL be prevalent at Barnard too."
College Freshman,1,Nothing to do if you don't want to go to bars.
College Freshman,1,"The student body is strangely competitive and obsessed with the idea of the ""Ivy League."" There is also a weird dynamic between Barnard and Columbia. People are very aware of their own intelligence and like to show it off. The facilities are in bad shape. Save your money, it will go a lot further elsewhere."
College Sophomore,1,"Barnard doesn't have its own sports teams! All varsity athletes at Barnard play for Columbia teams. There is very little school spirit at Columbia University because our football team is not very good. We excel at certain sports, like fencing, but not a lot of people watch those competitions."
College Freshman,1,We won two football games this season!!! Our first game in years!!!
College Freshman,1,"The food is generally bad, especially for the price first years are required to pay. The Diana is the only place with good food, but it is quite expensive. Barnard students do not have flex dollars at all like Columbia students do, and are not even allowed into one of Columbia's cafes. Personally I don't mind that but I'm just so confused about why our meal plan costs more at Barnard if it's so much worse."
College Freshman,1,"I didn't get offered any financial aid, and no merit aid is offered."
College Freshman,1,I would go to a school with more of a social scene on campus. I study all week and when I want to blow off some steam on the weekend there is absolutely nothing on campus to do because lame dorm drinking parties. YES dorm drinking parties are great but with fun people that you know not with cocky upper classmen.
College Sophomore,1,"I don't know why anyone would ever bring a car to Barnard. If New York's public transportation system is so amazing (and cheap), its parking is horrendous: good luck finding a parking spot (and then having to deal with NY's ridiculous parking rules and loop-holes). If you want to keep your car in a garage, get ready to shell out hundreds of dollars a month. All in all, there is absolutely no need to bring a car."

Alum,5,Moodle is the used platform and teachers were always willing to help and understanding if unforeseen circumstances came up.
Alum,5,"An amazing experience with elite professors, institutions, and the environment. One of the best liberal arts colleges in the American Midwest."
Alum,5,"The school does not have many online learning options, but that is changing because of COVID-19. I would expect their integration of online learning to be as great as their in-person classes are."
Senior,5,DePauw University is the best private college in the midwest. The class size is relatively small which enables professors to focus on each individual student to help them succeed. DePauw University is a liberal arts college that allows students to gain different perspectives from a variety of courses offered.
Senior,5,"Classes are not offered online at DePauw University. However, during the coronavirus classes were moved to online. Professors were patient and understanding with all students."
Freshman,5,"The campus is a little on the smaller side so it offers a very personal degree. The amount of help you get with internships, job opportunities, and many different research opportunities."
Alum,5,I loved the small community feel at DePauw.  The people were very friendly and helpful.  The food was excellent and the parties were the highlight of the week.  I hope the Sunday evening meal policy has changed.  I had quite a few hungry Sunday nights.  The education I received was superb.  I meet some of my best friends there and we still keep in touch today.
Niche User,5,"They offer many opportunities for undergraduates that other colleges don't typically give. It's a very small school, so you can have closer student-professor relationships. You have the chance to be a big fish in a  small pond, as well as become part of its tight-knit community."
Niche User,5,"DePauw has a beautiful campus and dynamic student life. Everyone knows each other and the professors work hard to maintain a personal connection with each student. At DePauw, you won't just be another number."
Niche User,5,"DePauw is the only school that will care. That sounds cold, but from DePauw I've received countless hand written post cards from admin, free gifts for committing, and so much help trying to find a place to fit in. It's campus is absolutely beautiful as well and the food is amazing!"
Freshman,5,DePauw University is the best place if you want to get strong knowledge and to have a good motivational and friendly atmosphere
Freshman,5,I cant wait to go come here for school next year. Staff is great campus is really nice. Great small school.
Junior,5,I love DePauw. It is an amazing place. It is VERY academcially chaellenging and prepares their students well. I fell like there are lots of resources for students for careers or for academics. My favorite part of DePauw is the staff and faculty. Most of the professors at DePauw are very supportive of their students. My problem with DePauw is how they deal with racial problems. Many of us students feel that DePauw reacts to racial incidents rather than trying to prevent them. It's usually after a racial incident has happened that we had talks and seminars about race and equality. The only thing that happens is Day of Dialogue but it's only once a year.
Niche User,5,"DePauw is a beautiful small college that provides a great education and a leg-up in finding a meaningful job or getting into graduate school.
Our son recently graduated from DePauw, and he had a wonderful experience. The class sizes are small, so he interacted and came to know his professors well.
He was a Media Fellow and had two summer newspaper jobs, which were paid for by generous DePauw funding. His semester abroad was also partly underwritten by DePauw.
When he graduated, a DePauw alum helped him get an interview at an excellent company, and he was hired at a good starting salary. His friends all went to graduate schools or got equally good starting jobs.
He's happy he chose DePauw, and we, his parents, are too."
Niche User,5,DePauw has opportunity for involvement and there is a place for all individuals and their unique interests.
Freshman,5,Great place.  Numerous honors programs including the Management Fellows Honors program and the Prindle Institute on Ethics.  Great alums including the founder of ESPN and Angie's List.  VP Dan Quyale is also a graduate.
Senior,5,DePauw has challenged me academically and has prepared me to confidently enter into the real world. I feel that I won’t have any difficulty finding a job in Computer Science as soon I graduate in May.
Freshman,5,Amazing school! They truly care about the students and truly want them to succeed. There are so many opportunities to get involved and the mentor program is a fantastic way to start the school year. There are really no negatives about this place. From day one I fell in love.
Freshman,5,Beautiful campus. The professors are some of the best in the world. The entire faculty is friendly and helpful. The facilities are well maintained. Study abroad is accessible and required!
Sophomore,5,"DePauw University can be described as a place full of opportunity. This established University offers so many opportunities for its students to excel in any direction they choose to pursue. It also challenges its students on their every level of being, whether that be through the rigorous academic options, athletic opportunities, or involved greek life. My experience with DePauw, although it is only the start, has involved all of these aspects and more. I cannot wait to see what DePauw has in store for my future."
Senior,5,"I love DePauw. The sense of community you get on campus is fantastic. Greek life is huge at DePauw, but it does not divide you into a segregated silo. You still have opportunities to make friends in other houses. DePauw is great for developing all aspects of life, not just the academics."
Freshman,5,I love it here. It's the perfect fit. The academics are amazing and internship opportunities are one of a kind. They also provide pretty good financial aid for how expensive it is. I would highly recommend checking DePauw out.
Freshman,5,I love this school.  Professors are great and always willing to help.  There is a great party atmosphere for a small school.  It's a ton of fun.  Great experience.
Junior,5,"DePauw University is the best education you will every receive besides an Ivy League School. I transferred out and had to come back because no other education compares to DePauw. They set you up for success, and you will feel prepared for life after graduating."
Alum,5,Beautifully and enriching liberal arts school in quite and rural Indiana. Students are given a great deal of attention by professors and community activities and life on campus are strong.
College Junior,5,I always feel driven and that I am getting the best attention and care from my professors. I love this school.
College Sophomore,5,"We're a top party school for a reason. Because we are so small, you basically just have to walk into a party and that's it. Everything is free, too. I'm told at other schools people have to pay for alcohol or admission.... I couldn't imagine that here. We offer Safe Ride, which is a shuttle service, essentially, that will pick you up and take you to or from your residence hall if you feel like you cannot walk back or feel unsafe doing so. Administrators know that people are going to party and drink, and they all take precautions before any large event like Monon or Little 5. Campus is small, so security is at most 5 minutes away. You can always call public safety or safe ride if you feel like you aren't in a safe situation."
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone at DePauw is extremely driven to succeed. We are the only school to make it onto the list of top party schools and make it onto a list of schools with top academics in the same year. We all do work hard and play hard, and you will hear it often. 

There is a wide array of majors to choose from. Not as many as your average state school or anything, but we do offer interdisciplinary majors where you essentially build your own from different courses. Professors are very willing to help students for any reason at any time. Most syllabi (syllabi? really?) are easy to follow and have all the information you would need on them.

The workload is a bit harder than other schools I have noticed, but nothing is filler. Everything is assigned for a reason, and it is all worth it in the end. 

There are tons of spaces to study. Some are harder to find than others (basement of Roy, I'm looking at you). Our library has a silence-to-floor rule, so you can talk on the first floor, but the third floor has to be absolutely silent. It's easy to find your spot here."
College Sophomore,5,"We have tons of students representing various countries, most notably east Asian countries! However, it is most definitely a predominantly white school. But coming from someone who grew up in a town that is almost 98% white, it is extremely diverse and there are a ton of opportunities to learn new things and meet new diverse people. Politically speaking, we are diverse. I've seen many arguments on YikYak about politics. You can come from a super conservative lifestyle and still be accepted here, and the same for someone coming from a liberal background. The LGBTQ community is wonderful and super supportive here, and that's something that is very important to me. This coming year we will even have an LGBTQ floor in a first year residence hall for those that are interested. There are also plenty of things to do around campus if you are religious. There is a popular Christian coffeehouse that people visit and do youth group type of activities each week, and Young Life is another group that visits a local middle school to mentor young kids. You can be a purple alien from space and still find your niche here, basically."
College Sophomore,5,"Quality of courses: Excellent. I have yet to take a class and feel like I learned nothing.

Professors: Even when they're the crazy mad-scientist type of professor, they are always willing to help. They all are very good at what they do, and each one wants to know their students personally. The personal attention to students is one of my favorite aspects of the school.

Variety of courses: Pretty great selection, but you have to cross your fingers if you want to get into a popular class. They fill up quickly and many people are often waitlisted for things like Psych and Sociology. Criminology was a big one recently that many people could not get into quickly enough.

Class sizes: I haven't had a class bigger than 30 people, and probably never will. It feels very much like a high school class size. 

If you're looking for a great school where you will get a lot of personal attention from professors, this is the place for you. DePauw cares about its students and provides great resources to ensure you'll get all the help you need with things like internships, finding a job, connecting with alumni, and even helping you to write an awesome resume. The atmosphere is always friendly and people are always willing to go the extra mile to help you out. I love it!"
College Sophomore,5,"DePauw has an entire student center that focuses on getting you ready for a career. Our Hubbard Center is where you go to get help with interviews, finding internships, writing your resume, and more. There are so many opportunities to really get a head start on your career here. There are multiple job fairs a semester, and there is a large alumni network that is provided to students."
College Sophomore,5,"DePauw is unique because it is a very small school with very focused and determined students. Professors are always there to help and the small class sizes make it easy to know your professors on a personal level. DePauw is, for many people, a home away from home, and it is easy to see why after visiting. I am happy to be able to attend DePauw and would choose it all over again if I were given a do-over."
College Freshman,5,"greek life has is amazing, they do so many things for the community and they really are their for eachother."
College Freshman,5,"Party scene is huge here. DePauw is consistently ranked as one of the top party schools every year. I think a couple years ago it was ranked as #13 and was the only Div.III school in the top 20. The party scene revolves around frats, but house parties are common too."
College Junior,5,"Strong academics, and knowledgeable professors. The academics are top rate, but also rather difficult.

You do leave with a wealth of knowledge so I suppose it balances out."
College Freshman,5,I always feel safe on campus. The university takes persistent measures to ensure the safety of all students in all facets.
College Freshman,5,"The courses rock! Huge variety in all subjects, and the professors all really care about you and your progress. The class size will typically never exceed about twenty students."
College Freshman,5,DePauw has infinite resources and connections.
College Freshman,5,We have the BEST Greek life. An overwhelming majority of the campus goes Greek; it's a huge part of the campus culture.
College Freshman,5,DePauw has their own police called public safety that helps make sure students are safe. We even have safe ride that gives students rides throughout campus.
College Freshman,5,DePauw Greek life is awesome! About 80% of students are involved in Greek life. There is a party literally every single night of the week.
College Freshman,5,The school has so many stadiums and sport facilities for not only athletes but also other students.
College Freshman,5,"So far my college experience has been absolutely wonderful. I have no doubts that I chose the right college, I've made so many connections with a ton of people and everyone here is super nice. If I were to do it all over, I would make the same choice every time. It is the perfect overall fit for me and would recommend it to any one who is looking for a smaller college, with great faculty, students, sports, organizations, and pretty much anything else positive you can think of."
College Junior,5,Amazing campus with family feel!
College Sophomore,5,The small student population size makes the campus very unique.  Everyone is so friendly and willing to help everyone.  There is a lot of emphasis of teamwork and community.  You couldn't pay me to go to a different school.
College Junior,5,"I've always had a safe and fun experience at DePauw when it comes to partying. Since the campus is so small you feel comfortable walking from house to house and you typically will know plenty of people at each party. Partying, in a sense, has impacted my ability to communicate with new people and feel more confident in stressful situations. You can see those qualities shine through in many of the students who go out often."
College Junior,5,Received the financial aid I needed easily.
College Junior,5,"As a freshman, DePauw makes all of the freshman students live together either in the same dorm or ones next to each other. It creates a great sense of unity on campus before everyone goes Greek in the spring semester. As an upper classman if you get stuck in a dorm it just feels like a repeat of freshman year. The best place to live is in the duplexes on campus that each have their own washer and dryer, kitchen and two bathrooms. You can live with whoever you want and that creates a great social environment at your own home."
College Sophomore,5,"There are lots of activities for freshmen to help them get to know each other.  The frats have regular parties, some of which are campus-wide and anyone can attend them.  There are always people hanging out somewhere on campus.  Because everything is within walking distance, it is safe for everyone to get home from parties.  This is a small student body and you will see everyone that attends a party, so students are more respectful of one another, even at parties."
College Sophomore,5,I needed financial assistance for the past 2 years.  The financial aid office will work very closely with you and your parents to provide as much assistance as possible.  They will let you know if you are missing information that they need to provide the assistance.  There are a variety of scholarships and grants available.  I even received a scholarship and a grant to help me afford studying abroad next year.
College Freshman,5,I couldn't ask for anything better. I would do it the same all over again.
College Freshman,5,"I love it here. I know some people who would hate it, but it's the perfect school for me. Great size, close to home, huge Greek life, and small class sizes. Professors are generally great and actually care about the individuals in the classroom. The biggest class I ever had was 30, the smallest was 7. It all depends on what classes you take. I love the opportunity for discussion and the fact that the students all seem to actually care about school. It's a really good environment to be a part of."
College Freshman,5,"Greek life is awesome. It definitely runs the campus so I see why independent students get annoyed sometimes, but for those involved it's a great community."
College Freshman,5,"There's always something going on so you never have to worry about not being able to go out. The big fraternities (Phi Psi, ATO, Delt) always throw good ones. Even though it's pretty crazy sometimes, the student body definitely has a ""work hard, play hard"" mentality so staying in to study is not frowned upon."
College Sophomore,5,I have never felt threatened while at a party and I always have a good time when out.
College Junior,5,"Getting financial aid should not be a hassle. If any school gives you a hard time, they do not want you. Always remember that you are the one schools are demanding. If the schools do not have students they cannot stay open."
College Sophomore,5,"Depauw University has their own events as well as student made events. There are many facilities that are open to students as well. Our library is open from 8am to 11pm, there are many different student centers, and just everyday hangout places. We have public safety and safe ride options as well."
College Sophomore,5,"As I have said before, due to my desired major not being available at this school the option that is often given is to transfer, however, I love my school too much. It is not just the people that make me want to stay. Depauw itself has such a great environment and the atmosphere everyday is amazing. Everyone is so friendly and so active as well. I really love my school, and there is just no clear answer as to why I chose this school out of the many others that I could have gone to."
College Freshman,5,"since campus is majority greek, the housing for them is the best. the campus also bought a lot of regular houses so those are really nice as well"
College Freshman,5,the science major at depauw is the hardest department but also the most rewarding. they work you hard and the science advisors make sure you're prepared for the next step of your educational career
Junior,4,"Despite my anger and frustration with administration, I love my teachers. They really want you to pass and do well they will take all the time they have to help you get where your going. I have only had one teacher that was reckless when it came to her assignments and rules (she forced a kid to come from his grandmothers funeral to attend class or fail). Other than that one teacher I love the rest. When it comes to the pandemic alot of my teachers took to online classes with stride only one went crazy to where she was changing the final assignment up until the day it was due. I'm not great at the stem area and the classes I was required to take in that area, the teachers worked really hard with me to try to get me to pass and I did which was great!"
Alum,4,"DePauw University is deeply rooted in tradition and academics that allow students to flourish in an accepting community. Located in Greencastle, Indiana, this may be it's only downfall but without much to do in the surrounding community, that leaves all the more time to focus on your studies. With an endless amount of clubs and ease to get one started, you will find your group. The school of music offers free concerts to students year round and actively recruits non-music students to join. DePauw recently hired it's first female African American president and it has been a joy to see the administration start taking diversity initiatives seriously. A huge portion of the campus is a part of greek life and it is easy to get involved. I spent the best four years of my life here making memories that will last a life time."
Sophomore,4,They really take care of their students.  Great opportunities and financial aid.  It is a small campus but there are students there from all around the world. A car would be useful but you can manage just fine without one
Sophomore,4,There were a few technical glitches but we managed to get by.  This was okay for the semester we had to do it for but I would not like to learn like this all the time.  I missed my study groups and having easy access to my professors.  I am looking forward to hopefully coming back to campus in the Fall
Freshman,4,"Overall, I really do enjoy Depauw. It all comes down to what factors are the most important to you. For example, my biggest concern was the value of their music and theatre programs as opposed to the dorms or food, and therefore them being somewhat sub-par wasn't all that much of a deterrent. If you are interested in Greek life, this university prides themselves on it. Over 3/4 of the student body rush, and the school puts a lot of time and resources into them."
Freshman,4,"I have only attended DePauw University for one semester which means there is a lot more on the campus for me to explore and participate in, but so far, I have thoroughly enjoyed it. There are many opportunities to study abroad and learn in an experimental setting rather than solely from textbooks. The relatively small class sizes are ideal because they allow me to form relationships with my professors and feel a sense of community that I would not have necessarily gotten at a larger institution. I am eager to see what other opportunities this beautiful campus has to offer."
Sophomore,4,"Super welcoming environment, professors who care and students who want to build. DePauw has  a long history  of being different and excellent! If you're looking for a sign, this is it."
Junior,4,"Professors seem to genuinely care about students well-being and path in life, great facilities, but the administration leaves something to be desired."
Senior,4,"DePauw is an inclusive environment with many clubs and activities to participate in. The faculty is by far the best part. I have never had a professor I did not like, respect, and learn from. DePauw is reasonable with coursework and encourages students to pursue many opportunities. However, it is expensive and lacks resources for a variety of majors, as they mainly only focus on the management program and only encourage students to pursue a business related job."
Freshman,4,"I am Currently a College Freshman at Depauw, and so far it has been a very interesting college experience. The Diversity at this school is not very good, but I still think that I have had a great time overall. There is always a party to go to, and there is always a safe ride car that will take students back to their dorms so that they make it back okay."
Freshman,4,DePauw offers a variety of experiences for every type of student including amazing study abroad options!
Sophomore,4,"I will be a sophomore this 2018-2019 school year and I can say my first year was something that will stick with me forever. I am always surrounded by opportunities and helping hands. The professors are amazing educators and mentors. I could not have chosen a better academically challenging school, while having fun studying and playing a collegiate sport. I know my next three years will push me and help me grow as an individual."
Freshman,4,"I  will be attending DePauw University next fall and I am more than excited about the opportunities it has to offer. It will allow me to pursue all my career and extracurricular interests, along with being a very high academic school. I know I will have a ton of fun the next four years! It offers extremely good study abroad program opportunities and I cannot wait to go on one. The academics are very very good and professors work very well with students. Through the smaller class sizes, students get to know one another very well and get to also know the professors on a more personal basis."
Freshman,4,"So far at Depauw, I have enjoyed the aspect of each classroom being an intimate setting where each student is required to participate. This school has motivated me to get out of my comfort zone and become very involved in the community. There are great opportunities at this school available to everyone that can help individuals build on their leadership and professional skills. A great focus at this school is inclusiveness. Each faculty member tries there best to ensure that no student feels left out and that everyone is included and feels important."
Senior,4,"My first two years at DePauw were absolutely amazing!  The student life was incredible!  However, my junior year things changed.  The administration changed and the lack of transparency between the school officials and students really changed my view of the school.  I still enjoy a lot of aspects of my school; however, with the changes that are being made, I'm not sure that I would recommend this school to future students."
Junior,4,"DePauw is a great school academically; if you work hard while you're here, the alumni connections and the prestige of a DePauw degree will take you far. The study abroad opportunities are amazing and definitely unique. The party scene gets exhausting and boring. It's great freshman and sophomore year but by the time you're a junior every night is the same. Students are very very overworked and are expected to spend 30 hours a week studying and at least 15 hours a week in class, leaving the rest of your week nights to do all of the activities that you need for your resume. People are very high achieving but are very stressed and depressed, meaning that mental health is not very well addressed on campus."
Senior,4,"I love the small classes, the ability to study music at the School of Music although I am a non-music major, and the individual attention I have received from professors, career center, and staff. I wish the social atmosphere was not so dependent on sorority and fraternity life (70% of students are involved). But, I have navigated this by jumping into Christian organizations and being involved as a Resident Assistant. I think the biggest advice I'd give to someone who feels like they are an ""old soul"" and not interested in your media definition of ""college life"" and who wants to attend DePauw is this: Know yourself and find things that strengthen who you are. The academics are top notch and you can find what you love."
Junior,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at Depauw. The faculty and staff are attentive, the campus is beautiful and their endowment for financial aid is great. However, I wish that their were more resources and funding for multicultural and LGBT services. Another issue is much of the campus is not ADA compliant and at times inaccessible to people with mobility issues."
College Junior,4,"The school helps students find the best internships for them, and the alumni network is very strong."
College Junior,4,The professors are very accessible and always willing to help you with your studies. They're very passionate about what they teach.
College Senior,4,The Hubbard Center is a great student resource and helpful in finding us students many funded opportunities.
College Senior,4,"New gym recently opened, state of the art machinery and pool."
College Senior,4,In some parts than others I based my opinion here of the supportive computer science department.
College Sophomore,4,The school's Hubbard Center works hard to ensure that opportunities are continually available for you. Great team of advisers.
College Sophomore,4,Never have I felt in danger on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Apart of the fabric of this school.
College Sophomore,4,"My only complaint is the lack of security cameras. We would have way less residence hall vandalism if there were cameras around campus. I know of maybe four cameras throughout campus, and no idea if they are even hooked up to anything..."
College Sophomore,4,"The only problem with housing is the fact that oftentimes, underclassmen in first-year residence halls make it difficult for everyone. Housing will charge everyone for damages unless someone comes forward or turns in a silent witness form, and that does not often happen. There is a lot of vandalism (at least there was my first year) that resulted in many, many people being charged for the actions of a few. Apart from that, housing is great. 

Rooms are generally what you would expect. Humbert (often called Humbert Hotel) is the nicest and newest first-year residence hall. People complain about Hogate, but I was there my first year and I wouldn't have had it any other way. It is the only building with single rooms and it is all suite style living with two doubles and two singles attached to a small common room, which was so much fun. It really made me feel comfortable, and the only people that bash Hogate are the people that have never lived there. Bishop Roberts is all double rooms, and they are pretty spacious. Longden is all triples and doubles. It's definitely old, but the rooms are huge there. College Street is the smallest first-year hall, but the people that live there are like a huge family by the end of the year. It is all double rooms as well."
College Sophomore,4,"As an independent student, I'm in the minority here, but I have tons of friends that decided to go Greek. Greek life here is different than at other places because we are so small. Everyone is friends with everyone, it isn't cliquey. Greeks don't treat independents differently than any other person. Our recruitment process is deferred until second semester in order to stress the importance of community and academics overall, as well. I think that's a great way to go about it. Don't expect to rush during your first month here like at other big schools."
College Sophomore,4,"While some dormitories may have big spacious rooms, or smaller ones, they're comfortable to live in. All dormitories are a good walking distance from classrooms and food places. Social atmosphere is great. Housing process is very easy, but sometimes can be difficult to get into the kind of room you want."
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics at DePauw is a big thing, and it can be displayed by the school spirit. Many students wear their college gear to show support everyday."
College Sophomore,4,This school is very diverse in educational topics despite the small campus. Classes are challenging and do require a lot of priority and time management. There are a lot of academic resources open for students that need the extra push.
College Freshman,4,"Lucy Rowland, the resident housing that I lived in my freshman year, was a great dorm to live in. It was healthy living, which meant no drugs, alcohol, etc. It was kept very clean. All of the other freshman dorms were not healthy living and were pretty dirty most of the time. Lucy was away from all of the other freshman dorms but all of the dorms are pretty close to all classes. The housing process was quite simple to figure out and apply for."
College Freshman,4,"From what I've heard from my graduating friends, they've been able to find work somewhat easily."
College Freshman,4,"There's is a whole lot of positives about Depauw. The course sizes are good, the professors are generally great. Overall, you can expect to receive a good education here."
College Freshman,4,"We have ten different fraternities and between them, there's one for everyone."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is very safe, Since I have been going there, there hasnt been issues that has happened on anyones safely for crime."
College Freshman,4,"They offer so many different courses and they have wonderful professors to teach them. The class sizes are very small, your professor really gets to know all the students and has time them. I enjoy chemistry classes the best or just science in general."
College Freshman,4,"The alumni network is very strong, they really help the students when it graduating time, Theu offer many job internship prospects, they are really about helping their students succeed in life."
College Freshman,4,"campus living is awesome, I have made wonderful friends for life. Dorms are clean, we can do our laundry for free, It all went rather well with getting the housing that worked for my illness."
College Freshman,4,"The student involement, team performance and fan support and school spirit and athletic facilities are all amazing. I really enjoy my college."
College Freshman,4,"I have a chronic Illness and I have been sick since I was in 8th grade, High school was tuff but i did my best and I graded.I wrote my essay about my life and I had a interview with the college and they were amazed on everything I have over came in my life."
College Freshman,4,"DePauw is one of the best schools in their conference and good nationally too. We very often win conference championships in all sports and win NCAA Div.III Championships. This fall alone we won the conference in field hockey, women's soccer and had 9 of our fall teams appear in the NCAA Championships, which is huge. School spirit is high, nothing like a state school, but quite good and supportive for as small of a school as ours. Our athletics facilities are top notch, with the Lily Center (our new athletic center) and brand new athletic fields completed in 2014."
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus during the day and during the night. There is not much campus crime. The most common things are students getting wasted and doing things they shouldn't.
College Freshman,4,"If you don't plan on joining greek life or attending the school of music, I would seriously reconsider attending here. I think its around 70% of the student body that is involved in greek life, which is either the highest in the nation or very close to it. Greek life basically controls the social and party scene here. Parties are almost always at frats, as there aren't really any bars here. If you're in the school of music it's easier to not be in greek life as a substantial amount of music majors aren't greek. Non-greeks aren't necessarily viewed badly by greeks or vice-versa, but greek life is a huge part of the social scene. Every sorority and fraternity has a house on campus and many students live in them, especially sophomores. The greek housing is not opulent like southern schools, but it's not that bad either."
College Junior,4,"Except for the exception of certain parties, I overall feel rather safe on campus walking around. 

That is not to say that I feel the same in the town, which can be less accepting of diverse backgrounds sometimes"
College Freshman,4,"Most of the first-year dorms are pretty old, but they are well kept-up and updated. Vandalism is a huge issue in the first-year dorms because of students who think they're funny. Cleaning staff is remarkable, and works very hard. Overall great quality dorms."
College Freshman,4,For students walking alone at night there's a Safe Ride service that can take small groups of students back to their dorms. Campus is well light so I feel confident walking alone at night.
College Freshman,4,"I took a a course from the classics department. At first I only took it for the credit. It quickly became my favorite course, not because of the material Co eree, but because of how passionate the professor was. His passion has encouraged me to take another classics course."
College Freshman,4,"The dorm I have is old. It's got issues, but the location is the best out of the freshman dorms. It's next to the student center and in the center of all the academic buildings."
College Freshman,4,I've heard most of the non-Greek students say that they don't see a difference between the two groups. The Greeks tend to be with their housemates more but there's not a great separation between the groups.
College Freshman,4,It's a small campus and class sizes. This has made lectures more enjoyable. When I do go to office hours I leave feeling like my questions were wanted and sometimes I'll even find out about upcoming programs that I'm encouraged to join.
College Freshman,4,"The campus is very accepting of minorities, even though it's a dominantly Caucasian campus. The student president is a minority."
College Freshman,4,"The professors care about the students and their performance in the class. They are willing to work with students to help them improve. The classes are difficult, but definitely manageable. Work hard, play harder."
College Freshman,4,"The professors at DePauw really care about the students and want them to succeed. My first year seminar teacher gave us her number and said if we needed a ride, even at 3AM, to call her. They will also meet with students at ridiculous hours if need be."
College Freshman,4,The career center helps find jobs for students. The alumni network is also great.
College Freshman,4,"Since the campus isn't too big, all classes are within a 10 minute walk, which is great. The dorm rooms are pretty decent sized. The only thing bad about the housing is that if you live on the first floor you will most likely be separated by gender, making it difficult to interact with the opposite gender on the first floor."
College Senior,4,"Professors are wonderful and are great help. Class size is perfect, and everyone will help you when needed."
College Senior,4,"DePauw is committed to helping students succeed, and if you take advantage of the opportunities they present you will be successful."
College Freshman,4,"DePauw is great because it is essentially a small community. There are about 2,400 students so even though it's a small amount compared to public schools, it's still big enough that you meet and see new people everyday. DePauw is a very friendly place. The majority of people will smile and say hello to you, even if they don't know you, as you pass each other on the sidewalk. DePauw is a great academic school with an amazing student body."
Junior,2,"The teachers are amazing, but the whole administration can go to hell if you ask me. I am a disabled person both with movment and hearing. When it comes to hearing aid they actually try to help. But for movement it took them a year to install a handycaped button on a building. When it comes to housing they had the audacity to call a step a ""lesser step"" like that makes it any easier to lift my foot up and over. And some days i'm in a wheelchair so a step is a step. When it comes to the pandemic situation they made sure to wait to tell us we were not returning to campus till it was to late to request a semester off or transfer schools. Now they are changing our scholarships like we have more money because of the pandemic to pay for college. They straight out look for money from their students while saying ""we are a nonprofit"" despite not being on campus we still have a 60,000 dollar tuition. Administration doesn't answer your questions unless you tag the president in the email."
Freshman,2,"As a student within the School of Music, it was a very difficult transition to remote learning during the Covid-19 quarantine. By design, performing arts simply cannot be taught effectively through a screen."
Niche User,2,"A lot of racial issues, pressure in terms of academics and being involved in Greek life and partying"
College Freshman,2,The first year housing can vary a lot based on which residence hall you are put in.
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, the athletics at DePauw are not that important, so if you want a school that's into that, DePauw is not the place for you. However, people still attend the games, but it feels like a high school setting."
College Freshman,2,"Overall, I'm disappointed with my choice to attend this school, and am seriously thinking of transferring for sophomore year. I'm very surprised that I'm disappointed with my choice, I thought DePauw would exceed my expectations, but it didn't even meet them. Over 2/3 of the freshman class is either from Indiana (Indianapolis) or Illinois (Chicago) and I think 20% of the freshman are legacies, so a lot of people know each other here before coming to the school. I was surprised by this and thought that there would be more students from other states considering the prestige of a DePauw degree."
College Sophomore,2,There is little to choose from in this small town.  The school is trying to bring in some popular chains.
College Freshman,2,"The campus crime and everything is fine, public safety does their job well. However, the student health services is terrible and the doctor never diagnoses correctly. It's best to go to an at home doctor whenever possible."
College Freshman,2,"Sports aren't a big deal at all except for Monon weekend and the basketball teams. It's D3, so for the most part the people who care about sports are the people in them."
College Sophomore,2,"Mostly just fast food and chains, its not good for picky eaters."
College Sophomore,2,"Greencastle is fine , but unless you only eat fast food or shop exclusively at Walmart, you might be a little shell shocked."
College Sophomore,2,"I understand why some people want to join Greek life, but it's not for everyone. It's something major to consider when coming to DePauw. I also think rush is poorly conducted. You are judged based off of ten minutes of someone in the house talking to you about the most superficial, small-talk topics. I don't believe it's a solid way to get to know somebody for who they really are. Also, when people don't get into the house that they wanted, it leaves a huge impact on them and their self-esteem. People feel as though they weren't good enough or that something is wrong with them, and that sends a terrible message to freshmen. And while I understand the whole ""sisterhood"" concept, being in a house definitely changes people and makes them much more group-oriented and exclusive. I thought we were supposed to leave cliques back in high school?"
College Freshman,2,the school is predominantly white with a speck of other things
College Freshman,2,"summer is okay, but hotter than you'd expect. winters are awful; this past winter had a feel of -40 degrees. make sure you pack a lot of winter clothing"
College Freshman,2,there are not many times when people will get in trouble for alcohol.
College Freshman,2,We may be in one of the smallest towns in Indiana.
College Freshman,2,Indiana weather sucks. so I just have to cope with it.
College Sophomore,2,The wifi has been crap recently (in the past 2 years) but its always fixed relatively soon after the problem arises and when it works its fast.
College Sophomore,2,"All students are required to live in campus housing or at least no less than a mile from campus for their time at DePauw, so the pickings outside of Greek houses, dorms, and University apartments and duplexes is very very slim."
College Junior,2,"You don't really need a car on campus, however if you do have a car there is not a lot of places to park if you are going to drive to your classes."
Sophomore,1,"You can ask any student on this campus if he or she is happy. They will probably say ""no"". Depauw using the ""Depauw Experience"" as a selling point to get students to come here. ""My Depauw experience"" started of walking into my freshmen dorm that had mold on the window siles.The administration is constantly stepping infront of students in their ability to learn by restructuing and laying off Professors.Depauw is known for it Greek Life and was bulit on Greek Life. The students that are in Greek organizartions are constantly restricted in having social events, police harrasment and constant monitoring by Depauw administrators. Honeslty I would not have any of my friends or family friends come to Depauw."
College Freshman,1,"I'm a freshman and the dorm I'm currently living in is College Street, which used to be a fraternity house. All the rooms are double, but I'm pretty sure these rooms were used as singles for the fraternity members, as they are only about 11'11 ft. My dorm is not shown or talked about on campus tours, which I'm guessing is for the reasons I just listed. I visited 12 colleges and my dorm is by far the worst. Upon walking into my room for the first time there were cobwebs on the bunk beds, many different insects, and stains on the floor and ceiling (there was also a whole in the ceiling, which I have since got fixed). The bathrooms are not any better, the floor is cement the sinks don't have any type of counter, the faucets are covered in rust, and if you're over 5'6, you're going to have to bend down when taking a shower as the shower heads are quite low. The common rooms are horrendous. The furniture is dirty and stained, the paint is peeling off the walls, and there are missing tiles in the ceiling. The other dorms on campus are much better but still worse than most dorms."
College Sophomore,1,There are some nice people in the town but the town itself looks like a post drug war zone in some spots. There are also some groups in town that are not the most accepting to minorities.
Recent Alumnus,1,"We need more transportation services. We have one van, Safe Ride which runs at 9pm-2a. They do not always pick up the phone to arrange rides nor is there enough room. The driver is over worked"
College Senior,1,"Their hours are terrible for a student lifestyle; they don't even work the weekends. Appointments can be hard to come by and their lab results take forever to come back. They have frequently misdiagnosed some of my friends as well. I say you are better off driving to a MedCheck if you think it is more than a cold or the flu. Yeah you'll have to pay, but it's better than them telling you to come back in another four days to see if it gets worse."
College Senior,1,"Rain of Shine-We Learn – Regardless of weather conditions, DePauw NEVER cancell classes. Indiana is known for harsh winters and Greencastle is no exception to that. The weather does cause some problems, but it is a small campus so getting around is not impossible."
College Junior,1,"Good at First – They give good scholarships at first.  But then they raise tuition by thousands of dollars each year, leaving you unable to afford the school."
College Junior,1,"If I had it all to do over again, I would never have come here.  DePauw University was the worst decision of my life."
College Sophomore,1,"Greencastle Is Boring – There isn't much for students to do in Greencastle. If we want to have fun we usually go to frat houses, or and hour or so away."
College Sophomore,1,"The only thing that sets this school apart is how much money the majority of the students' parents make. The grading is highly complicated, and though most students are often frustrated, they will not speak up and say that the system may seem unfair."
College Sophomore,1,"Absolutely Nothing to Do – If you want entertainment the best shot you have is going to a party. There is one tiny movie theater in town, but it only shows two movies and a time, and the theaters are gross."
College Junior,1,"Greek Houses Get Blamed – The school cracks down really hard on Greek houses who serve alcohol to underage students at their parties. It seems like it makes sense, but it's impossible to check everyone's ID all the time (these are frat parties, not professional clubs) and people sneak in or lie and get alcohol, choose to drink excessively, and then blame the fraternities for giving it to them."

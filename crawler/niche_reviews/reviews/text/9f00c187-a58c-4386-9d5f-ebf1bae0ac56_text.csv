Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman, but I am pleased with my experience with UW Bothell so far. There are so many resources for students in difficult situations. The staff are friendly and dedicated to helping the students learn. I love my professors. There are a lot of activities and networks to be a part of. I am grateful for my opportunity to receive an education here. There is also a great focus placed on diversity and ensuring that students feel safe and welcome."
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman, but I am pleased with my experience with UW Bothell so far although it has all been online. There are so many resources for students in difficult situations. The staff are friendly and dedicated to helping the students learn. I love my professors. There are a lot of activities and networks to be a part of. I am grateful for my opportunity to receive an education here. There is also a great focus placed on diversity and ensuring that students feel safe and welcome. Professors and other staff are really trying to do their best with online classes."
Sophomore,5,I have been taking online classes and I love it. The teachers are understanding and are very lenient when you ask for help or an extension.
Sophomore,5,I love everything about this university. The campus is absolutely beautiful - especially at night time. All the staff and students are super sweet and helpful and always have smiles on their faces.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at the University of Washington-Bothell thus far has been excellent given the fact that there are plenty of resources available on campus that students can take advantage of. The classes are relatively small compared to the UW Seattle campus which is definitely a perk because it allows students to engage with professors and experience more hands on learning. This type of luxury is often not offered at the larger universities, so being able to have this opportunity is special to me because I have been able to perform very well academically because whenever I need a question asked, the professors/faculty members were always accessible to answers any questions or concerns that I may have."
Junior,5,"I love this school. I am in the Health studies major, and the advisors and staff are very helpful. The campus is kept up very nicely and there are many clubs and activities to participate in. Cost wise, it is on the more affordable end too."
Niche User,5,UWB is an extremely clean campus with super kind people. There is always someone there to lend you a hand if you are falling behind and it feels more like a family than any other school I have ever been to.
Junior,5,"This college is one for those students who appreciate smaller class sizes, frequent interaction with professors, and active learning up close. The academic opportunities are plentiful, the campus life is relaxed, accessible, and convenient for residents living nearby. All of my professors have been nothing but Lovely, and serious knowledgable people. The school sets students up for suceeding in academic and career life as the career center employees professionals dedicated to getting students on the right track."
Freshman,5,"It has been a month going to the University of Washington Bothell and I enjoy being here honestly. A lot of students are still prideful that they go to this school at the Bothell location. The main and original campus is in Seattle. So many people want to go there because it is a well-known nationwide. I was a little scared to tell other people that I attend the Bothell campus. Until I meet my orientation leader who super proud of being a Husky and that we are all one system fight for the same degree. Overall, I learn this. Find a school that truly speaks to you, small or big. It does not matter about the novelty, it is about the experience. 

One thing I would like to change how the club's times. Sometimes the clubs will interfere with my class times. It is not a big deal but I would like to spend time in the clubs I am interested in."
Freshman,5,I really like the social aspect there is a lot of diversity so I'm able to talk to people who have same or different beliefs than me. Their clubs allow you to get familiar in the small campus.
Freshman,5,"Very modern. Everyone here is so welcoming and its a small campus so its easy to navigate. It isn't as big as the Seattle campus so getting to classes won't be hard. It isn't very far from Seattle so its around the city. I live near here so getting to school will be a breeze. On top of that, lots of my friends go here too."
Freshman,5,"Very good so far, I haven't taken any classes yet, I just transferred to it but the advisers there helped me a lot. They answer phone quickly, answer all of your concerns immediately."
Sophomore,5,"It's been fantastic so far! As my first year draws to a close I learned a lot about the campus that really showed me the difference between High School and College. While I admittedly still have much to learn when it comes to everything the University of Washington Bothell I can rest easily knowing that I'm excited for what the future holds. Speaking of, the professors here are absolutely fantastic and incredibly astute in their studies, something that has definitely improved from my transition into College. Also, being a minority Iâ€™ve found my peers to be very accepting of me and to feel included wherever I am. Go Huskies!"
Senior,5,"University of Washington- Bothell is great because the classes are no more than 43 people making it a better learning experience, in addition to that it makes it easier to get to know other students because of all the group projects."
Junior,5,"I attended Cascadia and transferred to UW Bothell to finish my undergraduate degree in Biology and I am beyond blessed for this school. The campus is clean and the perfect size to be tight knit with your peers but not overwhelmingly large or small. I love their edible garden near the library, too. It is obvious this campus is dedicated to reducing their carbon footprint. If you're into sustainability like I am, you'll have appreciation for this.  I recently heard about this outdoor club, too. They plan affordable backpacking/white water rafting/etc trips. I have nothing negative to say about this institution. Thanks UWB!"
Junior,5,"AMAZING school! super small classes, which makes it easier to learn as a student because you have more time and more attention from the teachers. This school wasn't super big which was nice, so you could easily walk to class."
Sophomore,5,UW Bothell is a smaller community within the campuses UW offers. This allows students to create more meaningful interactions with their professors and peers. I also enjoyed how easy it is to find everything on campus.
Sophomore,5,"I am extremely grateful I chose to go attend the University of Washington Bothell campus. There are so many resources available to students that you won't feel lost as you would at bigger schools. One is class sizes only hold 30-60 students maximum in a classroom depending on the building. The tutoring center and the writing center are two great assets being offered for students like me. The library offers a great size as it holds quiet study areas, computer labs, study rooms, and even a wide selection of books! Additionally, there is a recreational center open to everyone to hang out, eat, and even finish homework on campus. The career and academic success center offer great advice for students to continue to work hard and strive for success. I think anyone would have a great experience at Bothell if they're looking for benefits like these."
Senior,5,"RN-BSN Program, 4 quarters long, seattle site very convenient for those who work full time as a nurse."
Junior,5,"The community is very welcoming, sociable, and motivated! I recently transferred here from a community college in Bellingham and love it so much more. There are lots of extra-curricular activity options and clubs to join depending on what your interests are. The campus is easy to navigate and classes easy to find on the first day."
Junior,5,Great Schoo. They support students and help students to exceed. Great opportunities available to students.
Junior,5,I originally intended on just staying at UWB for a year then transferring but I absolutely fell in love with the class structure as well as my environment that I plan to go all 4 years here. The smaller class sizes actually do make a difference.
Alum,5,"I loved coming here for the commute and excellent teachers, but it definitely is not super social and a lot of the students are in their mid 20's vs just starting school."
Senior,5,"Great learning environment. With smaller amount of students per classroom, it allows more one-on-one learning experience with your professor. Questions, answers, and feedback is more accessible compared to major universities and this has helped further my education."
Alum,5,"I'm glad I decided to pursue higher education here. I really didn't want to choose a huge campus, so I decided to go to UWB instead of the campus in Seattle, and I do not regret my decision. UWB has a very welcoming and inclusive atmosphere (one of the best, if not the most, perks of this campus), and I truly felt that the professors invested a lot in making sure students succeed and feel welcome. This campus has a lot of resources for students as well, such as the writing and communication center, career services center, and the quantitative skills center. 

I'm was in the Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences program and I really enjoyed what I've learned over the course of my education at UWB. My experience has consisted of a lot of writing papers, group work and projects, presentations, and group/class discussions. The professors I've had have been really knowledgeable and passionate about what they're teaching. 

Overall, I've had mostly good experiences here."
Alum,5,"This commuter school is perfect for the traditional and nontraditional student!  The professors were amazing, with the exception with one every here and there, but other than that, it was a great school.

You also get the prestige that comes with the name ""University of Washington"" at a smaller campus, since this is an extension of the main campus in Seattle."
Junior,5,"This is a great fit for you if you dream of going to the University of Washington, but do not want to be another student number on the Seattle campus."
Junior,5,It's a great school. Very conducive and the class sizes are very small compared to other Universities.
Alum,5,"Loved, Loved, Loved this school!! Amazing teachers, small classes, vibrant community and lots of opportunities to succeed. Rated the best college for the money in the state and I believe that to be absolutely true. I feel confident in my pre-med education because of the quality of the programs here."
College Freshman,5,"I love the UW campus, I suggest you to apply here!"
College Freshman,5,I feel secured inside a UW campus.
College Freshman,5,UW has one of the best athletic teams in Washington State.
College Freshman,5,The University of Washington Bothell is the same university but on a smaller campus. Also with smaller class sizes which means you can connect easily with your friends and professors.
College Junior,5,"UW Bothell is a very safe school.  If one does not feel safe walking to their car at night, they can call a security officer to walk them across campus or to their car.  There are many emergency telephones all over campus if there is an emergency that happens."
College Freshman,5,So many faces walk the halls of UWB. Its great!
College Freshman,5,The best part of UWB is its housing. Very clean!
College Sophomore,5,What is really great about the University of Washington Bothell is that they offer you the same university of Washington education but on a smaller campus. It is safer than the main campus and so much easier to make friends. The professors are really great. I would definitely apply here again!
College Sophomore,5,"I love how every one of my professors knows not only my name but they know stuff about me. I also love the small class sizes, it makes it easier to engage in class"
College Freshman,5,our campus is very safe
College Freshman,5,I drive to school and the parking is fairly cheap
College Sophomore,5,Never have I had an experience an encounter with drugs or alcohol being visible or being used by my peers.
College Freshman,5,Security is always there when needed and around
College Freshman,5,Offers a great variety of curriculum
College Junior,5,A lot of options to choose from
College Junior,5,Provides many opportunities to use knowledge outside of class. Provide internships and study abroad options.
College Junior,5,"Workload is reasonable. Professors are friendly, help students, and make sure they are interested in learning. Major provides study abroad opportunities, internships, and volunteer opportunities"
College Junior,5,Printing costs $ but not much. Many available computers and laptops that can taken home by students
College Junior,5,"Smaller campus next to a great town, never received an email from campus security saying something has happened (like robbery, theft, suspicious characters)"
College Junior,5,"All the benefits of a large school (technology, access to materials, etc.) but with small class sizes where teachers know who you are and what you want to do with your life. Great accounting program with many opportunities to get into a job or internship"
College Sophomore,5,The University of Washington Bothell has been an excellent school. It challenges me academically. There are lots of recourse on campus to get involved in and so much help with classes if needed. I feel like this school is a private school for a public school price. I would recommend anyone to come to this school.
College Junior,5,Without a doubt I would pick UWB again.  I plan on taking my Master's program here.
College Junior,5,The cost of parking in Seattle in general is insane.  I take the bus and its great!
College Junior,5,UW in general PREACHES diversity.  
College Junior,5,All of my current classes do not allow lap tops in class.
College Junior,5,The school is relativly new and is BEAUTIFUL!!!
College Junior,5,If you are vega/vegetarian this is an awesome place!! There are numerous restaurants for you in and around Seattle!!
College Junior,5,"Being in Bothell is best of both worlds.  You are close enough to Seattle that you can partake in everything it has to offer, but far enough away to feel a little safer.  It is also nice because the community in Seattle embraces its students."
College Junior,5,"From Bothell you can get to Seattle in 15-20 minutes driving, or a little longer if you have to take the bus. Seattle has so many fun spots to visit!!"
College Sophomore,5,"Crime isn't a problem here in our school. Campus security is always patrolling around the school. We also have emergency stations around the school in case something happens. Otherwise, I feel safe at all times."
College Sophomore,5,"We are beginning to upgrade UWB, from the new science and engineering buildings to having a renovated buildings, the facilities are much more better compared towards other schools."
Junior,4,The online experience has been very engaging. We use zoom and a few polls and apps that let students actively participate during lecture.
Sophomore,4,The classes is a good size to have leaning wise. I felt more connected with the professors. There are a variety of clubs and opportunities to get connected with and to help with what you need. Everyone is friendly and staff is great. I am glad I chose to go here.
Junior,4,"Most professors have adapted well to online learning, when challenges such as internet connectivity issues arise they are able to change whatever is necessary."
Junior,4,"I like the small classrooms at UWB, it creates a better chance to make study groups and get to know peers and professors."
Junior,4,"Pretty much your average online zoom lecture. As a computer science major, there are no in person labs or anything that requires any physical equipment except for your computer so the experience did not change much."
Sophomore,4,"As a whole the online thing was okay, the professors tried their best but as always with remote classes there is some discrepancies. It is difficult for the more advanced classes to learn the material remotely without having any in person talking but this can't be helped."
Sophomore,4,"Overall the experience is good, the faculty is nice and competent. The campus is not to big and not to small. The campus is clean and constantly being taken care of. The only downside is that they do not have a cafeteria to eat on campus."
Senior,4,"The small class sizes at UWB makes learning the material easy because professors can offer more help. UWB is considered a commuter school, so it is much more difficult to make friends than a typical university. However, there are many clubs  to join."
Freshman,4,"UW Bothell is an excellent college, it's located in a great spot with many resources available for students. The class sizes are great and allow you to really interact with other people."
Junior,4,"I like the small class sizes, being able to communicate with my fellow peers and professors on a personal level."
Freshman,4,"I like University of Washington Bothell campus a little bit better then Seattle campus. Main reason why is because the classes are much smaller. The college life isn't there though unfortunately but it is getting a lot better. Very good education and I enjoy being there, get a good group of friends and your set!"
Senior,4,"I came into the campus expecting it to be quite similar from where I transferred from (Bellevue College) since both campuses are quite small compared to other universities that are around the nation. UWB, though a smaller campus, is a lot more hands on. Class sizes are smaller so I am actually able to get help from my professors quickly if needed since they have available office hours during the week."
Senior,4,"I loved UWB. It definitely has a community college vibe. Lots of people who are working part time, commuters, parents along with the usual undergraduate crowd. Not the school for you if you like to party and be constantly making new friends, but great if you value small class sizes and relationships with professors."
Junior,4,"The University of Washington Bothell is a very inclusive and diverse university. I find myself being accepted here and the resources here are very helpful. The professors here care about their students and they are very flexible with one-on-one appointments. However, I do wish that there were more options for restaurants or wherever I can find food. Subway and the university cafeteria are personally not sufficient enough for me as a growing college student who needs energy to receive my education. I understand this is a smaller campus compared to the Seattle campus, but this is just one gripe concerning Bothell."
Senior,4,"Overall, I have had an excellent experience at UWB. My major is GWSS, and one of the things I appreciate the most about UWB is the passion and authenticity of the faculty in my major. I can tell how much they all genuinely value education, and I always have felt that faculty is invested in helping students to learn. As a marginalized person, I have usually felt safe and accepted in my classes by faculty--the norm is to embrace diversity and foster inclusivity in the classroom. Many of my instructors have even started the class with pronouns, and have taken extra care to respect diverse gender identities and Queer students. The quality of education itself has been excellent. One thing that I would like to see improve about UW Bothell is the resources present for disabled students. While a disability center exists, there is no social support for disabled students outside of the DRS, and it would be nice to see a club, group, or some other kind of socialization opportunity available."
Senior,4,"THis is a great university, It i really diverse. Most of the teacher care and are really knowledgeable. University of Washington bothell offers many degrees from Computer Science to Nursing. I recommend this university to anyone."
Freshman,4,"When I was touring college I toured 14 different campuses all over the country, but University of Washington Bothell was by far the most diverse and accepting campus of all of them. The community is small enough to feel like a family but large enough so you dont feel stuck. The dorms have an amazing view of the local Pacific Northwest Wetlands, and are well updated and fully furnished apartment style. The professors are engaging and well respected in their fields. There are limited food options on campus, but if you like Subway and Pho you'll love it here!"
Freshman,4,It is a very small yet diverse campus with a small town community setting. It is a very easily navigated campus and it is less stressful than the main UW campus
Freshman,4,"UW Bothell is exactly what I was looking for--it is a beautiful, small campus with friendly students and a reputable name."
Freshman,4,"At the University of Washington Bothell the thing I like the most is how the classes and campus is small. This makes it easier to talk to the professors, especially when they have office hours. The small campus makes it easier to go from class to class, even if they are in different buildings. I also like how it is very group work oriented. With groups it makes it easier to make connections with your classmates and get a bunch of different opinions and views on different subjects."
Niche User,4,"I like the classes since they are smaller and feels like the professors are more tailored to your learning. The location of the school also is great since it's not in a busy, city environment."
Alum,4,"My experience at University of Washington-Bothell during my undergraduate degree profoundly  impacted my decision to continue my education through the University of Washington as a graduate student. The University of Washington-Bothell's campus is very clean. The campus is much smaller compared to the Seattle's campus, making it easier and faster to get to classes. Each professor that I had made it their mission to ensure that every student was successful. One thing that the school could improve on is food options. During my ten hour long school days, it would have been nice to have more options on what to eat, although it was nice to have a subway and two food trucks to choose from."
Senior,4,"As a CS major, I've been at University of Washington Bothell for a while now, and so far it has proven to offer a wholly rigorous, time-intensive, and enriching experience. It is common to see students who either commute from other cities to campus, or live on campus to cut down on commute times. Of course I have had many tough experiences during my time (up until now) at UW Bothell, however that is a given. The professors in general provide a well-established curriculum and content so far has been presented with excellence, breadth and depth. I believe I'll graduate with valuable knowledge and experience that cannot be replicated or compared to anywhere else (except perhaps the other UW campus, but it's still UW)."
Junior,4,It is a safe enviroment. Everyone is friendly and the classes can be challenging but interesting at the same time.
Junior,4,"The college has plenty of academic resources, from tutoring in almost all subjects, flexible instructor office hours, and links to many more academic websites that help students succeed. The classes provide hands-on work that prepare students for their future careers. The professors are very knowledgeable about the subjects they teach. There are many financial aid and scholarship opportunities."
Sophomore,4,"In my first year here at UWB, I was very nervous coming into college. But I got quickly adjusted to the campus and college life. The students here are very chill I would say. We have a very small campus so it's really easy to get to know people. The professors here are excellent they actually care about you and help you learn if you don't understand. Since it is also a small campus there are smaller class sizes making it easier to connect with your professor. Student life on here is alright, the students themselves are trying to improve that every year and get more people involved. Not much partying go on since there is no Greek life. Could use more food options as well, on campus, there's only 2 cafes and a subway and some food trucks. Overrall, the school is great at teaching you and have people that care about you."
Junior,4,"I love the student to teacher ratio as well as the small campus. It is in a homely location near many small business mom-and-pop shops and I would consider it to be a safe area. The dorms are amazing (basically an apartment) but because of UWB's growth, prices have increased and the housing accommodations are becoming overcrowded. There is also not a lot of diverse classes to choose from compared to the main campus on Seattle."
Senior,4,I love the intimate atmosphere achieved by smaller class sizes from Freshman through Senior year. The campus is newer and classrooms are clean and up to date. Parking can get really crazy during peak hours though.
Sophomore,4,"The size of this college does not make it similar to its larger sister campus. Small class sizes and drastically smaller campus size will make it feel like high school. If you aren't a fan of that then this campus might not be for you. But overall the professors are great and in the end, you still get the same diploma that the main campus gets. No mention of what campus you attended."
Sophomore,4,I love the small classes here compare to University of Washington Seattle campus. The education in my option are a lot easier and professors are willing to help in every way possible when it comes to your education. They really do try their best to answer emails as quickly as possible and will even having meetings with you to talk about any further information you might need.
Graduate Student,4,Generally love the experience in Bothell. Only problems are the forced classes needed for graduation. The professors generally care about their students and are willing to help outside of the class.
Freshman,4,"Graduating from a small rural high school, I was looking for a smaller four year university. UW Bothell offers smaller class room sizes that I felt comfortable in, and classroom sizes that make it easy to participate in, just like back home. I've only rated it ""very good"" because this is my first year taking classes at any college so I have little to compare it to. The professors all have high expectations of achievement for each student, but they're always willing to give an extra hand and eager to build a connection with their students. There's lot of support academically."
Freshman,4,"As a first year student at the University of Washington Bothell, I find that the campus life is very well suiting, accommodating, and relevant to students who would like a more academically intimate and personal education. These traits are prevalent with the resource rich campus and personable staff and faculty."
Junior,4,"I have been at the University of Washington Bothell for my junior year of college and it is a lovely school. The campus is small and personable and is great for others that learn well in small class sizes. The academic level is high and there are many resources to get help, such as the QSC (Quantitative Skills Center), professor office hours, and designated peer study group areas. In addition UWB has plenty of opportunities to get involved in student campus life. Events are held daily and with over 70 clubs to choose from there is something for you. The experience at this university is like no other and I would recommend the University of Washington Bothell to any student looking for a highly ranked small institution."
Junior,4,My experience over all is great. I love that it's such a small community. I walk to class and I literally know half the people I pass by. Not only that but it is easy to make study groups with people and make friends in class because everyone is so welcoming and friendly. I love the classes and the class sizes also it's so great. The only reason I give it a 4 star is because they have poor food options and do not have a wide variety of classes to choose from. But that's okay since they are still a developing school.
Freshman,4,"I like how the classes are small and how the campus is easy to get around to, so I do not get lost easily. I wish there was more access to get food around campus."
College Junior,4,I have not felt safer on any other campus that I have visited.
College Junior,4,"I like that the class sizes are not too big, and that the campus is very quiet. Even though it's near the freeway, the trees and marsh life drown out the sound of cars and is very calming."
College Senior,4,"Never had any problems unlike the Seattle campus. Ladies, carry pepper spray at the Seattle campus."
College Senior,4,"I'm just doing my time, it's not bland for sure."
College Freshman,4,U of Wash is recognized as a top school and a diploma carries a lot clout. I find that most students get jobs and are look at in a very good way. Highly professional and well respected
College Freshman,4,"So far my freshman year has been very good, I find everything is easy to locate and everyone helps with any problems I may have. The admissions office goes beyond and helps any way they can. The academics office is very helpful and have kept me on course to finish my major in computer science."
College Junior,4,"The campus is small but that makes it easy to talk to your professors one on one. Parking is a little difficult to find so you have to get here early but the overall safety of the campus is unrivaled. The people here are friendly, diverse, and eager to help. The classes are small but fun and interesting. Class variety is a little limited but the campus is constantly expanding so that may change in the future. And, because the campus is small and new, all of the facilities are top notch and very clean."
College Junior,4,Working on campus has helped with networking
College Junior,4,Working on campus has definitely made it better
College Junior,4,I work on campus also and its definitely made my college experience worthwhile since I create on campus events
College Freshman,4,I believe that there is a lot of support for students after graduation and in school.
College Freshman,4,I have loved all of my classes and am extremely happy with my academic program and advising.
College Freshman,4,"I have really enjoyed being accepted into a specific program as a freshman. I have no problem registering for classes and have excellent support from the staff and advisors. The professors are helpful and care about my learning and incorporate things into lessons regarding my major. However, I decided to move onto campus and which has been a a poor experience since the very beginning."
College Junior,4,"I like UW Bothell, but I do wish that they offered more degrees.  I am happy with the degree that I chose, but before I declared my major, I was struggling with what I wanted to declare.  I love that UW Bothell has small class sizes, it is very beneficial to be on a first name basis with professors and able to ask for help when needed.  It is a very diverse school which brings in new perspectives to the classroom.  My favorite part of UW Bothell is the variety of extremely interesting classes that they offer.  Those interesting classes keep people engaged and wanting to learn.  If I had to do this all over again, I would choose UW Bothell again.  There are many great aspects of this school, even though there are some small critiques that I have.  With that being said, there is no perfect school, but UW Bothell has been a perfect fit for me."
College Freshman,4,Registration is difficult but prof are friendly.
College Freshman,4,Class sizes are helpful because you know the prof.
College Freshman,4,Bothell is very progressive. I feel blessed to go.
College Freshman,4,"Registration is first come first serve, the smaller campus makes it a little less competitive. There is an a text message/email process to notify  people of open classes"
College Freshman,4,Class sizes are small and professors take time to get to know students
College Freshman,4,Its a small campus but has a wide range of majors to choose from
College Freshman,4,there are new fields and equipment for all students
College Junior,4,Very diverse. Small class sizes which mean you can connect with your professors.
College Freshman,4,I feel very welcome at the University of Washington Bothell campus. The classes are the perfect size for me and I feel included and engaged in all class discussions and seminars. The professors and faculty are extremely helpful and most are easy to approach. I wouldn't want to go to any other school!
College Freshman,4,"Compared to most universities, I strongly agree that this this is the best college to go to. It is close to my home, which makes it much easier for me to stay connected with my community and activities. The cost is much cheaper than other colleges, especially with me living with my parents. My major is hard to get into, but this college offers one of the best with a high acceptance rate."
Freshman,2,"I am sorely disappointed in the way UW Bothell dealt with online learning.  One of my teachers didn't even start teaching until half way through the quarter, while the other one had only graded one assignment by the eighth week."
College Junior,2,"You see a lot of school spirit but mostly sports are focused on main campus rather than this campus. I do see some sports events occasionally but, except for a gym, I've never seen anything really sports related. We do have a soccer field and some tennis courts but that's about it. I'm not a sports person so I may have missed some things, but that is pretty much my participation in sports events."
College Freshman,2,"I think general campus safety is good, however, I didn't feel safe with my roommates and I didn't feel as though the staff stepped up to do things to ensure my safety and belittled my feelings of discomfort."
College Senior,2,Campus housing at UW Bothell feels like apartments
College Freshman,2,No one really has time for athletics. Just studying!
College Junior,2,"No parties, however there are a few late night dances"
College Junior,2,There needs to be a center for Diversity on campus.
College Junior,2,There is not much good dining near campus.
College Junior,2,I only received loans that only covered part of my tuition even when there are two people enrolled in the University.
College Sophomore,2,I don't want to be greek. I prefer myself.
College Sophomore,2,Where did all the good things go?
College Sophomore,2,I didn't enjoy it at all.
College Freshman,2,I don't really find relationships at school
College Sophomore,2,I know there is student involvement but not as much as some would think.
College Junior,2,My  school is very isolated from most transportation such as the airport. It is however located next to a bus route that will take you into the nearest town from which you can find more transport.
College Junior,2,There is no nightlife at my school at all. We all live off campus and do our own thing. Every once in awhile the school holds a movie night or dinner event but that is it.
College Junior,2,There is almost no involvement in any sports on campus. We do not have school sports team as I am at a smaller campus that is part of a larger main campus but we have a few intramural sports teams that are not very popular on campus. We also do not have a gym I believe but do have many trails and such for outdoor activity. They are in the process of building a student recreational center as well for campus but that will not be down for a few years.
College Junior,2,Bothell campus isn't located to too many nightlife spots because of location. 
College Senior,2,"The bus is easy to access. if you drive however, parking is very difficult to find."
College Senior,2,"The school does not allow us to do the internship again, I would if I could because it was valuable for me to be in a classroom learning hands on. "
Freshman,1,"Completed 2 quarters so far and absolutely regret going to UWB. First if you are anything but complete liberal you are done in this college professors will hate you, students will hate you. people and staff constantly shut people down if they have a different political opinion. College is supposed to be a place where you can open your mind and listen to other people opinion and points of view but here if you dont agree you are done. Every day I have to put on a facade so my grades dont go down. There is a lack of food options on campus there are 2 cafes 1 subway and a couple of food trucks with low options. If you are a HS graduate and you don't have 45+ college credits do not attend this college get the 45+ credits from a community college so you can skip the discovery core classes which teach you false and misleading information with a brainwashing political agenda. Remember there is no point of having diversity of race when there is no diversity of ideas"
College Junior,1,I don't think we have a Greek Life on this campus... I could have missed seeing them though...
College Freshman,1,"I would advise everyone admitted to avoid living on campus. There were health related facilities problems in the first apartment I was placed into and had to move in the middle of the quarter for repairs. The second room I was placed in wasn't a good fit, none of the people were compatible with my roommate and myself and the staff hasn't done anything sufficient to make it a better situation. They won't let you out of the contract regardless of the situation. I was really excited about living in campus, and based on my experience alone, I would suggest looking at different living situations. This is really disappointing, and the proximity to campus cannot be beat, but consider this decision carefully! I wouldn't change my decision to go to UW Bothell, and this experience in no way detracts from my happiness with my program in classes, but I do not suggest living on campus."
College Junior,1,There is no Greek life and UW Bothell.  I can only compare what I personally think of greek life at the UW Seattle campus.
College Freshman,1,Haven't been involved in nightlife to know.
College Senior,1,"If I could do it all over again, there is absolutely no way that I would choose the University of Washington - Bothell. Before coming here, I was told of how convenient it was to get to the main campus and surrounding areas of Bothell, it is not a commuter campus because there is on-campus housing that has an excellent community, etc. I am currently confused at why they ever even said the things that they did. It is strictly a commuter campus as even most of the students who live on campus go home almost every weekend and the majority of students come for classes then go home afterwards so there is no sense of community whatsoever. It has been beyond difficult to go north of Bothell as the buses do not have decent routes anywhere north. As for getting to Seattle, that is also a pain in the butt. I was told that there was tons of stuff that I could do at UW-Seattle campus but I have found nothing but ran into difficulties. I also had no idea how far left many of the people here are and I am beyond sick of people shoving their beliefs about politics down my throat and not being accepting that I believe otherwise whatsoever (that may just be my experience because I worked on campus and many of the strong-willed people work on campus as well). Plus, there is no food on campus except for two cafes which I have only bought coffee there about 5 times, two of which they burned my coffee. I bought a salad once; it was rotten. There is also a Subway that most students get beyond sick of because that's basically the only choice for food. Other than that, good luck finding anything without having to do a 30+ minute trek into town. There are no sports, just a few intramural teams that play soccer at night. There aren't many activities either. They occasionally have events like ""Pokemon battle"" and small things that don't strike interest in everyone.... which is really funny with how much of an ""inclusive"" campus they try to be. I have so much more to say."
College Junior,1,"Because the University of Washington Bothell is a commuter campus, parties dont really happen. If you want to attend a party you would have to go to the University of Washington Seattle. Parties do not have a positive impact on students experience becasue they take away from the actual reason to why you are in school that is to learn."
College Junior,1,We need to improve that
College Freshman,1,"Bad food, expensive, and no discounts"
College Freshman,1,I don't even think we have any
College Freshman,1,We don't have greek life
College Sophomore,1,There is no nightlife at this school.
College Junior,1,We do not have a greek life at this campus.
College Freshman,1,"UW Bothell does not have Greek life. However, I am in a fraternity at the Seattle campus and so are plenty of other Bothell students. We live on the Seattle campus, in our respective fraternity houses and commute. "
College Senior,1,very terrible. Bothell is not a hot bar scene. 
College Senior,1,"There is no variety. The campus has begun bringing in food trucks which is helping the problem. Food costs seem high, no discount in comparison to off campus. "
College Sophomore,1,"Restaurants in Bothell can be described as dull and barren. I've only encountered a cafe and a small pizza joint close to walking distance away from school. Give it time while Bothell downtown is renovating, until then I give it a D."
College Sophomore,1,"At the moment, City of a Bothell is still renovating and reconstructing to become more prominent on the map. For now, it's very boring, not that many places to eat unless you travel farther from Bothell, better to stay in the dorms and hang out there."
College Senior,1,"Its really bad.  The cost for a parking pass is already expensive, and its really hard to find a spot, I have to come extra early to find a spot."
College Junior,1,"Nothing Close â€“ Seriously, this campus isn't walking distance from anything at all.  It's pretty isolated."

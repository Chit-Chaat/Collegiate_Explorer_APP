Alum,5,I found Greensboro College accidentally and do not regret it. Like most small private schools you are not a number but GC really hones in on the relationship you build with your professors. I was able to navigate my college career because I had people who actually cared about where I wanted to go. The faculty and staff were able to show me a path to walk but allow me as the student to walk it. Greensboro College allowed me to me while preparing me for life after college.
Alum,5,Greensboro College set me up to succeed. I loved my time there and my best friends to this day are the ones I met at GC.
Sophomore,5,"Greensboro College is honestly the perfect school for me. Coming all the way from California, this school makes me feel home away from home. The staff and Faculty all are so amazing and only want you to succeed after graduating here at Greensboro College. Being a Student- Athlete at this school I am not overstressed because the faculty understands the life of every athlete and wants us to succeed not only on the field but also in the classroom. Two things I love most about Greensboro College is the student to teacher ratio. since class sizes are small you get the chance to actually know who your teacher is as well as for them to get to know you. You will not be just a number at this school. the second thing I love about this school is the Pride/Support students show for one another. Whether that be in sports, classroom, or even on stage for our theatre program, everyone shows long as we are one unit. I couldn't imagine myself going to any other school."
Works Here,5,"I Graduated from Greensboro College in 2017 and now currently work for my Alma Mater! My time as a student was great. I played a sport all 4 years, studied music and was a part of a bunch of different clubs/activities on campus. However, I wasn't incredibly motivated at times and fell into a bit of a repetitive pattern, which made some days on campus very boring.  This really showcased the amazing location to the downtown area, which in my opinion is, unrivaled at any other school. I would not recommend this school to everyone, but If I had the choice to do it all over again, I would!"
Senior,5,"I love my school! It is very easy to get involved in multiple activities and to develop leadership skills on and off campus. The small campus curates a community feel, and the personal relationships you build with the professors and staff members are unique and meaningful. The location near downtown Greensboro allows for diverse and convenient internship and part-time job opportunities, but the individual attention you get in the classroom is the most special part of GC, and it is not found in most colleges."
Junior,5,"Ever since I applied to Greensboro College, I have felt that I was part of a small, tight-knit family. Everyone is super friendly, from dining hall staff, to admin, to teachers. Classes are stimulating and challenging and I always say I wouldn't be happier anywhere else. There are plenty of ways to get involved on campus, from sports to clubs; you get out of your experience what you put into it. I love Greensboro College!"
Alum,5,"Feel confident in knowing you will find your home here at Greensboro College. Friends that will last a lifetime and an education that will help you achieve any goal you put your mind to. Faculty and staff put their heart and soul into creating an atmosphere of inclusion, going above and beyond to ensure you succeed. Greensboro College is not just a place of learning, but a place of self discovery."
Sophomore,5,It is a very close community where everyone knows everyone else. It is a beautiful campus with something for everyone. The classes are small and they will prepare you for your future. You'll find everything that you need here! Greensboro College is very much a family and we'd love for more to come join us!
Sophomore,5,I am a current student here at Greensboro college. I love it here from the president to the students it is the best atmosphere. Yes we are small but we have a lot of big opportunities. Everyone here wants to help you be the best you can be. They challenge you to shoot for the stars and they instill hard work in you. You are capable of exceeding your dreams here at Greensboro college. This was the best decision I have ever made.
Senior,5,I like the instructors and diversity of the school. We have several great opportunities for students and support when it comes to finding jobs. They also try to place Almuni in jobs at the college if they cannot find jobs elsewhere after graduating.
Niche User,5,During my visit at Greensboro College the staff and Students panels was very helpful in explaining the format of the college. I like the fact the college was supportive. Through out my visit what kept being mention is the staff  constantly keep you on track and will know you by name unlike other schools.
Sophomore,5,Being at the college has allowed me to grow a lot personally. I enjoy being at the college and do the best I can when it comes to academics.
Niche User,5,"I have only been there on a college visit but while I was there the college staff treated me and my mom very well. I was there on a visit with for  the lacrosse team and i got time with the coach and time with the team. I got to watch a lacrosse game. We were fed, the coaches were awesome. The tour of the college was amazing I loved the campus, it was small, not allot of walking, the dorms were big the cafeteria had great food. I would be ecstatic to go to Greensboro College"
Alum,5,"I graduated recently from Greensboro College and I loved every minute of my time there.  Faculty were amazing and the student body outstanding.  Within only a few years after leaving I started my own business which has now 'taken-off' and it's all due to my education both in and out of the classroom at Greensboro College.  Small, yes...but mighty enough to make me an entrepreneur indeed so !  Thanks Greensboro College !!"
Freshman,5,"Greensboro college is a very diverse college with great instructors, accepting people, and an amazing campus life with countless opportunities."
Senior,5,"Greensboro College is an great school to go to if you like small classes. I choose to go to this school to play basketball, but I also liked the classroom sizes so I can sometimes have one-on-one relations with my professors if needed. It's also located a few minutes before downtown Greensboro, and it's in between UNCG and NC&T so some kind of entertainment is always going on. "
Niche User,5,I am in love with Greensboro and can not wait to attend there in the fall. I love the nice people and surrounding city. Great atmosphere. 
College Senior,5,Security guards are constantly walking around day and night.
College Senior,5,Many of the staff work here and graduated from here. The alumni network is strong. Teachers prepare students for potential careers.
College Senior,5,Small school means small classes and a lot of one on one help and very responsive to e-mails.
College Freshman,5,"Our campus security is amazing at what they do. Someone stole my laptop a the beginning of the year, and they did everything they could to find it, and they did. They are always on campus, and they engage with the students."
College Freshman,5,"With my major, normally everyone gets an internships, which is great. Dealing with sports recruiting, our soccer coach is a great recruiter. He has almost 20 girls coming in next year."
College Freshman,5,"I love living on campus. There isn't much to do, but the people make it fun."
College Freshman,5,"Greensboro College allows to play two collegiate sports. I play soccer and lacrosse. For every athletic event, an enormous amount of students are out supporting our fellow athletes."
College Junior,5,They did a great job!
College Student,5,It was the best thing i have ever done and i think i made the right choice
College Freshman,5,i don't live off campus yet but it will allow more freedom. and force better responsibility.
College Freshman,5,"the parties are what you make them, overall they are very fun"
College Freshman,5,off campus dining is a hundred times better than the food in the caf
College Sophomore,5,All the staff at the school is very helpful and since it is a fairly small college they start to recognize you and really want to help you. There are no special requirements to get into the political science program but it is the same for the whole school.
College Sophomore,5,Greensboro has a TON of places to eat.
College Senior,5,The relationship at school is the best. I say this because people have their own style and no one judges their appearance.
College Sophomore,5,There are five different other universities which is great and there are many things to do because it is minutes away from down town.
College Sophomore,5,It is excellent that's all I can say they make the worst process ever to the best process and the easiest
College Sophomore,5,They are very diverse and very open to everything
College Sophomore,5,The buildings are close so the weather doesn't affect at all.
College Sophomore,5,That they are willing to open up other opportunities with other schools to get a program they don't have which is nursing. It's new but seems to be a great program
College Sophomore,5,I honestly didn't have a problem the advising office was very helpful and I didn't face any problems. They made this process very helpful.
College Sophomore,5,They are always around you never have to actually go out and look for them.
College Sophomore,5,The off campus housing is very nice around this campus
Sophomore,4,Decent facilities. Very diverse student and faculty base. Tightly knit community with many clubs and activities to help student involvement.
Niche User,4,"What l like about this college is the classes are small and it helps me whenever I ask the professor for help and I can keep up with my work and it helps me stay focus.  The campus is small and I live in dorms that they are closer to one of my classes.  It helps me to classes on time, or other activities.  Another reason why on campus is small is meeting a lot of people and become friends with them and I’ll get to know them more.  When I walk around campus, I see the same people I know."
Junior,4,"I enjoy the people at Greensboro College.  The facilities are the main problem at Greensboro College.  The dorms and food options could use improvement.  The area that Greensboro College is in is the perfect place for a college, and even though the school is not as large as many others, the experience you get at Greensboro College is unlike any other.  The relationships that students make with other students and professors is unlike any others at bigger schools."
Niche User,4,I felt very welcome and at home. I felt I've been going there for years. The food is always good but it doesn't really have much of a variety.
Senior,4,"Leading up to my senior years, it has gone by really fast and I can not believe that I am almost finished. I am glad that I picked Greensboro college because it ended up being the best thing for me."
Freshman,4,I am a first year student here at Greensboro College and so far I have nothing but positive things to tell you. The professors and adults who work here truly dedicate themselves to helping each individual student. Other than all of the help I have received the students and student life is great here on campus!
Freshman,4,Greensboro College is a small campus where the students know pretty much everybody. I like how the class room sizes are very small and students get one on one with their professors. The campus is beautiful and their security is fantastic! The only thing I see that I would want changed are the locations of the athletic fields.
Freshman,4,"I overall like attending Greensboro College.  It's a small campus with a close staff/student body.  Greensboro College has made my transition from home to college easy with it's small, family atmosphere.  "
College Freshman,4,everyone is open and happy
College Senior,4,I am an adult student so I do not participate in sporting events.
College Freshman,4,"The professors make a point to help and work with you if you need the help. They are experts on their job, and they engage students into their teaching."
College Freshman,4,"Greensboro College is amazing academically and athletically. The teachers are wonderful, and they do everything in their power to help students' succeed."
College Sophomore,4,"The student involvement at school is high. Everyone is involved in something on campus. The school spirit and fan support are high as well. Everyone supports all the teams no matter where you belong in school. We have something called a ""Pride Packs The Place"" where every team has a big game or event and the whole school (or teams) have to attend their games to cheer them on and support them. It's a great way to get students involved in other sports and there are always prizes and small games to win during the games. Our facilities are not the best in the state, but they are adequate. They are there for us to use and if there is a problem, there is always someone to talk to about changing or fixing it."
College Sophomore,4,"My favorite experience at my college would be joining the Women's Swim team and meeting most of my closest friends to this day. The swim team is very unique and fun to be around, not saying that any other team isn't fun. Since i grew up swimming, the friends i have made on the teams i have joined have been some of my best friends growing up. Something that makes my school unique is that it's small and perfect. Everything you need to access is right around the corner. The dorms and classrooms are within feet of each other and it comes in handy when you're running late to class. Another thing that is unique is that because the campus is small, the class sizes are small as well. When you need to meet with a professor or have time after class, you can go up and talk to them and meet them outside the classroom for lunch. The professors here are great and I wouldn't change a thing about my school. I would chose this school again because I met people who have impacted and changed my life here and I wouldn't trade that for anything different."
College Junior,4,I think they are pretty good
College Sophomore,4,My college experience has been great. i have learned a lot both semesters had fun and meet awesome people
College Sophomore,4,"There are many restaurants and fast food places nearby the college. Many surrounding places deliver right to the college, but usually the only place that delivers very late is Jimmy John's."
College Sophomore,4,"Each student is responsible for his or her behavior and class attendance at Greensboro College. The college is tobacco-free, but not a dry campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Although many complain about the old historic buildings of Greensboro College, the school has some of the largest dorms out of many North Carolina colleges and universities. Every room has an actual window and each person has their own bed, desk, desk chair, and closet space. The beds aren't the most comfortable out there, but the overall dorm atmosphere is very comfortable."
College Sophomore,4,They are generous and helpful.
College Senior,4,"The nightlife is very fun, because everything is so convenient and easy to get to."
College Sophomore,4,The school in General is great. The help concerning financial aid and everything is excellent as well they are willing to help you find any way to pay for school.
College Sophomore,4,I personally believe they have enough computers and printing is free which in my eyes is very important
College Junior,4,its really great and the night life is always available for anyone of any age and we have a baseball stadium
College Junior,4,the facilities are nice and accommodating for athletes and no athletes
College Sophomore,4,It only takes a couple minutes to get to downtown Greensboro and the city is nice
College Sophomore,4,There is a lot of availability and the free printing on campus is great. The wifi is usually pretty good and tech support is always on top of any issues.
College Sophomore,4,"I love GC. I love the small class sizes and the short walks to class from my dorm. Sure it's a little old and run down, but what do you expect from a 175 year old institution? "
College Sophomore,4,Nobody really gets raciest here. We all try and get a long with everybody.  
College Sophomore,4,"My major is criminal justice. So far I've had one really hard professor that will fail you without caring. It's all on you to study hard, but she does give you  everything you need to know. I've had a somewhat of a hippie professor as well, very attached to his guitar, and goes off topic a lot. And then I've had this great professor that will make us laugh all the time with her stories, but overall, all the professors know their stuff and can teach. Every student must have an internship before they graduate, I'm working on that now. "
College Sophomore,4,"All the professors know what they are talking about. Most will work with you if you miss a class, or don't understand. All you have to do is ask. "
College Sophomore,4,"I've only been out to Greene Street and heard of The Boro. Greene Street usually has a cover, but it's not that hard to get in V.I.P. The Boro is for 21+ and usually has a good beer price. There is no cover."
College Sophomore,4,"Parking is close to the dorms and classes. Spots behind Hill and Greensboro building fill up pretty fast though. And watch out, don't park where you shouldn't because you will get a ticket."
College Sophomore,4,"Since the campus is so small, being able to get to nearly any class within 5 minutes of your dorm is great! Definitely helps when there is bat weather. "
College Freshman,4,"Its a tiny school, so there are only 3 dorms to choose from.. but all the buildings are within a 5 minute walk of each other so its easy to get to everything from the dorms"
College Freshman,4,"We have a wet campus, so it pretty noticeable for drinking"
College Freshman,4,"Dont personally live off campus, but the friends i have that do love it and it is easy to find"
College Junior,4,I think my program is great because it has different pathways you can go to getting your degree. The workload is not that easy but it is well worth it. Our facilities are limited when it comes to outside the classroom for hands on but outside of the college are many opportunities for internships. The only problem is the transportation that the college lacks; you have to find your own if you go anywhere off- campus.
College Senior,4,"One of the great things about GC is that we have exchange students from all around the world. It creates an environment to learn about different cultures. GC also had at one point a group dedicated to creating a bridge between people with different sexual orientations known as GSA (Gay Straight Alliance). With GC being tied to the Methodist Church, there are several different relgious groups on campus that allow fellowship in different ways."
College Sophomore,4,The variety of food is great and the food is delicious. The only thing they need to work on is to fix the ice cream machine they have.
College Senior,4,The school constantly sent me updates on upcoming scholarship deadlines. Would have not been able to afford school if it wasn't for these opportunities.
College Sophomore,4,"The school is located right in the heart of downtown Greensboro as well as within a few miles of about 5 other colleges so the area has many great options when it comes to dining out. There are a few quicker options within walking distance and anything else you are looking for is within about a 5 to 10 minute drive. These places are very reasonable when it comes to pricing compared to portioning, therefore they are perfect for college students."
College Sophomore,4,Greensboro is a city with enough to do without having to deal with all the traffic of a huge city.
College Freshman,4,You meet all sorts of people from nationality and there is a lot people from different states.
College Freshman,4,Parking is easy in Greensboro College because you'll always find a spot. It is separated for commuters and residents so it is very organized.
College Junior,4,Variety is for sure.  There are people from all walks of life and form all over the country!
College Junior,4,It's a great part of the country where you have 4 seasons but no extreme weather either way.
College Sophomore,4,In the education program student teaching is required. So that is my internship. There is no pay when student teaching however you act as another teacher in the classroom. It's the last step in becoming a teacher at Greensboro College you cannot take another class when student teaching. It is that intense.
College Sophomore,4,I am a History with licensure major it is so that I can become a teacher after I graduate. The professors here work around the fact that I'm a basketball player here (Which is a two semester sport) and help get me plugged into the classes that I need. I've enjoyed all the classes that I've taken so far. The school allows me to add on minors that coincide with history so that I will be more marketable as a teacher. Then having collegiate athletic experience also helps market me as a coach. That is my dream to teach and coach. GC is allowing me to do that.
College Sophomore,4,"I commute from about 30 miles away from Greensboro, but I am very familiar with the area from growing up the next town over.  Greensboro is the most vibrant area for about 100 miles of where I live."
College Sophomore,4,"There are three main off campus places to live that are close to campus. You can go a little farther and find others, but The Province, Campus Crossing and Wafco Apartments are the closest. Wafco has the best prices that I have seen, and the Province is the nicest. Its a decent selection and is definitely worth moving off campus to."
College Sophomore,4,I thought it was very easy to get into the Bioligy program at Greensboro College. Getting into the Honors Program was more intense and required essays and things like that but the Biology program onl required that I declare my major and take the classes.
College Freshman,4,More than anyother school I've been to Greensboro is by far the most friendly.
College Freshman,4,Does not really affect anything. Weather is mostly great!
College Sophomore,4,Guys Are Okay – The guys at Greensboro College are very friendly and athletic. The mostly wear their jerseys.
College Junior,4,They Know Faces – The security guards are very familiar with many of the faces on campus due to the location of the office and the amount of time they spend patrolling the campus. They do question people that aren't familiar and they work together to ensure a safe environment.
College Sophomore,4,Nice Off Campus Living – the apartments and the houses are very nice in comparison to the dorms
College Junior,4,Great Food! There are many places within a 10-15 mile radius that are not extremely expensive and have a very good atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,Money Does Grow on Trees – I have gotten more financial aid then I had thought and the process has been smooth.
College Freshman,4,Real World Here I Come – Some of the toughest classes I've ever had come from my school and it has helped me develop.
Freshman,2,I think this college will be good for someone who grew up in the area and would like to settle their for the rest of their lives. I don’t think this school gives you many opportunities that a larger public school would give you.
Freshman,2,The teachers were not prepared to teach online and once the classes got moved to online the “teaching” and learning was almost non existent.
Freshman,2,"My experience with Greensboro College was awkward,  being bi racial, the school does not have enough diversity or cultural awareness programs.  I felt lonely and I felt the school did not offer support in these areas"
College Freshman,2,dont think they have ebough support
College Freshman,2,"I have not attended any athletic events and to my knowledge not many people do. There is some school spirit, but a lot of the athletes here are not gracious when they lose. I use the recreation center frequently and it has convenient hours of operation, but I find it to be sub par. The gym is small and a lot of the work out equipment is broken. There is a lap pool but I have not used it because it is open to the students for a very short period of time and then it is used for children's swimming lessons. The recreation center is not on campus either. You have to walk two or three blocks to get to it."
College Freshman,2,"I am a part of the theater program at my school, and I love it! The professors have all worked professionally and they really care about their students. However, if I could do it all over again I would not apply here. There are very few things to do on campus and because the school is so small there are a lot of social clicks. The staff is fairly friendly, but that cannot make up for the food and living conditions. Other than the wonderful arts departments I have not been satisfied thus far."
College Freshman,2,"half the time it does not look ediable, caf repeats its self multiple times a week."
College Sophomore,2,"It is really convenient to live on campus since it is so small and you are close to everything. The dorms are however old and in need of renovation. Most people living on campus keep to themselves socializing in their rooms, rather than in common areas so the interaction with other residents is limited. I do think, however, that it is overpriced and the rules for living on campus are stupid. All students that are under 21 need to stay on campus which force most students to live on campus their whole college time."
College Sophomore,2,Less and less majors each year.
College Sophomore,2,"Greensboro, the all girls dorm, is by far the most clean. Both Hill and West are pretty gross. It seems like in the hot weather seasons the air only comes out hot and in the cold weather seasons the air comes out cold. The rooms are very spacious compared to other colleges though."
College Student,2,"start school in the spring 2014
"
College Senior,2,Alpha Xi Delta is the only sorority on campus aside from academic fraternities. They are not well represented and do not have a voice compared to another sorority at a bigger institution.
College Freshman,2,It just cost a lot because it is a private school.
College Sophomore,2,It's a small school so classes are smaller than normal but a negative is that you have to buy your own books and cost of attendance.
College Freshman,2,"Good but Old – Greensboro has every amenity you might need, but except for the Student Union (a renovated YMCA) and the Cafeteria I don't think there's been a single renovation on campus since the 80s. The library isn't much but with the Consortium you can get books from other colleges. The Student Union is great, with a gym, pool, and two basketball courts. Dorms and academic buildings are all old and in desperate need of repair."
Sophomore,1,"This school sucks, it cost to much money to go here and they don't even try to get maintenance to fix anything. Also the cafe food is terrible, its boring, they didn't give us any heat last year for a month and it took three girls passing out for them to get the air on, and the staff here gives you an attitude if you try to transfer to any other school and everyone knows your business. All the dorms are in need  of a renovation but they wont do anything about it. My dorm this year is terrible the bathrooms are filthy the faucet doesn't work the heat and air are just unbearable, the shower sucks the water doesn't get hot at all.   The WiFi continues to go off and on constantly.Overall Greensboro college is a terrible school, if push comes to shove your better off going to GTCC, at least they are well known and dont cost as much. WHOEVER SAYS THIS IS A GOOD SCHOOL THEY ARE LYING OR IN DENIAL!."
College Freshman,1,We don't have a Greek Life at Greensboro College.
College Sophomore,1,Just no. 1/2 the reason I transferred.
College Senior,1,"We do not have a Greek life. Majority of the time if you are trying to be apart of the Greek life, you have to go to others school around the area."
College Sophomore,1,"Most sports don't even have their own place. Football uses a high school field, softball uses a Boys and Girls Club's field, baseball floats between 2 fields. Really only soccer, lacrosse, and swimming have a place to practice at on campus."
College Junior,1,The campus dining hall close at 7:00 pm some days and 6:00 pm on other days. The rest of the night you are on your own whether you stay on campus or not. You can't go in and get a snack or relax when they switch between meals like we used to because they close the whole café. The on campus store we have stays open but closes about an hour after the café closes every night. The selection they have is okay for snacks. The food served in the café is pretty repetitive but it is good at times. They tend to run out of different drinks and dessert a lot. They told me that they were going to have a food shack in one of the centers across campus but they never did. Its just a vacant area in the back now. 
Recent Alumnus,1,"The campus used to offer the public buses as an amenity for the school which I used as well as many others but recently removed it from the program. Years before I got there a shuttle van was used and is now just for maintenance I believe. 
This school needs to add the Heat bus/Public transportation back especially if the shuttles are not available. 
Some people have to take classes at other schools to do their fieldwork, student teaching, or finish major due to cut courses. This is very difficult when the school has no transportation options other than praying people will help carpool."
College Sophomore,1,"Girls Are Not Hot.... at All – you wont find too many attarctive girls here, but there are a few"
College Freshman,1,Nothing to do at Greensboro College. Parties are lame. Downtown is iight gets old quick there are plenty of club but no one want to blow all there money on clubs

Freshman,5,My classes aren't bunch up instead I get to focus on each course at a time period. This university see's my potential and want me to enhance my skills in each environment of my study.
Freshman,5,My communication skills and time has improve due to FSU. I can work and balance between these two things.
Graduate Student,5,My online class experience I have to say is different because I'm not used to all my classes being online so its definitely an adjustment!
Graduate Student,5,The experience is absolutely amazing! Full Sail provides a unique amazing learning atmosphere! I've only been in attendance for about a few months and my knowledge is expanding like none other!
Alum,5,I loved the hands on experience as well as the real world feel to the major I was in. Most schools are stuck on theory. While this school really catered to what the real world would be like in this industry. It really prepared me for a career after college.
Alum,5,They gave you everything you need for online help and classes. The customer service is great and they really are attentive to their students.
Freshman,5,"They are so caring to the students in making sure that the starting process is understandable and everything is taken care of, with both the parents and students."
Freshman,5,"They are big on making sure every student understands the information and willing to give any help needed. Though fast paced, you are never bored"
Freshman,5,Their online learning program is very well thought out and easy to understand. Easy to navigate and see where your assignments are. I can easily tell when they are due and I can always call them for tech support if needed. I couldn't be more happy with my online learning experience and I'm glad I chose Full Sail University.
Freshman,5,So far I have been in Full Sail's online program. Their online program is excellent! They have been well prepared for online and make it a wonderful experience. Easy to understand and follow the website. Have great teachers and staff members. And when I call them for assistance they are extremely helpful. The only thing is that sometimes it's hard to reach out to them because they can get super busy. But once I'm able to get a hold of them they help me!
Sophomore,5,"The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable. There is always someone available to get advice, ask questions, or anything else you need."
Sophomore,5,All of my classes are online. They have a very user-friendly platform and their website is easy to navigate.
Freshman,5,Have had a really positive experience with staff and faculty. Looking forward to continued learning.

Freshman,5,"I´m currently taking online classes and the experience is great, meaning the professor is good to know. Very nice professor."
Freshman,5,My experience in my first year in college has been great. The professors are really nice and meeting different types of people and different ages is nice to meet them. Being an online student makes it easier to have a flexible time.
Sophomore,5,"I Love Everything about their adaptive online education process, they have a multitude of resources and are always adaptive in formats to reach out to the students that need assistance."
Sophomore,5,"It's atmosphere, students, professors, and resources are astoundingly helpful and productive in the fast pace process of teaching and creating."
Freshman,5,"Currently taking online classes. Teachers use Zoom as a way to teach live every Monday. If you cannot make it,  the video is posted to be seen every week.  Teachers find ways to come up with fun lesson plans to keep your attention."
Freshman,5,All of my courses are online. They are very good at helping you stay on track and get your coursework done on time.
Freshman,5,"Very helpful with getting online students going, the fact that you are able to call or chat or email them at any time is very very helpful! Can't wait for the rest of my career!"
Freshman,5,"I love the opportunity this college offers, as well as the amazing support. I was amazed at how much they care about you and you being a fit for the school"
Freshman,5,"Their entire process has been very simple and stress free. The admissions and financial aid staff have been so hands on and engaged with me, even through out this difficult time with the pandemic and such. There have been virtual tours and online video chats to ensure i had all of the tools and information necessary to be successful. Really excited to begin next month."
Freshman,5,"I am start at this school this up coming semester, but they have been very helpful in answering any questions I may have."
Freshman,5,"In just start but I hope for the best. I hear a lot of great thing about them. I look forward to learning a lot  from them, and taking what I learn to make great life and successful career for myself as well as my family."
Freshman,5,They are always available if you need anything. They are very hands on even with the online students. You can also get help from another students so easy online. They work around your time that you are available.
Freshman,5,The staff are very helpful. All class are easy to get too. Everyone helps each other and are very outgoing . The teachers are amazing.They answer all your questions and are available when you need them. The students have away to contact each if the teachers arn't available.Its a really amazing school.
Freshman,5,"I'm in an accelerated, 29-month Bachelors degree program. I'm an online student, so there's flexibility for me to get all of my assignments done. I'm enjoying the community aspect of it, as well as the types of training I'm receiving.  There's also opportunities to earn certificates through LinkedIn Learning, which is awesome! Also, there are several community-related events that occur virtually, which introduce me to alumni currently in the field(s) I'm looking to go into. A recently attended a Q&A event that introduced me to a virtual internship opportunity, and the amount of networking I've gained from that internship has been phenomenal!"
Freshman,5,"Instructors give us online assignments through a variety of ways: We analyze TED talks and other-related video content; we get reading assignments in e-books via O'Reilly Learning, and have access to LinkedIn Learning, as well. They also have a Launchbox program, which is factored into your overall tuition and fees, and they actually send you the latest equipment and links to any software needed, so we can access the same stuff as if we were on campus."
Freshman,5,The instructors do an amazing Job with their online courses. They make sure to always respond to any questions in a timely manner. If you can't make the live session they also record them and usually post them to the platform the same day so you don't fall behind at all!
Freshman,5,So far I would say Full Sail is an excellent college they have helped me in so many ways! They even provided everything I need to do the online classes. The only thing they didn't help me with is scholarship & grant searching but then again that's not really their job.
Freshman,5,"They have amazing administration that guide you thru admissions, financial aid, tech response, etc. They keep in contact with you throughout your experience.  I was nervous about doing online classes but they have it down to a science!  Well organized and their instructors are just as eager to teach you and build relationships via online.  I would recommend them for all who are looking for online."
Freshman,5,They make  online learning seem like it's  the option of the future.  They are ahead of the game as covid 19 has created issues with on campus classes all over the world.  They have been doing it for years and like i stated before it makes online experience seem smooth and the new norm. I would assume they could be a model for traditional schools to follow.
Freshman,5,The experience in full sail university is unique you get hands on experience on the filmaking aspect of the university as well as acces to in the career professionals that have worked u=in the industry definetly recomend anyone going for Film.
Senior,5,"Full sail offers great programs to achieve your dream. If you want to go into the visual arts, Full Sail is a great choice"
Senior,5,"I'm a online student with Full Sail, and the platform for education is extremely easy to use. You have every opportunity learning online as you do in the classroom."
Niche User,5,Visit was amazing everyone is really helpful and nice and it seems like a very nice and helpful learning environment
Niche User,5,The school is very helpful online helping you get better and closer to technology and helping students advance.
Freshman,5,My entire degree will be done online and I am thrilled to begin my classes and really get a taste of everything Full Sail has to offer!
Freshman,5,I love the admissions advisors at Full Sail! They have really been quite a life saver with getting enrolled and prepared for classes that begin in two weeks. I wish however that they would help more with finding financial aid to help pay for my education at their school.
Freshman,5,I haven’t started yet... but I’m pretty sure it will be amazing bc there’s things I never thought I would want to do and applying for full sail university is the best thing I have done ever.
Freshman,5,I can’t wait to start . It seems like my cup of tea the way it’s is I think more colleges should be like this people will succeed in life with things that they actually be hands on and everything.
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience here has been great. The professors are amazing and very personal with each of the students when they ask for help. The lab assistants are great too, they teach us how to solve a problem instead of solving it for us and they make learning that process much less frustrating than grade school. Full Sail is awesome and I hope to return to campus soon."
Alum,5,I love this school. I completed my B.a and plan on working on my Masters with them as well. This school is for people who do not want the typical college experience. Extremely fast paced and teaches you what you need to know and gets you to where you need to be.
Freshman,5,"They were all super helpful. The online program is very much at your own pace, so it helps if you have health problems or have to leave for a few hours."
Niche User,5,"I did not do online. I heard it was great, and that they like it more than on campus, but I didn't try it because I would never trade the on campus experience for the world."
Niche User,5,"Sound like my dream school. I love entertainment services. I have been looking at this school for over 3 years, I applied last month to attend in 2021. Hope they accept me."
Freshman,5,"Before attending Full Sail I tried another online school and it was a complete joke, Full Sail you will actually learn and feel like you are in college level education. I can’t wait to finish my degree!"
Freshman,5,"An amazing choice to attend, great staff and instructors. Getting my Bachelors online and it doesn’t feel like a joke like most online schools seem to be."
Freshman,5,Full Sail is great the staff is great the tech support is active almost daily and helped me get trhough any problems that may show concerns to me they also have an online class option
Freshman,5,Full Sail is great the staff is great the tech support is active almost daily and helped me get trhough any problems that may show concerns to me they also have an online class option
Graduate Student,5,If you take education seriously then this is the school for you. You work hard but get the opportunity to learn so much and gain skills. Highly qualified teachers that actually care.
Graduate Student,5,"Online classes aren't usually what I like but you get everything you need. I still prefer on-campus classes, but I was successful and learned a lot online at Full Sail."
Alum,5,"If you are self-motivated then studying online is a breeze. Moving at your own pace is helpful, especially if you're working at the same time."
Alum,5,"Coursework is very very challenging, but it definitely does prepare you for the real world. Be prepared to grind for success."
Junior,5,They provide you with everything you need to be successful in the classes. The online courses are accelerated but each month is only 1 - 2 classes. That's the part I really enjoy because it gave me time to really understand all of the material. The school provides us with equipment like computers and tablets to be able to work efficiently from home.
Junior,5,Great experience overall. I was able to meet and network with many people and it has become very beneficial for my career. I started in the Game Art Bachelors degree program online and it's been a great experience so far.
Freshman,5,"So good so Far, looking forward to learning more bout information technology @ full Sail. Learning online while working will be tough."
Freshman,5,"Im starting online classes tomorrow while working a full time job in the oil field.
So far everyone at full sail has been really helping in getting me ready to start classes."
Freshman,5,Love it Instructors are amazing and there when you need them. All the tools needed are there for as well as any kind of extra help for an education purpose they do all they can do. I am also happy with the online student liaison team that keeps me motivated.
Freshman,4,Excellent teachers and support team for distance learning students. The launchbox provides everything needed to succeed in the chosen degree field.
Freshman,4,I have had an absolutely amazing experience with the o mine degree so far at Full Sail. The pace is perfect for me. There is one class a month and the Bachelor degree is earned in 2.5 years.
Sophomore,4,"I love attending Full Sail University online. I have learned so many things essential for my field of study. The instructors I have had so far, have been kind but fair. Tech support are always available and helpful. The only note I really have is that it is fast paced, a lot of information is crammed in a very small time frame and without my husband working full time, I do not think I could keep my grades where they are."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience with Full Sail University has been a good one. The curriculum is fast-paced but intensive. Instructors are helpful and thorough. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Full Sail, so far. I reach out to tech support frequently, and the staff is patient and helpful. We so communicate through Dischord in most classes, this was a new but welcome experience for me. I enjoy the live workshops though Zoom, that are done at least once weekly depending on the class."
Freshman,4,"A little expensive but all schools are.  Will allow you to get all equipment from school, its included with your tuition but it is helpful if you cant afford it out of pocket"
Freshman,4,"I've just started my first year at Full Sail, and the programs online are well put together, and the instructors put a lot of care into interacting with the students and accommodating to their schedules if there are problems. I certainly appreciate all my professors taking time to check in with me about the material I'm learning."
Freshman,4,"I just started at the school, and I'm very excited to continue over the next several years in my program."
Freshman,4,"Online classes have always been hard for me, full sail challenged that. As an online student you are pushed to your limit if  you’re soemoen who doesn’t time manage"
Freshman,4,"I haven't begun classes yet so its difficult to really answer this question; but based upon the things i have witnessed thus far, I'd say the online learning system they have in place is amazing."
Freshman,4,Its pretty solid.So far everything is going great although its very challenging.Definetly not a place for lazy paople.You learn a lot!!
Alum,4,"I think some of the classes they offered online should of been taught in person. I will be working on getting my Masters online so, I am pretty sure those classes are more tailored to online learning."
Alum,4,"I have not yet taken any online classes with this university, so I wouldn't be able to accurately rate it. However, I am planning my graduate courses online."
Freshman,4,"The admissions team was very helpful, and everyone there is super friendly. They are more than willing to help you with everything that they can. They are more than willing to help you with financial aid and scholarships. The only downside to this school is the price. It's a very pricey school for out of pocket (depending on how much the FAFSA gave you)."
Freshman,4,"The online classes are good, so far so are my teachers. My classmates are nice and there is diversity in my classes. I wish I were able to stay connected to live classes daily but other than that, I've been impressed with its programs."
Freshman,4,"I like that they have an Animation Program, and that you can complete a bachelor's degree in only 29 months!"
Freshman,4,My experience has been wonderful. Full Sail responds quickly to my questions by email or even a call.

Freshman,4,I was able to join in on game with fellow student. Show my artwork and connect with professionals in my field.
Freshman,4,Over all Full Sail University is a great online school platform with instructors who really care about  your success
Sophomore,4,"I am an online student and the experience is better than I expected. I love it so far. I didn't know that with it being online, that it would be as involved as it is. I have connected with some other students and that also adds to the connection for going to Full Sail University online."
Junior,4,"Excellent online platform, very easy to use. Due dates are clear, discussion boards could use some improvement"
Junior,4,Great faculty and attentive staff. A little pricey but worth it!  You work with faculty who have been experts in their field and make great connections.
Sophomore,4,It is pretty nice. I love the classes they are fast pace however you know that going in. Because they want you to graduate within two years instead of four which is amazing.
Alum,4,"Full Sail University is a great school with experienced and helpful professors and plenty of opportunities for students to connect. The attendance requirements can be tough, especially for students with long commutes and those originally from out of state. Much of the curriculum is online which makes it very easy to keep track of your assignments and due dates. With the university being so close to Orlando, you will never run out of things to do.  The one downside of the location is the traffic. I am happy with the education I received at Full Sail and the lifelong friendships I’ve made."
Freshman,4,"I do online at Full Sail University and I love it so far! The teachers are wonderful and really care about me doing my best. They always help me when I need it and I feel like this is the best school I could've picked for my degree to be successful. Since it's accelerated it can be a little hard to keep up sometimes and be challenging, but once you've got it down you'll do great. I really love this school and I'm very confident that I'll be able to get the career I want with my degree."
Freshman,4,"great teachers, I’ve learned so much over the past 7 months that I’ve been an online student. Some advice I would give to upcoming students is that if you choose this school, do it because you are passionate in the field your studying, because if you don’t have the passion and put the effort into your career you will probably fail."
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my studies at Full Sail so far, although it has only been the general studies I have had classes in.  The classes I have taken have been well taught and rather informative, I have no complaints wih my experience."
Freshman,4,The admissions department staff is very helpful. Full Sail does its best to work with students which is highly appreciated. Knowledgeable and good course work.
Junior,4,"I love my experience at Full Sail, but it is definitely not for everyone. Do your homework and talk to the school, even tour if you can, to see if their campus programs and especially their accelerated online programs are for you."
Freshman,4,"As of right now, I like that with assignments, while they do give you requirements within those assignments, they also encourage you do be creative and think outside the box, which is very encouraging for students who do want to think outside the box and be creative. The thing I would change though is, they should specifically what they do not want a student to do on an assignment. While they give students freedom to be creative, they don't mention what they aren't looking for, just in case the student makes something they're not looking for. And by doing that, it could the student make wiser creative decisions."
Freshman,4,its so good i love the hospitality of the people who help you pre enrollment andpost enrollment of the school
Freshman,4,I've found this institution to be very informative and precessionaly inclined at the highest level. They take time to guide you through all the difficult issues from admission to online communication always available to the needs of the student. Also I'm very impressed with the number of alumni students of the institute that are out in the world making a difference in all walks of life from music production to have designs. Full Sail is a genuine educational icon within it's boundaries of all the classes they offer both on campus and online. Personally I'm just getting started but I've already experience more from this college than all the education of my life both work and school.
Graduate Student,4,"There is a difference between online courses and being on campus for sure. Which is why I stopped going to school for now until I can attend on campus. Overall still a great school, you still have to work hard after college no matter what. They wont hand you a job right off the bat you have to work for it like any other school."
Freshman,4,"I am constantly working with state of the art gear within the first months of being at full sail. I can make connections with my future instructors and get involved as much as I am able to. The workload in the first couple of months is not bad at all and isn't too hard on the schedule, but the farther you go into the degree the more intense the workload becomes. However, because this is a for-profit school, funding does not always go to the places it should. Also, some of the gear is not usable and the creative side for film, show pro, and audio arts is not always available because of the contracts with outside companies such as WWE. By having these contracts, they restrict how much students can change and be creative."
Senior,4,"So far, I have really enjoyed my time at Full Sail University. For the most part, I feel that they are teaching industry specific skills that will be helpful in my future career, however, I do believe that many of the skills you need have to be learned on the job. The instructors have been great and provided helpful feedback throughout my degree program."
Freshman,4,"Full sail seems like any other college, but they're not, they have many opportunities for students going into game design, art, music, entertainment. It's truly different from any college"
Freshman,4,The teachers and staff are very helpful and friendly. They are always willing to lend a hand when you need help with something.
Freshman,4,The staff are very helpful with my enrollment process. They show that they care immensely about my enrollment and education.
Junior,4,"I love how beautiful the college looks. People there are supper nice! And when it comes to learning, the teachers are the best."
Niche User,4,I've only attended the behind the scene tour and I'm scheduled to start classes on July 8th 2019 but so far I'm excited for all the great things I see coming for my future as a student at Full Sail. It just seems as the right place for me and I can't wait to start school.
Freshman,4,"Include forms to apply for their scholarships instead of doing it over the phone, it makes it more accessible for future students."
Alum,4,"Completed my Bachelor's in computer animation completely online. The accelerated workload isn't for everyone, as it can be pretty stressful and you need to be incredibly self disciplined in order to get all of your work done on time without the benefit of having a traditional classroom experience to keep you focused. My one complaint is the price, but a MacBook and assorted programs are part of tuition so it's not all bad. Getting a Bachelor's in under 4 years is definitely a huge plus, and I loved the coursework!"
Niche User,4,It is a technology and design university that has graduated some major names in the industry. They have a very diverse campus and recruiters go all across the U.S to find students who they think will do well at their college.
Freshman,4,I haven’t yet begun classes here but every interaction I have had with the staff at Full Sail has been nothing but positive. I plan on studying all online as I live in NY and the university is located in FL and they have put any concerns I have had to rest very quickly.
Freshman,4,I enrolled as an online student and its amazing. They contact me according to the schedule I set up and everything I need is at my fingertips and I couldn't ask for a better experience.
Junior,4,"Full Sail is very hands on. You will get a lot of experience with your industry's technology and software. However, I hate that there is no food on campus. You usually only get a 30 minute break, which is not enough time to leave campus, go out in Orlando traffic, have time to eat, and return to class. I also hate how expensive this school is. I have 5 scholarships and I'm still struggling to keep up with the cost of tuition, equipment, and food PLUS rent since the school doesn't provide housing. So, any support I can get in terms of funds helps."
Niche User,4,"I am beginning my enrollment at full sail university, for my b.s. in science with a degree in digital cinematography. so far so good, wish me luck."
Freshman,4,"What I like about Full Sail, there was a very warm, open minded and accepting atmosphere. It 's an art school, so it really feels like your talent is being nurtured and cared for. As an individual you can really find yourself their. Staff is great and gives advise when you need it. The students there are all cool and really passionate about whatever they're into. My only real gripe is with the ridiculous workload. You go to school from 8 to 5 pm. Sometimes on the weekends and sometimes you have night courses. Also, soon as you get home you have to study. Furthermore, it's hard getting around without a vehicle. Other than that, it's a great place to come if  you want to be an artist or into sports management and need starting point. They want hold your hand but if you put in the work they will send you in the right direction."
Freshman,4,"Full Sail is a nice school but you have to be serious about being here, or else you'll just be wasting thousands of dollars."
Niche User,4,"I did the 'Behind the Scenes' tour of the school, and it's got a beautiful campus in the Orlando area. It's absolutely phenomenal."
Freshman,4,Full sail is a fun and creative university. If your looking to go into the preforming or visual arts I can highly recommend Full Sail.
Senior,4,"I love the flexibility, especially since I take the online classes! The workload is intensive but it's worth it."
Freshman,4,I am in my fifth month at Full Sail and I love it so far. I am in the Digital Art and Design degree program. I've learned quite a bit already and can't wait for my classes in the future.
Freshman,4,"Full Sail is a good school so far. The online classes are accommodating and the campus life seems like it would be fun. It is mainly hard work, but those breaks they give us from time to time are wild from what I've seen. Live music, panels, games, you name it and it is likely there. As there is no On Campus housing, they have made deals with the surrounding apartments, and they give discounts to students who need to move in."
Junior,4,"I absolutely love full sail!!! I am thrilled to experience as a student everything the sxhool has to offer: hall of fame week, volunteer opportunities, internships, employment options, and much more! This school is for you if you're willing to learn hands on with top equipment for your future career!"
Niche User,4,"It’s fast paced and sometimes it’s hard to keep up, but I’m having a wonderful time. The teachers are knowledgeable and most still work in the industry, and there are so many amazing projects that can be worked on."
Sophomore,4,"This school can be very demanding but it does a good job getting you prepared for the industry. I think that I’ve learned a lot and think that it gets a bad rep. It really is a good school and I would recommend it to anyone. If you are considering, rest assured that you will be kept in good hands."
Junior,4,"I am attending Full Sail University for Creative Writing. Thus far, my experience has been great. I feel like I have been given access to great learning material, and I love that I have been given the appropriate technology and apps to supplement my learning."
Niche User,4,Full Sail seems like the perfect college for me because of the vast open scenery and lovely people in the area
Sophomore,2,"I was originally a campus-only student, so the shift to online learning was jarring for me. In my personal opinion, the shift was not easy even for the professors as their online teaching is mediocre because talking directly to the professor is harder/more uncomfortable to do over Zoom. Other than that, the online aspect is exactly how I expected; average amount of work as compared to campus and Zoom conferences for lecture."
Senior,2,"Perhaps the online experience is bad and the on-campus version is good - regardless, online classes are a joke. Ridiculously easy, the classes are basically a film-curated YouTube playlist - this is no joke, most tutorials are YouTube videos, and not even videos created by Full Sail staff."
Graduate Student,2,"Honestly they charge you 65 thousand dollars for their online Graphic Design corse and it is not worth it. Here is why, Firstly I got a Bachelor's Degree I spent 3 years doing all the work and it was only ever basics if even that. Secondly most of the work was really outdated by like 4-7 years. Thirdly, the teachers were really lazy and did not give adequate directions. Forth, the classes the scheduled weren't helpful most of the time it was just them saying what was wrong but no feedback about what we should have done to improve it. I finished this 3 year corse and owe so much money in loans and I don't feel that they properly taught anything that can even get a career going. I went ti this college because all the positive feedback I read but honestly most of it is crap and they were paid to say good things. If you go to fullsail be ready to owe a lot of money for something you can teach yourself by watching youtube. 100% not worth the money."
Niche User,2,"The school don't have tutors for grad students who have learning disabilities
Students do receive their final grade until there next month's class."
Freshman,2,it is very expensive and classes go by really fast.  I am in the online courses and can be difficult not having that face to face interaction with the instructor.  Advice to future students. Apply for scholarships and make sure assignments are turned in on time
College Senior,2,"I keep wanting to not label this school as ""the worst"" but as I continue on the survey it's hard. You can tell time and time again that the students aren't the problem it's the school itself with it's minimal teacher qualifications and horrible planning."
College Senior,2,"Full Sail is probably one of the most disorganized schools I've seen, the way that the school works is completely dysfunctional after the first few months and by that point you realize it's ""too late"" in a sense, to get out but I'm trying my hardest now before I get further in the hole."
College Junior,2,Scheduling is a NIGHTMARE. It's IMPOSSIBLE to plan for anything because the schedules barely get to teachers and students before the first day of class. It makes everything rather stressful.
College Senior,2,I have yet to be introduced to job opportunities through what the school offers. Only offers I myself have come across outside of school.
College Senior,2,The classes and teachers are decent or online classes. However you are spending way to much money for the courses you are taking.
College Senior,2,"The program feels very rushed, but the work load is okay. Way to expensive for what you are ""learning""."
College Senior,2,"The classes are fairly easy, and the students/instructors are great for being online. However the Financial Advisors and Student Counselors are terrible. They lost important papers at which I had to submit multiple times, to poor communication given certain circumstances."
College Sophomore,2,"This school is a joke. There is in support or help whatsoever with helping pay for school, all they want you to do is get loans."
College Junior,2,"You are paying for the same level of education as the campus people, but you will not receive that great of an education.  What you put in, is what you will get out.  You can breeze through everything, and you will pass, even if it's just with a C. The mentality here is that this is a hard course.  So, if you score a C, be happy.  If, however, you put in the time, and score an A, be proud of that.  Granted, that's the perception, the reality is much different.  For much of the time, it feels like you are just doing leg work, and the teachers are just auto grading, it's frustrating.  Most teachers don't respond to discussions, or prompt things.  The actual teachers do (the ones with degrees).  The instructors, not so much.  The PMA courses are a joke, and can be done all usually within a week (even though they are supposed to take 4 weeks).  Some of the instructors dislike online students, and will retaliate against you even if you misspell something (that's 25% off your grade), or miss an innocuous comment in code (that's a whole letter grade deduction, sometimes 2)."
College Senior,2,"I only had 2 classes where credits could be transferred and I heard/read recently that Full Sail doesn't offer much at all in the form of transferring credits to other schools. So if I were to attend a new school after graduating from Full Sail, I don't think any of my credits would be transferable. I think it has something to do with it being a for-profit school and an accelerated program - not entirely sure. Their online curriculum could really use some major revamping. Some classes literally just entail you watching YouTube videos and doing things completely on your own. Some of the instructors literally don't create or come up with their own projects or assignments. There were also MANY classes where you would be required to watch hours and hours (like, 5+) of videos in order to figure out how to do the assignments, but those hours and hours of videos would be weighted at 0% of the grade. Their grading scales are really horrible, too. I'd say majority of the classes I've had so far would have a few assignments worth a large portion of the grade and then they'd have random, small assignments worth 1-2%. They should really work on weighting things better. Instead of making one assignment 40% of the grade, they should break it up or add smaller assignments to help with the grade. Otherwise, if you do poorly on one assignment, you could easily fail the entire class because of just one assignment."
College Senior,2,"The best way I can sum this particular answer up is by saying that had I known what the instructors and classes were going to be like and had I known how much it was ACTUALLY going to cost me in student loans, I never would have signed up to attend this school. I also wish I would have realized what for-profit schools like Full Sail really care about. Lesson learned."
College Senior,2,"If you transfer credits they make you wait six months to start your schooling. If you feel you need the classes because you have been out of school a while, they let you start; then when there are six months left, they claim there is no more financial aid and you will be kicked out if you do not pay up."
College Senior,2,"They make you think you are approved for student aid, then each quarter they redo everything. They also try to make you wait six months to start, if you want to transfer old classes. If you have been out of school a while and want to take those classes, they oblige. Then when you have six months to go, they say there is no more financial aid and you must pay them. I am a straight A student and they are threatening to kick me out. I cannot get private loans. It is disgraceful."
College Junior,2,"Trying to get a straight answer from someone in the financial aid department is like pulling teeth. There is little communication, and you have to wait and wait to hear back from them. In order to qualify for ANY scholarships from the school you have to have been denied a outside loan. So it seems to me that they want you to go further in debt, which is pretty backwards to me. If the scholarships are there I think they should be based on grades and attendance."
College Junior,2,The teachers have a bad time communicating what is required to student in regards to assignments.
College Senior,2,They tell you right away it's a full time thing. It's pretty impossible to have a job and to be on accelerated at the same time. They let you know before you even come though so it's your own fault if you can't handle it.
College Senior,2,"I've learned some new things. The class times, class relevance, most of the curriculum is a waste of money."
College Senior,2,I can only speak for RA
College Senior,2,"overpriced, irrelevant classes, don't even go near a studio until like you're 8th month"
College Senior,2,at least for RA this is a rip off
College Senior,2,90% dudes who are all thirsty.
College Senior,2,"Im still attending this school, but as an RA student I'm seriously considering leaving. you're basically on you're own after you graduate, and because they pump students out every month its extremely rare to find employment."
College Junior,2,"Although probably not the absolute worst, it's pretty bad. The school puts you into your classes long before finalizing your financial aid documents. This causes huge problems and is a very stressful and uneasy distraction while working in my class. I am getting a call from my financial adviser at least once a day, every single day, about something new I have to fill out or about a new issue that has arose. It is an ongoing process and it is very, very stressful. My financial adviser has threatened me many times, saying that she will push my ""start date"" back by months (which would mean I would have to completely start over months from now) until we settle all of my financial documents. It's not my fault that we didn't complete everything and make sure everything was ok before starting, however I constantly feel like I'm being punished."
College Junior,2,"I'm a ShowPro student, and I hate that we have to go through a year of only audio classes.  I want to focus on lighting, and we won't even get into that until like month 13 or something."
College Junior,2,"The campus is stuck right in the middle of the city, and the two sections aren't connected, so you have to get out on the busy main road to get from one side to the other.  Traffic here is terrible."
College Junior,2,"I took two months of online courses before transferring to campus, and it was a complete waste of time.  I ended up having to retake them when I got to campus."
College Junior,2,"I've had a lot of costs, that were not thoroughly explained to me in the beginning. There are only scholarships for incoming students. So after you are enrolled, you are pretty much on your own for paying. I wasn't fully informed of this, which is why I would really benefit from a scholarship."
College Sophomore,2,I can say if you shy like me and try to make a friend it's very hard to find one to help with projects.
College Sophomore,2,they didnt help me out when i needed the help and when i ask for it
College Sophomore,2,"When Game Design I didn't know it was going to be that hard and I wouldn't get hardly any help from the teachers. Some of them I did and some of them I loved. But when I wanted to change my degree to Game Art, I wasn't allowed to."
College Sophomore,2,"When my fiance was pregnant she was a high risk pregnancy and it was like they didn't care because when I failed a couple of classes because I had to be by her side they made me pay to retake them. When I tried to appeal it because if was a good reason, I was denied everything. Now I am to the point to where I want to transfer but they won't give me my credits that I rightfully should have."
College Junior,2,The online experience at Full Sail can be a slight disadvantage to a lot of hands on learners.
College Sophomore,2,Special accommodations were not made after injury
College Junior,2,It is way too much money especially having to pay for housing on top of school 
College Junior,2,There is quite a work load at Full Sail. Some classes are tougher than others but they are spaced out nicely. I take classes online and like it. I work with Maya and ZBrush and love using those programs. I haven't got any internship opportunities of of yet but I have had opportunities to join clubs that will better prepare me for for after school.
Recent Alumnus,2,Many of the subjects taught can be learned from a book
College Senior,2,"The average student does't try very hard, complains too much, and expects way too much for their minute effort."
College Sophomore,2,"The online program is marketed as being flexible enough for working professionals.  During orientation I was acclimated to a seven-day schedule (discussion post due by Wednesday, additional course work due by Sunday) . Approximately three months into the program the schedule shifts from discussion post being due by Tuesday, all work due by Friday and occasionally new classes do not open until Monday.  Saturday and Sunday cannot be used to catch up on school work.  This is a very poor online program for anyone working full-time who needs their weekend to really dig into their assignments without the distraction of their employment."
College Junior,2,I feel that this could be improved. They wait until the last moment to let you know that there are problems with you financial aid then kick you out the following weekend. (I had a problem with FAFSA and rather than informing me of this problem the gave me a withdraw notice.)
College Junior,2,"i chose online course because it fits better into my schedule with not owing a car, and financially."
College Freshman,2,"Hello there. I'm Alannah and this is my review of Full Sail's Financial Aid and Tuition!

This college is well worth the money. Most of the teachers are or were professionals in their industry, so there are a lot of contacts you can make along with valuable lessons and advice.

I gave this a C- just because the financial department is not the best. On average, this college cost upwards to $80,000 for a 4 year degree and Pell/other grants will only cover so much. 

My advice to anyone interested in this college is to PLAN AHEAD. Get all the scholarships/awards you can while you are in high school.

My experience with Financial Aid here wasn't the best. I moved to Florida for the campus degree and was just barely scraping by. I had no scholarships other than the ones they offered and with the grants from FAFSA I was still not making enough to cover my first semester. So they put me on a monthly cash payment plan. I managed to pay them off, but now the financial department is refusing cash payment plans altogether because people weren't paying their dues.

In the end I was forced to move back home with my parents and switched to the same major but online instead. The problem with this is that the online degree is more expensive. and on top of that ALL of the scholarships I was awarded at first have been removed and they have no scholarships to offer me for the online degree.

Overall, their Financial Aid is not good at all. The people are nice and very helpful, but there is only so much they can do with Full Sail's weird idea of financial aid. Get scholarships while you can. High schools have millions of opportunities just sitting there for you. That one opportunity could either make it or break it, and if you really love the career you are going into then its a chance worth taking."
College Sophomore,2,"Ive had a bad experience trying to find all the help needed to cover the cost of tuition fees.  The people from financial aid returned my calls and gave me a breakdown of the money i can receive for help, the other alternative to pay for the tution is to get a loan! I felt disappointed and letdown, all my dreams and hopes of enrolling into a fine university had been shattered. I can't get a loan with bad credit history so I'm left doomed. 
  They do need to offer more help to students in this department, if they gave better advise and shown more support to people it would be a better place and I think students would enroll more. The cost is scary and the way the staff with financial aid handle you is not professional. Other than that I pray and know there is miracles that I will graduate from full sail with the degree to give me my dream career."
College Junior,2,"I feel they do not go all the way to help you find financial aid, and you have to hound them to get them involved in explaining their process of funding. They control everything tightly when it comes to finances."
College Senior,2,"It's a lot of money, and after what FAFSA pays it 
is hard to make the rest of the money work out."
College Junior,2,The tuition is pretty costly and finical aid process is somewhat hectic. I have to call and check up over and over on the status of my financial aid. The financial aid office at Full Sail is unorganized and sometimes very unprofessional.
College Junior,2,"This grade is an average, but it is a PASS. Also this grade shouldn't make a student be diappointed, however it just tell his to work harder."
Recent Alumnus,2,My school isn't quite the best at helping others find jobs.
College Junior,2,"Introduction to Accounting – I was so displeased with this grade when I saw it. I received 90 and above on all assignments and all test except one. One assignment I earned a 33 due to my own fault. I misread the directions.The problem is they don't offer any type of extra credit, none at all. I don't think its fair that a student does so well and gets a C because of one assignment."
College Junior,2,"At Full Sail all books are included within your tuition. This is great expect we don't receive any hard copy books only ebooks for our computers. I honestly feel I would exceed more in school with a hard copy text book. I would be able to study where ever I am and not get a headache from staring at a computer screen for hours. I've emailed many people within the school to see if hard copies were available but no response. My problem with financial aid is they don't contact you in time for anything, therefore your financial aid could be on the verge of running out and you would have no idea."
College Junior,2,"Grading Process – Sometimes the instructors do not post the assignment grades until the end of the classes, which run 4 weeks, so we never know if we need to change something, it is to late."
College Junior,2,"Entertainment Industry – I have noticed that my fellow students are younger and they just don't take the education seriously.  They brush off assignments and then wonder why they are failing the class or academic probation. All they care about is getting their money.

I don't understand their thinking, they think they can just breeze through classes making it harder on me, because they critique me, because even though they are younger, they are far more talented and they are never shy about bragging."
College Junior,2,"Need Some More Incentive – The educational value of these classes are an absolute must, however the amount of effort that you have to go through to get scholarship is mind boggling. The Business office is somewhat flexible but only on certain things. They do not believe in second chances to help out those people that truly want to improve their life through education."
College Junior,2,"Don't Be Blind – I was told one thing about the school fees and cost before starting, and once I got in, everything changed.  They switch you around too many times with Financial Advisors. I don't like that.  In the beginning they were very helpful in helping me with Financial Aid, but now that I am a sophomore and having a little more harder time in getting funding, it's like they've drop the ball on me.  I know that their degree's offered offer tons of value to your life, but I think they could be a little more up front."
College Junior,2,"Overpriced: Rushed and Stuffed – The school is reduclously over priced. The courses are a month long and everything is rushed, the instructors attempt to fill the students mind with as much they can which leads to in effective learning. As a student sometime on month is to short to understand a concept that is taught once and never talked about again. Since everything is so quick, variable information is often left out. Our classes and schedule are selected for us with our in put."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Late With No Apologies – I do believe that the education I am receiving is well worth the money to some degree because of the facilities and knowledgeable teaching.  While, their breakdown of how they expect money is horrible.  Meaning, they are requiring the most money at the end.  So they are most students to scramble around to find more money unless this their first time in college.  The financial aid officers are so late with the information.  They have a poor planning system."
Sophomore,1,"Online was alright, but after the school chewing me up and spitting me out I can't condone such nonsense, just another ""school"" that cares more about money than it's students"
Sophomore,1,"Well i had 100% attendance and did all THREE of the easy assignments for the class. It was Pass/Fail and the teacher who clearly gave me attitude throughout the month failed me. I did 100% of the requirements to pass, again PASS/FAIL. When i brought it up to the school they simply took her side and revealuted my program and thought i should be double charged for the class. This school is horrible. Though it does have some amazing teachers, this one was pure evil and had no business teaching anyone. FOR SHAME FULL SAIL!"
Sophomore,1,It's a nice platform. It is just incredibly expensive for online learning...there are much cheaper options that would leave you $200k in debt.
Niche User,1,"This college is not cheap and on this times we are living with coronavirus  a lot of families including me have been affected one way or another. The government just gave 1,000 help for the students but full sail deside they are to good to accept this. They are charging the students as if they were taking clases on campus when the campus has been closed since March and is you deside to switch to online programs they tell you . Basically you will lose the scholarship and if later on you deside to go back to campus clases you won't get them back. But in the present time they are not giving or offer any other help or discounts because basically all they one is the money and not help the kids. A parent like me paying out of pocket the part that is not been covered by the scholarship have no support from this college at all. This is the true face of this college"

Freshman,1,"I am completely appalled by this school. I've been a student since August for the Computer Animation Bachelors Program. I am withdrawing due to the fact that I can no longer afford to fail any classes. I failed one class, simply retook it and passed easily the second time. Next class I failed, which was weird. I worked really hard. No big deal, you get two freebies. But I just discovered I failed it again, which was fishy. Reason being was because I put in double the work, double the effort and triple the time to complete my assignments and there is absolutely no reason I should have failed again. Only thing I can think of is it being purposeful because they get $2,000 a class. Social life? Yeah right. 30 hours of homework a week and some of the most awkward and smelly kids I've ever seen walking around campus. None of them have any social skills, they look like the kids to hiss at people. Can't wait to get out of this non-transferable scam that is Full Sail University."
Niche User,1,"Many of my friends have either dropped out, transferred schools halfway through, or have been struggling to find a job after graduation. 

I myself dropped out halfway through due to the insanity and strain that the hectic schedule puts on you. I tried transferring some of my credits to another university and I was basically told that Full Sail credits are worthless and nontransferable. 

Going to this school was a waste of time and now I'm buried in student debt."
Freshman,1,It was honestly a mistake to attend this school. They don't seem to care much for the students and whether they succeed or not. I didn't feel like I belonged at this school.
Niche User,1,"I cannot believe the lack of professionalism & care for students that I have witnessed as my friend has tried to enroll with your school.
You have constantly told her ""let me reach out to someone that can help you"" ""they are not available you can leave a message & they will get back to you""

You do not even appear to care if a student even enrolls with you.
25 days ago, she started the process as of 9-2-17, she has not started class. She has provided everything you requested. Yet you keep giving her the runaround.
You are running this college so much like a business you seem to have forgotten who pays your checks- THE STUDENT!

I attend an online school & my experience has been so positive and different than the mess you have put my friend through.
I am happy to say I convinced her today to start the entry process @ another college (not the one I go to) & already they have treated her better & been more helpful in 1 interaction then Full Sail has been in the whole 25 days."
Niche User,1,Full Sail is a scam. No one should enroll unless they want to live the rest of their life in debt for a useless degree.
College Senior,1,If you are even thinking about swapping schools at some point without completely resetting your academic schooling good luck.
College Sophomore,1,The two online courses that you are required to take are bogus. Sooo bogus.
College Junior,1,"I knew the schedules would be hardcore, but I never imagined it would be this crazy. I've had classes starting at one in the morning and end at five."
College Junior,1,"I'm not saying that it really is the worst. It's just the worst for me. Being a student that doesn't even live in the same state as the college, has been hard enough. The Career Alumni not being able to help me find a job here was the worst part though. I'm sure they take care of who they can and I know that Louisiana and Florida are a distance away and I have been successful in at least finding a job that can relate to my degree, but I was not even offered assistance. Thanks Full Sail."
College Senior,1,"In the initial enrollment process, they tell you the base cost of the program, which, for me, was a little over $53,000. They told me multiple times that they cannot estimate the actual amount I would end up owing because apparently things change constantly with their financial processes. Right away, I was told that I needed an additional $12,000 just to attend the school because my FAFSA did not cover all of my tuition. Eventually, I had to take out around $24,000 in additional private student loans from Sallie Mae to cover remaining tuition costs for each semester. They were never correct on the amount that I would owe per semester. It was extremely frustrating to have to take out multiple private student loans for my tuition costs. It's also incredibly frustrating that they never know exactly what your program will cost you. I finally figured out what my total tuition cost will be just recently, which is a little over $79,000 (I also have $9,600 from a previous school), so around $89,000 total."
College Junior,1,non-existent. and faculty is horrible.
College Junior,1,"DO NOT go to this school...please listen. Teachers and faculty don't care about you, only that you keep paying. Tried to get help and they aren't interested in helping and take ""up to 24 hours"" to respond to homework questions. Really who can wait that long on an assignment? Wish I would have listened to all the negative reviews I read instead of turning a cheek. Pass this one up if you want a good education."
College Junior,1,"Don't go to school here. If you try to transfer to a different college the school might not take your credits. I withdrew during my second year there back in November 2013, and I'm glad that I did. When I first started the Music Production program online, it was great. The teachers I had were amazing and had great knowledge. But overall the school is a waste of money. I'm glad that I got out early with a debt of $8,000.86 dollars for the first year."
College Junior,1,"I absolutely hate the students here.  I hardly interact with people.  Imagine every possible stereotype for rappers, and combine them into one entity, and you have the majority of students here."
College Senior,1,"I think the scheduling at Full Sail University is the worst thing about attending this school, but it is understandable due to the short period to obtain a bachelors degree."
College Sophomore,1,They sucked so why keep asking me this I mean really
College Sophomore,1,Still don't know what to say here because its not that good
College Sophomore,1,Really not that good so what am I suppose to say here 
College Sophomore,1,they didnt know what they were doing and seemed they only cared about themselves
College Sophomore,1,They were too high and it was bad what else should I say
College Junior,1,"They are stressful and annoying. For your first class, They expected us to know when assignments are due just by starting Tuesday but not like an exact date so that has screwed me up. Also if you have a problem or a question, the teachers don't email you back in a timely matter "
College Junior,1,There is no choice it's just you chose one degree and you get forced into each class 
College Junior,1,"I was told that there would be no gen ed credits but there are alot of them. Digital Literacy, Psychology of Play, English, and soon Math were classes that I did not have any knowledge that I would have to take "
College Junior,1,The teachers are so negative and pretty much make you feel as if this was a bad choice. They are very unreliable emailing wise and their grading system sucks. They also lied about many things about this school and they expect you to know how to work a Mac and how to make a movie prior to going to this school. I came here to learn not to show off my skills. The only thing holding me back from dropping out is how much money was put into this school 
College Junior,1,"There are many days that I just want to go home on a weekend and that's impossible unless it's Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, or 4th of July. You are only allowed to miss 4 hours worth of a class and that it pretty much just 1 class. "
Recent Alumnus,1,"I started at Fullsail last year and have had to drop out this month due to, A. This school outright lies to you about the overall expense of going to Fullsail, it's life savings draining expensive, this site has there tuition at 21k when its around 90 to 100k + your other expenses. B. If you fall behind at all they leave you in the dirt and ask for your retake fee ( around 2,000$ ). this helps there huge and increasing drop out rate. C. The teachers are awesome, but the administration hasn't a clue how to run a school and treats most academic and domestic student issues as though they can charge the issue out of you. so if you miss a day from school because your to sick to leave the house, be ready to pay a class retake fee, even with a doctors note.

Overall, if you want an awesome school experience, have time to eat more then once a day, sleep more then 2 hours a night, keep you job, and stay in touch with friends, DONT GO HERE!"
College Junior,1,I used the library and have never got the book.
College Junior,1,I have yet to receive the book I checked out two months ago.
College Junior,1,My experience with FullSail's financial aid has been the worst experience ever. They don't know what they are talking about half of the time and the other half of the time they lie to you. They never have a straight answer for you and are completely rude. I have been told several times they didn't even have an answer for me. I thought they were suppose to be there to help you and they don't.
Recent Alumnus,1,Career services could not find me a job in my field that was in my course of sudy
Recent Alumnus,1,Tuition is crazy expensive and goes up every semester.  Financial aid does not cover everything.
College Senior,1,"Horrible. Workload is easy enough for a monkey to do, no challenge just a heap of work. No real artistic nature here just a place where everybody wants to try and be better than the next, but nobody realizes we all have the same material. No sort of real world education. Just a real sense of a scam."
College Senior,1,"For 30 years what has Full Sail been doing ? So no how about a class crammed of information that was poorly put together in a ""lesson plan"", with no slides, or properly written textbook. How about a degree program that has courses changed and revised and dropped just about every month, Great aren't i supposed to get to take a class for free if they change or add something new ? well that means I should get to take the whole course for free shouldn't it. No structured learning, just a bunch of information thrown on a wall like a plate of spaghetti to see what sticks."
College Senior,1,"I am a VA student, the military paid 100% for all of my schooling. Yet Full Sail university seems to over charge the VA as well as try to bill me with 25,000 bill. Which is a joke, when emailing a representative wether it be a student advisor or financial aid advisor, you can be assured that it will take them a week to longer to get back to you. When you do get in contact with them, "" I never received any email "" is always a definite at Full Sail University."
College Senior,1,"Nobody is there to help at all. This is a total gaffe or front, when asked about internships it seems like a joke to them, when some colleges offer internships with the program you are in. D - is a generous grade."
College Junior,1,I am not crazy about the financial aid office they are nit informative and are of little help when it comes to financial aid. My advice to others would be do as much research as possible become as knowledgeable as possible concerning your financial aid and options do not depend on their help because you won't get it
College Junior,1,"They lack secure quiet enviroments for EXTREMELY creative gifted people, we need isolation and time to think and eat... they make more money than alot fo schools and should see that inorder to survive they need there ASSETS or I mean students to guide the path way to the mainstream media... Bigger librarys, bigger athletic centers, health centers for students , and DEFIANTLY fiber food or vegan food!!!"
College Sophomore,1,I never thought online schooling would be for me. I signed up for this school trying to advance my life while working full time. In the end online schooling and Full Sail just weren't for me.
College Senior,1,"Generally, tuition is fairly reasonable for the quality of education received.

That being said, Full Sail does tend to rush students into the school without paying much attention to funding the whole degree. I have tried to contact financial aid multiple times. The first time, I e-mailed the person listed as my financial advisor, and (months later) I have never heard back. In January, I received a bill and was informed that my new financial aid advisor had reportedly contacted me about needing a copy of something to process financial aid. I called this new advisor, and did not hear back after a week, so I called again. After another week, this advisor called back, explained some information, and agreed to provide a financial aid breakdown for the rest of the amount I owed. Not only was it days later that I received the breakdown, but it was for the amount already covered, so I still do not know for sure what I will owe by the end of this year."
College Junior,1,"I have ADHD, PTSD and many other physiological issues that I am being treated for. My physical health is not any better. I spend and great deal of time rewriting and rereading my work."
College Junior,1,The classes are accelerated and last four weeks per topic. They pretty much run non-stop except Christmas. The last school I attended was a 2 year school with 8 x week accelerated classes and 16 week regular classes. I am just starting to get the timing of the classes at F.S.U.
College Junior,1,"No help from the teachers when the Autodesk program crashed, teachers do not make themselves available to help with these issues and FSO support does not support Autodesk at all."
College Junior,1,"Full Sail requires that you purchase a mac book pro and software at a rate that is only a small percentage of what the msrp values. They also require that you pay for the equipment in your first semester, regardless of your expected graduation date. They have a package that allows you to place a deposit down on the laptop but you must make four payments within the first academic year."
College Junior,1,The admissions team at Full Sail are unprofessional and often lie about the school. Quite often during my experience my paperwork was lost and I constantly had to resend it in. I often had to deal with no communication from the admissions team which lead me to have to seek legal advice and help. I tried several times to get in contact with the admissions team I was assigned to but I did not receive much feedback.
College Junior,1,"Your not working hard enough, it shows that you don't care much about your school work. You should start working harder before you get kicked out of the school."
College Junior,1,"There Is None. If you fail a class for grades you retake it, if you fail a class for attendance you retake it."
College Junior,1,"Financial aid is a must.  Full Sail is very expensive, so i suggest whoever decides to go here is very serious.  It's a lot of money to be wasting by failing your general ed classes."
College Senior,1,"Do not waste your money! This school is a business above all else and their goal is to make money, not educate you.  The only interest they have in educating you is to the minimum standards set on them by a tiny accreditation board.

Do not waste any money here because you'll soon realize the quality is terrible and non of your credits will transfer to other schools.  THEY KNOW THIS yet lie to you and say they do but that you need to confirm with the school if they'll accept the credits.  But why would you even bother checking before you start if another school accepts them when you are lead to believe the school is amazing beyond words.

And on that note, if you do decide to leave.  If you drop out after a month and 7 days into your semester you will owe for all of that semester.  Read about it here: http://fullsailreview.com/full-sail-universitys-greed-how-you-end-up-paying-for-classes-you-never-took/

#DownWithFullSailU"
College Senior,1,"YOU CANNOT TRANSFER CREDITS TO OTHER SCHOOLS.  Ask Other Schools If They'll Take Your Credits - They Won't – The lectures are a joke, you can learn everything they teach you own.  Do not waste your money."
College Junior,1,Hectic Schedules – I am not able to get a job and juggle my school schedule as well. Full Sail makes sure their students are solely focused on their careers or on their education. A job would distract me but give me money to live off of. Schedules change every month and make it very difficult to stabilize.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Every student that enrolls at Full Sail takes exactly the same courses in exactly the same sequence. Full Sail is a university in name only. There are no electives to choose from. Full Sail is about as rigid as you can get. And if you are hoping to transfer credits to Full Sail, they must be submitted within ten days of enrollment. And you're thinking about transferring Full Sail credits somewhere else? Forget about it, no school accepts their credits. Not a single one."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Student Body – Remember that this is a school where the only entry requirement is a pulse and a checkbook. Filmmaking is a collaborative art. Set the bar low and you might be happy. If all you want is a piece of paper that says you have a college degree and you want it in the shortest time possible then Full Sail is for you. If you're looking for more then consider saving your money and going elsewhere. If you really, really want to make movies think about how much gear $80,000 will buy. In the end, you'll at least have something tangible that has a resale value... your education at Full Sail does not."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Scheduled Class Time – The school states they are a 24 hour a day school, often using the expression ""real world education"". What this really means is that they schedule classes around the clock to make sure that facilities are utilized to the fullest extent. This also means that as a student you might have months where you can't even have eight hours of uninterrupted sleep. Same goes for the lab instructors. The student is paying the price so that the school can make even more money. Labs and lectures are supposed to be four hours long. That's what is required for accreditation and that's what the student is paying for but four hours is rarely delivered."
Recent Alumnus,1,"One of the big draws of Full Sail is all the gear they promise you'll be able to use during your tenure.... ha ha ha. Almost all film programs have equipment rooms where you can check out gear and use on your own... not Full Sail. The only way you can use the gear is with an instructor present. And of course the gear has to be available for check out. Lots of gear is broken or gone missing. And the rest of it is needed for class. You best make friends with the trustifarians that go here. Kids that at the age of 18, spend more money on gear than your parents will every spend on a house."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The posted price on this site is approximately $30k.... not even close. The price for a BS as of June 2010 is approximately $80K. There is an additional fee of $3k for a laptop and software which is required for all degree programs. Because of the compressed class schedule (two classes a month with completion of a degree program in 21 months) the payment schedule is very aggressive... three seven-month enrollment periods each costing approximately $25,000. Each enrollment period had a 30/60/90 day payment arrangement. Each payment is approx. $8000. You are paying in advance for services not yet provided. And of course the refund policy is also not very customer friendly... make sure you intend to finish at Full Sail if you decide to start. It's expensive and your credits transfer no where. "

Freshman,5,"I haven't really taken any online classes but I know that they are consistent in emails and making sure that you have everything you need, they want us to succeed and know we're important."
Freshman,5,"It is a really nice college and all the teachers and staff are always looking out for you. This is only my first year but I know that I'm gonna come back here, they push me to do my best every day."
Niche User,5,"Amazing environment I love the people and the town, they have a great small school and it’s so much fun!"
Niche User,5,I think that Olivet College is beautiful and offers a lot for a student to do because of its multiple club offerings. The teachers are really outgoing and are willing to help any student in need of help with a test or paper. The students at the university are really friendly and outgoing to everyone. The student cares about the community and helps out a lot with things like cleaning the community.  The spirt at Olivet is like nothing I've ever seen before the cheering is amazing and they really care about there athletic clubs. The alumni of the school only say good things about the school and encourage others to become an Olivet comet.
Freshman,5,Olivet is a small school but it felt like home the second I got there. Everybody is so friendly and nice.
Freshman,5,Small class size. Professors and staff care about your sucess. Everyone is treated like family in this small diverse University.
Freshman,5,I love that the teachers are always here to help you. There is also a Starbucks here so there always coffee.
Sophomore,5,"Well I’m a sophomore now that I’ve completed my freshman year. My freshman year was so amazing! The whole campus was involved, the staff was more involved and made the students feel like they were at home. I play football so pretty much the whole campus appreciates the athletes for working hard and performing. Academics is the number one topic at my college. They want to make sure everyone succeeds in life."
Junior,5,"Olivet is a very personalized college. The faculty and staff will always go above and beyond for you. The class sizes are very small so each student get a lot of one on one time. I love Olivet College because it feels like home. Every teacher after having them once knows your name. If you ever need help with any subject they have tutoring available at no cost. Your advisors are assigned based on what major you are, so that means that they have your best interest at heart. The teachers will always push you do do better. Olivet is like one big family."
Freshman,5,"I am only a freshman at Olivet, but I have finished my first semester and could not be more impressed and happy with the college. The classes I have taken were wonderful because due to the small, private college size you are able to connect with your professors and they assist you in any way you need. I love the small campus because I have not gotten lost once! They have a good tutoring program which has helped me greatly. I love Olivet College, and I am not just saying that. I really do!"
College Senior,5,"Greek Life students hold a huge role in the social atmosphere on campus. We have a student ran Greek government that organizes multiple social events, and we also volunteer at events around campus to increase student involvement and encourage students to a leader on campus. Greek students are viewed differently based in each organization by non-Greeks. The non-Greeks who want to become Greek, view Greeks as mentors and friends. Other non-Greek students have no idea what to think about Greeks on campus; the picture us as students from a wild Greek life movie. Olivet has housing for all 11 of its Greek organizations but two."
College Sophomore,5,Great  Athletic  faculty
College Freshman,5,"Personal safety here at Olivet College is the number one priority. Their isn't much crime that goes on here, but i'm sure their is still some criminal activity that still goes on."
College Freshman,5,My professors here at Olivet College are very helpful with anything a student needs. I mainly have two professors and i'm on first name bases with both of them; they try their best to make sure everything is on track for me to graduate on time.
College Sophomore,5,If you get an insurance degree from this school you will be wanted by some of the top companies in the nation. The school is nationally ranked for the Insurance program and gets a lot of attention from the industry.
College Freshman,5,"I have play flag football, been invited to their teas and social parties.  I think it great!"
College Junior,5,"more than a party place, the greeks are an important contribution to life on campus"
College Junior,5,The fast track to a career.  Faculty is dedicated to my success.
College Junior,5,rules are enforced when important.  saftey of students comes first.
College Junior,5,"Safe, fun, great student parties"
Junior,4,Online classes were well organized and put together for how short of notice we had with the whole COVID situation.
Junior,4,"There is a lot of diversity at Olivet, and with small class sizes, the professors really get to know and care about the students. Greek life is also super prevalent on campus, and it is a great opportunity to connect with the campus community."
Sophomore,4,"I really liked being at Olivet College because, I was able to branch out and meet new people and become really close friends with, I was able to see strong support from a professor to a student, the tutors where really helpful, kind and smart, the Greeks where nice for say if someone was intoxicated and needed help back to their dorm. Attending Olivet was very feasible because the campus is small so it wasn't a far walk to classes. I wish that the college had more clubs, and a theater program. I also wished that the dorms looked a bit more home like. I would like to see more interesting events and things with the college."
Senior,4,It is welcoming and there are so many opportunities to leave your mark. It is a place that you can discover who you are and your interests.
Niche User,4,"They make you feel like family. I really enjoyed the campus and all of the activities they have for students, specifically the music department. If you are a theater kid like me then a liberal arts college like this is perfect for you. They also have a wide array of sports and participation as well, and some really amazing professors that seem to really care about their students. They made the admissions process so easy and they were so helpful. I would highly suggest Olivet to any student going into law enforcement or corrections as well. Campus is beautiful, and it was overall just a very nice experience. I can't wait to go back in the fall."
Freshman,4,"Olivet College is great. Every one is so nice and the teachers are easy to talk to.  The campus is beautiful and small, so its easy to get to where you need to go. The only thing that I would change about Olivet College is their lack of handicap accessibility."
Junior,4,"Olivet College is a small rural school that still offers plenty of student clubs and activities to keep you busy. The curriculum is limited because of the schools size, but is still a very competitive academic school."
Freshman,4,"I love that it is a very small school, I like this because almost everyone knows each other and everyone seems to be a lot closer that you would at a bigger university. I also like all the professors I have so far, they all are willing to help if you ask them. The tutors here are also very helpful if you cant meet with your professor, so I enjoy using the tutors here. One thing I would change at Olivet college is maybe get like a small convenience store because there is none in town"
Freshman,4,"It feels like home and everyone is very welcoming. There are times when you may feel lost, but there is always someone you can go to who will make your time at Olivet easier. The experience overall has been a positive one."
Sophomore,4,"Olivet College is a very nice school all together. What it distinctly lacks in activities to participate in on campus is made up for in the academic aspects of the college. The teachers are all available and extremely willing to help out the students almost all of the time. With Olivet having such a small student base, most of the teachers have plenty of time to help the students learn or better understand the content of each class. Besides this, the school's food is fairly decent for the most part with some exceptions. However, it has improved greatly in this aspect as this past year has progressed."
Freshman,4,"Olivet is a great college if you like a small campus and even smaller classroom. The advisors and professors here all want to see you cross the stage in four years, they are very helpful. But, one thing i would love to change about the school is the food service we get it is not the best on a scale of one out of ten and ten being the best to me it’s honestly a 6."
College Senior,4,"Olivet College is known for its athletics and student athletes. 85% percent of the freshmen students that come to Olivet are athletes for at least one year. Football is huge in Olivet, they recently won the MIAA conference championship with a record of 9-1. Every home game, the team leads a parade down Main Street, while fans flood the city with tailgates and cheer. Overall Olivet's athletics are climbing each year for each sport."
College Senior,4,"My overall experience at Olivet College has been great thus far. The classroom sizes average 10-20 students which makes it easy to learn and give great opportunity to create and build personal relationships with colleagues and professors. The campus is fairly small which makes my commute from building to building fairly short. With Olivet only having 1, 300 students on campus, it's extremely easy to get involved, become a leader in an organization or team on campus; Olivet, also offers the opportunity for students to create new clubs and organizations to create awareness of interest in their choice of topic.

    I hold leadership positions in multiple organizations and clubs on campus since joining Olivet in the summer of 2013. I'm the current President of Alpha Xi Omega: the first minority organization established Olivet's on campus. I'm the Vice President of Industry Relations in the Alpha Alpha chapter of Gamma Iota Sigma: a business fraternity for insurance based students. I've had two paid internships since joining the Insurance and Risk management major; last summer I interned at an agency called Bad Boys Bail Bonds, this summer I'm an intern at a coporation, Accident Fund Group, doing Underwriting/ Business Development.  I'm a two time All American and captain in Olivet College's boxing club; our team is ranked first in the nation in collegiate boxing. Lastly, I'm a Hiram Archer Scholar in the Hiram Archer Society; a new organization created to highlight and mentor African- American students on Olivet's campus."
College Sophomore,4,Everyone at orientation was very helpful and friendly
College Freshman,4,"Degrees from Olivet College are very respectful, almost everyone i've meet that has graduated from Olivet College has found a job in their field quickly after graduating from college."
College Freshman,4,"Olivet College is a new home for me, giving me many opportunities to succeed in the future. Although my school is very expensive without any help to pay for school; I still love the atmosphere and all of the kind professors at Olivet College. My school is unique being in the middle of Michigan and only having 1,500 students; that makes Olivet College the smallest liberal Arts college in Michigan. I would choose to go to Olivet again because at this school you aren't just a number. No matter the time a worker from the college will be there to help a student out with any of their problems."
College Sophomore,4,The school is very safe and has campus safety patrolling around the clock.
College Sophomore,4,They are very knowledgeable and are always helpful if you have any questions.
College Sophomore,4,We may not have the biggest gym or football field in our conference but we have a great fan section at almost every home game.
College Sophomore,4,"The school has great class sizes and I find it very easy to contact a professor about any questions. Yes, it is very small and has limited fun to do. On the bright side it is about 30 minutes from Michigan State if you want to have a great weekend. The financial planning and Insurance program are very strong at this school and give a great overall education in the industry."
College Sophomore,4,The campus is safe at all times thanks to the tight security we have 24 hours a day. We have squad cars touring around the campus all day and because of the small campus they know faces. Any unfamiliar faces will be checked and asked questions. I feel very safe on campus I can be out at any time and will never question my safety.
College Sophomore,4,The career prospects and value of a degree from Olivet are very good in my favor. Students who graduate from Olivet have at least two career job options. The time we spend at Olivet they make sure we have internship opportunities that can lead to full time jobs.
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics at my university are a big part of the campus life. I am a member of the Men's Basketball team and we have the entire campus supporting us along with the community. The football team recently had their best year yet resulting into Conference Champs! The athletic facilities are great, we have three gyms and they all are great to get good workouts in. The school spirit is great, everyone comes to the games and supports us win or lose!"
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at my school so far has been pretty good. One of my favorite experiences of the school year so far would be the career fair that we had. Every major had someone that works in our field and spent the day talking to the students and creating a plan on getting to their level. What makes my school unique is that my school is a small school, so the professors know us by name and check up on us daily to make sure we are okay outside of class. They genuinely care about us and our futures it makes me feel good knowing that. I would choose this school all over again because it is a perfect fit for me I am thriving at this university."
College Freshman,4,It has been a great experience so far. Classes have been challenging and I've been working through them as hard as I can. I'm hoping to work harder next semester and get my grades up even higher.
College Sophomore,4,Olivet just seems like a wonderful school. I'm glad I found out about it.
College Junior,4,"There are a couple of great options, but there really aren't very many options.  Tim's Pizza is amazing but a little more expensive, as is the Lamplighter.  Coachlight is great depending on what you order... Subway is available at the BP.  The Willow Tree is amazing and offers coffee, tea, and amazing homemade baked goods."
College Junior,4,"There really are quite a few options, especially if your grades and community involvement are good.  There is staff willing to help with financial aid processes like FAFSA and sometimes scholarships."
College Freshman,4,The financial aid process was smooth and easy and the people who handled my application were very helpful.
College Freshman,4,"The college had links to scholarships and to student loans on there web site. I was able to get a student loan easily--since my parents co-signed for me.  Not sure if it would have been easy without them?  By the time I become a doctor I will be in debt, even with the scholarships I was able to obtain. :("
College Freshman,4,I am glad my parent's talked me into staying on campus. It has been an experience of a life time and a great way to get involved in groups and meet people with the same goals in life.
College Freshman,4,Being part of the soccer team keeps me involved in the college and is a great way to meet new people.  It is also nice to hear my parents and the fans cheering us on at the games.
College Junior,4,"all you need, and more"
College Junior,4,the atmosphere makes it good
College Junior,4,Athletics is a focal point of many student relationships.
College Freshman,4,the schooling is great and it wasn't difficult to get into my desired program.
College Freshman,4,the staff are great and they make sure i will be prepared for my future.
College Senior,4,The student life on campus is pretty cool. Everyone know everyone.
College Freshman,4,"Wide variety of people. Easy to interact with people on a small campus and find someone who you really get along with. Everyone is pretty ""normal"""
College Freshman,4,They do what they need to do. nothing fancy
College Freshman,4,I do not hear much about actual incidents
College Freshman,4,I believe there is a good balance
College Senior,4,I was able to receive a lot of financial aid at this school.
College Junior,4,almost no crime on campus.
College Freshman,4,The computers are pretty new. It's a small school on a budget.
College Freshman,4,Athletics is why people come to our school
College Freshman,4,Sports wear is the norm.  Grades are important but working out becomes a priority
College Freshman,4,Our college is growing and the parking has become an issue.  Parking availability needs to expand.
College Freshman,4,I have more possibilities than I thought I would.  I am enjoying it. 
College Freshman,4,We are adults.  We should be able to take care of ourselves and the campus expects that.
College Freshman,4,Workload is bearable.  The professors are always there to help.
Recent Alumnus,4,I loved it and had a great experience.
Recent Alumnus,4,Never a problem with parking
Recent Alumnus,4,I was satisfied with what I received.
Recent Alumnus,4,Never a problem with technology.
Recent Alumnus,4,I lived on campus in an apartment and it was so convenient.
College Sophomore,4,"I received a modest amount of scholarships. I could have earned more if my GPA would have been higher than a 3.0, but mine was a 2.86 in high school. If you live closer to Olivet college you can even get a larger scholarship."
College Sophomore,4,"Parking and permits are free on campus. There are certain areas that you are required to park in depending if you are a first, second, third, or fourth years student. As a freshman the parking is not the greatest."
College Sophomore,4,Olivet College Campus life is  a wonderful place for someone that grew up in a small community. The faculty influences students to achieve their goals. This last summer the cafeteria was renovated giving more spacious seating. There are several organization that you can join not to mention the two magnificent gyms for students to work out in.
College Sophomore,4,"Olivet seems to be in an area that does not get hit as hard with snow like other surrounding areas. However, and can get icy from time to time. Classes occasional get canceled if the weather is bad. Dorms are not too far from the main campus and cafeteria."
Sophomore,2,"I never did an online course with Olivet College, but when the pandemic took over, we had to switch to Remote Learning. I really dislike the Remote Learning due to Covid 19, because I'm very up close and person learner, and I enjoy the classroom atmosphere, so that wasn't the best at all not being on that. Online learning was as consistent as the personal classroom was for me   because there were some assignments I didn't know about that would pop up, and we had zoom meetings that took place of the classroom. The professor made it pretty easy because they rewrote a syllabus for us to look at, and some professors would email us about an assignment."
Niche User,2,"My son goes there , lives in ship hall . WiFi doesn't work ever  in his dorm room . My wife has called and complained they keep promising they would take care of it . So he has to go somewhere else to get WiFi since they won’t fix it . As long as they get their money they don’t care . All the money we pay for housing and they can’t fix it ."
Sophomore,2,"I have not had a good experience at Olivet College. The staff does not really seem to care about the students, and the students do not care about each other."
Junior,2,"I have spent 2 years at Olivet so far, and unfortunately I am not impressed. Yes, I was excited at first to attend, but Olivet does not meet the standard that other liberal arts colleges here in Michigan do. Whilst I did have some memorable professors, classes were far too easy and posed nothing challenging. Intellectual conversations outside of the classroom were none, besides the fact that Olivet recruits lunkheads and people who barely got by in high school. If anyone is looking for a liberal arts college that prides itself off of academic rigor, merit, reputation, and character, Olivet does not meet the match. In the end, I decided to transfer because I would like to attain a degree from a school that takes my money and dedication seriously."
Freshman,2,"Olivet College is a small, boring campus filled with African Americans who feel they own the place. The admissions folks purposely target the blacks, and let them flunk out after first year. The food is mediocre. Dorms are extremely crummy and with no AC in the summer. The professors are okay, but the programs are NOT challenging whatsoever, so this school doesn't really prepare an individual for grad school. The town is so dull and bleak. You would have to drive 30 minutes away to find something to do. If you are not an athlete, do not come to this school. You will be regarded as an outsider and you'll make no friends. Drug use and sexual assault on campus is high here. Don't be fooled because this is a private school. It's run by deplorable people who aren't classy, sophisticated, or mannered. Paying $35,000 to go here is absolutely not worth it. Go somewhere else."
College Freshman,2,I just think the school is too small for me and not challenging enough
College Freshman,2,There is no air conditioning and the rooms are really small. My dorm is missing furnature and the college refuses to give me and my roommate the furnature we are missing.
College Freshman,2,The gyms and facilities are really out of date and small.
College Freshman,2,Greek houses are very snobby to student not involve in Greek life. Greek's don't affect the social atmosphere because everyone at Olivet College tends to do their own thing. There dare multiple Greek houses that are huge and offer adequate living space.
College Freshman,2,There is not much available to do in the city of Olivet. There are very few opportunities for extracurricular activities
College Freshman,2,Needs to be updated big time
College Senior,2,"Olivet is very beautiful and peaceful. However, there is not a lot to do there. The closest thing for entertainment is about 15-20 minutes away. There is a park and a few dining options, along with a humane society where you can go and walk dogs."
College Senior,2,"Near the college there are mainly 4 options for off campus dining: Subway, Coachlight, Lamplighter and Tim's Pizza. The restaurants are okay but could be a lot better. Service is not usually friendly. The next nearest dining options are a good 15 to 20 minutes away."
College Student,2,we have to make a 20 minute drive to the nearest hospital
College Junior,2,dorms are old and out dated.
College Junior,2,nothing to do but drink on the weekends.
College Junior,2,most of the buildings were made before the 60's
College Freshman,2,They are typical school spots. Some are not great teams and some teams are very good.
College Freshman,2,If you are able to be a commuter I recommend it. Room and Board is not worth what you get from the school to spend the year living in.
College Junior,2,Not a lot of places to park close to the school you have to walk a good distance if you get there at a prime time.
Niche User,1,"I have heard students complain about their on line experience. Some teachers do not want to go embrace it, so when they can't figure it out they just cancel class. They have done hybrid and complete remote learning due to covid spikes on campus."
Niche User,1,"I am a parent. My son is a sophomore. I continue to be disappointed with each thing I discover about Olivet. My son has had no real advising. They claim to have foreign study. They do not. Limited internship opportunities. The campus has a beautiful library that is in a their pictures, but classes are mainly taken in one old building. It is really over priced for what it is. I am also very dissatisfied with how they have handled covid and reporting to parents. Don't send your students here. Very cult like."
Freshman,1,"I honestly went into Olivet thinking it was going to be much much better than what it actually was. The first semester I was placed into a dorm with three strangers that i had never met previously. And we did not get along at all. After a few months of dealing with two filthy, rude, and disrespectful roommates I finally emailed and talked to someone to change rooms, (keep in mind one of my roommates had previously left and came back) and I wasn’t able to move into a single dorm. They allow too many student on campus without having options to move rooms. The food isn’t the greatest considering how much you pay for this school. It’s not worth spending that much money, you just should go to a university. Professors are very opinionated and close minded. Also, if you like stuck up rich kids, this is the place for you. Basically anyone that goes here is for shitty d4 sports."
College Freshman,1,There is one apartment complex available for off-campus housing.
College Freshman,1,There are two official off campus dining options. One is a sports bar with decent food and a family owned pizza joint.
College Freshman,1,The food on campus is terrible and sadly there is only one place to get a meal. Athletes will find maintaining weight and strength difficult.
College Student,1,the only thing that is are the deli wraps
College Student,1,basically if you dont have a car you stay on campus all year long
College Student,1,its nothing to do honestly
College Student,1,there are a lot of places to eat but they are more than 35 minutes off campus
College Junior,1,There has been a rapid growth of students attending Olivet college. I don't have a car but I always hear the frustrations of my peers claiming they cant find parking spots near where they reside.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I am an international student. The school says because of that, I do not get any benefit at all. All I get is the international student scholarship. Without any aids and loans or even payment plans, it is really hard for me to go to the school. They make me pay all the money at once. In addition, the books at the book store are really expensive that I couldn't even afford one book.."
College Senior,1,"Demetrius Byrd – There's nothing to do in Albion MI. There's no where to shop, we have to go out of town to do shopping."

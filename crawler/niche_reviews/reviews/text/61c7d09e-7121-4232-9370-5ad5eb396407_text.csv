Alum,5,"Super easy to navigate, and generally awesome instructors! The courses that I took online were not the hardest, but they were definitely challenging. You learn to budget your time differently, and I appreciate that skill now!"
Alum,5,"I ADORED my experience at USM. There were so many opportunities to meet people from different walks of life, a variety of organizations to choose from, and an overwhelming amount of degrees to narrow down from. I loved going to football games with my friends and I loved my time in my sorority. Southern really challenged me academically, and that's what I wanted! I grew so much in my 5 years there (I had a total of 3 majors during my time at USM). I would absolutely recommend Southern to others (and I have) and will always be a proud Alumni! SMTTT!"
Junior,5,I have had a positive experience with online classes so far. I am able to work at my own pace and contact professors when needed.
Senior,5,"Many exceptional online instructors have it going on. I prefer online, and my needs were met and exceeded."
Sophomore,5,I loved the diversity and care for its students. It was also convenient to get around and the campus is very beautiful.
Sophomore,5,My professors did an excellent job in transitioning to online. They made it easy and compromised with us.
Junior,5,"I have not started classes yet, but I will be a full online student. I have had a great experience with my advisor and the online student support specialist. The emails that I get still gives me the experience without being on campus. Plus what I have heard or seen of the campus through social media is great."
Junior,5,"This will be my first year there, but I am a junior fully online college student. Although I have not started yet it seems like it will be great."
Freshman,5,It is a wonderful school filled with extraordinary people! they are so kind and helpful. I enjoy being a part of their family!
Sophomore,5,"Southern Miss is very calm and welcoming. There’s a place for everyone here, and the staff and faculty are so nice. There is nothing that I can think of that can change because USM is so perfect."
Senior,5,"I have always taken a couple of online classes. At USM, they thrive on helping students get through these online classes. The teachers are very helpful and responsive to students and they show that they care about our education. They did exceptionally well with transitioning to the online classes in the middle of this past spring semester because of the COVID crisis. They made everything formal and comprehensive like it should have been. I appreciate them for caring and wanting to see us succeed."
Senior,5,"Southern. Miss has wonderful teachers and staff eager to help at all costs. USM offers many disability programs to accommodate students, preparing them for success. If you are looking for a supportive school willing to work with you, let Southern Miss. assist you today!"

Freshman,5,Awesome experience! Love the atmosphere and the professors! I would love to see another parking garage added haha!
Freshman,5,The one online class I took was a pretty cool experience the professor was very active and attentive.
Freshman,5,"My experience at USM so far is a great one , the professors are well rounded and are professional at what they do , for me the transition to online classes I didn't have a problem , passing all my course work , if I'm to choose between online and sitting in the classroom, classroom would be my choice"
Freshman,5,"USM for me is a excellent choice, I'm an international student, as a freshman and I'm loving it at USM . room and board is great , my only concern is the food , I'm not enjoying the food , I guess coming from the Caribbean with our traditions for food is a great difference to what I'm use to , the professors are great very welcoming and I understand the work , so far it's been a great experience"
Sophomore,5,The learning environment is my favorite part of Southern Miss. It challenges you to reach your full potential.

Alum,5,My online courses were extremely easy and engaging. I was able to easily access my information and the professors got back to me in a timely manner.
Sophomore,5,"FOR THE MOST PART, I HAVE HAD A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE AT USM. I LOVE THE PEOPLE I HAVE MET AND MY CLASSES. I DO WISH THE ADMIN WOULD BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN HIRING PROFESSORS WITH STRONG ACCENTS BECAUSE IT IS OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THEM AND DOES IMPEDE THE LEARNING PROCESS. THE MAJORITY OF MY PROFESSORS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT I SUCCEED IN THEIR CLASS AND ARE VERY WILLING TO ASSIST ME WHEN REQUESTED. I DID NOT LIKE THE ONLINE CLASSES THAT WE WERE REQUIRED TO TRANSITION TO DURING THIS LAST SEMESTER, AND I DO FEEL THAT OUR TUITION SHOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO REFLECT THE FACT THAT WE DID NOT RECEIVE THE HANDS-ON EDUCATION THAT WE WERE PAYING FOR. ZOOM WAS NOT ALWAYS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL AND OFTEN HAD GLITCHES. IT WAS A VERY ANXIETY FILLED LEARNING PROCESS FOR ME. SHOULD USM CONTINUE THIS IN THE FALL, I WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER CONTINUING MY EDUCATION ELSEWHERE."
Freshman,5,Very supportive staff and friendly all around. Extremely inclusive. Opportunities and resources are readily available. Very understanding professors who are very passionate about their work.
Graduate Student,5,A have benefited tremendously from both the virtual format and face to face.  I particularly find “canvas” as useful and extremely functional.
Junior,5,I enjoyed online classes through the University of Southern Mississippi because my professors put in a tremendous amount of effort into making online learning interactive and valuable.
Junior,5,"I absolutely love the University of Southern Mississippi. As a third-year student in the Athletic Training program, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in-lecture, in-lab, and in my clinical settings.  Additionally, my genuine and caring professors, a beautiful campus, and an incredible program have helped me thrive, and continue to help me do better every single day."
Junior,5,I love Southern Miss! I have the best professors. They all are always there to help me succeed. Southern Miss is an excellent school with lots of opportunities.
Freshman,5,It has an amazing program in psychology that’s why I want to attend. And I can not wait to attend there.
Senior,5,"The curriculum at Southern Miss is difficult, but completely worth it. They allowed me to go above and beyond, and to soar into graduate school. #SMTTT"
Alum,5,"The campus is very walk able and classes are all within walking distance. Close knit community. You get to know almost everyone by face.
Teachers are great and helpful. You get a good balance between decent education and good quality of life. Honors college program is also great. 
Dorms are good and the campus is safe. 
It's a small college town with all the amenities. There is also good diversity and getting involved on campus is fairly easy. Career placements are good with alot of alums end up going to Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, New Orleans and Jackson among other places."
Junior,5,I just transferred here fall  2019 and it has been such a better experience than my previous school. The professors are great and care about their students. There are so many opportunities offered here that I never would have gotten anywhere else. Transferring here was the best decision I could have made for my education.
Niche User,5,"I have not visited the campus yet. However, I have heard wonderful reviews about the beautiful campus and the diversity of people there."
Junior,5,I've been attending USM since 2017 as an adult student. The staff is amazing and have helped me with my GI Bill.

Sophomore,5,"Such a friendly, hospitable place to be. Holds rich traditions and staff and faculty who value you education."
Senior,5,"I think that the Gulf Park Campus of USM is a very beautiful campus with an amazing staff and student body. It's small, so you get a more tailored experience, and you feel like your teachers and advisors really care."
Freshman,5,"My experience at the University of Southern Mississippi has been wonderful. Choosing this school has been the best thing for me. When I first got there, I was very nervous. The staff, student body, and others had made this experience worth while. The professors are great, and they are very thoughtful and helpful when it comes to assignments. Overall, I love the University of Southern Mississippi. There is not a better school for me. They have been the most amazing people, and the campus life has be good to me as well."
Freshman,5,"My first semester here at The University of Southern Mississippi was life-changing, stressful, and also structured in a way that helped me with being open-minded. The semester was challenging and demanding for me however it taught me a lot about communication, effort, and dedication. My biggest accomplishment was taking on eight classes for my major which is not common during your freshman year. However, I believe that if I worked hard enough this could have been the most rewarding outcome. I’m not saying that being an overachiever isn’t stressful or easy but decisions like those are beneficial yet it’s a hard process.  I encourage anyone who’s mentally and physically fit for this to give it a shot but also know your limits. 

 Everything is not meant to be perfect and it’s more of a trial and error type of thing at first when finding things that work best for you. Also, meet new people that are different from you and aim to get out of the comfort zone."
Senior,5,"My experience at the University of Southern Mississippi exceeded my expectations. I feel prepared for further study and have enjoyed my classes, professors, and fellow students. USM cares about its students and provides great services and activities for them. I would highly recommend this University to anyone!"
Junior,5,"I am currently attending the BSN RN Nursing Program at this university and although it is a tough course, it truly has some of the best instructors.  They are all very knowledgeable and want their students to succeed!"
Senior,5,"Southern Mississippi is a small, tight knit college. It is a true southern college with all the southern charm. Depending on your major, almost all major classes are in one building. You have plenty of time to get to your classes. The class sizes are small to medium, no overcrowding. The faculty and staff are excellent to work with. When your at Southern Miss, you feel at home."
Freshman,5,"The University of Southern Mississippi's online program has wonderful professors, is clearly designed, and formatted to help you succeed."
Senior,5,I love that Southern has an open minded community and it feels refreshing in the deep south. There are always things to do and ways to get involved on and off campus. The faculty are super friendly and personable. My favorite thing is that class sizes are really small!
Niche User,5,I visited USM for a college tour and had an amazing time. The administration was very nice and the campus is beautiful. The information on the the curriculum and the campus itself made me fall in love. They became my number 1 college choice.

Niche User,5,I TOURED THE CAMPUS AND ATTENDED A FOOTBALL CAMP.  AWESOME EXPERIENCE. THE CAMPUS WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HAD A LOT TO OFFER TO ANY TYPE OF STUDENT WITH ANY MAJOR IN MIND. ALL STAFF AND STUDENTS WERE VERY NICE AND FRIENDLY AND WAS WILLING AND ABLE TO ANSWER ALL OF MY QUESTIONS OR MY PARENTS QUESTIONS.
Niche User,5,I love the environment at USM. The students and faculty seem very friendly. I am currently waiting on my acceptance to the university. I am very eager to receive my acceptance! I live just a few miles away from the campus and I visit regularly for tailgating and sporting events. Every visit draws more into the school and i'm excited to be apart of the schools diverse environment! I feel like this would be an excellent school for anyone of any gender or race to be apart of.
Junior,5,"The University of Southern Mississippi is truly a home away from home. Southern Miss does such a fantastic job of making every student that enrolls in the university feel truly welcome. It does not matter if you live hours away, or right down the road Southern Miss makes you feel safe. My favorite part about the University is the school spirit. No matter who you run into on campus, even if you’ve never met them before, they will most likely greet you with “Southern Miss to the Top!” I’m so thankful to be part of a university that gives back so much to their students, making everyone feel included and loved."
Niche User,5,"Its amazing! The campus is beautiful and the people there are really nice. There is also lots to do around campus, as well as places to eat."
Freshman,5,"I've never seen a school that cares so much about their students.  We have the kindest and most hard-working faculty and programs that are designed to help student excel in life and in the classroom.   Every student has access to free counseling, we even have a zen room where students can relax and cope with stress in a calming environment.  Here, at Southern Miss, they want to see you graduate and reach your goals."
Sophomore,5,It’s great diversity and student involvement I feel right at home. I would like for them to add more restaurants and improve lines by hiring more student workers.
Freshman,5,"Great campus and college town. Smaller than some universities but much more personal.  Great class size and many clubs, organizations and activities."
Niche User,5,"Upon my visit to USM, I was very pleased with the way the staff treated on us the campus tour. They were so friendly and helpful with all the questions that needed answering. The campus is beautiful and it is surrounded by fun activities to do in Hattiesburg. There are no things I would like to change because things are already great at USM!"
Niche User,5,I love the welcoming atmosphere. I feel like I am at home every time I step on campus. The students and staff are very nice.
Junior,5,I liked the academics because it helps you with knowledge that you may not know and i also like how the help you get jobs right after graduating.
Junior,5,The University of Southern Mississippi is very good about helping thier students stay on the  track they want. They are also very supportive and encouraging to their students.
Alum,5,USM offered my a great campus life with lots of student activity. I also received a great education here. My only negative comment is that I wasn't able to find a good job in my field of study and  I feel my expectations were not reality. However in the recent years I noticed that my major has more emphasis on preparing students for graduate school and provides more direction than it did previously.
Freshman,5,The university of southern Mississippi is one of the best college in Mississippi and the staff is very friendly and helpful. When I went to the orientation they gave me helpful information and they also had a performance to show different things that happens at college. After that they had a lot of fun activities.
Junior,4,"The online experience works quite well. However I believe the school needs to do a better job of making sure all of their teachers know how to do basic functions, it’s irritating when things slow down because the instructors don’t know how to work some things."
Junior,4,"I am mostly doing online courses right now, but I’ve had a good experience so far! The professors are very helpful, and everyone I have talked to has been very friendly."
Senior,4,"My advisor was terrific. She knew exactly how to help me. The professors are all fantastic except one. I loved the online experience, except for that one (he know who he is)."
Junior,4,Every instructor seems to use a different method or platform to communicate which is annoying. One platform should only be used.
Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful and worthy of its students. In my personal altercations with the school, minor inconveniences continue to plague my college experience but no other complaints."
Freshman,4,"i didn't attend it online, but their websites are also very helpful! the websites are clear and straightforward. Wonderful! If you need help, all you have to do is give them a call (their number is provided at the bottom of each of their pages)."
Sophomore,4,What I like most about the university of southern Mississippi is the fact that it is a campus that is very diverse. What I would like to see change at the university of southern Mississippi is that I wish they would have more of a variety of food in the dining hall instead of serving the same exact thing every day of the week.
Sophomore,4,"The online transition during the pandemic was a little rough, but the professors did their best work with the students. Prior to this, I have never taken online classes, however."
Senior,4,I like the University. They are serious about student's education and are on top of everything. The campus is very nice and they never overdo anything. Everyone is welcomed and treated fairly as long as you are all about getting your work done. This is a nice school and they have a lot to offer to incoming students looking to further their education in a comfortable environment.
Sophomore,4,"Both campuses offer the full college experience. The school offers excellent education, activities, and the school is well diverse. The University of Southern Mississippi has a little bit of everything and I believe that makes it one of the best in Mississippi."
Sophomore,4,I am a incoming sophomore at the University of Southern Mississippi. So far my experience had been great. The students and staff are beer kind and loving. Although at times the work load from the teachers are a little unrealistic the learning environment is what you’ll need to become successful.
Alum,4,I loved attending USM! I was able to earn my degree and the staff was very helpful. I do wish the educational program had more rigorous classes. I felt some were too easy.
Freshman,4,Was very difficult adjusting since I previously hadn’t taken online classes but the staff was very helpful and understanding of the transition and did all they could to provide aid of any kind.
Graduate Student,4,I have had a fantastic experience at USM. I attended the  Hattiesburg campus from 1990-1995; I am currently attending USM via hybrid PHD- Gulf Coast MS.
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed my freshman year at Southern Miss. The traditions, the school spirit and the sense of community was very welcoming. Everyone welcomed me with open arms. During my first week of school, everyone on my floor sat on the grounds outside of Scott talking, laughing and connecting. We talked about where we were from, our majors and what we hope to accomplish that year. It was a surreal experience that allowed me to enter my freshman year with a sense of relief and confidence."
Junior,4,Southern Miss is a great school with a wide array of degree plans and majors for you to choose from. Great location with a hometown feel without being too distracted from the party scene.
Freshman,4,USM has an interesting array of classes and multiple scholarship opportunities. There are also lots of services available to help students.
Senior,4,"Southern Miss is a very diverse campus. I was given so many opportunities to build relationships, serve the community, and grow as a leader. I was given so much support from faculty and staff. If you give yourself to this university, the university gives back to you tenfold."
Freshman,4,"The University of Southern Mississippi is a very close community.  Yet, it is still a decently big school.  You will run into friends everywhere you go and still see a new face every day.  The school has offered lots of programs and services to us students to help in our development.  There is ample involvement opportunity and it is encouraged which adds to how close the community is.  Originally I always wanted to go to a big SEC school but after touring and coming to this university I know that I made the best choice for my life."
Sophomore,4,"I transferred as an adult student and the academic quality is excellent. The professors seem to genuinely care about their students and are experts in their fields. The school offers so many services for students and the tuition rates are very great considering everything you get. The course work is challenging and it will be difficult if you have to work outside of going to school full-time. 

Cons- Food in The Fresh is not healthy and very expensive without a meal plan. Fortunately, there are many better food places on campus, so invest in bonus bucks for the cost savings. 

Parking is a nightmare! Never enough spots and although you pay $90 for a parking permit, many parking spaces are restricted and you still have to pay parking meters in a lot of places. There is a separate permit for bicycles, which is silly."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy Southern Miss overall; however, there are issues and other occurrences that influence my review of the university.  I don't feel safe all the time. Academics are challenging but manageable. Social scene is vibrant but can be considered small town."
Sophomore,4,"So my experience of the university of Southern Mississippi has been good. No racism to anyone I have seen. Everyone is nice and respects each other. One that need to change is the food, payment policy because it's hard to understand, and classroom times and semester weeks."
Sophomore,4,I love the homey feel of Southern Miss and all of the opportunities on campus to get involved in. The leadership within the students is incredible and it's very diverse on campus.
Freshman,4,"The University of Southern Mississippi welcomes you with open arms. When I first arrived at the University it felt like home. You would think that you are going to fail or you are not going to make it to the next semester. However; with Southern Miss you get that sense of relief, because of how interacting everyone is when you walk around to get a feel of the school. The staff, faculty, and students bring so much joy and excitement to this University, and I would not want to be anywhere else. There may be times where you find yourself wanting to throw in the towel, but remembering all the opportunities USM have to offer. You realize you do not need to.  There are writing centers, speaking centers, and there are even professors who are willing to have that connection with you to help. I am happy I chose the University of Southern Mississippi."
Freshman,4,"The people here are very welcoming and really want to help you feel included! The amount of ways to get involved is insane! Even if you don't want to be dedicated to a certain club, there are still opportunities to get involved."
Junior,4,"While in high school, I toured the University of Southern Mississippi campus in Hattiesburg. I immediately fell in love with the environment. It’s a very peaceful campus, not too large nor too small. Not only is it aesthetically nice, but it’s academically excellent as well. As a history major, I fell in love with their History program and professors, who have offered me amazing opportunities both in and out of the classroom."
Freshman,4,"I love the welcoming community here at Southern Miss. You feel like you belong and won't get lost in the numbers since it isn't a ginormous school. One of my only complaints is parking. We need more parking built instead of a new volleyball building, and students should not have to move for game day."
Freshman,4,"The University of Southern Mississippi is a great place to be. The campus is beautiful and the students are diverse. The school is large enough to feel like you're getting the ""full college experience,"" but small enough that the professors know your name. The residence halls are nice and there are a lot of options for on-campus dining. Hattiesburg overall is a fun town with lost of things to do."
Sophomore,4,"I love USM. The people are great. The campus is beautiful. The only thing I would change is parking, there needs to be more commuter parking"
Senior,4,Southern Miss has become my home away from home. The campus is beautiful and there is a variety of places to eat. The parking situation is one thing I would change.
Niche User,4,I enjoyed the tour and they have a great Psychology program.  I enjoyed the campus and it had a family feel.  The classrooms seem very hands-on.  Everything on campus is within walking distance.  Area around campus seems safe
Freshman,4,"The University of Southern Mississippi is a wonderful school. I came four hours away from home and i feel like i have made a new home here at Southern Miss. The staff is incredible and can help with most, if not all the questions you have. I would 10/10 recommend this campus. #SMTTT!"
Junior,4,"I am an incoming transfer student, but I've lived in the area my whole life. USM is a great school in a good location with a lot to offer for any major."
Sophomore,4,"My time during my first year was pretty good at the University of Southern Mississippi. There was an abundance of clubs and organizations to join. There were companies invited to the campus so that students had the chance to get internships. They have a big cafeteria, and it's all you can eat. 
My first time going to class was extremely scary because being social is not one of my strengths at all, and I not very good at making friends. However, every student was provided with a printed schedule to find every class. The professors are varied based on there teaching style. Some teachers are funny. Basically, teachers are different.
The university would set up social events to help calm the stress of school work so the student wouldn't be overwhelmed. There was one thing I liked going to during my first year. The university set up multiple movie events throughout the year, and I loved going to these events. 
My time at Southern Mississippi was good."
Senior,4,"Southern Miss is a great campus where the professors are willing to answer questions when needed, and don't make you feel like just a number or name on a roster.  The academics are top notch as well as the athletics. I highly recommend attending if we have the major you are interested in, which we probably do...Southern Miss to the Top!"
Sophomore,4,Overall; the university of southern Mississippi is a beautiful environment everyone is very loving and also kind . It’s pretty hard to feel out of place when the environment is super friendly
Senior,4,"The University of Southern Mississippi is a great school with a great location. Hattiesburg is not too big, but it is close to big cities such as Mobile and New Orleans. The professors and staff are always so cheerful and ready to help and educate."
Freshman,4,USM is a great school! They have everything you need to advance to the next stage in your education. The people of USM are always there to assist you with everything you need. They have programs to help you get through with total support every step of the way.
Niche User,4,"The University of Southern Mississippi is a very affordable college for local students, and is an ideal choice with it's high academic record and excellent location."
Junior,4,"Overall, I really enjoy the University of Southern Mississippi. It is a very great school and has a beautiful campus. The professors are all very helpful, kind, and truly enjoy their jobs. I used to be on the soccer team at Southern Miss and that is the only reason I did not give the school five stars. If I am honest, the soccer aspect of this college is what caused me the most aggravation and irritation. The school itself is an amazing place. The staff and students at this university exemplify what it takes to be a good person. I am currently in my fourth semester at Southern Mississippi and I am absolutely loving it. I am a business management major and my professors are absolutely amazing. The business building is gorgeous and offers amazing amenities for all."
Freshman,4,"I love the University of Southern Mississippi, the experience has been by far one of the best. The atmosphere is so chilled and calm, you immediately begin to feel at home. Everyone is always so helpful, consider how the world is today. The only thing I feel as they should change to make it better Is, financial aid. They could use more grants and money to help be able to pay for school instead  of loans."
Sophomore,4,"Being here can be very challenging, but once you get the hang of it you will make it. It is very academic and they want you to get involved around campus. The atmosphere itself is amazing. I recommend going here if you want to attend a cheap yet academic college"
Freshman,4,"Southern Miss is a great school. The entire campus is 1 square mile, making the school feel smaller than it actually is. The professors seem to actually care about their students and try to make sure everyone can succeed in their classes. I would only change one thing, our cafeteria. The Fresh, as its called, makes the same food every week, which gets kind of boring. However, we can use ""Bonus Bucks"" for other eatery places on campus, which is very nice."
Freshman,4,"The university is very well put together and I have enjoyed the past two semesters that I have been here. The classes are somewhat challenging and the professors are always willing to help you no matter how many times you go to them with the same question. however, the parking at the university is not very good there is almost no where to park unless you are a commuter student and even than the parking situation is not good."
Alum,4,"I loved my experience at usm. it was a small school but it didn’t stiffle you. there was so much to explore, extracurricular wise. I loved my time here, minus the food!"
Sophomore,4,"When I first came to the university, I was a wide eyed 18 year old who didn't know his path in life. What makes this university so special is their efforts to help as many students as possible and find things that they are interested in. Within a month I joined organizations I would have never imagined being a part of. Southern Miss helps guide you into being an excellent leader and pushes you to improve yourself everyday. I am glad to be a Golden Eagle."
Freshman,4,There are so many different clubs and activities to help students get involved and meet other students. There are a variety of classes and majors to help cater to many audiences. Everyone you meet is willing to go out of their way to help you and are always nice. There are job fairs with booths that hand out brochures for study abroad and different majors. There is a writing center that will help you peer review and edit your essays or speeches for classes. The campus is awesome and there is active greek life and campus ministries. Every day we say Southern Miss to the TOP!
Junior,4,I am a junior transfer student from MGCCC in Gautier and I really like it here. I am majoring in Library Science.
Niche User,4,I think Southern Mississippi is a gorgeous campus with very nice staff and students. I have not yet attended Southern Mississippi but from my so far experience it is a wonderful home away from home.
Sophomore,4,"It is a very diverse school in the Deep South of MS. While tuition is a bit pricy, it is the right university to go with. With a small campus that feels like home, unique sports atmosphere, and some great administration, it is the college that you are looking for!"
Freshman,4,Southern Miss was my dream school. The College of Business has a very strong business program.  The people on campus are so nice and welcoming. I was immediately welcomed into the Southern Miss family when I came to campus.
Junior,4,"I have been there for only a semester and haven't gotten out much. I didn't know much about what was going on around campus until I finally made a friend. I was so happy my friend was in a fraternity and active o campus. If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have known anything."
Freshman,4,I liked the nice people that I met there and also the professors because they try to help students as much as possible to recieve a great education. The parties are fun and the food is both healthy and nutritious. The University libraries are also great for any type of research and a good place to study. The campus itself is just the right size to get from place to place within reasonable time. If I could change one thing it would be to have more people helping students study for every class.
Alum,4,I recently graduated from USM. I was a great four years. The student life was great. It was much diversity on campus. The professors were always available and willing to help during office hours. There was many financial assistance available for students. The classes ranged from easy to very difficult in all majors. The school is good start for students looking to go on to graduate school. An improvement the school could use is parking places and on campus food options.
Junior,4,"I like how Southern Mississippi tries to get everyone involved in an activity. The school is really good on helping you get an education. They have all types of tutors to help students improve their grades in classes that they might be failing or that they need help in. The only thing that I would probably change is when the dining hall closes up during the week and the weekend. During the week, the dining hall closes at eight o,clock at night. During the weekend, the dining hall closes at seven o’clock at night. I personally think that it should stay open until one o’clock in the morning because some people get the late night munchies."
Freshman,4,"My overall experience for being at the University of Southern Mississippi was pretty good , I liked how the people are so nice and the professors help you an improve your learning skills. I also like that the campus isn't really that big as i thought it was when i first made it there.  College can be very overwhelming because you're on your own now and nobody has the power to tell you what to do. The University of Southern Miss. is a great school, they show great hospitality, they put the students first, and they also make sure you have a great time while you're there, they also have plenty of activities, and festivities. USM is a great school in my opinion."
Freshman,4,"I love that it's a small campus and gives a homely vibe. I also have an on campus job and I feel that has made me very connected because I come in contact with so many different faces and opportunities. If the staff is aware of your financial need, they will try their hardest to help you out and get you connected with other administrators. There are also various club for just about anything you can think of and if you feel nothing here matches you, you can make your own club. The campus area is very populated with various food places as well and they're close in proximity, so its easily accessible. Overall, the campus is very safe place to be and very fun !"
Niche User,4,"This school is very friendly, just like me & diverse. It's huge as well and im always meeting new people. Every event they have is never the same and always shows effort."
Alum,4,"Southern Miss is a great school.  It has many different programs. I personally attended their Bachelor's program for nursing.  It was easy, fast and affordable.  Many of my friends and coworkers attended this great University and loved it. I would definitely recommend it."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Southern Mississippi is a great school. They try to get all students involved, but they stress on focusing for class."
Freshman,2,This year all of my classes are online which makes college so much more boring and hard. I only have one class that gets on zoom calls once a week and for all of the other ones its up to me to teach myself. I would rate the online format very poorly because its harder and you dont learn as easily.
Sophomore,2,I was only at the University of Southern Mississippi for one semester and honestly wouldn't recommend it.
College Sophomore,2,Was hard the first time around and worse this time
Recent Alumnus,2,I would never live off campus with the school I am right now. Most of friends have gotten rob and you go through a lot trouble just to get in your complex. The pro is you can have guest. Two complexes have shuttle buses that take you to and from the school every 30 mins. The availability of living of campus is slim to none. The lost is very expensive for you to have live where the past guest messed up the carpet. The safety is also terrible and when things get stolen they do not help to find out who is the blamed. The school does help with the off campus living.
College Freshman,2,They are great at publishing a lot of slick brochures with all the services they offer. When you need them they go out of the way to talk you out of making them follow through.
College Freshman,2,Overpriced. Poor quality and inconvenient.
College Junior,2,"The newer dorms are too expensive and don't offer much more than the old ones, plus they're further from classes. The old dorms are disgusting and poorly maintained."
College Freshman,2,There is more scholarships for out of state students than local in state applicants.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Know what you have to have and don't leave until they give you an answer..... They like to say ""My supervisor is out at the moment, but if you come back...etc"" and when you come back at the specified time the office is closed."
College Sophomore,2,I'm struggling to pay for school and seems like no one is willing to help me!
College Sophomore,2,Frat parties are lame and there isn't a big club variety.
College Sophomore,2,Because of my families financial standing I cannot receive the financial aid I actually need.
College Sophomore,2,They're pretty annoying and they are always partying
College Sophomore,2,You have to pass all your classes and have a good score on your ACT
College Sophomore,2,"I am having issues even contacting the financial aid office to try to straighten out my account, I can't even manage to call a number that will allow me to speak with an actual person instead of an automated message."
College Sophomore,2,The rules in the dorms are abundant and ridiculous in my opinion.
College Sophomore,2,"Upon arrival to my apartment, I found that it still had a lot of things left over from the previous occupants and places like the balcony, bathroom and refrigerator were absolutely filthy."
College Freshman,2,"I wasn't quite sure what to rate the strictness. It is very strict on campus. The police will write a person a parking violation without hesitation. They are not too strict on underage drinking as long as a person is not carrying around open containers and acting a fool. Theres no tolerance when it comes to the dorms, though."
College Freshman,2,Security guards on campus are a joke. They are lazy and don't really perform their duties at all.
College Junior,2,"I was offered an academic scholarship -- which was awesome -- but was no where near enough. I recently took out a loan this past year and it was a horrible process. The checks weren't mailed when they said they would be, they lost my records, checks were randomly mailed to different addresses. It was just ridiculous. "
College Junior,2,Frat parties get old and aren't really fun unless you know the majority of people in the fraternity. The bars are expensive and there are only really two bars that all college students go to so they are generally too crowded anyway. 
College Sophomore,2,"I am from Chicago, but I go to school in Hattiesburg, MS. I never get help from the school to get home. I have to either rely on a friend who has not left for home yet or call a taxi. It is very inconvenient for me to get to where I need to go off campus unless I get a friend or cab driver to assist me. "
College Junior,2,"Parking on this campus is outrageous. If you are not perfectly early for class, there is hardly any chance to get a parking space anywhere near class. The faculty parking is what makes it so bad--there are SO many faculty parking spaces, but rarely are they ever filled. It is entirely frustrating because parking enforcement is serious business on campus. "
College Sophomore,2,"You would think with it being a pretty big city, and a college town at that they would have a better public transportation system. Well, they don't. They have a few taxi's and a few buses, but other than that it's kind of hard to get around without a car unless you are willing to walk."
College Junior,2,Most Greeks are stuck up. Housing is always available. 
Recent Alumnus,2,The dinning halls are pretty big but the food is not worth all the money that we have to pay.
College Freshman,2,The weather is very unpredictable
College Freshman,2,We are in the process of building a new parking garage. Spots are limited in the early part of the day & you can get a parking ticket for things I've never heard of. 
College Sophomore,2,It rains a lot here and it tends to flood stuff like some walkways and lower places on campus. 
Recent Alumnus,2,"I wish there were more transportation options. But nobody has a perfect schedule that parallels with a bus. Only big apartment complexes provide transportation to and from campus. it wasn't an option for me
"
College Freshman,2,"I live in Jones Hall, and honestly it is horrible. Century Park is really nice, but everywhere else is okay at best."
College Freshman,2,"It's a completely different school from what I had envisioned. The food here is mediocre at best, Greek life is okay, and overall campus atmosphere is very liberal. I regret coming to school here."
College Junior,2,"I'm glad we have good parking enforcement, but I feel like we have way to many spots for faculty and staff. Also, the price is ridiculous, and I have a hard time finding a parking spot. This is why I walk to my classes and only use my car to go places way off campus."
College Junior,2,"Really, the worst that can happen is when there are tornadoes. We had one hit campus last year, and it was pretty awful. Other than that, it either rains or shines."
College Junior,2,"I've been to three different dorms during my so far three years of living on campus. It really varies on what your degree is while attending this school. Last year where I stayed was more conveniently located near my classes, but sadly far away from the cafeteria. This year, I'm right next to the cafeteria, but classes are farther away. To be honest, I'd rather have a longer walk to get to classes than to get to any source of food. But that's really my opinion. Some dorms are more expensive than others, and the housing process can be a bit stressful. "
College Junior,2,"The registration process is great because it shows us when, where, and who is teaching our classes. If we have problems with our current professors, or any other inconvenient reasons, we can change the class on that same website. It makes things a bit more convenient for the students."
College Junior,2,Our football team hasn't won any games these last 2 season. The basketball teams are ok. I don't know much about any of the other teams but I've heard the baseball team is pretty good.
College Freshman,2,I haven't heard from Greek life since orientation and the beginning of my freshman year. They may throw a few parties but doing things for the community i haven't heard of much.
College Freshman,2,"Parking is pretty bad for residents, but for the commuters it is pretty decent. There is always somewhere to park, and there are certain lots you can always count on to have spaces available. Our campus is designed for pedestrians as a priority, so walking is extremely neccessary. Your best bet is to arrive 10-15 minutes early, park in a lot that always has spaces, and walk a little to get to your class. Parking management is thourough here, so if you park in a bad spot, you are more than likely going to have a ticket."
Recent Alumnus,2,weather is average. always carry an umbrella because one minute it is sunny and the next it is raining. Invest in a light rain jacket and some cute rainboots
College Junior,2,"there are 3 main student living apartment complexes in Hattiesburg, they all look the same and range in price, two of them have a shuttle bus that takes you to and from campus every 20 minutes. The complexes are pretty big but it is best that you have your roommates already planned out or you will be forced to live with a complete stranger."
College Sophomore,2,"Every semester for my freshman year there was some kind of weather problem. First semester we had a hurricane that hit, it didn't do much damage to Hattiesburg but school was closed for a few days. Then second semester it was a tornado, which did destroy one of the school landmarks and the entire front of the school. Even did damage to a lot of student vehicles."
College Sophomore,2,"They don't really offer a lot of financial aid. You have scholarships but if you have anything less than a 3.0 then your screwed for scholarships. They have a loan referred to as the Perkins Loan, it may help but then again try to stay away from loans."
College Sophomore,2,The campus isn't too strict nor is it too lenient. Certain rules that don't pose a threat to others can get you a slap on the risk and then rules that could cause danger to others or yourself is usually taken under immediate action.
College Sophomore,2,It is a nightmare and the cost for a parking permit is outrageous.
College Junior,2,Parking has gotten pretty bad because they are building where parking used to be. There are more students than there are parking spots. It takes more time and gas just to find a parking spot on campus than it does to go off campus for a little bit. Parking has become quite inconvenient for students on campus.
College Junior,2,They have the emergency stick things around campus but when leaving my night classes i am scared to death walking to my car if it is far away.
College Junior,2,I feel that the program should cater more to the students to keep in touch and discuss the individual needs of the students. I find myself in classes that are designed around certain professions and the family relations majors tend to get less attention.
College Junior,2,If you live a ways from campus the only way to get there is to drive a car. If you can find someone to carpool the more the better but that's few and far between.
College Sophomore,2,Mississippi weather is generally pretty hot. It's never really too hot or too cold though. I love the weather here but sometimes it is hot one week then freezing the next week so dressing is a little difficult.
College Freshman,2,"For the most part, the campus at the University of Southern Mississippi is safe. However, every now and then robbers or other type of criminals tend to walk onto campus and blend in with the students. Since there is no type of gate or fence surrounding the campus, it's easy for random people to walk into the school."
College Freshman,2,Parking on the gulf park campus is terrible. The only time you can get a good spot is if you have the first class of the day. It is even worse at night
College Freshman,2,"Whenever it rains, it's horrible if you have class across campus. You aren't going to drive to class because finding parking will be a nightmare, and the campus has poor irrigation so the roads and walkways get really flooded. Most students have rain coats, rain boots, and heavy duty umbrellas."
College Sophomore,2,"The parking situation at school is ridiculous.  A permit for a vehicle is $180.  We have the highest permit in the state of Mississippi.  The parking is outrageous.  It is very difficult for residents and commuters to find a park on campus.  As a freshman, it is not needed for you to have a vehicle.  There are many places close to campus that you can walk to.  For example, CVS Pharmacy, McDonald's, and Checkers are right in front of the school.  They provide crosswalks for students to travel to these places. Ticketing is not at all bad as long as you know the rules of parallel parking and where to park and where not to park.  This is all explained at our orientations that we have.  I believe parking at any university sucks! Because everyone wants the best parking possible."
College Sophomore,2,"the paths are not very well lit, and it sometimes can be hazardous around construction areas"
College Senior,2,"Public transportation isn't available on Southern Miss campus. The only transportation available is that of the students who live in the Eagles Trails apartments, and that's ONLY because the apartments are far from campus. If you don't have your on vehicle you're pretty much out of luck. Not everyone will want to offer you rides. I know because I've experienced it."
College Senior,2,"It tends rain a lot here, but classes do continue on. I hate that because, the dorm where I was living in was far from my classes so I had to walk and sometimes get drenched with water from the flooding walkways. Other than that, the weather is pretty good."
College Junior,2,"I received a pretty fair amount of financial aid, although some of it did not cover certain expenses that I had. That was a big problem, and still is. I suggest making the financial aid more durable to all expenses and maybe offer a little more."
College Sophomore,2,"It's absolutely ridiculous trying to eat healthy on campus. While there are many options, they are really repetitive. You have The Fresh, which offers a salad bar, and the smart line, but the salad bar's toppings are very limited, and the salad dressings are all fatty, they don't offer any simple olive oils or vinegar, and the smart line is basically the same thing every day. This year, every day, they have the same sauteed vegetables, and some kind of entre, with a noodle bar. The other options include Subway, which can be good if you know how to order a sandwich the right way, but alot of the options are just as bad as fast food. Then you have Chik-fila, which is supposed to be a ""healthier version"" of fast food, but the chicken has 18 different types of preservatives in it, which are HORRIBLE for you. Then you have the agora, which is either fattening mexican food at tortilla fresca, or slighty healthier food at the Einstein brothers. And the topper is they force residents to buy a meal plan. The entire food program at Southern is ridiculous."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Very Repetitive Foods – Somedays the food is very good other days it isn't. They tend to repeat many meals, or sometimes they match foods up that don't typically belong with each other. There are some places on campus that offer a great variety of food but the prices are usually kind of expensive. You would be spending less off campus."
Freshman,1,Tuition and dorms are really expensive. The staff treats you nice to get you to come here but when you get here they are rude and don’t give a crap about you. Financial aid department is the worst. They are nasty to you on the phone and in person. They won’t help if you can’t afford to pay for college and they have these ridiculous fees for being late paying and fees for each and every class. Don’t go here. Stay away!!
College Junior,1,"Maintenance crew came into my dorm and stole my shower curtain. When I called maintenance the following the morning, I was informed that they would not replace the shower curtain and that they were not responsible."
College Freshman,1,The Fresh is your main option and it is the most unhealthy and unprocessed food I've ever eaten. You really don't have any other choice unless you have bonus bucks or money to spend at the other places like Chick-Fil-A and Subway.
College Freshman,1,"They actually answer students' questions with, ""We me the minimal standards."""
College Freshman,1,Poor quality instruction in the Audiology program.
College Freshman,1,Never found scholarships that were not extremely exclusive with complicated application process.
Recent Alumnus,1,You're on your on.... Pepper Spray is a good idea!
College Freshman,1,The campus does not offer transportation considering how small campus is. I walk everywhere on campus.
College Junior,1,I say its the worst because it is VERY strict. I live off campus but my best friends live on campus. I shouldn't have to check in and out constantly or fill out paperwork just to crash their for the night. I can understand for the opposite sex but we aren't. Sometimes after hanging out late it'd be nice to crash at their place.
College Freshman,1,"You have to struggle, unless you go to the garage."
College Junior,1,"I am not at the point were I have only 2,000 left to pay and I am praying that If a way to pay it."
Recent Alumnus,1,Hated parking on campus. 9:00 morning class had to leave at 7:00
College Freshman,1,"The food here is horrible. It is nearly the same thing everyday in the cafeteria, so it gets old pretty fast eating the same food."
College Junior,1,"It's not the worst thing ever, but it can do better. Much better. I think the biggest complaint about the school from any student would be financial aid. I keep hearing from some students that the people who work there don't know what they're doing, or they don't really care. As for me, yes I have lots of frustration trying to settle my finances. It's just an overall frustrating process."
College Freshman,1,There are no public buses run to and from the campus except for those that are run by apartments and can only be used by residents. This lack of transport means a car is a necessity since the city is not very pedestrian friendly.
College Junior,1,Parking is terrible on campus. The permit costs are to much for people living on campus. If you have a class on one side of campus and the next one on the other side then you will definitely need a car to get there on time.
College Junior,1,The scholarships are geared towards better achieving students and specific fields that have nothing to do with mine. I'm trying to avoid students loans as much as possible but the cost of school is hurting me and my family that i'm trying to help support. Scholarships at USM aren't great and if you can go somewhere else that will be more help to you i recommend it.
College Sophomore,1,There isn't enough parking space available for all students even with parking decals.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is a pain. There is a lot of construction going on where they take away parking to store building supplies, but they do not add any additional parking to compensate.  Yes they have a parking garage with plenty of space, but it is not in a very convenient location.  I have to walk almost half a mile every night to get to my dorm when I park in the parking garage."
College Sophomore,1,It rains on campus all the time. The campus was poorly built because there is always an issue with flooding.
College Sophomore,1,Students decals are $135 and we can never find a spot. I live right near campus and usually have to leave up to 30 minutes early just to ride around to find a spot.
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is horrible. For starters, the parking decals are $135 which I don't understand why they're that expensive when there's a parking garage. If you don't buy a decal and you receive a ticket, it's usually a warning the first time and the second time it's $100. The only time there's enough parking is usually after 4pm. Parking management stop checking vehicles at 430pm so that's when there's plenty of parking."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is great on weekends when nobody is at campus, but when people are on campus there is not enough convenient parking and most of the times me and my friends have to resort to the parking garage on the other side of campus."
College Sophomore,1,"The dining options suck at USM.  We have two dining halls for students on campus.  The first is called the Fresh Food Cafeteria.  This particular cafeteria is disgusting.  They only serve good food twice a week.  The rest of the days are absolutely horrible.  The second cafeteria is called Hillcrest Cafeteria.  It is absolutely fabulous! You can always count on the them to be good.  The lines are not short and the workers are able to be efficient getting the food out on time to being as nice and courteous to the students. The food options are always outstanding and everyone gets a bit of everything.  Also, we have place called Seymours.  This place holds Chick-Fil-A and Subway.  These places are good but the students would like way more food options.  Also we have Einstein's Bagels and Sandwiches located in the International Center.  This place is good because it holds delicious fresh and healthy food.  The only thing that is unacceptable is that as long as you live on campus you are required to have a meal plan.  And the meal plan is too expensive for the little you receive.  For example, I have the Golden Eagle Pass which is unlimited meals to Fresh Food Cafeteria and Hillcrest and $75 bonus bucks.  This meal plan is $1385!! That is outrageous because we do not great options in the Fresh and Hillcrest is only opened at certain times in the day. Overall, the dining options greatly need to be improved on campus."
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is CRAZY! There is very little parking space. If you don't find a dorm that has a parking lot by it, then you will have a hard time finding a spot. The bad thing is when it rains, IT RAINS, and it makes it hard to get around campus on foot. The parking garage is almost always full and parking spots beside other dorms have only a limited amount of spaces. It's terrible."
College Freshman,1,There are more faculty parking spots than students! Extremely hard to find a park and the parking garage is far away from the freshman quad.
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking on campus was crazy. I would make sure I leave 10-15 minutes early to park. Be careful of the different areas to park to avoid tickets or getting your car towed. Permit costs at one time were $50 and then $135 due to building a new parking garage.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking sucks. It has not caught up with the new residence halls and the push for raised enrollment. It costs $135 for a permit, and if you park outside of your allowed areas, they will ticket you. Parking management prowls looking for opportunities to write tickets. Fortunately, the campus is very walkable or I'd spend most of my time looking for a parking spot."
College Junior,1,"The Parking Lot Is a Pond – I attend classes on the Gulf Coast campus. I believe we Gulf Coast students have been more than patient with the progress, or lack thereof, in rebuilding our campus after it was ravaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.  There is a huge issue with parking, however, that has caused my patience to be worn a little thin. Every time it rains, we may as well all be wearing what we Coastal Mississippians refer to as ""Back Bay Reeboks"" (rubber boots.) I have literally gone and purchased a pair that I leave in my car, just for the purposes of wading across the parking lot to get to my classes when it rains."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Campus Rules Are Enforced – Southern Miss's Campus Police Department expect all students to obey the rules on campus.  When those rules are broken, the CPD simply do what they are trained to do: enforce the rules, punish the offenders according to the degree of trouble they have cause and discourage others from breaking any more rules.  Some of the punishments implemented to offenders are warning letters sent to the offenders' parents/legal guardians, suspension from school, loss of housing and/or financial aid, and expulsion from the school.  I do not condone the misuse and abuse of alcoholic beverages, but if people want to drink, they should do it off campus, and if they plan to return to campus on the night or day they choose to drink, they should avoid becoming inebriated or avoiding going back on campus until their drunken state ends.  The University of Southern Mississippi works hard to maintain a positive image in education and will not tolerate the negative actions of those who disregard the rules designed to maintain order on and around campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There are more students than parking spots available.  A new garage has been built, but I was informed that it was paid parking."
College Senior,1,"The financial aid office is always slow at updating information. I was finally awarded aid for the 2012 spring semester THREE months after the semester had started and one month before the semester was to end. This was no help to me because the university required that I pay the full cost of my tuition a few weeks after classes began in January. I ended up declining the loan because I had already paid out of pocket. Word of advice, apply early and stay on top of your applications even if the university does not contact you."
College Senior,1,The parking lots on campus are all located far away from any of the academic buildings. Faculty and staff all have the best parking (which is understandable) but it would be of great help to us students if they alloted a few rows of parking only for commuters. Come prepared to walk long distances or invest in a bicycle to get you across campus.
Recent Alumnus,1,The parking is terrible even though we have a huge garage. They leave all the good spaces for faculty and staff. I usually have to walk a mile to and from class everyday. Therefore I have to time my classes thirty minutes before they even start.
College Sophomore,1,"There are no real transportation options at Southern Miss. The only thing keeping this from an F is the fact that after 10:00 P.M., the University Police will pick you up from anywhere on campus and take you anywhere on campus. There are no buses, no shuttles, no anything."
College Senior,1,It used to be fun but it has gotten so lame. We don't really have a lot of options and its gotten dangerous lately.
College Freshman,1,The parking on campus is mostly for the faculty and staff.
College Freshman,1,Punishments Are Too Serious – Police can be very strict about a group of people being together having fun at night. I could see if we all were acting like fools and out of behavior but we are teenagers in college let us have some fun at least instead of having us feeling like we are in a jail house.
College Freshman,1,"This Place is terrible – This place is miserable. Buildings are old. Professors aren't worried about the students. Greek like is good, but the school is basically against it. Student body doesn't care about it's teams and only go to games that are suppose to be ""big"" games. The dorms are super strict. The night life is crowded crappy and little. There isn't much to do in Hattiesburg. I would definitely go to Ole Miss or Mississippi State before coming here. "
College Senior,1,There are more faculty and staff parking spaces than there are for students and commuter spaces are slowly disappearing and being relplaced with resident parking.

Graduate Student,5,"I went to SGSC for two years and earned an Associates degree in English. The staff was very helpful and the students were friendly. The (Waycross) campus is very small, though its beautiful with all of the pine trees."
Niche User,5,"Amazing school, amazing teachers, amazing student body. The classes are taught in a way that allows every student the chance to excel. The campus is always looking so fresh and clean. And the student body is so uplifting and welcoming to everyone."
Niche User,5,I loved it's small easy to navigate environment. It's perfect for a dual enrollment high school student.
Senior,5,South Georgia State College is wonderful. You can choose to attend any of the campuses if you are in the certain mile radius of that school. I commute to the campus so I do not have the expense of living on campus. It is originally a two year school but that have added great bachelor programs and I am currently enrolled in the business program and I love it.
Niche User,5,"I enjoyed my entire experience at SGSC; the faculty were extremely kind and helpful! ALthough the college is only a two year school, it have various four year programs, such as nursing and biology; I would highly recommend this school if you're local and not looking to get bogged down in student debt."
Junior,5,"The classes are small and the Instructors are very flexible and understanding. Since I stay three hours from the school, I live in student housing. I love that in student house everyone has their own room and only share an living area with someone else. I will also mention that since the campus is in a small city, there is not a lot of bars or party scenes that are near by."
Sophomore,5,South Georgia State College Is a great place to Earn a quality education. Throughout my freshman year the faculty is very friendly and caring. Also the class to teacher ratio is small. Also I joined a Honor Society which is very involved with the campus. There are many clubs for each type of person.
Freshman,5,Everyone has been so kind and helpful. The advisor are amazing people and wants to see you succeed. The Stem lab worker's are very helpful. English lab and tudors are very helpful when you are in trouble with work.
Sophomore,5,This two year school is where I wish I could stay for 4 years. For me I am able to swim for two years and get the best of both worlds as an athlete before I head to a different school to finish my academic career as a teacher.
Sophomore,5,"I love that South Georgia College was able to work with my while I was still in high school allowing me to acquire my high school diploma and Associate Degree in Early Education at the same time. They were very easy to work with and provided counselors that helped me every step of the way. The professors were welcoming to me even though, I was younger than their usual students. I would highly recommend South Georgia College to anyone."
Sophomore,5,"This is an awesome college with great instructors! The atmosphere, students, and campus are full of Southern hospitality and Charm! I would recomend this college to anyone looking for a great school with great people!"
Junior,5,I am enjoying my time at South Georgia College (now South Georgia State College). I have enjoyed every instructor I have had. The school has several clubs and organizations that I enjoy being a part of.
College Sophomore,5,"I have only attended South Georgia State College in Douglas for only one semester, but my instructors were all excellent at their jobs. They were all very knowledgable about the material and were above average on helping students."
College Sophomore,5,I have attended South Georgia State College in Douglas for one semester and have really enjoyed it. I have had amazing teachers who care about their students and are willing to help students. One thing that has annoyed me is that the library is the only place I have been able to find with a hole puncher.
College Freshman,5,"They are really good at offering a number of different classes with different professors. Although, it's fairly difficult to get any help on your schedule, it's not difficult to figure it out on your own."
College Freshman,5,There is a very wide variety of classes with different teachers at different times.

College Senior,5,The online classes I have had were structured nicely. The professors answered questions in a timely manner. Online classes are VERY limited and I wish they could offer more.
College Senior,5,There is a surprisingly diverse student body. I have made many friends and I believe anyone who comes here could adjust easily.
College Senior,5,The STEM center is helpful.
College Sophomore,5,So far I have not had any problems with finding classes to fit into my schedule .
College Sophomore,5,The tuition is not that bad but it is expensive for somebody like myself who doesn't have much money. Financial Aid office is very helpful by always giving step by step instructions to everything.
College Sophomore,5,My overrall experience has been amazing so far; for the first time ever I have never struggle to not want to go to class I find myself to be much ready to go to class and learn.
College Sophomore,5,"My college offers great resources that can be beneficial to its students , while making it and enjoyable time. One resource it offers that i found to be great is the availability to receive cheap but good medical attention for its students on campus."
College Sophomore,5,I enjoy my schools internet system it always works fine and is very fast and dependable. 
College Sophomore,5,"My major will be in Biology, so far the biology program seems to be good and the class rooms have all the tools that it needs, and work space that one needs to do lab work and study."
College Sophomore,5,"Overrall my experience so far has been great. The professors are very friendly , helpful, and easy to talk to. The school its self offers  great programs to help their students succeed."

College Sophomore,5,The college i attend has a very helpful program that offers free tutoring to students in all subjects. 
College Senior,5,"The computer network is great. There are computer labs in every building and in the library. You can print from any computer and go to a WEPA station and get the print file by a release code, log in, or by a usb. It is a very convenient way of being able to print something out because all you have to do is pull it up on a computer and print it or plug in your usb and print the file."
College Junior,5,It is a tough school but the professors really reach out and help you if you need extra help and the classes aren't overwhelming.
College Sophomore,5,"Decent workload, fairly easy if motivated to study"
Recent Alumnus,5,"Around the campus there are several computer labs, as well thirty plus computers in the library, and wireless throughout for your personal computers. They run on the WEPA print systems - this does cost money, but included in tuition is a twenty dollar or 200 page credit - which is often not used up. A bonus with WEPA is a student can upload a file from home, and print it next day from campus. If you upload something but decide not to print, you are not charged. The computers are free to use, and easy to access. Wireless may get a little bogged down in high-traffic buildings, but the computers themselves are updated and fast."
College Junior,5,The school does a very good job at informing their students about upcoming events. They also are very helpful in creating ones schedule. Teachers are there to help you when needed and the campus has many tutoring sessions for those in need.
College Junior,5,I'm a math major and all my classes are going great.
College Junior,5,All the professors are wonderful at SGC. They work with you and really care about you passing.
College Junior,5,"The education I am getting is well worth the money because one day I will be able to support a family. I have little financial aid, so I need all I can get. I would just like to be able to pay for school myself to help my parents out cause I have other siblings."
College Junior,5,"Everything offered to us on campus is designed by us, for us. This school has our best interest at heart. The libraries, athletic centers, student centers, etc. are all designed to better suite the students here."
College Sophomore,5,The computer network at Waycross College is great. Although the library can be pretty full around final exams there usually is always a free computer available. They also offer private study rooms to take tests or to have group study sessions. The internet connection is fast and reliable and the technical staff is very helpful.
College Sophomore,5,"Different Clubs/Organizations – Campus life can be boring, exciting, etc. There are many different clubs and organizations that are offered on and off campus. All you have to do is find your interest and join! So many great opportunities!"
College Student,5,"Locked Onto Larger Campus – This school campus is located on VSU campus in Valdosta.  It is designed to assist in transferring to VSU and allows access to all resources on VSU campus.  The wireless network can be a pain to log onto, but fast once on.  Printing is easy, and many printers are available throughout campus and computer labs.  I do use laptop, but many people solely use the campus computers in one of several labs or library."
College Junior,5,The education Im recieving from South Georgia College is worth the tuition I paid for. The financial aid office Staff are very frendly individuals and on't mind helping students wih financial aid or etc. they are pretty straight forward with you and are willing to meet with you at anytime. my financial aid progress wasn't a hassale.
College Junior,5,Computer Excellency – The school provides each dorm with a study room and computer labs. In the computer labs they have computers that are always available to students and printing access. The internet speed is fast and if you have your own laptop the wireless access is also great.
College Junior,5,"My a+ Review – The Student center is very eventful because you have fool, ping pong tables, and programs held here. The Library is a nice size you have alots of books and computers that are always open to students. The Libary also have events held there that are very pleasant for students. The overall campus life is because South Georgia College try hard to meet their students need and takes suggestion on what kind of programs to hold and which ones students are interested in the most."
College Senior,5,"Online Is Awesome! Since attending South Georgia College I have only taken one online class. The book was and online interface which was really cool, and it also included videos from our instructor. Taking the online class allowed me to have time for work, If I needed help I could e-mail my instructor or my peers at any time."
College Senior,5,I Loved It – My experiences with online classes has been great butI did not think that would be the case. I think I excelled in my online courses because everything is more organized and the course do not change. I know what to expect and I am given enough time to complete all of my assingments and not to mention the fact that online class allows me to take more classes than I normally would.
College Senior,5,The Staff – The falcuty is passionate about our success and they go above and beyond their call of duty. Some of them offer free tudoring at times they should be home with their families and they are happy to do so.
College Senior,5,"Don't Procrastinate – If you wait until the last minute you will not do well, but they are really accommodating and helpful. But at the moment we do not have enough money to afford online classes. I loved them though, and I have made lifelong friends because of our discussions online!"
College Senior,5,"Tuition Isn't So Bad! The tuition here at Waycross College really isn't bad. We are a two year college so the fees are low. I've never spent more that $1,700 for tuition and fees here at Waycross College for any one semester. As far as Financial Aid, they like at any college, are intimidating but efficient."
College Freshman,5,"I am currently in the South Georgia College entry Program at Valdosta State University. Here, we have a tremendous variety of diversity coming from all over. With that being said, VSU has many different types of churches and religous events that take place."
College Junior,5,"Where Success Starts – I really like this school. I already finished a semester and it went smooth, but best of all I passed all my classes. This school has alot of variety of clubs to get involved and meet new people. What I like best is that the campus is peaceful and you can even get to sit outside to study or enjoy a book without alot of distraction. South Georgia College has an amazinf staff and teachers would always be there to help. If I had won a full scholarship to any school, I would definitely choose this school, because this is where success starts."
College Freshman,5,"School Studeny Body – A lot of the students that attend my school were not able to pass the act/sat or are riends with someone that attends the school and did it strictly for the relationship. My school is very diverse and it does not have a lot of students because it is an entry program. This year, the school population has increased drastically."
College Freshman,5,"School Major – My school is an entry program, so we do not claim a major. We are considered Basic studies and nothing more."
Graduate Student,4,"My experience with online learning has been pretty bland. Its easily accessible if you have reliable internet. Though, it comes with its own challenges."
Sophomore,4,"My experience with South Georgia has been wonderful with the teachers well, some teachers that take the time to think that the student also have other classes so their not going to over load the student with work. The dorms are so nice you have your own room so that’s a plus. The people that you have to contact about things like financial aid, registering for classes and things like that are nice as well. The police department does their job of course. Overall it’s a nice school just to get your work done the area doesn’t have too much going on or too less. I would recommend this school to anyone."
Freshman,4,It’s a really small and close knit college. It’s basically highschool but living on campus. I love my classes and the teachers and it’s so easy to make friends. The campus is small so it’s not a lot of walking and everything is in a close distance
Freshman,4,"My favorite part about this place is that it is small so there is a great opportunity to get individual help and meet other students. They have many programs for students that need extra help also. The classrooms are always clean and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Classes are fun and interesting, along with the many activities that the college puts on every semester for the students to enjoy."
Freshman,4,I am enjoying my entire experience at SGSC; everyone here are enjoyable and obliging!  I would highly recommend this school if you're local and not looking to get stuck in student debt.  It’s a substantial college to start out at because of it’s small campus and low tuition. The classes are small so you can focus more and actually get a better understanding from the professor.
Freshman,4,"Admissions was a mess, but the school is very good overall. It’s a great college to start out at because of it’s small campus and lower prices."
Junior,4,"Some great faculty and some that are just there for a paycheck.  I am currently in the nursing program and so far it has been a great experience, I just wish the simulation lab was updated."
Freshman,4,It’s a very good school I recommend it to any one out there looking for a 2 year college to go to. This school provides you with thing you need like paid for tutors and a stem center which helps you with your classes. The teachers are good as well you activities to do on campus that are fun like a Game Center that’s on campus and I actually work there as a work study student and you can do the same
Freshman,4,"I love the school. The only part they need to work on is informing students which papers and processes when they get started. They should have some way of explaining everything that needs to be done because anyone new to college has no idea about all the different things they have going on. Otherwise, the school has great schedules, financial options, professors, and staff. They will work with you. Great school!"
Sophomore,4,I like the scene of the college it's located near slot of stores which represent opportunities to get a job. And they have a lot of student activities. But me being a football player it upseted me that they have every sport besides football.
Freshman,4,"On my first day of classes, I was just like any other ""new"" or ""transfer"" student; scared, lost. Its safe to say, I  felt like a ""fish out of water"". I didn't know anyone. This was hard for me because, my whole life I attending school where everyone knew everyone, perks of living in a small town your whole life. After attending classes each day, I started to make friends and get to know the professors. Things weren't so bad anymore, and I began to realize that Waycross College wasn't as big as I made it out to be, it was just bigger than where I came from. I started to enjoy school, and for the most part it's a great college. Overtime, I would like to see Waycross College expand and offer a more variety of classes and degrees. I believe this would be both beneficial for not only the students but the school itself."
Niche User,4,"The advisers, teachers, and staff were always helpful. Teachers made themselves available to you whenever you needed additional help."
College Sophomore,4,"From my experience during classes in the one semester I have attended at South Georgia State College, the instructors I had all had excellent teaching styles. During all my classes, the instructors lectured and students took notes. Some of my instructors used PowerPoint presentations, one even gave you incomplete copies of the presentations. Another instructor did not use anything but the whiteboard and a marker, using the marker only to write short words or phrases and you had to write what he talked about."
College Sophomore,4,"In my one semester at South Georgia State College, I did not have a lot of problem signing up for classes. However, classes fill up very fast, so students need to make sure to register for classes at 12:00 AM the day registration starts."
College Sophomore,4,"While everything doesn't always run perfectly here, there is almost always somebody willing to help or at least point you in the right direction."
College Sophomore,4,"For me, the process of scheduling classes was a breeze. The only problems I have heard about were a few athletes who had a very specific class for their major that was only offered during their practice time, but coaches always accommodate the classes and there is never too much trouble. Besides those few guys (3-4 out of the whole school), it's a very simple and smooth process."
College Sophomore,4,"Being a junior college, the degree itself may not be what gets you a six-figure job within months, but if you keep your expectations realistic it can still be very valuable. Everybody here who really wants to transfer to a 4-year school will get there. The degree itself may not be what catapults you into success, but it will open all the doors you need to get to where you're going."
College Sophomore,4,"Pretty much everyone here finds their ""group"" pretty quickly. Whether that's a sports team, classmates, student organizations or just strangers that become friends, everybody is accepted and has no trouble making friends if they want to. Making friends here is a real life example of ""what you put in, you get out""."
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the classes aren't necessarily a lot of work, because they are taught by different coaches from the school. That isn't to say that they don't take the class seriously though. You just won't have a lot of homework or out of class assignments because they have another job to do. When you take your tests though, you will realize that you are still expected to learn."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm a student athlete, and so coming in I had a group of friends almost built in. Since it is such a small school though, you get familiar with people that are both athletes and non-athletes. If you aren't afraid to go talk to people, you will find that even if they aren't your ""crowd"" they are nice and sociable until you really do find you place here."
College Freshman,4,"There are a few teachers who have a very unusual way of teaching, but other than that, most of my professors have been amazing!"
College Freshman,4,The campus always has something to offer students. Usually at least once a week. They're really big on athletics and they strongly encourage our Academic Support Center.
College Senior,4,It's really good because in some cases I couldn't attent my class but the professor would allow me to make it up by attending the same class at a different time.
College Senior,4,I loved my time here. I thought I wouldn't but every one is really nice and always willing to help.
College Senior,4,I loved most of my professors. Some of them have very peculiar ways of teahing that make it very fun to learn.
College Senior,4,I value my degree from this school very much. I feel like I will be able to succeed with it. I know I learned a lot and will do good in a job.
College Senior,4,The financial aid process is al fairly easy. Most of it just requires to complete FAFSA. Once you have don this you just need to wait to see what your award is.
College Senior,4,The proffesors are very nice and don't leave much homework. We have occasional quizes and essays to read but it isn't very stressfull.
College Senior,4,The weight room could be better and the treadmills could be fixed because none of them work... Other than that the library is amazing and the librarians very nice.
College Freshman,4,its an easy workload because you can pick your on classes
College Freshman,4,i get my refund every two monthes its the best my books are paid for
College Freshman,4,they treat you like family
College Freshman,4,I love the small town atmosphere as well as all the memories I have made here. I have enjoyed my classes and I have learned so much
College Freshman,4,"I feel the value of education I am receiving is worth the money I have paid. I am getting so much out of my degree. As long as I turn everything in by the deadlines, I havent had any trouble with financial aid"
College Freshman,4,"Campus life is very unique. Since it is such a small town and not very many people live here, everyone is very close"
College Freshman,4,I haven't  taken any online courses but I have heard great things
College Freshman,4,I'm not quite sure if there is a career center at South Georgia State College. But you are offered great opportunities to further your career choices
College Freshman,4,I feel like South Georgia State College has a unique as well as diverse student body
College Freshman,4,I haven't had any problems with the computer network
College Freshman,4,South Georgia State College does have a nice athletic building and also a nice pool.
College Sophomore,4,I have had a very easy time with financial aid.  The financial aid officers are very knowledgeable and helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school.  It has been a very enjoyable experience. Being and older student I was worried about being out of place. But, this school is very diverse in it students."
College Sophomore,4,"Many of the clinical sites that the college uses for the nursing program, hires new graduate nurses from the program."
College Sophomore,4,"I am an older student and had a lot of older credits. The school made transferring everything easy.  Also, when a class filled up quickly and there was a high demand they opened up another class to accommodate  the need."
College Sophomore,4,The curriculum if very broad. The professors are very knowledgeable. They make learning fun and they try very hard to be available to help if you are having problems. There are many programs set up to help tutor students that are struggling.
College Sophomore,4,I am a nursing major. The pre-nursing program is set up so there is no problem getting your core classes out of the way. The selection for the nursing program is very fair.
College Sophomore,4,"With the smaller campus, it is very easy to go from one class to another.  It has lovely benches, where you can sit down and enjoy a beautiful day.  The labs for science classes are small so you get plenty of one on one attention."
College Sophomore,4,The campus has many amenities.  The library is a great place with very helpful staff.  The school has many activities during the year for the students to enjoy.
College Senior,4,Being a nursing student at SGSC has it's ups and downs. The curriculum is challenging but it is neccessary. Most of the professors are willing to help since it is the only 4 year degree at the time but some frown upon the major for whatever reason and seem to make things slightly more difficult if they know that is your major.
College Senior,4,Registration is simple. Class options are limited and fill up quickly. Most professors are helpful. The STEM center is a lot of help for math and sciences.
College Senior,4,I get frustrated with the financial aid office because they rarely answer the phone when you try to reach them. I know they are busy at certain times of the semester but it seems as though they should add extra help at that time. If you are going to the financial aid office be sure to bring every paper you have ever filled out in your life because they will need it. They are helpfull in the Fin Aid office but it normally takes multiple trips to get them what they need.
College Senior,4,"Printing is easy but you have to have money on your ID to print. Some buildings have nice computer labs while others, such as the research center only have 3 computers. The wifi is reliable."
College Senior,4,We do a lot of campus actives which the students really like
College Senior,4,There are a lot of great resources on the campus and you should really utilize them and get your moneys worth
College Senior,4,"Ive had a great time at the school, there has been confusions in some of my credits that are keeping me from gradating when im suppose to but other than that its fine."
College Senior,4,I started talking a online course but dropped it because I didn't like the subject. They way the school administers online courses is fine though.
College Senior,4,The financial aid office use to be great it still is although most stuff happens on the Douglas campus instead of the Waycross campus now which makes things a little more difficult
College Senior,4,The teachers are good you just need to know how to learn by their teaching methods or teach yourself a different way
College Sophomore,4,The student at my college are very dedicated and have been recognized by many professors as being a good group of students who do not miss many days and always shows up to class on time.
College Senior,4,"The education I am receiving is more than worth the amount of money I pay for tuition. As long as you put in all the paper work in on time, the financial aid process is mostly painless."
Graduate Student,2,Small school which I like but doesn't have the best faculty. Was very hard finding adviser to set up classes and some teachers were not very good.
Alum,2,South Georgia State College is a pretty good school. I was satisfied with my time spent there which was a total of three semesters in which i completed my degree.
College Sophomore,2,"The front office is getting a lot better about transferring paperwork for you, but you can forget trying to get anything done over the phone or online. You MUST go see the folks in person."
College Sophomore,2,The online classes at SGSC are awful. I transferred to another college to get some of my classes knocked out because SGSC's online availability was terrible.
College Sophomore,2,"Every so often, SGSC has a job fair, but most of the students at SGSC are not willing to work."
College Freshman,2,The student body is too excluded within itself and the college really doesn't enforce diversity.
College Freshman,2,"The athletic center is nothing impressive, there are hardly any campus activities, and the student center is the only thing keeping me entertained in that small town."
College Freshman,2,I hardly no anyone at my school.
College Senior,2,I'm an engineering major. They do not offer engineering classes here so I have to get a degree in mathematics first.
College Senior,2,It is very difficult to finally get all the financial aid requirements done. The office staff is not always helpful and they do not bother to go out of their way to help any student who needs assistance.
College Junior,2,"Personal Laptops Are of No Use – Network access is great as long as you are in the library or their computer lab.  I have problems if I decide to take my laptop with me to school unless I have my Verizon card, because you can't log into their network."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus has a small town feel to it, its very small and serves its purpose. The gym is adequate size, as well as the library. Campus Activities, which bring the entire community together, could be drastically changed and upgraded so more people could participate."
College Student,2,Campus Life – We are in college not back at a boarding school. They are super strict with rules in the dorms between guys and girls and visitors.
College Sophomore,2,"As far as small colleges go, SGC would definitely not be my first choice if i could do it again. The professors are enjoyable, but the administration is unusual. They pretend to listen and take interest in your concerns, but everything goes in one ear and out the other. Majority of the students are rowdy and participate in illegal activities. Rooms are always being searched by dogs and police officers. 

Overall, I guess it was an experience I had to go through to better pick out my college choices. I would definitely not recommend South Georgia College to any of my peers."
College Freshman,1,"There is nothing unique about my school, other than the amount of pinecones here are ridiculous."
College Freshman,1,Rudeness and time of service is horrible. Needs major improvement.
College Sophomore,1,"Haven't Graduated.. I haven't graduated yet, but from people I know who have they just transferred. The school didn't offer any help, besides the standard transfer information."
College Sophomore,1,"I've only taken one online class at South Georgia so I don't have a fair opinion of the online learning system as a whole. However, from the one class I did take, I wouldn't recommend it. Our teacher set up a web cam chat with each of us at the beginning of the semester and that was the last we heard from him until he gave 2 assignments at the end of the semester."
College Sophomore,1,"The typical student, that lived on campus, was an idiotic, pothead. The students didn't really care much for classes or even receiving an education period. The main focus for students was where to get their next high. The students love to drink, smoke and party all the time."

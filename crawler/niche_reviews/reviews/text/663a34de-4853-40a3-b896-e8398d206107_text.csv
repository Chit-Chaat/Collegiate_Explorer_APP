Junior,5,The online learning experience was just the same as on campus! Teachers are quick to answer any questions you have through email and lectures are given easily through the website and PowerPoints.
Junior,5,I absolutely love this college! Great campus that feels like home. Teachers are able to get on a personal level with their students because of the small campus! Great students too! Education is superior!
Freshman,5,"So far, I have enjoyed my time at Baptist College of Florida so much. I have learned a lot, not only about music and basic fundamentals of education, but also about myself. I have loved every minute!"
Junior,5,good place of fellowship and a good place to get an education for teachers and even pastors and youth pastors.
Niche User,5,"Faculty and students are friendly, the college is small and spread out, and chapel service is great!"
Freshman,5,"The Baptist College of Florida is great school. If you leave your home town  to come live on campus, you would never want to go back because the staff make you feel like they are your family and the professors are wonderful . with that being said, everyone know each other because they care for the students."
Graduate Student,5,"It is absolutely amazing how a small campus school plays a magnificent role in your life. I had some of the most dedicated professors and compassionate school faculty. It is a Christian college, so I loved that the people there were quick to pray for me. Instead of falling into the statistics of not finishing school, I had a tremendous amount of support!"
Junior,5,The small class sizes are great because the professors have time for you! You're able to get with them if you have questions and they can help you with one-on-one consultations.
Senior,5,"I have acquired a solid and dependable education from professors who are gracious, helpful and understanding. I have learned course knowledge, as well as gaining life experience."
Senior,5,"I enjoy The Baptist College of Florida so much! But what really draws me to be here, is the fact that it's not a huge college. It's a small, chill environment, and a place where I can actually get to know everyone. Attending a small college is not a bad thing! The staff and students here are wonderful! I can honestly say I'm blessed to be at BCF and would not rather graduate from any other college."
Alum,5,I loved The Baptist College of Florida. The professors all really care about the students and the small school environment really allows students to become family.
Freshman,5,The Baptist college of Florida is an amazing school! Everyone wants to see you succeed and the experience of attending BCF is so great because it is like a big family.
College Sophomore,5,We do not have Greek life - thank the Lord!!
College Freshman,5,"This isn't the time or place to get into an argument on the meaning of diversity. What the Bible speaks clearly on as far as moral standards before God leave every one of us as sinners without hope. But, there good news is that Jesus Christ pays the penalty for sin and it is up to us to listen to and abide by His Word. If a student is a different race, that is not a sin, they were created by God and are made in His image. You won't find a problem at BCF. If you are from a low economic background, join the club. But those who are of a better economic standing do not belittle others. In fact, they see their economic position as an opportunity to bless others. If you have specific political beliefs, you will find someone from each political party here. There are more republicans/conservatives. In order to get into BCF, one must profess Christ as their savior, and so there aren't other religions that are found on campus. But one thing does hold true about BCF, if you walk onto campus and believe differently than we do, we aren't going to spew hate at you. It is our belief that salvation is available to all who believe on the name of Jesus. Our job is to simply show the love of Christ to everyone."
College Freshman,5,Drugs are not tolerated. Students found with drugs are either dismissed from the school or placed on probation and sent to rehab.
College Freshman,5,"Our professors are top of the line. The courses offered address the degree programs effectively. Classroom sizes may reach 60 or more in a room during your freshman and sophomore year. After that, upper-level courses rarely get above 20 students in a room. By the time of graduation, I was fully prepared to move forward in my degree field. I have attained a job working in that field and am now pursuing a Master of Arts at BCF to increase the effectiveness of my resume."
College Freshman,5,"What do you expect in a college dorm? I've stayed in a few selections of them across the United States for various reasons and they are not supposed to be a hotel. Your dorm is what you make of it. It can either become home because you have decided it is where you want to stay, or it can be an utter disappointment because it isn't where you want to be. For the price paid on the dorms, weekday meals are paid for. There isn't an immediate access to a stove and the rules do not allow for open heat sources. However, I get that. BCF doesn't want to pay the price for some brainless student to leave a hot plate on and burn down the building. If you find yourself in the need to grill, there are two charcoal grill stations next to Lake Albert. If you have been subscribed to Pinterest for very long, you know all of the meals that can be made in a microwave. The students, faculty and staff create a family atmosphere. Accept that you will be accepted or make the choice to hold up in your dorm. The Campus Housing experience is yours to make."
College Freshman,5,"When I first applied and attending in 2009, I had never heard of BCF. Now, I couldn't imagine how it was kept so quite within the Christian communities of Florida. I highly recommend this institution to any student desiring to receive a college education that places the highest priority on the Word of God. Sure, there are times when BCF will not meet certain desires or expectations, but when it comes to academic training of Christian leaders, this school can not be beat. As far as I am concerned, that is the job of BCF and they do it to the highest level...everything else is just a bonus."
Recent Alumnus,5,"College dorms usually need regular maintenance and repairs while off-campus housing are generally in better living conditions. They are a lot cheaper due to low-income housing options and because they are in such a small town, they are safe locations, within a 5-10 minute walk to the college campus. I would recommend after applying to the college to also apply to the off-campus housing --the waiting lists are long (a lot of college students apply) sometimes taking up 3-6 months to wait for an opening. While it can isolate you from on-campus events, its very nice to have your own independent space."
College Senior,5,The campus is very strict but it is in place to keep a Christian atmosphere.
Alum,4,"My time at BCF was a lot of fun but more importantly it helped shape my faith in God! The campus is very small so it’s easy to get to know everyone and feels a lot like family. The professors care about students and take time to answer questions and get to know their students. BCF quickly began to feel a lot like home. There’s some beautiful scenery surrounding the college including a lake. There’s a great gym facility and while no actual sports teams, plenty of intramural sports to keep active students entertained. Cafeteria food is not the best but also definitely not the worst. There are always several options for food which is nice. Overall I would choose to go to BCF again if given the chance to do it over!"
College Sophomore,4,"I do feel very safe on campus. Recently though, there have been several car break-ins."
College Sophomore,4,My overall experience at school so far has been great. The teachers are wonderful and I love the small town feeling.
College Freshman,4,"Whether a student is working toward a BA in music, psychology, education, ministry or business, there are a great number of internships available while a student at BCF. Do those internships take work? Yes. Are employers begging the school to send every student available? Only the church staff positions. Even with this fact, many students will never provide their resume to BCF. In our Education department, I have seen one alumnus after another get jobs within a public or private school system. Because our Teacher Education Program is State Approved, students now have an even easier time finding a job because they can teach out of state right away. Our psychology students are placed within an internship program before they graduate and are expected to write a paper based on that program. Our business students have gone into corporate fields, worked for non-profits, and many continue their schooling in fields such as law."
College Freshman,4,"We were recently rated as the third safest college in Florida. When walking around campus or around town, there is a very high sense of safety within the newer management of the Graceville Police Department. Our Campus Safety Office patrols the campus but must call on the Graceville Police during an issue. Campus Safety ensures that doors are locked and that there are no shady characters or cars on campus."
College Freshman,4,"Considering the amount of funding that goes into our athletic program, as well as the belief of the institution that academics should come first, the quality of the athletic facilities is expected. These facilities aren't designed to attract athletic stars because there are no scholarships or varsity teams. We have a simple intramural program that provides students with the opportunity to participate. We have a gymnasium that allows for indoor basketball, volleyball and racquetball. In the gym there is a walking track, weight room, pool table and ping-pong table. Students can compete in fencing classes as well as a chance for female students to take part in a zumba-type dance class. As far as students that enjoy running or biking, our remote location offers students the ability to run or bike within a safe community."
College Freshman,4,I would choose it. The faculty and staff really want to see you succeed and the will go above and beyond to help you learn the material.
College Junior,4,"So far, my college experience has been great! BCF is a unique place to be and I am grateful for the privilege of being a student here. At BCF, your professors do not merely teach the required material because it is their job; the professors go above and beyond to make sure that you are receiving the highest quality of education possible because they truly care for each individual student. The faculty here puts God first in educating young Christians to ""Change the world through the unchanging Word"". That is why I love being a student here."
College Sophomore,4,Living on campus is really amazing.
College Senior,4,All professors are different but will help in any way possible.
College Senior,4,The beauty of the campus and also the generosity that constantly flows.
College Senior,4,"Extremely diverse in background, economic, and ethnicity."
College Senior,4,I am in an internship now and it is great. The college and church have collaborated a great experience.
College Senior,4,Everyone here at this school should have one goal in which is to better themselves for the ministry they have been called.
College Senior,4,"There is always an activity to be involved in. It may be Bible study, sports, or study group but there is always something to help better yourself."
Recent Alumnus,4,Most of the teachers are helpful if you are struggling.
Recent Alumnus,4,"They wont let just anyone in! They require you to come in with good grades, take a pre-qualifying test, ect."
College Sophomore,4,"The BCF financial aid office is always willing to help anyone who wants to attend the school. Lack of funds often is not a problem for potential students, as the staff does whatever they can to help students find scholarships or loans that they need."
College Sophomore,4,"I attend a Baptist Christian college, so it's pretty obvious that the school would have strict policies against drinking and such. Sometimes these rules are broken, but I and most other students agree with these policies and have no problem adhering to them."
College Sophomore,4,"I believe my personal experience with safety on campus is an exception to the rule. In the past year, a student whom I was very close to committed acts of sexual assault on campus. This situation was handled very well by the staff, the student was dismissed from the school. My school has received awards for its high safety rank in our state. Though I have seen first hand that no place is completely safe, and there will always be bad people no matter where you go, I feel like BCF is generally quite a safe place."
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of people like to study in groups at the student center, which can be a great option sometimes, with plenty of people to keep you company and a snack shop right across the hall. Personally, I prefer to work in the library. The library has plenty of comfy chairs and tables, as well as the strongest wi-fi signal on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I love being in the music program at my school. The professors have been a great influence on my life in this past year, they have always done their best to help me learn and do the best that I can. The music building suits the needs of the program well enough, but is a long walk from the dorms. Also, the building has extremely thin walls, which makes working and practicing difficult sometimes when others practice too loudly."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus activities are great, from various intramural athletic programs to music groups to special competitions between dorms."
College Sophomore,4,"Living in the dorms has been a great experience for me. BCF is a very small school, so most everyone knows each other, it's like a huge family."
College Junior,4,"One of the great things at the Baptist College of Florida is the computer lab is always accessible and the computers are up-to date with great software and Microsoft Office accounts. BCF has a great emailing system through the use of Microsoft Outlook. If students need to print an essay, the computer lab has unlimited resources for students to print from, free of charge (but with a black and white printer only). BCF definitely cares about its student's needs for desktop computers. Personally, I recommend bringing your own laptop to class for ease of typing notes and doing assignments wherever, whenever; but that's my personal preference. Beware though, the wireless networking her is not always 100% efficient."
College Junior,4,"For students seeking ministry degrees, BCF is absolutely wonderful. Most of the professors have jobs in churches so it is a good way to learn. When someone graduates BCF they are ready to either work at a church, or go to seminary. If you are not called to work in a church, you might as well transfer schools."
College Sophomore,4,The weather is pretty good. It is Florida so it rains a lot sometimes and the campus floods a little sometimes. But overall very enjoyable.
College Freshman,4,The Baptist college of Florida is an amazing school. It has an amazing atmosphere with great fellowship between everyone. Although there can be tensions and drama at times but I would rather go here than any where else.
College Freshman,4,"The people at the school are of all sorts; short, tall, nerds, jocks, hefty, skinny. And each student has their own path and are from all over the country. You can find pretty much the perfect match."
College Freshman,4,So far I am very pleased with the education program. The teachers here are wonderful and are willing to help all the students.
College Freshman,4,"There are many different races at the Baptist College of Florida. The main religion is Baptist, because it is a Baptist college. Anybody is accepted and will be loved for who they are."
College Junior,4,"Pretty much all of the off-campus housing is government subsidized and is therefore very affordable!  It consists of apartments and duplexes.  They are not new, but are perfectly acceptable for your average college student."
College Junior,4,"Permit costs are reasonable and you won't get a ticket if you simply obey the rules. However, there is a need for more parking spaces. The campus is small enough to get around on a bike though, so if you don't have a car it's not going to kill you."
College Junior,4,"Domestic Life on Campus – The dorms on campus are very clean and comfortable. It's a small school, so we all know each other, and it's like living with one big family. The cost is very reasonable, and the atmosphere is very safe."
College Sophomore,4,"It's Super Safe! Being a small town, crime-rate is already at a small amount, but it is especially safe on the campus! There is always two guards circulating around campus, keep the students and faculty safe."
College Sophomore,4,"If you go to the Baptist College of Florida expecting a lively city, with tall buildings and bustling traffic, you're gonna be disappointed. There are no clubs, no theme parks, no movie theaters or any popular stores to hang out in. What BCF lacks in activity however, it makes up for in social activity! Without the distractions of city aspects, students at the school are better encouraged to get to know each other more, creating the chance to form stronger, longer-lasting relationships. It's the perfect school to make friends in, and in my opinion, that means a whole lot more than not having a spot to hang out."
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of White Baptists – The college definitely has a diverse atmosphere, but it is a Baptist college.  Therefore, all of the students profess Christ as their savior."
College Sophomore,4,"Genuine People. Being at a Christian college has been challenging to find my purpose and why I am honestly actually here. The experience that has been the most challenging is just adjusting to a smaller campus, but it means more of a time to bond. The school is unique because the people are just real. I wouldn't trade it over anything."
College Sophomore,4,"They Are Great. You will find all kinds of different guys at the Baptist college of Florida. There are skaters, punks, musicians, writers, you name it. Most people care about their looks here. Relationships are not worst but are not the best either."
College Sophomore,4,"They are not the best, but they are not the worst. The Internet could be faster sometimes, but it runs fine otherwise. They are easy to access though, because the labs only get crowded during midterms and finals."
College Sophomore,2,"Our athletic program at school is pretty bad. But...none of us came here to play sport, we came here for the ministry. Plus, there are several intramural sports offered."
College Sophomore,2,Small town. No buses to get around. Everything is old and outdated
College Junior,2,BCF actually just ended their varsity sports this past semester and the student body was very sad to see them go. However the students do participate in many intramural sports and are quite competitive and active when it comes to participating in them. The athletic facilities are adequate enough for our student body.
College Sophomore,2,"The Limitations of Graceville – The choices of places to eat in Graceville is very limited. So much so that the only chain restaurants that Graceville has is a Subway and a Hardees. The other restaurants are locally owned, but do not usually have set business hours. When it is opened, I like to drive to Tampicos. Tampicos is a family owned mexican restaurant and their food is delicious. There is, however, one restaurant that has set hours, and that is Super Canton. Super Canton is a Chinese restaurant and is always busy because it is the local's favorite. Though the places to eat are limited, the prices are very cheap which makes it easier on our broke college students."
Alum,1,"Absolutely horrible. This school should be shut down. I was scammed into taking out a max loan every year so I’d have “spending money” as my advisor put it. I’m now in massive debt and have been struggling to support my family ever since. This school took me in knowing full well there was no degree for my interest (children’s ministry). They assured me that a general degree would be enough. And it wasn’t...nobody would bring me on. This is after I graduated with honors and mostly A’s and a few B’s. Every time I applied for a job, I was told my degree wasn’t good enough. I totally got scammed by these people and they should be ashamed. - Colin, former student."
College Sophomore,1,There is not much to choose from in Graceville unless you go out of town.
College Junior,1,"Very few options in Graceville, but if you are willing to drive a little ways, Dothan has a much better variety.  There is even a Chick-Fil-a in Dothan!  The dining options in Graceville are very convenient and affordable though."
College Junior,1,"Very Little or Non-Existent – Flag football. and sometimes volley ball.
d- just becuase F sounds too harsh."
College Junior,1,"Mold, Mildew, and Spray Paint. Mold and Mildew runs rampant in all the dorms. ALL THE DORMS. schools way of fixing the problem? spray painting over it.
It costs more to live on campus than it does off campus, but you cannot live off campus and be a dependent.
Every dorm room has its own shower and usually two small closets.
Guys are not allowed in the girls dorms, period. and vise versa.
housing distance from the school greatly varies, depending on the dorm/off campus apartments."
College Junior,1,"Not Safe at All! People are nosy and get you in trouble over little things. Security is lax to non-existent. It can be very dangerous to be out at night, even on the campus. people have been robbed at knife point on streets that connect to the school. The so called hospital down the street is like an abandoned cvs and you are much better off driving the 30 minutes to walmart and bandaging yourself up then risking you life waiting for someone to come to the front desk. Teacher have offered to drive students to the hospital if they are ever seriously hurt. I feel very unsafe on campus and will even set my car alarm off when I have to walk to my car after the sunset. In some places the campus is overly bright at night and in others where lighting would make sense (like parking lots)it is almost pitch and hard to see. I have never seen nor heard of security walking young ladies to their cars at night or checking the areas around the parking lot or female dorms to make sure they are safe. some campus housing is placed so far away from the campus that students cars have been broken into and gas siphoned. most of said dorms are females dorms. they constantly complain about people driving by and shouting obscenities at them and security not coming by more often to keep a watch over the dorms."
College Junior,1,"Piece of Crap School. Theoretically this would be a great school. In practice, not so much.
Registration in a pain. They only offer certain courses on certain semesters and it can be hard to get the right classes, without conflicts, and enough total hours to stay a full time student. They tell you last minute what courses are available for the following semester.
Some of the professors care about their students while others do not. Some can teacher while other can not. If you need to catch up with a teacher after class to ask about an assignment or project it can be very difficult.
Some of the classes are very informative and have good discussions that help you learn more about what you are studying. Some are good subjects to study, but the teachers don't care or are so disorganized the the class becomes unbearable or are a complete waste of time.
Workload varies depending on what degree program you are in. Music and Music Education takes a lot of time and patience, and even then you may not pass or please your teachers. Theology and Missions takes a lot of memorizing and paper writing. I am not aware of the workload for psychology or elementary education students at this time.
For most students 18 credit hours is a decent course load, well below the suicide course load level. For anyone in any kind of Music Degree 18 credit hours is the equivalent of taking 21 credit hours because of extra demands and requirements that are put on those students and the practice hours they are expected to get."

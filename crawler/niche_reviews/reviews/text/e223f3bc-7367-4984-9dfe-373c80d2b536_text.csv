Sophomore,5,"Amazing staff. The advisors are extremely helpful, especially when it comes to active duty military students like myself."
Sophomore,5,"Amazing. Amazing staff. The advisors are extremely helpful, especially when it comes to active duty military students like myself. I enjoy my time I have spent there because I am able to work on my at my own pace."
Niche User,5,I showed up to the school unannounced just wanting to look around the school with my family since I am decided which school to attend next fall and ended up getting a personal 2 hour tour of the entire campus. The administrators and staff were nothing but helpful and kind.
Sophomore,5,"McMurry is a small private institution in Abilene, Texas. Every single professor that I've encountered so far in my short year and a half all have the same goals for you in mind. If you need anything at all they are always there to help whether it be for their class, if you're having a bad day or if there's something going on in your personal life that you just need to get out. The professors and counselors are extremely helpful and intuitive. The McMurry community is awesome and they are always doing good things for the community of Abilene. This University is perfect if you're looking for a small community of people your age, looking to make a change in your community, need help such as one on one with a professor to understand certain concepts, go at your own pace classes, and much more."
Freshman,5,"This is my first semester at MCM and from the beginning, I haven't felt so much love and support, from staff and faculty to the financial aid office and the teachers.  its been 12 years since I was in college and they got me in, got me set up and has been truly life changing... I'm so blessed to be back in college and I am so thankful I am part of MCM family. They are all truly the best"
Junior,5,McMurry is a small school and the professors and advisors really care about your success. They’ll help you through any problem you have and work closely with you until you succeed. They’ll also work with your other classes to make sure your stress with tests is minimized as much as possible. All in all McMurry is a great university.
Sophomore,5,My first year at McMurry was good.  The faculty and staff are very helpful and the campus is easy to get across. It was a excellent experience.
Sophomore,5,"Small school but has a big family environment, the faculty, staff and students really do care about this school. My time here has been nothing but positive."
Sophomore,5,I like that the campus felt as if I were at home. The students are nice and the community cares. One thing I would change is the student involvement.
Junior,5,"I love this college! great environment and student involvement.  The professors here care about their students and see student success as their own.  The classes are small and interpersonal, very well structured and set students up to succeed academically and personally.   The non teaching faculty are always available to help and very pleasant to deal with.  You are not just your tuition like i felt at a much larger college in South Carolina.  I am always made to feel like a priority and i wouldn't go anywhere else."
Niche User,5,"What I really liked about this university is that its really diverse, its academics is great, campus is great, students life and safety is great and everything is just perfect. The teachers are super nice and really helpful. I also like the way the campus is really organized with all the classes and clubs in order to help the students, faculty and the community."
Niche User,5,"It's very student friendly and the student to faculty ratio is a perfect 13:1. The school is made up of 1,300 enrolled, making life at McMurry very very personal.  It's easy to make friends and to gain enough courage to talk to professors. Everyone at McMurry knows each other because of the small class and I enjoy being able to have good discussions in class. Life at McMurry is very comfortable and the relationships that can be built at the school are everlasting. The campus is very lively and there are various kinds of clubs that students can be a part of."
Sophomore,5,I like everything that McMurry University has to offer. McMurry has a wonderful staff. The professors are great and always available when students need help.
Sophomore,5,"I liked that everyone is friendly and makes it feel like home. I like the professors, they are really helpful and flexible if you are doing extracurricular activities. Everyone at this campus is really understanding and really helpful. I love the small campus life."
Senior,5,"Small campus community.
Academic are good. 
Campus life is good.
Dorms need updating.
Food is average.
Sports are good."
Freshman,5,I am an incoming freshman and I have to say from my first visit I knew that McMurry was the school for me.  The professors I met were very knowledgeable about their field and the administrative staff have answered all the questions my family had and more.  Now that I am accepted the care that they are taking to make sure that I am prepared for the Fall is more than I expected from a school.  They have been just as helpful from the beginning up to this point so I am excited and can't wait to be on the campus to start my educational career.
Freshman,5,Class sizes are small so the professors get to know their students. The campus is small but very diverse and the athletics are top notch.
College Sophomore,5,there is not much drug usage.
College Sophomore,5,I love my school and cant wait to go back this upcoming year.
College Freshman,5,We are near a military base and everybody likes to keep each other safe so we don't have any issues. The school is completely safe.
College Sophomore,5,"I am specifically in Alpha Psi Alpha, and it is amazing. I would of never thought i'd be in one but ever since i've joined i never felt so happy and thankful i met wonderful sisters! The greek life at McMurry is very important boys and girls. We do not have Greek houses but some of the members in clubs will get a house and have their members live with them."
College Freshman,5,I feel that I am getting a quality efuation. I can do with fewer liberal.arts credits though.
College Freshman,5,"Since it is a very small school, professors are able to know you personally and genuinely care for their students success. However, there is not ,much diversity when it comes to the student body."
College Junior,5,"Coming to McMurry University was the best decision I ever made. Even though it is a small school, the professors want to challenge you. The small class sizes allow you to personally get to know your professor and they have the chance to learn what your learning style is as well as how to make you better. You're so much more than just a number in the attendance book, they know the student's hopes and dreams and encourage them to reach for them. I wouldn't trade this school for the world because it feels like I matter here."
College Freshman,5,Sports are important on campus.
College Freshman,5,They hand out money almost as much as the free snowcones.
College Senior,5,"McMurry is a great school for people who aren't into big schools. Everyone at this school accepts you for who you are and doesn't judge based on your race, religion, or political preferences. The campus wide activities are always a lot of fun as well. They give you a chance to meet one another. The school is smaller than the high school I attended, but I like that. This is a great school and there are a lot of wonderful people here to experience your college years with."
College Freshman,5,its a Methodist school the drug scene is practically nonexistent and most don't even know it exists
College Freshman,5,more than 80 percent of my tuition and housing is covered
College Freshman,5,The rooms are large and i can wake up five minutes before class and get to my class on the other side of campus on time
College Sophomore,5,The academics are pretty well and educational
College Junior,5,You get what you pay for and it is cheaper than what you would pay on campus and alot better.
College Freshman,5,College provides computers to every student.
College Freshman,5,I have not been exposed to any.
College Sophomore,5,"I love the education program at my school. The professors are great, helpful, and caring. We have a fifth grade magnet school that attends class in our education building so that makes it perfect for the education majors to practice tutoring students."
College Sophomore,5,We have a ride variety in such a small school but we believe that everyone has a spot here at McMurry.
College Sophomore,5,It was easy. My advisor was extremely helpful.
College Freshman,5,Permits for parking on campus (for students) is free and you get two of them. They are strict in enforcing having the permit to park. I do not know how much a ticket or fine is if you park and do not have a permit.The campus is small enough that there isn't a need for a car unless you want to go around town. Parking spaces are reasonably easy to find unless some big event is happening.
College Freshman,5,Perfect distance to where my classes are
College Freshman,5,Fast internet and you are able print from any building. 
College Freshman,5,It's not very big but thats what I like about it. It's all very closed in but is very clean. 
College Freshman,5,I love it. I dont dread going to class everyday and i love how conveniant it is. 
College Freshman,5,My major is early childhood education and Mcmurry has a huge part in this major so their involved alot in the local schools in town and other campuses. But as for other majors Mcmurry seems really involved and helpful.
College Freshman,5,Well all the staff are very helpful in helping you find a job and finding out what you want to do in your major. 
College Freshman,5,MCmurry offers a variety of classes and they pretty convenient on times. 
College Freshman,5,I love how all the proffesors are always willing to help and if you need help late at night they give you their phone numbers so you can give them a call. Academics are very important on this campus.
College Freshman,5,Being raised in abilene I know all the fun stuff to do in Abilene so I love it here and I definately plan on staying here or around this area when I graduate. 
College Freshman,5,Mcmurry has a great computer lab with plenty computers. PEople are always willing to help if you have technology problems with your laptop or computer. ANd of course it is conveniant to be supplied with a laptop and all the useful tools such as microsoft offiice.
College Senior,5,"Very much so a academic school, science is our biggest department beside Psychology. Its a school worth attending."
College Freshman,5,"Alpha Phi Omega, the fraternity on campus is based on: community service, leadership, and friendship. If you are looking for a friendly campus, small campus, great professors, and school spirit, McMurry is the Place."
College Freshman,5,"Varsity sports at McMurry University are pretty huge, especially because it is so small that almost everyone is an athlete. I want to say that 85% or maybe more are athletes and if they are not, they were. Coaches care about winning, but emphasize more on your grades and what you do after college."
Recent Alumnus,5,"My program, religious studies, left me prepared enough to get into both Princeton and Yale. I am extremely satisfied with my professors and the work they demanded of me."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Apart from a very rare theft, I did not notice any safety issues or concerns at McMurry. I always felt safe, even at night, on the campus."
College Freshman,5,the school caters to every major as best as possible
College Junior,5,"Greeks as a Support System – Greek life serves not only as a support system for those within each club, but also for non-Greeks. The clubs all run fun and important social events for the entire campus and promote involvement."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Health Is Pretty Good. There is hardley ever any campus crime here at McMurry. I can't remember the last time I heard of any if there ever was any at all. Most people are pretty easy going on campus, so there is little to no threat of danger around the campus beside maybe a speeding biker."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Nice warming feel to the campus.The people here are so friendly, and it is easy to talk to people."
College Sophomore,5,"Plenty of Space – Once you get your parking permit (which is cheap), there are plenty of spots for you to park in all around the campus. There is always plenty of space and they are even expanding it some more. The best part is being able to park near the building most of your classes are in so you don't have to walk very far."
College Sophomore,5,Safety First – The parking is decent and the spots are all relatively close. If your late to class then you will obviously have a tad bit of a harder time finding a spot. The security is the best aminity and really appreciated.
College Freshman,5,Notebook for All Students – All students have a university issured notebook and the IT is great
Sophomore,4,What I like most about McMurry University is the caring and attentive professors. They have helped me one-on-one and to find needed resources. If I could change anything about the University I would add more foreign language options for students to take advantage of.
Alum,4,I loved all my professors and the small classroom sizes that allowed me to get hands on experience. I built a strong relationship with each professor. They truly wanted me to succeed and were very approachable. I got the opportunity to conduct my own research capstone project even in my undergrad. Being a college athlete for the women's basketball program for three years was very rewarding. I enjoyed representing the university through athletics and getting a Bachelor's degree in Biology.
Freshman,4,The few months that I have been here I have enjoyed it a lot it is not a big school but its just means you get to know a lot more about people than just their names. The classes are small which I enjoy because the teacher can really get to everyone
Junior,4,I like how McMurry makes you feel as if your at home and has excellent staff.  McMurry University has amazing programs for students to be involved in.
Niche User,4,I liked that mcmurry was a very interactive school and how they have a lot of diversity and I also like that they have a soccer team that I can play for and I feel like I would meet new people and be able to have fun out on the field.
Senior,4,McMurry is a wonderful university to go to. The professors there are exceptional and will do anything to help see their students succeed in and out of the classroom. It’s nice to walk around campus and be greeted by all smiling faces everyday. I have been challenged academically in the classroom in ways I never thought I would.
Sophomore,4,"McMurry University has changed me in ways I would never think of. Being here has brought me out of my comfort zone thanks to the activities I have done, the people I have met and even the courses I have taken. The best thing about McMurry is the people, the people here make you feel as though you are part of a family and that you are you are apart of something bigger than yourself. Not only in school but in life and I believe that if they continue to do this nothing but good things are to come for this institution."
Niche User,4,My experience was very great! The staff is very nice and helpful and always want the best for you. I am guaranteed to apply here. (:
Sophomore,4,"The teachers are great! They will do whatever it takes to get you the help you need. The people are nice, as well as the staff there. McMurry is a small university, but you get treated like family there. At the school there is free tutoring from teachers and students. The students go to most of the sporting events and cheers them on."
Freshman,4,I like that I can see everyone almost at anytime at McMurry. Most if not all professors are very nice and will communicate to students in appropriate manners. There are also events that are student run almost everyday at the campus which are indeed fun.
Freshman,4,"I love the classroom environment and the relationships students form with professors and other students due to the small university size. If you are struggling in a class, you will NEVER be in a situation where you cannot get help/tutoring conveniently and free of charge. My only complaint is that I come from a 6A high school in a large city, so the small college town life just isn't for me."
Sophomore,4,I like the small college town and the fact that the people here make you feel like you are part of a family. I just really feel that we could fic the food in the cafe and do some structural touchups around campus.
Alum,4,"Coming from a big city, McMurry was the perfect college town for me! I wanted to get away from all the partying, noise, and stress. I loved that I knew literally everyone on campus and glad that we became one big family. Everything is in walking distance from classes, gym, track, dining hall, dorms, and even shopping. The professors truly care about the future of the students and keep in contact even after graduation. I'm glad I chose McMurry!"
Junior,4,I like McMurry University because of it's small class sizes and how you get more hands on with the professors.
Freshman,4,"When I was applying, the staff members were very patient and showed me around and explained what I needed to do next in order to be enrolled into the Spring Semester."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at McMurry is fantastic, it's a very nice school by having teachers who can help you personally as well as the people at the school. Everyone there is very friendly and gives you a good vibe, everyone is helpful and will make your bad if you have a bad one. The changes that I think should be made is makin it a little bigger adding better food places there and if it wasn't a D3 school because there are a lot of great and talented athletes there and everyone needs the extra athletic scholarship money to help pay off school."
Sophomore,4,"I am on my second year at McMurry, it is a well diverse school. The professors are great, they are willing to help with any problem."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about McMurry University is that it is a small, Christian-based University where you can have thirteen to twenty students in class, but still get that one-on-one help from the professors. What I would like to see change is how the dining hall is not open during the summer terms when there are students who do not have access to vehicles for them to travel to get/buy food."
Freshman,4,I transferred from Cisco College to Mcmurry University. Everything has been awesome so far and there isn't really anything I'd want to change.
Freshman,4,My experience so far for my freshman year the teacher/student ratio is great. I love the small classes. I also love how it's easy for me to get around campus.
Freshman,4,I was a little scared to go to mcmurry at first but then I ended up liking it. The teachers are great and they treat you more than just a student. The food is okay not really that great. The dorms are pretty out dated but they're adjustable.
Sophomore,4,I love McMurry though it was my first semester and a little expensive I think it's worth every penny! The professors actually work hard to see their students pass and succeed it's not all about a check. Student life is great they want to see you involved and everyone is friendly.
College Sophomore,4,The school helps you get internship and jobs if needed.
College Sophomore,4,The professor are great and care about how you are doing. the classes are small so you get your one on one time which allows you to ask the questions you might have.
College Sophomore,4,Safety is one of their main concerns
College Sophomore,4,The housing is great since they offer many options and even apartments
College Sophomore,4,The school has two gyms ones for athletes and the other for their regular students. Which is a plus especially since you don't want a crowded gym. They also have a pool which is a plus.
College Sophomore,4,I loved how the admission advisor was so helpful and made me fell welcomed.
College Sophomore,4,the degree from mcmurry can help you get somewhere and start you off with an internship.
College Sophomore,4,The coaches and the athletic director are very nice and easy to approach. When I came to this school I didn't think they would but they are.
College Sophomore,4,"My school is a great school , because it is small you know everyone. Everyone there is so nice and helpful."
College Freshman,4,Better than most schools but still could use some work.
College Senior,4,Greek life on campus is fantastic but slowly being killed off.
College Freshman,4,Nothing bad or harmful happens on campus
College Freshman,4,The professors do lectures and good lessons. But when it comes to assignments and homework they are willing to help during their office hours or whenever is good between them and their students.
College Sophomore,4,"Class sizes are small and courses are always taught by professors, not teaching assistants. The professors are always willing to help the students, and often will make themselves available and will include ways to reach them after hours. Not every course is available every semester or even every year, so sometimes you need to watch for some of the classes to make sure you get the right courses in time"
College Sophomore,4,"The residence halls do not have a curfew, but they do have quiet hours from 10pm to 10am that are enforced to provide an atmosphere where students can sleep and study without excessive noise. Laundry is easily accessible in Hunt and Martin Halls, and is a little more of a hassle for the other residence halls and the on campus apartments. The residence halls are a great place to find community. Often walking down the hall, many rooms are open to socialize with others going through. The housing process is not difficult to understand, but can be challenging if you need to move off campus unexpectedly."
College Sophomore,4,"I love being at McMurry. There are many opportunities for me to get involved around campus and know my classmates. The classes are small, and the professors are willing to make themselves available to help with questions and struggles. It is easy to know what is going on around campus."
College Freshman,4,Being involved with Greek life helps me interact with new people and have fun with a lot of events and activities
College Sophomore,4,"It is pretty good! the campus goes out and supports each sport with great spirit. They may not win much games, but we love our sports just as much as we love our campus!"
College Sophomore,4,"It is a small environment which is very helpful because all the professors know you and you can get help as needed and the classes are a great size. The school spirit is pretty good, especially when its time for basketball which i use to play my freshman year and first semester and then stopped playing to focus on nursing school."
College Freshman,4,I have always felt safe.on campus.
College Freshman,4,McMurry makes college life easy and fun. Im glad I chose to come here.
College Freshman,4,I like it. no community bathrooms. only up to four people share bathroom.
College Freshman,4,There is a clubs for everyone. very few people do not participate in Greek life.
College Freshman,4,"McMurry is a small school. with classes about 15 students each. if you want your teachers to know you and have the opportunity to join any and all school activities, McMurry is the place for you. most people major in business and medicine."
College Sophomore,4,As a non-traditional student I have found McMurry to be a truly wonderful place for me. I am an older student single mother with young children I am also dyslexic (a learning disability) most of my professor have work hard to help find ways for me to learn and retain the knowledge I need to complete my BA in education.
College Senior,4,"You can get help from all the teachers, and it's always fun!"
College Freshman,4,I live off campus and it's cool.
College Freshman,4,"I love McMurry. It's in small town Abilene and the other private colleges here make it like high school again. Cross-town rivalry football games are the best. It's so quiet at McMurry. You don't even realize you're walking through a college campus. Except Wednesdays. Warhawk Wednesday to be exact. Then, it's every man for himself."
College Senior,4,The cost is out of this world but the living in the dorms it very simple and very comfortable. The worst part is maintenance because they are slow to react to a certain situation that involves the dorm. The social atmosphere is very out going except when people are rude.
College Freshman,4,"The have excellent professors, I skipped remedial and some basic classes because all of my dual credits transferred, and the classes are very small too. The professors are there when you need them."
College Freshman,4,"There is not any hassle on campus, there is zero tolerance for drugs an alcohol."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms got renovated in 2006, have there own thermostat in each room, and are very spacious rather than most dorms."
College Freshman,4,"Just as long as there is no alcohol or drugs on campus than there are no problems. It's an open campus, and the guard are unarmed, but there are hardly any problems at all."
College Freshman,4,"The staff is very helpful and resourceful when it comes to financial aid, very few problems."
College Senior,4,"I have lived off campus for a couple of years and the prices, compared to other places in Texas, are actually pretty reasonable. I enjoy being off campus because I am right next to the grocery store and other convenient stores. It's best to find a house on the south side of town which is where McMurry is located. The north side is a little more unsafe and there is a lot more going on on the north side. I have not had a problem with any of the landlords I have dealt with so far. They mostly pay for all of the bills except electricity. If there's a problem with plumbing or anything that involves what they pay for, the landlord takes care of it."
College Senior,4,"The thing I like about McMurry University is that they allow you to live in peace without a strict schedule of where you need to be. Unlike other private colleges, McMurry doesn't have a curfew or restricted times that you aren't allowed to leave the dorms. The only thing that McMurry is strict about is social clubs. They keep a close eye out for hazing of any sort."
College Freshman,4,pretty descent everyone is nice and helpful
College Freshman,4,if your caught with alcohol its usually a slap on the wrist. but if your caught with drugs your expelled
College Senior,2,They tend to sell it more then what is actually is. If you really want to know what Mcmurry is like ask around if you say a frlull day you tend to find more people who dont like it then actually do enjoy the campus
College Sophomore,2,"its a dry campus, so everyone does not use drugs or alcohol on campus."
College Freshman,2,"There are only 2 clubs that have a college night. It is really a school to get an education, not party. Plus if you are an athlete  practice is early in the morning the next day."
College Freshman,2,"The weight room is nothing more than a garage looking gym with weights in it. However, athletics itself is a huge factor at the school, but are students before athletes."
College Sophomore,2,The campus police only patrol at nigh and in areas where no one really is at. They honestly give the feeling that they do not generally care about the students here
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid process is very slow and unorganized. They never tell you what papers you actually need unless you ask and that is when you don't receive the aid you were promised. They will lose forms easily and blame the student for never turning in the form.
College Junior,2,"I believe that we only have one campus policeman, since he is the only one that I have ever seen and I also believe that he works somewhere between 12-5. I have only seen him in daylight writing parking tickets. I have never seen him at night even when there were scary things happening on campus."
College Junior,2,"First of all there are not any signs marking the ""faculty parking lot"" and if you park there you immediately receive a ticket. The parking spots are few and far between since the board of MCMurry decided to dig up a parking lot to install grass that didn't stay green that long. Not to mention they charged the students for digging up the parking lot."
College Junior,2,"The people are pretty much lost in the financial aid office. There is one lady that might know a little something however she is only in her office like 4 times a year so if you do catch her and she does help you, she most likely will hand you brochures."
College Sophomore,2,School says they are totally against it and will kick people out of the university but I don't think it's ever happened.
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot of people attend the sporting events.
College Junior,2,I need to budget ahead of time and they did not provide me with any assistance even after I called them thus making it a huge hassle on me since I am the one paying for my schooling.
College Senior,2,Either it is too hot or too cold its a lose lose situation but it is tolerable.
College Junior,2,"I am originally from Houston, TX so comparing the night life from Houston to Abilene is why I give a C. Abilene is a pretty small town so there's really not a whole lot to do. We have the occasional house party that can be really fun, but that's not very often. If you're not 21, it can get pretty boring. No one wants to go sit at a random bar and do nothing but watch everyone else have a good time. Although, we do have Guitars and Cadillacs that is a country dance hall. Every thursday it's ""College students get in free"" night. It's the one day out of the week that college students look forward to."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Abilene in general has very little diversity. McMurry seems to be much more diverse than the rest of Abilene, but that still leaves it lacking. Most students and professors are white."
College Freshman,1,"There is none, just social clubs people put together."
College Junior,1,"People openly talk about what they do to boast about how ""bad"" they are. They are practically screaming help me!! They need an outlet, They need Jesus, He is the reason my life changed!! He helped me when i was in their situation, driking away my problems only to have them come back within 12 hours. Temporary fixes only bring temporary reilef. They need a real fix. No one would put a bandage on a broken bone it won't do anything. But Jesus is the resetting of that bone and the regrowth that occurs in the healing process!!! These kids need Jesus!!"
Recent Alumnus,1,Abilene has very few public transit options. Most students have a car.
College Sophomore,1,Not That Great – There aren't many on campus shuttles that go out around town. The taxis are good and they are set at a good price. There isn't that many public transportation that is available to the students around campus.

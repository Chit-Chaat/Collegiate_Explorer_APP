Freshman,5,VSU learning experience has been good and helpful even though we are online they still support as much as they can.
Freshman,5,I like the teachers and the students. And i like the location of the college. I don't like living too far from home.
Alum,5,"I loved the ""family-like"" atmosphere of VSU. No matter where you're from, you can find a community of people who love and support you at your home away from home."
Freshman,5,"Personally my first year experience at Virginia State University was great, I also love the fact that it is an HBCU. I enjoyed meeting different people from all over the world, campus is awesome there is literally always something to do on campus such as activities, community service, clubs, and etc. academically Virginia State university is very good with helping students and making sure we all succeed in our class courses along with our everyday life. The staff on campus are amazing and they really do care about the  students, if feels like a second home while being away from your first home. As well as our great campus president Mr. Makola Abdullah who is a very outstanding man who is also very very involved with campus as well as his students you most likely will see him attending our football and basketball games or even catch him in the cafeteria having lunch. Virginia State University is an amazing college the only change I would recommend is adding more dining options."
Sophomore,5,Being at Virginia State University it’s makes me feel welcome by everyone. It’s a home away from home.

Alum,5,"Great, traditional college experience. Black students learn much about their history and culture being at a Historically Black College/University and amazing Greek life, student organizations and academic setting. You are pushed to find yourself and assistance is available to all (you just have to be determined to find it). Only downside is Petersburg is just a military/college town so you have to go to Richmond (25-30min away) for nightlife, and dorms need upgrading."
Niche User,5,"It is a great institution, you will fit in greatly and the courses are superb. The area surrounding this prestigious institution is not the best, But it will do."
Sophomore,5,"Virginia State University is an HBCU (Historically Black College University) in Petersburg, Virginia. This school is one of the top HBCU's in the country. The opportunities that present themselves here are amazing. Depending on your course of study many doors will be opened for you resulting in internships relating to your major and maybe even job opportunities in your field of study. The campus is nice and you meet lots of people which is always a nice things. The academics are well and you will be successful here if you apply yourself, I would recommend this school to anyone."
Freshman,5,"VSU wasnt my first choice but i glad i chose this HBCU, its a very positive fun environment there are many organizations and things to join not to mention a like of different people to connect with. The staff i have had interactions with are amazing and most of the time friendly. There are probably more hidden gems  about this school that i have yet to come across yet!"
Junior,5,My experience at Virginia State University has been the best experience ever. At Virginia State University you have numerous of people trying to help you with anything possible.
Sophomore,5,"I currently attend Virginia State Unversity as a Sophomore and personally, I am enjoying myself not only socially but I am noticing how I am improving academically as well. There is a sense of family not only at the university but in surrounding areas as well."
Freshman,5,Virginia State University is a great Historically Black University (HBCU). it is very active on campus and there is always something fun to do. academically it could be better. The amount of care the teachers have for students could be better.
Junior,5,"I am pleased with my commute to the University and its distance from my home. I am determined to excel in each program related course, and I absolutely love how professional the academic staff are. My school is large, and I would recommend upcoming students to get familiar with the campus, by asking the staff and current students questions in order to navigate locations. It's an HCBU, and I am well pleased with how well kept and clean the facility is. 

Thank you,
David"
Niche User,5,"As a transfer student, I haven't had much experience with the school. However, from the few experiences I've had on this campus, I can say that Virginia State University is a very great campus to be on. It is always buzzing with student activity, their staff is very helpful and they have a selection of food that accommodates individuals who have a different diet."
Junior,5,I am now an upcoming junior at Virginia State University and so far my experience and time here as been everything I hoped it would be. Their faculty is super helpful and friendly and it makes adjusting to campus life way more easy. I'm glad I decided to continue my education here.
Junior,5,Virginia State University is an university that gives one of the authentic HBCU experiences that you can ever have. It has allowed for me to develop more into a future leader of the next generation and had allowed for my musical skills to be further enhanced.
Freshman,5,"I went for a college visit and the campus was beautiful.  They also have fun activities and clubs there.   I haven't been there long enough to say what I would change, but my overall experience has been amazing."
Junior,5,"My experience at Virginia State University was amazing! I have the same birthday as my school president, I am a Virginia State University Woo Woo, I am now a junior at Virginia State and VSU gave me the opportunity to start my distress jeans company here. I have met people who could eventually be my family and amazing networking opportunities."
Junior,5,I enjoy the school and we have one of the most down to university president's you will ever come to know.
Sophomore,5,"I love the professors and the Financial aid office, Virginia State University is somewhere I can call home I like the dorms and also the gym if I would change something it would be the parking doe students that’s just about all but far as the school I love it !"
Freshman,5,"My experience at Virginia state University was very good when I went to visit the school in March.The Tour lady was very nice ,Respectful. She had a positive energy also very well spoken. The campus was very big and everyone was interacting with each other. It is a lot of actives you can participate in while you are attending Virginia State University. Since I will be a upcoming freshman in the fall the dorms were good and spacious when I went to visit the school. The safety is very good because when I went to visit  I saw how there was a lot of police officers on campus."
Junior,5,I love Virginia State University! The whole atmosphere at this school is great. Every moment of being at VSU has been an experience that I will definitely remember forever. VSU students and faculty are like a big family. Even though we all come from different backgrounds we have foundv a common ground. Being away from home and having a family away from home is a great feeling. I love my hbcu!
Sophomore,5,"I knew I wanted go here since I stepped foot on campus 2 years ago when I took the HBCU tour. I love my VSU. It's home away from since I'm an out of state student that means alot. The professors actually care, the students are like family and the academia is marvelous."
Niche User,5,Virginia State University was an excellent experience for my two children. Both graduated in four years and were employed in their field of study after graduating. There is a sense of family and the alumni are committed to the university. I would recommend VSU to parents and students.
Niche User,5,"Virginia State University is a very comfortable university, you make friends quick off the back and there are RA's there to help you get over your depression and make you feel home and it's an HBCU"
Niche User,5,I will be attending the university in the fall. But my sister attended the university a few years ago and she had some good times and not so good times.  Her first few years was good then she wasn’t happy because she said the professsors wasn’t professional and communication amount staff and overall was a bit much for her.  I remember my mom going down there to help or better yet to solve issues as she have always done in the past or for her kids.  I remember a little visiting the school but not at the time thinking about college.  At the time they were building new dorm but my sister didn’t get one she got the old dorm.  The older dorms could use a lot of fixing up . She eventual got transfer to another school. I will br visiting the university for myself to attend for fall 2019. Looking forward for my first college years.
Niche User,5,I visited the agricultural unit and was VERY impressed. Especially with the blueberry fields. Everyone teaching appeared confident and and were able to present their information in an easy to learn way. The large variety of hopps seemed to be thriving and it was a unique experience learning about them. Who would've guessed that the different 'genders' of hopps have to be kept a certain distance away from each other? All around worthwhile!
Sophomore,5,I like that Virginia State University atmosphere is welcoming. Teacher are determined to push their students to be successful. Students help and motivate each other to do there best.
Junior,5,If you want to be at school that makes you feel like family. This is the place to be! The number one HBCU. I love my HBCU
Sophomore,5,I love my HBCU. The campus has a lot of culture. The academics are very good. The student life is extremely enjoyable. I am ecstatic to be a Trojan and I wouldn't trade it for the world.
Sophomore,5,I love VSU because there is so much activities and student life that you can get into and do on campus.
Niche User,5,I love everything about the campus the alumni  and students a true HBCU . I love the Tv Production major classes and the campus life
Niche User,5,"ive always had fun when i went, its a great school, i havent been for school yet but im pretty sure itll be good,great in academics, sports, living, student life"
Freshman,5,My experience at Virginia State was wonderful. The student to student interaction was enjoying to watch. The homecoming parties and all other events were nice and lit. VSU should improve on the housing and dorm sizes.
Sophomore,5,I’ve like that it’s a hbcu & how they make sure that students stay on track.  One thing I wish they change are the visitation hours.
Sophomore,5,"First and foremost, I would like to say that Virginia State University is a very family oriented environment for its students. I consider VSU to be a family. The students and advisors make you feel at home. They welcome you with open arms. To me, they advocate acceptance. I’m grateful to be apart of an HBCU that I’ve been embraced with such profound comfort. Behold the true  Orange and Blue!"
Sophomore,5,What I love most about Virginia State is that there is so much to do and so many organization that will help you succeed in the field you desire. The only thing that I would like to see change is the crime and violence that sometime's takes place near on on campus.
Freshman,5,"My major needs. I like the dorm rooms, girls, activities and classes. I would love to come back and rebuild myself once again just like i did in high school in 2017"
Senior,5,I love Virginia State University! Being here at VSU I learned more about myself and how to express myself. The professors here love their students and will go above and beyond for their students but will also push you to your maximum potential they see in you. The professors are always available for students to contact them. Campus food is great! Wednesday's is fried chicken Wednesday's and Fridays is Fish Fry Friday's. Campus has a great tutoring services offered to students. One thing I would like to see Change is all of the dorms updated to modern living for students and get rid of community bathrooms.
Junior,5,I love my HBCU. Everything isn't perfect but its a great school. The food is not the worse but it could have some improvements. Some professors are really good while some are very poor. but as a whole Virginia State university is a very good school.
Sophomore,5,Virginia State University has broaden my mind in ways I couldn't even imagine. Its a very family oriented school where everyone takes their education seriously. I feel this school is really molding me to the man I need to be and I love everything about it!
Sophomore,5,"VSU is a diverse college, with a lot of difference major options. The professors are hands on, always willing to help or guide you in the correct direction with a smile of there face. Its in a great location, to include surrounding area. The best part is, my parents are able to navigate because what a lot of people don't know is your parents are still part of your education even thought your adult and suppose to do it yourself but that's not always the case, especially if they're paying for your education."
Alum,5,"I've always said that school is what you make of it. If you sit there, complain and joke around, youre not going to get much out of it. At state, I feel like I received a quality education and can go into the workforce with confidence in my knowledge and ability."
Senior,5,"The school has wonderful instructors, but overall the school seems very unorganized with financial aid, scheduling, etc."
Sophomore,5,"Virginia State University is amazing! You feel like you are one big happy family. Everyone takes the time to make you feel welcomed, no matter what the event is. The parties are out of this world, but most importantly the education is great! The professors that the time to help each individual with what he/she needs help with and doesn’t complain or judge them."
Senior,5,I enjoy going to VSU. The staff is great and the student body is awesome. I have learned a lot going here and i think anyone who is looking for a great college experience should attend Virginia state university.
Sophomore,5,"So far my first year at VSU has been very good so far. It went by very fast. VSU is very family orientated which makes it allot easier to get used to college. I made allot of new friends which i am very proud of  myself for doing because, I usually stay to myself allot . i am excited to start my second year and make more memories."
Sophomore,5,"Virginia State University is an HBCU like no other. It is a school that shows you the real world from a different perspective. The school offers many different programs and all areas have professors that truly want to help their students. The classes are small or average, which allows for a closer relationship with your professors. The student body itself are nothing but friendly. They offer great housing so student life will go smoothly. The food is great and consistent on a daily basis. Virginia State is a great school and I am proud to call it my HBCU."
Alum,5,I loved the fact that they made sure I am in good hands with them. The faculty and staff from the offices are warm welcoming and friendly.
Freshman,5,"Virginia State has a beautiful campus, and they have a great engineering program. The student body is very diverse a faculty are always going out of their way to help someone in need."
Sophomore,5,I love going to an HBCU you learn so much!! The teachers are all about helping you build yourself up and becoming confident in who you are. They let us know all the time that they are genuinely here for us and that makes me feel amazing
Freshman,5,"I love Virginia State University. Being here has been a great experience so far and I am only a second semester freshman. Everyone is like family here. We all care and show love and support for one another. I made the right decision by choosing to come here and be around people that look like myself. Also, being taught by African american professors, I have learned a lot more than I ever have."
Freshman,5,"Great place for all types of black folks, as well as other minorities. There are a plethora of places to go (in and around campus) to do activities and there is ALWAYS someone wandering around who are happy to converse."
Graduate Student,5,"I am a recent alum and current graduate student here at VSU and I love my HBCU! The Psychology department is my home away from home, the faculty and staff are very committed and helpful."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Virginia State University was amazing. I made many friends that look out for each other. And most dorms are very nice especially the upper classman. Parties were great because every weekend  there is a party. The cafeteria food isn’t the greatest but it is somewhat better than most other colleges. Walking across campus is only about 10 minutes. The school contains a lot great thin like picnic tables with USB plug ins. I like the campus because it isn’t modern but it is also older buildings. Overall, my experience is excellent and I think I want to stay there all 4 years"
Freshman,5,"My first semester at Virginia State University was pretty good. However, I would like to see Improvement on the food they serve in the cafe."
Sophomore,5,"Transferring to Virginia State University has been a blessing. I have grown academically as well as mentally. Growing up in a small community, a place where opportunities are very limited to black males,  this university has been an eye opener to many possibilities in a great way. I've met many friends and the professors have been great in helping to make this truly a learning experience for me.  I am looking forward to my second semester as a Trojans!"
Freshman,5,My Experience of Virginia State is good. They have wonderful teachers and faculty. Also they really care about their students.
Freshman,5,This school is amazing except the variety in the dining hall. Campus life is humble but very fun out here if you make it. Most of the people who say bad things came here with the mindset to transfer. College is what you make it.
Freshman,4,Virginia State has been an amazing learning experience with a lot of fun and friendly professors and classmates.
Freshman,4,"I have just started going here and because of covid, we were made to take online classes. And i don't have a lot of experience at the school, but i have been told very good things about the school."
Freshman,4,"When i think about my college experience at VSU , there are many things that come to mind. Some of them are: good memories, bad memories, mistakes, lessons, happiness, heartbreak, misfortune, joy, drama, and most importantly, fun. College to me seemed like it past by really fast, almost too fast sometimes. I learned many valuable life lessons as well as made life long friends. I learned the value of hard work, dedication, and also how to tell your real friends from the others. It was tough but overall a great experience that i will soon miss. When I think about college and all the memories, some of them were good, an some of them were bad. Most of the good memories involved my good friends and most of the bad memories involved just me. Some examples of good memories in college is just like going to the different sports games with my friends. My friends and I attended many of the football games, basketball games and some baseball games."
Freshman,4,"In today's society, online courses are widely used in colleges providing easy access to course materials, classroom discussions, and feedback to instructors. The course materials and activities may be accessed from any computer, whether it is from the University or from the comfort of your own home. I've taken two online courses since I've been in college and have benefited from those classes. There are a few reasons to why I'm drawn to an online education course as opposed to taking courses in a traditional classroom setting. First of all, I have a full-time job, which limits my opportunities to attend classes scheduled during normal school hours. Also online classes allow me to work on my own and move at my own pace. Finally, these classes offer more of a one-on-one teacher-student relationship rather than a teacher having to spread their focus amongst thirty other students. Any student that is interested in taking an online course should do research on the class."
Freshman,4,"Unfortunately during my freshman year spring semester the world got hit with a nationwide virus. Due to the virus my time staying on campus was cut short and for safety reasons all students and staff had to evacuate campus grounds sending everyone back home. Professors and the school staff took about a week figuring out how they would move forward with switching over to remote learning. During the process students were kept updated with emails from professors as well as staff about how things would be changing academically and how we would be using emails, scheduled phone calls, zoom as our way of communication. The app Zoom was our “classroom” for some students. Personally my professors made the remote transition easier for us and they understood our needs as students and really worked with us to make sure we finished the best we could once the semester came to an end."
Junior,4,Online learning is excellent. All the materials are uploaded so the pace is up to you. Professors are always an email away and very helpful.
Junior,4,"VSU is one of the most transformative HBCUs out there. From organizations to clubs, sports, and academics, there's lots in store for the students."
Sophomore,4,I took two online classes last semester and the teachers however online respond to you very quickly and attempt to help you with any issues.
Sophomore,4,"This School Is Amazing. The culture there is very rich and it feels homey, which is good because a lot of people are away from their homes."
Sophomore,4,"I love the closeness of the university and how loving it is. It truly is like a family on the campus and there is a lot of support from students and staff. VSU provides many internship opportunities and an ample amount of resources to help find what is needed. The engineering department is impeccable and I absolutely love it. I like how the campus is small, so the classes are smaller than traditional universities. The professors are able to help the students more due to less students in classes and it is more hands-on in the engineering courses."
Freshman,4,I haven't gotten on campus yet this would be my first year as a freshmen I've heard from the professors and looked at the doors even spoke to students and already feel like this is where I want to be for the next 4 years .
Sophomore,4,It’s a well known school and great students. A lot of academics. Great events for alumni and students.
Freshman,4,"It is a great school overall , but you can tell students aren’t really there to get an education .  I love my department and I am going to miss them all as I am transferring to Fayetteville state university . I was very distracted and feel I need to take myself away from the environment."
Sophomore,4,I was a transfer student! If you’re transferred in make sure all your credits were accepted! They’ll get you towards the end if you aren’t on it!
Niche User,4,I enjoyed visiting Virginia State over the summer time. It seemed to be in perfect order and has a lot of opportunities. I cannot wait to attend this lovely school in a few months.
Junior,4,"Virginia State is a very good school, but also needs a few changes. We pay way too much for off campus living and it is not what we pay for being that we still have to come out of pocket for parking to still get towed and high electric bills. Other than that it is a really good school to go to."
Freshman,4,I like the atmosphere of my university it's very inviting and open to all who decide to go there.  they help me out and they really care about there students success and want them to do well in the future. They have a lot of accessibility that helps me out as an adult with autism. If I could change anything it be classroom the ones with desk that look like they've been there since forever. so an updated classroom would be a nice addition. Because your spending all this money to go there you think they would update the desk and scenery.  it's a great school that looks at there students as leaders not as money pits.
Junior,4,My experience at Virginia State University was beyond what I could ever imagine. My academic experience was what really had me hooked. I had the opportunity to learn so much about the importance of attending an HBCU. I was able to surround myself with great mentors and professors who really took the time out to help me succeed beyond measures. I would recommend Virginia State University to anyone thinking about going back to school or going in for their first year of college. Virginia State University offers many opportunities to get involved with the community and making a difference in upcoming students lives. Virginia State University is a well rounded school that helps their students with their personal or scholastic finances by offering work study. I would recommend anyone attend Virginia State University if you are wanting to make a difference in this world or reach your greatest achievements.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy VSU, though my experience with the professors isn't exactly the best. They are all very kind, though some can't teach very well, in my opinion."
Junior,4,I have had a very good start there and would rate it the number one school thanks. The staff is great and helpful.
Freshman,4,"Virginia State University is a beautiful school. My personal experience so far, has been one of the best experiences of my life. I chose this illustrious HBCU because of its strong alumni, connections through the country, and motivating professors. The Virginia State University is a small but comfortable university. I love my HBCU with a passion."
Freshman,4,"What I particularly enjoyed about Virginia State University, was that the professors were so invested in improving the study habits of the students. There appears to be a motivation for the instructors to be able to make a difference in the lives of the those they are entrusted to."
Freshman,4,I am currently in my Freshman year at VSU. I loved the opportunities Virginia State has offered me thus far. I am considered an introvert and did not have many people in my life before arriving to this school. The atmosphere here sets at tone where you don’t feel alone and sets you up for success.
Sophomore,4,"I live the HBCU experience the provide. However, I do not like the minimal financial assistance the provide to out of state students."
Freshman,4,"I can't really say anything to criticize VSU being as I haven't attended yet, but based on  my college trip and what others who have previously attended told me, I feel as if I will overall enjoy my experience here."
Junior,4,As a student I like Virginia State University because of the environment and the academics. The professors are very engaged with the students and offer one-on-one help often. The environment is very friendly and safe. There are plenty of security officers and the students are all very friendly and inviting.
Freshman,4,Virginia State University campus is beautiful! jn sj  ji j  j  xj  xiun isd cisd saui is ciasid ids sdudi ds dj ads sjd s ijsdn mxk jxjjdu di aj Jx jd jdk kjyf jsyub jkisi  hy xcy jzuinukshd j sue hunsye
Niche User,4,I have visited on MANY occasions with my father and aunt who are VSU Alumni's. It feels like a family oriented environment.
Niche User,4,"It was actually great , they had breakfast prepared for us when we arrived. The campus was great, it was very diverse.  The staff was very welcoming and helpful."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Virginia State University has been like no other. Since I came from a small town, I never got the chance to experience diverse settings and people. The campus is a melting pot of people from all over the world. Though meeting and interacting with different people, I have gained a sense of improvement my culture awareness."
Sophomore,4,"I first entered Virginia State University as a Freshman. My first year was a great experience. I was alittle nervous at first.Once I moved on campus. The staff and student leaders were very nice and helpful. They made you feel like home.The registration process was alright. The financial aide process was alittle challenging at first.I had to go back twice because of missing documents or waiting for loans to be processed. The cafeteria food was alright Some days were good and some days bad.The hours were convenient though  My classes were alright especially my major ones,which my major is Criminal Justice. The electives the professors seem to be more challenging. The campus life was alright.I liked seeing the different Fraternity step.The parties were good and made you feel safe with the security on campus. The athletic with the Football and Basketball teams games were good. So far I met Alot of people who I can call family. I am enjoying my Sophomore year."
Niche User,4,My brother goes to this school and I pick him up after every holiday and I see the campus each time I go down there.
Senior,4,"My experience at Virginia State University was one of a kind. I came straight out of the Caribbean into the US, Virginia specifically. My first year at Virginia State University was  a culture shock for me. I had no idea what was a Greek Fraternity or Sorority. However I quickly learned about them due to their strong presence on campus. My favorite part about this school is how dedicated and motivated the professors are to see you succeed. The programs here are very strategically structured and created to help you get every ounce of knowledge and experience possible. Along with that everyone on campus are very polite and courteous.  Its either ""Yes Ma'am or No Ma'am  or ""Yes Sir or No Sir"". One thing that I would like to change at Virginia State University is the quality of the food they serve in the cafeteria."
Niche User,4,"My experience visiting Virginia State University was excellent. My sister attended the college last year and she had great year. She met a lot of good and friendly people. Also, she said the food was amazing and the teachers was very interactive with the class. However,  she told me that she also had terrible experiences at this university. She  said it was a lot of gun violence and fighting."
Junior,4,The experience at Virginia State University is unreal the people as a whole join as a family it’s a family vibe when you step on campus. Also there a lot of people on campus to help you get where you need to be all you got to do is open your mouth and ask and there their to help you. Vsu experience is one thing you have to experience yourself because it is just that amazing.
Junior,4,"Virginia State University is a very friendly school with a fun atmosphere. The professors are amazing and they will help you to be successful. If you are looking for a stress free environment with peers that feel like family, then choose Virginia State University. The famous is beautiful, the food is great,and the dorms are very comfortable."
Junior,4,"VSU is a really nice school. Pros: it's very easy to navigate through campus, there are always student activities going on, some dorm rooms are nice.  Cons: most of the time the food isn't all that great (the best café to eat at is Gateway), the surrounding area is very country and seems vacant at times. You would have to go out to Richmond if you want to experience any nightlife. The mall is pretty ok, there not many good stores in there so I would suggest you go to Richmond to shop at a better mall (especially if your used to the city life)."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Virginia State would have to be the best ever. I am really glad I picked this school. Being here taught me how to be very dependent on my own without always calling on my family for help.
Sophomore,4,Virginia State University humbled me as a student and made me realize that every obstacle you may go through can be learned as a lesson.
Junior,4,I experience at Virginia State has been good thus far. I believe that the students and professors on campus are well connected and have a strong relationship. Virginia State allows all students to be able to express themselves freely
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed seeing all students of the university come together in groups or as a family for events, or even just socializing all around the campus. The music, the energy and the great friendly people made the experience what it is. There's nothing I would too much change about this university. Maybe more food options would be nice."
Sophomore,4,"My experience so far at Virginia State University is amazing. I knew I wanted to go to the school when I toured the campus and I instantly fell in love. The vibe I got from the campus and everyone around me was better than any college I toured. I liked how the campus was big but it was still on the campus. Nothing is too far to where I will always have to drive. There are some things about this school that I do not like which are I feel there aren't enough opportunities on campus regarding majors. For example, Mass Communication majors should have a tv station and news station set up for us to not only practice but take a class and maybe adventure off and have a show on campus. I think the fields of study really do connect but I feel we could have better professors also because there have been a couple classes that I have taken and I feel that the professor can not teach as well. I love this school and will continue to get my education at this institution."
Freshman,4,"I love this campus. Both of my parents attended this school. In a way, this school is like home to me."
Freshman,4,This is my first week and I have enjoyed meeting my roommate and teachers.  Everyone has been very helpful in helping me transition into the college life.  I look forward to my years there and learning.
Freshman,4,"I loved the campus, everything was in such a good walking distance. The new dining hall was very nice and spacious. Only 4 stars because some of the dorms are very old, which is expected but they need serious renivations. Everything else was great and I can't wait to start my college expirence."
Junior,4,"Virginia State University is a great school to attend. You learn so many things just being on the campus. The people here make you feel like you belong, like you're right at home. You will receive the best education possible."
Niche User,4,"Virginia State Universty was a great academic institution but overall was an average historically black university. I personally felt that the school was going through a rebuilding process and honestly, I prefer a college that had a little more diversity and better activities on campus. I do believe Virginia State has a potential to be an outstanding university but they need some improvement."
Junior,4,"Virginia State is a superb school however it has it's fights. The organization is frequently discourteous on occasion and a few laborers (cafeteria for the most part) are past impolite now and again. The school is minimal a long ways behind in innovation yet most little hbcu's are on occasion. Virginia state is the thing that you make it, it's amidst no where. The school makes up the city, so you need to discover things to do. It doesn't offer you much and that is the reason I say you make the VSU encounter how you need it. General it's a truly decent school and little school."
Alum,4,My time at Virginia State University was nothing short of a positive experience. VSU is a HBCU that took pride in academics and life changing organizations. I joined the cheerleading team as a freshman and those 4 years of multitasking between being a full time student and athlete prepared me for hard challenges in the real world. I am honored to have graduated honors from such a prestigious college. I built such strong and amazing relationships with the staff and student body that have brought me far in my journey to now farthing my education. VSU is now growing and I am excited and looking forward to the day where I am able to give back.
Freshman,4,"People are really friendly, helpful, and supportive. The school is a relaxing place more than a party center. Doesn't offer a lot of diversity academically but it has a diverse staff. Education is pretty good and helpful."
Freshman,4,"I love Virginia State, it is one of the best HBCU's that you could attend. Out of state tuition plays a big part in college. If you're out of state and went to, not only a D1/D2 college, but an HBCU, you would know exactly how it feels. I am my mothers only child, and this college year out of her pocket she paid at least $20,000. She had set up a payment plan to make different payments to pay for me to attend. 1,000 could help a kid more than you think. I come from a neighborhood, called North Philadelphia, where most kids are dead or in jail, but I'm out here at Virginia State with a GPA of a 3.067, and can't get a $1. I have peers that have a GPA of a 2.5 that are in state, and still don't have to pay a dime. 3,000 could help my mom a lot, that's 1,000 more dollars in her pocket. My mom is a employed single parent with a household of just herself, while I'm currently in college."
Freshman,4,"My stay at Virginia State is a wonderful school,besides the outer limits of the campus.On campus is a lively atmosphere of different students."
Senior,4,"VSU is actually a really good school. It a lot of times is criticized for things that happened years ago. But the school has majorly improved. Campus life is fun, you'll definitely enjoy your time there."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the family oriented atmosphere that is among the campus from the professors to the workers in the dining halls.
Junior,4,"Virginia state University is an amazing campus with amazing opportunities. My major is Animal Science and the campus owns a farm not too far from the school. The people at this campus are very welcoming, makes school feel like home."
Senior,4,What I like about Virginia State University is the fact that it is so diverse that it's slowly becoming more diverse. I believe in Virginia state continues there efforts in being a diverse and University it brings all kinds of walks of life to the campus Virginia state learns to adapt to those personal needs of others showing no discrimination.
College Freshman,4,the best thing you can do
College Freshman,4,I love that this school is an HBCU
College Senior,4,"For the most part, I feel safe on campus. Late at night, when no one is out, it can be a little bit nerve wrecking sometimes, but other than that I feel safe."
College Senior,4,"My overall experience so far has been great, I feel involved and enjoy being a trojan!"
Niche User,2,"As a prospective student years ago, I did not enjoy my experience at the student orientation. That experience ultimately persuaded me to attend another university. The surrounding area a few years ago was basically just abandoned buildings and many of the buildings on campus needed a great deal of renovation."
College Junior,2,It takes forever for the school to receive the financial aid and it delays your education.
College Junior,2,I only say it's bad because the things that are being enforced aren't the problem.
College Junior,2,"They don't add anything to campus life. They are boring and strut around on,y wither people. Very non-friendly. Interest meetings are few and far between. Unless you know someone in a chapter good luck getting in. Sororities are snobs and fraternities are walking STDs."
College Freshman,2,it was a headache. I wish they could have given me more money to come to school. What the gave me wasn't enough.
College Sophomore,2,"There's more crime than is necessary on a college campus. robberies and missing phones or keys that don't come back up. Though, some students report items occasionally. it depends. There seems an even number of cases where you hear of lost items and found items but few cases where the lost items are the same items that were found.

The robberies or almost robberies are such that people get on edge though its not something that seems to be going away or resolved. I'd say look out for yourself because often case though the security is always there to bust a party, theyre never there to stop an attempted robbery. So be careful come dark and when walking alone with money and devices out or in obvious places. Don't broadcast all your worth, especially if you live on the other side of campus like gateway or moore."
College Freshman,2,I need some extra money to help pay for school and I didn't get any scholarships first semester to help pay that's why I really need this one.
College Sophomore,2,"There's basically nothing around here besides Burger King, Chinese food places, and a couple of pizza joints. The school gives people with meal plans the option of using that to purchase off campus I believe but the lack of variety and the unhealthy options there are is ridiculous."
College Freshman,2,It was not beneficial to high school students enrolling into a freshman at college because they were none for them. I would say that applying for scholarship all school year would be a great help and to always keep your GPA up
College Senior,2,"every year i have an issue with financial aid, it gets worse and worse each year and i am in my final year, and it's not going too great."
College Senior,2,"there's not that many clubs around Petersburg, you have to drive to Richmond if you really want the club scene. but there are a couple of decent bars around downtown Petersburg"
College Sophomore,2,Most days i don't want to eat there but breakfast and fcw are definitely the best meals also fcw is the most popular day in the dining hall
College Sophomore,2,its pretty bad i got food poisoning twice
College Freshman,2,a LOT of people smoke weed.
College Senior,2,"McDonalds, Burger King, Pizza Places, chinese...nothing fancy..just fast food"
College Senior,2,Not much transportation...we have to pay for everything.
College Senior,2,Petersburg is very small..not many things to do. Only one mall. People just drive to Richmond if they want something to do.
College Senior,2,Depends on what dorm you live in. Social atmosphere isnt very god since they have been doing construction around the school. There is not much amenities. The housing process is a pain that is why a lot of students live offcampus. The dining halls close very early and there are no c stores or small places to get food unless you walk all the way to Wawa.
College Sophomore,2,it all needs work in my opinion
College Freshman,2,because when the weather is bad class still goes on
College Sophomore,2,i see it as very boring
College Sophomore,2,"if you do not have a car, then you will probably get stuck or left where ever you are at"
College Sophomore,2,i can not stand the weather down here
College Sophomore,2,the weather down here is so hard to keep up with
College Sophomore,2,"everything in this area closes early, so it is hard to have fun sometimes"
College Freshman,2,There's only one shuttle that runs Thursday-Sunday. It only takes you to walmart and southpark (the dumbest mall ever).
College Freshman,2,Everyone smokes and drinks for the most part. There is a kickback almost every weekend (which begins on Thursday). THe police are very strict about drugs here.
College Freshman,2,"In the summer, it gets really cold at night despite being hot during the day. In the winter, it snows on and off. It's been snowing every week, once a week, since we got back from break. As soon as the last snow melts, it snows again. But we don't get snow days."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are old but have character. One of main issues is that the heat gets cut off in the snow for some reason. My hall, Langston, is very close knit thanks to our strict RAs. Living in Langston is convenient because I have a single and it is near a dining hall."
College Sophomore,2,If you can't find a ride your best bet is the train and that's about it or you find a cab or your parents.
College Freshman,2,"The security tries to eliminate the crime on campus but because of the location of the school, crime is high. The locals come onto the campus because it is public."
College Freshman,2,I just feel like this environment is not right for me so i would not come back. It is a beautiful campus and the students are great here as well as the classes.
College Freshman,2,The connection on campus always goes out and sometimes won't come back on for a few days.
College Junior,2,"The freshmen dorms are very raggedy at Virginia State University, The upper classmen dorms are brand new. The only good part about the freshmen dorms is that it is very close to your classes. The cost of the freshmen dorms are very expensive because its old buildings."
College Senior,2,"I have not had an internship yet, but plan to take one next summer. So far I have not participated in any professional training positions. I believe that an internship is essential to my future success."
College Junior,2,Petersburg is small town and there is no shopping center or sports activities close to campus. The city of Petersburg is very support of Virginia State University students.
College Senior,2,"Campus transportation is convenient for upperclassmen staying at the university apartments. This a free ride to and from campus every 30 minutes between 8am-1145am resuming from 1230pm-7pm. However local transportation for other students tend to be a hassle. Local buses PTC stop at about 6-7 pm daily. There is a bus fee I'm  not exactly sure of.The taxi services are very unprofessional the drivers are rude and I would never suggest Petersburg taxi services to any of my fellow colleagues. Moreover, in my opinion local transportation around campus is horrible needless to say have your own vehicle!"
College Senior,2,It's okay. I eat at cook out quite often. VCU has more options.
College Senior,2,I am simply grading on the way the staff handles student accounts. It is very hard to get in contact with a live person or have someone return a call in a timely manner.
College Junior,2,I received not much in scholarships  and it's very selectivedue to grades and the size of the campus. it's annual and you must put in an application but it's not 100% so it's better to stay on top of all the infomation that develops . I suggest making regular in-person appointments with the  financial aid officer for more information.
College Junior,2,Greek life is there  on campus and provide events  but it's most secretive and can boost your status up.
College Senior,2,"There are many things and people in VSU. You have to know which people to hang out with and stay out of trouble. You will also need to know what you want to study instead of wasting your parents money and time. There are certain things in the school you shouldn't get involve in because it migh change your life, not in a good way. In this school if you want to make it out with a degree stay focus"
College Sophomore,2,"Being that Virginia State University is an HBCU it is not as diverse as some other colleges, but the school is very accepting of all types of races and religions."
College Junior,2,There are little to no events to participate in. The facilities isn't as involved as they should be.
College Sophomore,2,"The cost is too much, there are little parking spots, the parking spots are far from classrooms and most parking spots are blocked off for professors. you would have to co.me like 30 mins before class to find a good parking spot"
College Sophomore,2,Parking on campus isn't that bad. The price is a little much to park on campus and you have to make sure you park in the spot when the sign say to. I feel you really need a car on campus epecially if you need something from the store and you can get it yourself instead of searching for a ride.
College Sophomore,2,"The freshman girl dorms are dirty. Branch, byrd, eggleston is nasty. They have soo many OVERSIZED  roaches, spiders, and other creatures. Ive seen brown recluses everywhere and they are POISONOUS! They have done nothing! Byrd has 4 floors and NOO ELEVATOR. when some dirty person decides to POOP in the shower, PUKE in the sink, PEE on the floor,  throw DIRTY PADS around, put BABY OIL in the shower, and DUMP their trash in the bathroom can.... THE WHOLE FLOOR GETS FINED.  If you have class or rehearsal during a DORM MEETING they fine you if you dont go.
Upperclassmen dorms MINUS Whiting hall are cleaner. but ODEE expensive. They're always evacuating for drug raids. They fine you if your room is not clean enough or if you forgot to take out the trash EVEN IF THERES ONLY 2 THINGS IN IT"
College Sophomore,2,"Just like at ANY OTHER SCHOOL, watch out for HAZING. watch the dangerous things ANYBODY will tell you to do just to be down with their crew cause people can get hurt or even die. The school had maybe 2 shootings right next to campus that had nothing to do with students, but locals. PEOPLE LIKE TO PLAY PRANKS ON HALLOWEEN. Some fights (BUT PEOPLE FIGHT EVERYWHERE) You won't find trouble here unless your looking for it. I've had no safety issues beside my ignorant roomate. In which they refused  to switch my room or give me a single after her threats."
College Sophomore,2,The dressing of females and males can get out of hand. Females will dress like they are going to clubs or parties when the temperatures are high and boys tend to sag their pants too much. Relationships aren't really big on campus but there are a few specks of couples walking around. Most people have long-distance relationships.
College Sophomore,2,The support and spirit is very low for any sport. Basketball games are only packed at the beginning and end of the seasons. Football games are usually a little crowded but barely enough to fill the stands. I am not sure about other sports.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't often drive on campus because all my classes are within walking distance but if I happen to drive, it can be very nerve wrecking. Depending on which class I'm headed to, I know where to look for a park and where not to. The only guaranteed lots with parking spaces are the football field lot or the softball field lot. The only thing with these lots are that they are inconvenient depending on where your classes are."
College Sophomore,2,"The main problem is that there is a good amount of peer pressure. To many people crack under peer pressure and because of this even more fall victim to peer pressure. People with good self-control should be fine. As far as visibility goes, its noticeable."
College Freshman,2,There isn't many apartments you can choose from if you stay in off-campus housing.Some Cons are it is still expensive and you have to provide your own food and pay a electricity bill. Some Pros are your not on campus and you will have an apartment with friends. You wouldn't have to worry about safety because the ares is good and the police are always around.
College Freshman,2,I gave everything a C which is average because everyone on campus does not drink or smoke. Their are many who do and is very visible outside but not everyone so I believe a C is a fair answer.
College Freshman,2,The only strictness really the campus in forces is the time people can be in the gazebos and female and male freshman visitation.
College Freshman,2,There arecomputers in every building but the wireless connection is skeptical because it will sometimes kick you off the connection if you are on your laptop. A lot of the printers aren't reliable so if you don't want want to pay the library to print it would be best to buy your own printer and at times the computers can be all used so a laptop is advisable as well.
College Freshman,2,It is average being that there is only a few non chain restaurants around.
College Freshman,2,The weather here can be pretty unpredictable especially during winter and spring. It will be hot one minute and about to snow the next. Weather that will make you catch a cold quick if not careful.
College Junior,2,They barely let you log in it has to be a good day. And they have taken away our $10.00 for printing so now we have to provide our own paper etc.
College Junior,2,When it rains too hard electricity WILL AND DOES go out.
College Junior,1,to strict on what we able to do. Feels like my parents are there 24/7
College Sophomore,1,"If you want to receive anything you have to put the effort in yourself, especially if you have the grades but not necessarily the ""financial need""."
College Sophomore,1,"To me, Petersburg seems like it's stuck in the past and is just catching up to speed so that it has some options but they are all the same type of places with little variety between them.The area is not only slow but also dangerous, I have heard of people being robbed or even murdered nearby/ on campus and, while I am from a city infinitely larger than this, I would not feel comfortable walking to and from campus. There's nothing outstanding about Petersburg and I can't wait to never have to set foot in this god forsaken city again."
College Freshman,1,"Over the course of the my first year in college I have witnessed a lot of peer pressure. The most popular drug at my school is marijuana. Most of the students who smoke, will smoke in their rooms which leaves an awful odor in the halls. Many students come to class intoxicated with blood shot eyes and sluggish behavior. Alcohol is popular also but not as popular as marijuana, alcohol is mostly seen around campus on weekends, however marijuana is seen everyday."
College Freshman,1,Bigger Shuttle or more shuttles
College Senior,1,There is none..unless you're in richmond
College Senior,1,Its a dry campus.Students can't have snowball fights or play any games that involve the students that live on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"I'm not a big fan of the night life so I can't say much about it. From what I have heard though, some people love it, while others do not."
College Freshman,1,It is not safe on campus the police are no where to be found
College Freshman,1,There isn't really anything to do at night
College Sophomore,1,"the campus police are very rude, and treat everyone like they are out to do wrong"
College Freshman,1,"There is nothing to do. The history of the town is its claim to fame it is its downfall as well. Additionally, they have yet to remove the confederate flags from various locations around the town (including the highway). I'm not sure if they know that the war is over."
College Sophomore,1,Getting validated is the worst process ever. So time consuming and stressful.
College Sophomore,1,You walk around dorms smelling weed all the time
College Sophomore,1,I'm qualified for numerous scholarships at school but i do not get offered them.
College Sophomore,1,Besides community service from the school theres not much to do in the local town. The town isn't very welcoming of the college students.
College Junior,1,Limited parking on campus with a few student lots. The earlier you arrive the better to find a parking spot.
College Junior,1,The shuttle system we have for our off campus residence is horrible. They say its supposed to come every half hr on the hr until 930. But instead the drivers decide to do otherwise. And the campus PD do nothing about those who are left because of the inconvenience of the driver.
College Sophomore,1,There are an endless amount of rules we have to follow. Even though this will be the case at any college. But it seems as if we have more t follow. Especially in our dorms.
College Senior,1,"There is nothing to do around campus. We have to travel to Richmond, VA to have a good time"
College Sophomore,1,"parking is horrible. the thing cost too much in order to have car plus, there is not enough parking spaces adn you will most likely have to come to school extra early to find a park or you will be out of luck."
College Sophomore,1,Freshman dorms at Virginia State is horrible. The best bet is too move off campus.
College Freshman,1,Unless you have car or know someone who has a car there is not much to eat off campus besides this fastfood place called Cookout . If you drive a few miles down then you will see a Wendy`s and Mcdonalds but the only thing in walking distance is Wawa and Cookout .
College Freshman,1,Its pretty  unsafe to walk off campus the buildings are old and there is alot of gang activity.
College Freshman,1,You rarely see any other race other than blacks but there are other races
College Freshman,1,"As a historically black school, there are mainly of course only black people, and relatively few of white, spanish, and anything else."
College Freshman,1,"I do not like this school, it lacks diversity. the only source of fun here is partying clubbing and drinking and smoking if you don't do those you won't have fun. the food is gross and unhealthy. the female to male ratio is like 1,000,000 : 3 .too many girls here.some of the dorms are okay. i know its a hbcu but the amount of black people here is ridiculous(im black btw) its in the middle of no where... you have to have a car if you want to get around. some of my professors are cool but other than that yeah....hopefully I wont be here next year (Im a freshman btw)"
College Freshman,1,There is really not much to do. What they call a mall is not really just alot of stores that dont have much. Not many attractions luckily kings dominion is not far. That could be some fun and Richmond would have a little more to do. There are buses on campuses that you can catch.
College Sophomore,1,I hate on campus housing. Women are very nasty and disrespectful.
College Sophomore,1,Virginia state i gave a D+ because this school is unorganized. they lose paperwork.
College Sophomore,1,"Virginia is a big state but where I stay it is old and dirty. The scenery is horrible. Local people are rude and have no life. The Museums are okay, could be a little better."
College Junior,1,"It's an HBCU. The school is a Historically Black College University with a student base that's over 90% black/African American, so don't expect much in diversity."
College Senior,1,The weather in Virginia is very unpredictable. It can be sun shiny one minute and downpour the next. Virginia State does has a issue with downpour. when it rains IT POURS.
College Freshman,1,This college is a Historically Black College/University so it is mostly black.  There are a few sprinklings of other races though.
College Sophomore,1,"VSU lacks extreme diversity which can be understood because it is a Historically Black College. Howver, in the twenty-first century there should be more diversity among students."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus isn't terrible, but my experience asking questions about the policy for commuting grad students was horrible! I felt like a convict asking for a weekend pass... :("
College Freshman,1,Financial Aid is horrible and they need a lot more help. they're very inconsistent and irresponsible
College Freshman,1,"Nothing to Do – If you don't have a car you are miserable. The bus comes every hour and stops running at a early hour. Im from New York so I'm not used to this type of environment. Everyone moves slow down south something I cannot get used to. Petersburg is a highly deserted town, historical district. You can tell who is from the town and who isn't because the locals all dress the same, old fashion like in their in the 1980s which I wasn't around for. There are parties but there all in Richmond ( the club scene ) which is about more then 30 minutes away."
Recent Alumnus,1,Control Your Alcohol Intake or Don't Drink at All – It's sad that people after 2 maybe 3 times still do not undderstand their alcohol limit when it come to drinking. If you don't know your alcohol intake by now then stop altogether. If you are underage then don't drink at all. Plain and simple.
College Senior,1,Stick With Your Books – The boys here are very immature and have a lot of growing up to do.  The girls here think every day is a fashion show and would rather walk in their high heels all day then to read their textbooks.

Alum,5,"GVSU is a medium size school, which is great because there are a lot of offerings in terms of majors, student organizations, etc, but classes are small enough that your professors actually know your name."

Alum,5,"GVSU was my first love. I loved the campus life, the clubs, and I mad love long friends. It was a quality of life that I haven't yet matched. I first thought I wasn't going to get as good of an educated as my friends that went to U of M or State, but I was totally wrong. The campus draws you in and takes your learning beyond the classroom and gives you a better education than most places."
Senior,5,Great University with great resources to help you succeed.  Campus can be confusing to navigate but once you get it its easy.

Senior,5,GVSU is a great college and I really love the mechanical engineering program here. I am on track to graduate on time in 4 years.
Sophomore,5,I was very stressed out at first with COVID-19 and how it would effect my college experience as a freshmen. The professors at grand valley were completely prepared for the switch to online classes. I had little to know issues and the professors were extremely helpful.
Graduate Student,5,"Big enough to have everything you could want, but small enough that teachers know who you are. The faculty is truly stellar!"
Freshman,5,"As a freshman, my experience has been fantastic.  I wish I could have stayed to finish.  Transitioning to online was very challenging and I did not do as well as I know I would have in person.  I have met some wonderful friends."
Graduate Student,5,Had a great four years at GV! Counselors were very helpful and the campus was very inviting! I felt safe and felt like the teachers and staff were very supportive!
Sophomore,5,"My freshman year at Grand Valley State University was a normal start with living in the dorms and meeting all new people. I think the set up of living is very convenient as a freshman because only freshman can live in the dorms. It was easier to go in by knowing that I will be surrounded by other freshman. My second semester was a little different because halfway through, we went to online classes. All in all, it was a very eye opening experience for my freshman year."
Sophomore,5,Everything about grand valley is amazing although it is on the pricey side for college. But the classes and overall life on campus is a wonder.
Sophomore,5,Online classes obviously had there restrictions but for the most part they were a breeze. Although I did feel like no real learning was being done.

The professors are equally as amazing, and for the most part care how you are doing in the class as well as mentally."
Junior,5,The professors genuinely care (for the most part) about helping you succeed and there are tons of resources available on campus to help you achieve your goals as long as you use them.
Freshman,5,Grand valley is really in touch with their students. Since the school is smaller is makes contacting your counselor or academic adviser really easy.
Alum,5,"I loved my experience at GVSU! I transferred here my junior year and I'm so glad that I did. This was a great place to make connections with professors who really care about what their field and sharing that information with others. The small class sizes are awesome and make the professors really accessible to students. There are a breadth of resources for students, tutoring, ba fitness center, awesome library, and a beautiful campus right by Lake Michigan!"
Freshman,5,I love Grand Valley! Now that I am at home due to the pandemic I am missing campus so much! The people are so nice and professors want you to succeed and they do not just view you as a random number.
Freshman,5,Love it at GV! Took a few weeks to adjust but the professors I've had so far have been very helpful and understanding and I haveso many resources at my disposal. They also handled the COVID-19 situation very well by giving us partial refunds for the rest of our dining plans and housing costs.
Alum,5,Very good university with new and clean facilities. The professors are very helpful and the classes are typically a good size. I felt like the professors cared about me in most of my classes and wanted me to succeed. campus life is great and there are a lot of opportunities for activities and meeting people.
Alum,5,"Loved Grand Valley! People who complain about the party scene just haven't gotten out there yet. Everyone is welcoming, parties are easy to get in to, and the parties are awesome!
At every college you have to get yourself out there. MSU and U of M both have technically ""dry"" campuses also. That doesn't mean that we don't party. Plus people are nicer here so the parties are just better."
Freshman,5,Really easy application with no required essays but there are options to complete a few. Everyone on that campus is really nice.. Their application style is rather outdated..
Niche User,5,Grand Valley state is a great school. They offer different opportunities for everyone. The campus is also in a great location on the west side of the state. Grand Valley is the perfect college for me and many other people.
Junior,5,"I really enjoy the campus atmosphere as a whole. There are a lot of student organizations to join, students are very accepting and there are a lot of ways to find ""your people"". 
The professors all have office hours and are able to work with you if you need a different time. The professors want their students to succeed and it shows. 
Grand Valley is dedicated to making sure everyone feels safe on campus, whether that means taking extra steps to promote inclusion or making sure students feel safe walking back to their dorm in the dark. 
Students have access to many opportunities like free access to the recreation center, counseling, a career lab, and a location on campus where students who are struggling financially can get free groceries. 
Campus dining has many options for several dietary needs. Some locations have started serving gluten-free bread, and many have vegetarian options. Though it doesn't apply to me, I think it would be nice to see more options for a better variety."
Freshman,5,"Grand Valley has been a very welcoming school. It’s not hard to make friends, everyone is helpful and supportive, and it’s a very outgoing school.

The professor are invested in your personal journey and are extremely kind! It is an amazing opportunity to have Grand Rapids bear for internships and social life! This university really supports the individual students and helps us!"
Freshman,5,My professors were always helpful and taught well and the campus is beautiful. I don't have a car so the bussing system is how I get to class and the buses are always on time and running.
Freshman,5,"I love the community here and how everyone makes you feel welcomed. Grand Valley State University does a fantastic job including you in opportunities throughout campus. They are constantly sending out emails informing grand valley students of possible internships, job opportunities, clubs, campus events, and much more. Grand Valley State University has amazing professors that reach out to their students to make them feel like they can be prepared and pass the class. Along with outstanding professors, the grand valley does a great job making it known for tutor opportunities. My favorite thing about Grand Valley State University is that almost everything is included in the tuition price. Going to sporting events, finding tutors, counseling, the gym, and so much more."

Sophomore,5,"Leaving Grand Valley State due to transferring, knowing it has been the hardest decision to make. I have nothing but great things to say about this University. Great student life, great small student sized classrooms, really just a great environment to be in. The student life is what you make of it like at any other campus, there are plenty of opportunities and things for students to do. Highly recommend this college if you're looking for a safe, friendly college environment."
Freshman,5,"The campus is a decent size and at lest feels large, there are plenty of people and the town of Allendale is an overall calm and easy-going place to be. The price is affordable and nearly all the professors I've had have been excellent. Assistance for students is easy to find and extremely helpful. It's a very good university."
Niche User,5,I love the small class big campus feels to the school. The small classrooms help me connect to the professors more and everyone is super friendly at GVSU.
Freshman,5,I love it here at Grand Valley! People are so nice! I'm in the Honors College taking Craig Benjamin's Big History Class and you should definitely take his class if you get into the Honors College.
Freshman,5,Grand Valley has a really open and welcoming environment. The climate on campus is one that everyone should be involved in. Everyone is extremely friendly and willing to help. The professors and staff are great and want to see you succeed.
Freshman,5,Grand Valley is a very good university. It is academically challenging and provides many great resources for its students.
Junior,5,"Grand Valley State University is a great college to attend! It has the most beautiful campus with many great opportunities for students. They have over 400 clubs to choose from and if you can't find one that fits you, you can always create a new one. Grand Valley is also located near the city of Grand Rapids which is an ever-evolving city with great activities for any young person. Grand Valley is also a big enough school to feel independent and free but also small enough that you see familiar faces daily. My overall experience at Grand Valley has been amazing and I would recommend this school to anyone and everyone!"
Alum,5,"Grand Valley is a stunning dual campus with both the rural and city vibe. The staff, fellow students, and even the area locals are incredible. It is one of my all time favorite places to be, I wouldn't change a thing."
Niche User,5,"Grand Valley has one of the highest rated criminal justice programs available.  I'm excited to see what the school has to offer with respect to campus life, academics, and internship opportunities."
Freshman,5,"What I love about Grand Valley State University is the environment and how it is so welcoming here. I love the campus and I feel at home here. Ever since I moved in I have felt like I belong here and I have so much fun with every activity offered. I love my dorm building and most of my professors. My schedule is pretty good and I have some free time apart from classes and homework where I can have fun with my friends at late night, walking around, or just hanging out in our dorms. One thing I think would improve aspects of life here is improving the WiFi. In many places around campus, my laptop does not connect to the WiFi and I am unable to use it to do class work. Overall, I love GVSU and I am so happy I made the choice to attend here."
Senior,4,"I took a few classes online and they were all very successful. The course outlines were clear, though you have to be well organized and self-disciplined to be successful."
Junior,4,"My experience at Grand Valley has been absolutely perfect for my personal needs and preferences when it comes to campus size and class choices. I am in Grand Valley's nursing program, and I am so fortunate to be enrolled in one of the most prestigious nursing schools in Michigan. The opportunities that are presented to me through GVSU's nursing program are so incredibly valuable and beneficial to my future career as a nurse. This program is what really drew me to attend Grand Valley. Plus, being in downtown Grand Rapids is a really exciting and energetic vibe during a regular school week. Also, I love the smaller size of Grand Valley's campus and classes. Bigger schools make me nervous and seem very intimidating, so I appreciate the more personal and friendly environment that Grand Valley presents."
Junior,4,"With the COVID-19 outbreak in the middle of our spring semester, it was extremely challenging to adapt all of our learning to online, but I think that Grand Valley did a phenomenal job making this urgent change. I was so thankful that the nursing program did everything possible to continue moving my cohort and I forward in the program, so we did not get behind in our classes. There are definitely aspects of online learning that I do not enjoy, especially the lack of hands-on learning. However, I think that all of the professors I've had learned from virtually did a wonderful job maintaining communication with their students, as well as being understanding of personal situations that may have been getting in the way of completing assignments."
Sophomore,4,The school was very nice the campus was completely safe. I felt safe working at night and felt there was many groups to join. For me GVSU just was not the fit for me though.
Sophomore,4,"I love the convenience of the bus lines,  cafeterias, location of housing, and the academics. GVSU has excellent sports and hundreds of clubs to reach all interests. People are friendly and professors truly want you to succeed."
Graduate Student,4,"Most teachers are excellent, though I have had one or two that just isn't very engaging in the online format."
Junior,4,I transferred to Grand Valley State University in my sophomore year and I had an overall great experience both academically and socially. I made new friends and got the chance to have a better education.
Junior,4,It was amazing seeing my professors transition perfectly to an online teaching method during the winter semester. They all did a great job and tried their best to make the students feel comfortable with the new learning system and to educate them as best as they can. Professors still had online office hours where students get to talk them. The tutoring centre also switched to an online program to help students. I think my school transitioned really well especially academically to provide all students with a really good online experience.
Graduate Student,4,"I ended up finishing my senior year online due to the Coronavirus...it didn’t take too long to understand how the online platform would look. There were a couple. If stumbling blocks, but the teachers were helpful and patient during the transition, so though not ideal, it worked."
Sophomore,4,"The online courses were definitely different from in class. It was difficult to change everything in the middle of the semester. The professors were very helpful and gave a lot of different instructions throughout the process. I think it could’ve been a little more organized, but given the circumstances it was very well constructed. I am grateful to experience something so different and to try my best adapting to such a different system. I think this will be helpful for the upcoming semesters."
Freshman,4,it was good! my professors were able to transition to online classes very easily and made our experience good when covid hit.
Senior,4,There are many resources available for online learning which makes it easy to learn. They should offer more classes online for those who find it difficult to attend in-person classes.
Alum,4,I studied Social Work at GVSU and took several studio art courses. There are many ways to meet other students and get involved. I lived on campus the first year and off campus the next three years. The only concern I had was a lack of available parking for students who commute from off campus. I frequently received parking tickets when the lots were full or had to walk at least a mile to campus.
Freshman,4,I enjoyed going and all of my classes and professors. I especially liked chemistry lab. Unfortunately my year was cut short due to Covid19.
Junior,4,"I love going to school there. The professors are great and I like how it has a smaller college feel but at the same time, it is still a decent size of the campus. Everyone is very nice and it is a really nice place to live while going to school."
Sophomore,4,"I like the size of the university, and I am in love with the classroom sizes. Make it super easy to learn, and stay focused."
Senior,4,I have absolutely loved GVSU! The professors I have had in the BSW program are very understanding and caring.
Sophomore,4,"It is a great school, its not too big to where you get lost but its also not too small so you don't feel like you're in high school. Class sizes are decent which helps with 1 on 1s with professors."
Junior,4,I will be entering my 3rd year at GVSU in the Criminal Justice Program.  I am in Club Cheerleading and work at an off campus restaurant.
Freshman,4,"When visited, Grand Valley was amazing. The people within the university are some of the best people you’ll meet. the campus is absolutely gorgeous and well placed, its easy to go from one place to another. Im so excited for attending Grand Valley in the fall and cannot wait for the experiences they will give me."
Graduate Student,4,"Grand Valley State University is a four year, public institution that has a climate of success. From my personal experience, academics were pressed with high expectations: professors were passionate, workload was challenging, and coursework content was intellectually stimulating. 

Though I felt stretched and supported academically, I do feel that social life at Grand Valley State is a bit more cold than other universities. This may be due to the large student population and wide spread campus, but I felt that I needed to do significantly more than usual to make friends. 

Grand Valley State always made me feel safe. It is a well-lit campus with easy access to safety alarms in case of emergency. I frequently ran at dusk or walked at night time and never felt in danger at any moment."
Freshman,4,"GVSU attracted me due to its exceptionally rigorous academic curriculum, its cultural, gender, age, economic, racial, or geographic diversity of the student body, and its strategy of fostering global awareness and international experience in classrooms for the benefit of students."
Junior,4,"I am transferring to GVSU in the fall and decided to rate it very good because even though I have not yet started school, the college has been very good about keeping in touch and keeping me up to date on events going on."
Freshman,4,"My freshman year has been very good, I have found that it is very competitive though. This only makes it more stressful on the students who are applying to the medical programs. I have found although that I have learned a lot within my couple of months being there and feel that the academics are very good."
Niche User,4,The college is something that you can fall in love with on sight. It gives you a very warm feelings whenever you walk on campus. You are surrounded by people who know what they wanna do with life and those who want to help you in life as well.
Junior,4,"I love going to Grand Valley! Most of my classes are smaller (about 30 students) per class and I can easily ask my professors for help. Both Allendale and the downtown campus are very nice and the free bus makes getting between the two very easy. There are lots of opportunities to meet new people and join new clubs even when you're not a freshman. The dorms and on-campus housing are also pretty nice and the food is ok to good; no complaints.  The party scene is ok, definitely much tamer compared to some other universities in the general area. 
Some cons include the following: Sports aren't a big deal here and most students are not involved with athletics. Diversity is incredibly lacking. I'm guessing about 80% of student here are white. There's not much going on in Allendale outside of the university but downtown GR is just about 20 minutes away so it's not that big of a dealbreaker."
Senior,4,"So far Grand Valley has been great. Instructors are very interested in student success, and there are lots of resources on campus to help. It is a beautiful clean campus with all the amenities you could want. Transportation to and from is easiest with the bus, and free!"
Junior,4,"I really like my experience at Grand Valley. All students and teachers are very inclusive and nice to everyone. There could be some improvements made to the campus as well. As a commuter, it is outrageous to charge over $200 for a parking pass when we already pay tuition and gas. The bus system they have is not too bad, but the smaller campus size helps. They could use a few more stops and even a few more buses for their busy times. I have enjoyed most of my professors except one in the chemistry department."
Freshman,4,So far I have nothing bad to say about GVSU. I have visited their campus many times and can't wait to start there in the fall.
Freshman,4,"Grand Valley gives you the large college feeling without being overwhelmed in crowded lectures, your professors will most likely know you by name. The tutoring center is free, and there are many other resources to make sure you succeed in your courses."
Alum,4,"I loved the housing and the beautiful campus. It's a very scenic place to go to school, which makes walking to and from class and finding outdoor study areas easy and enjoyable.

The attendance and participation policies could be better regulated, as some professors are much stricter than the general university rule."
Sophomore,4,"The professors are highly educated and have a strong drive to see their students succeed. Diversity and forward progression are important to the administration and students, as well as providing a safe environment."
Sophomore,4,The campus is absolutely beautiful! The class sizes aren't too overwhelming and students are able to get to wherever they need to go on campus within 15 minutes. The professors here are awesome and so helpful and considerate of their students as well. My best learning experience in my entire college career!
Freshman,4,I liked the main campus of Grand Valley State University. The environment was very appealing and had a calming vibe and feel to it. I loved that they have buildings in Grand Rapids and the city looks so alive in GR. The people in GVSU are very friendly and I love the professors and buildings.
Junior,4,I love the culture at Grand Valley. It’s a small enough school to have small class sizes however large enough to feel like you’re at a university. I also enjoy how campus is integrated into downtown Grand Rapids which makes it very unique!
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at Grand Valley State University and I would say that my experience at this school have been more than amazing.  The campus is beautiful and you feel like it's literally a home away from home.  Everything from sports, to academics, to food, and to student life are all amazing and I am glad that I decided to pursue my education here at Grand Valley State University."
Sophomore,4,"Awesome campus, I would like to see it grow in both numbers of students and more buildings. Host more events for students also."
Junior,4,Grand Valley has a number of student opportunities available and great professors as well as a many student opportunities
Sophomore,4,"An amazing school. They have the perfect class sizes so you can decide how engaging to be. It's big enough so if you are introverted or just dislike talking in class, you can just not be engaging and no one will bother you(usually) but small enough so that if you are a super engaging student or just like to show off, you can receive the same level of engagement back(profs will call you out if you are a kiss ass). The resources available to you on campus are astounding. They are everywhere. Informational flyers will appear in your dreams. Not only that, but they help you get what you need(in real life). Getting a job for actual experience in your field is extremely easy on and off campus. GV really is committed to you.(And no, I didn't get paid to say this, but I will willingly accept any money you are offering)"
Sophomore,4,"Attending Grand Valley feels like a dream come true. There are so many resources available for students, the campus is amazing, there's easy access to the surrounding town and the city. My one complaint is that I wish there was more diversity on campus, but there are tons of organizations trying to change that!"
Freshman,4,"I will be a freshman at GVSU next year so I have not actually attended yet. However, my experiences with them so far have been good. The campus is beautiful and the dorms are very nice. I was very happy with the kindness and help I received from all of the staff that I talked to. I also love the close proximity to Grand Rapids and all that that has to offer."
Freshman,4,Only my 3rd week here and I've had a great welcome here. Low in diversity as I am a women of color at a predominantly white school. Great clubs overall.
Sophomore,4,"I love Grand Valley, the only thing that I would change about Grand Valley is that I wish the professors would be more open to differing opinions. Since I am a republican I often get wrote off as being dumb or wrong. That is the only thing I would change."
Senior,4,I wish Grand Valley had a bigger downtown campus in Grand Rapids. I really like the professors there.
Senior,4,"My experience with Grand Valley has been very good. I love that my professors seem to care about me as a student and truly want to help me learn material. If they can see you're trying, they will go above and beyond to help you succeed. Apart from the campus being beautiful, the people who attend Grand Valley are equally pleasing. Walking to class, other students with glance at me with a smile which is a warming presence. However, I would like to see more financial assistance offered. This year was quite tough on me and I was not sure if I was going to be able to pay for what they thought I could. Thankfully, my family and I made it work but the thought of putting my dreams on hold was a scary and sad feeling."
Sophomore,4,"The campus and professors are all great! The dorms are clean and there are so many options for food on campus. The only thing, being an Asian American, Ive noticed the school doesn’t have much diversity, however I expected that when I applied knowing Grand Rapids is mostly Caucasian with not much diversity."
Freshman,4,When you call the offices for support they aren't always completely willing to help. I wish they went deeper in helping the callers and possibly a bit nicer.
Junior,4,"As a transfer student from a 2-year junior college to Grand Valley State University, I would say that I have made one of the best decisions in my life. The overall quality of this school and the professors has made this this an easy transition for me! They offer almost every degree you can think of as well!"
Sophomore,4,I love that Grand Valley does everything they can to make sure every student is getting the best education. I also love how inclusive GVSU is to all students that contribute to a variety of race and ethnicities. Grand Valley is  a very welcoming environment and most of the professors are there because they truly care about the wellness of the students.
Senior,4,"I am currently a senior at Grand Valley pursuing my undergraduate degree in nursing. I have had very great experiences at this school, such as meeting life long friends, being accepted into the nursing program, attending football tailgates and games, etc. Although many of the courses I have taken thus far have been challenging, the majority of the professors are amazing and willing to help you achieve the grade you desire in the class if you are willing to put in the work. I am very excited to finish getting my degree in this next year and I will be proud to say that I am a Grand Valley alum!"
Junior,4,"I found Grand Valley to be the perfect medium sized school. You have the intimacy of small class room sizes but also a very social community. Not only that, but it is a short bus ride to Grand Rapids. There’s not a lot I would change about GVSU, except that some of the buildings are getting old/outdated and need some major renovation"
Senior,4,"Overall, Grand Valley State University is a great school. The tuition is a little high, but nowadays that’s the normal. My classes have always been very informative and my teachers have been great! There are so many ways to get involved on campus and in the community. The bussing system between campuses is also very helpful!"
Freshman,4,"GVSU offers many programs and the variety is one of the many proofs of the institutions excellence. The staff is friendly and great, extremely accommodating and always willing to help, making communication with the institution so much less daunting. The campus is beautiful and there are many opportunities to explore"
Niche User,4,Very friendly tour guide staff and seemingly nice on campus culture. Staff seemed invested in students and students seemed to enjoy themselves on campus.
Senior,4,Tuition is a bit high but the classes are good. Getting scholarships to pay for it is a bit stressful but the programs are great.
Junior,4,"Love it! I am going into my third year at GV and am so excited. There are so many opportunities and so many great programs to choose from. Student life is amazing. My favorite thing is that there are two totally unique campuses - one in a smaller town, one in the city. So, you can have so many different college experiences!"
Freshman,4,"Nice and quaint, most of the faculty really truly care about the students and actually have really awesome knowledge about the campus that they love sharing with others!"
Freshman,4,"I loved everything about Grand Valley from the moment I stepped foot on campus! The scenery, the people, the programs, the food, the living spaces, and the simple energy is just amazing."
Niche User,4,"What I love about Grand Valley is the openness of the community. Everyone is so welcoming and kind. I am a senior in high school getting ready to attend the university, and have only heard generous things about the school. I know several people who are or have attended Grand Valley State University as well who have really enjoyed their time there."
Freshman,4,"Grand Valley State University is a great family University. The university achieves making the campus very welcoming and I always feel at home. The campus is not too big to go out and make friends or get involved in clubs. Professors are open to helping and always have time to spare for students. I have made life long friends so far and earned amazing grades wrokign hard. I would reccomend Grand Valley State to anyone college searching. No matter what personality type you have, you will fit right in."
Niche User,2,"So unorganized, the staff had no idea what to do and didn’t care about the students very much. The teachers were also very hard to get ahold of."
Senior,2,Not Many online course Its a very tradition university. Wish they had more online options for busy professional like myself
Junior,2,tutor labs are super spread out across campuses instead of in the same buildings those classes are usually held in making it inconvenient to attend. Physics department is atrocious. you're better off taking it at CC
Niche User,2,There are a lot of incidents on campus. The safety is not appropriate and the students are very out of hand.
College Senior,2,"There is a strong divide at Grand Valley State university between the Greeks and the other students. Greeks are invited to exclusive parties and I would even go as far as to say they have their own lingo. They tend to have a specific personality that clashes with other students. I would say the Greek life is has many cliques and judgmental towards each other and outsiders. With this being said, they have a lot of involvement in the community as far as their philanthropy goes and the mandatory community service. They definitely do good but perhaps live a more care free party lifestyle."
College Freshman,2,"The Greek students are usually very involved with charities and all that, but they have a terrible reputation among non-Greek students. Greek housing isn't even on campus and it's expensive to join."
College Senior,2,I've been broken into twice and my friends had a break in over Christmas break and they only knew because one of them came back and saw their house destroyed. That's not safe at all to me. They need to fix the safety.
College Freshman,2,"Everyone says ""wow it's so diverse"" but its a sea of white from similar ethnicities and religions.  Coming from the most diverse city in Michigan, I find the school very biased and not accepting."
College Freshman,2,I'm not a part of greek life but many of them treat you as if they're better than you if you aren't part of it.
College Freshman,2,"Everyone leaves to go home on the weekend. It's a great ""school"" but a terrible ""college"". Plus it's dry."
College Sophomore,2,There are not a lot of options for off-campus dining in Allendale.  Especially good vegetarian options.
College Sophomore,2,"I have no idea how to answer this questions.  I have only been invited to one party and I don't drink so I didn't go.  I work a job, go to class, hangout with my friends and study.  I'm not the party type of person.  My roommate went to parties all the time but I didn't ask her about them."
College Student,2,Way too strict. Should loosen up more.
College Student,2,Cops are way too strict.
College Student,2,Make sure you look ahead of time because deadlines are early
College Freshman,2,I hate how strict they are around here. We're adults not children and should be treated as so
College Freshman,2,I didn't receive any; I just have loans to pay back.
College Sophomore,2,You get so tired of it after a while. Never really changes. Anything really good requires to use debit dollars as well. Inconvenient locations
College Freshman,2,"Cost is very high for a 4 bedroom apt each person pays between  $450-600. Rules are outrageous, no hanging pictures, no nails, blinds clean, anything they have to clean you pay double the dollar amount. snowplowing is not done properly and cares are blocked in."
College Sophomore,2,Traditional housing like mine was way too crowded and it was so expensive for the little amount of room you received.
College Freshman,2,I have not received any financial aid because my family is middle class.  I'm paying for college on my own and it is extremely difficult.  I wish there was money available for students like myself who are hard-working and paying on their own.
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much of a party scene. If you know people, you have a better chance. Many students at GV value academic performance over partying."
College Freshman,2,There have been at least 4 sexual assaults since the beginning of the semester.
College Senior,2,parties are all just drunk freshmen and sophomores. They are nothing to rave about and they are a total waste of time.
College Junior,2,"Greek life is too judgmental based on personal appearance, and rumor or drama. A lot of service greek life is not doing anything relating to service; it is all turning social and centered around drama. It is also too expensive. I would not consider joining greek life"
College Junior,2,"financial aide can be quite upsetting for students who's parents have an estimated contribution, but aren't physically able to make that contribution... I, myself, have been having this ongoing issue with financial aide to try to help me, but they tell me that my parents should be able to put this much money towards my college. This simply is not logical. If my parents could really afford to send me to college, they would have done it, but the mere fact is that I am on my own when it comes to college expenses and if financial aide can't help me because of what my parents make, I think that is a real problem."
College Sophomore,2,All i have is 5 bucks to my name and the debt keeps piling up
College Freshman,2,They need more international students and diversity and more peoplle who hang out with people outside of their economic background and share the same ethnicity and political beliefs.
College Sophomore,2,"As a 3.747 student coming out of high school, I expected to get a lot of scholarships, but instead I got none. Financial aid barely covers half of my tuition, so it is really expensive. After freshman year of college, I got a state competitive scholarship, but it was only $300 a semester, so it didn't make much of a difference. Tips for getting financial aid? Don't have one member of your family make $70,000 or more in a year. Even if it is a one family income for four people."
College Junior,2,"The winters in Michigan are bad and unpredictable. The local weather channel could say there is going to be a winter storm and it will be above freezing and sunny out the whole day. Also, there can be so much snow that the plows cannot keep up and even the busses will fishtail when breaking."
College Freshman,2,"That's why I take public transportation - inexpensive, convenient & a green option"
College Freshman,2,Need more vegetarian and diverse choices in the immediate area
College Junior,2,Allendale is heavily plagued by wind and lake effect snow. The only positive side to the weather there is the occasional breath taking sunsets.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Downtown Grand Rapids - where all the bars are is 30 minutes away.  If you're under 21, the cops seem to have a huge presence on campus and its harder for there to be parties from what I've heard."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are no frat or sorority houses and since GVSU does not have a big party culture, the greek life is mainly focused on community service."
College Sophomore,2,"My rating is based solely on my own experiences. GVSU students tend to be very cliquish and not very accepting of newcomers. I feel that I am a fairly approachable guy with a diverse background. My parents are retired military, I recently relocated from Alaska, was born in Germany and have experienced a variety of cultures. I have found ir extremely difficult to socialize with my classmates, and have yet to be invited to join in any extracurricular activities. I have attempted to invite fellow classmates to various get togethers (ie a drink at a local bar, hang out at the Hookah Lounge, group attendance at a concert, etc); but have not had any positive response."
College Sophomore,2,"My experience relates to the Pew Campus, which is located inear downtown Grand Rapids. The selection of off campus housing is limited to run down flats ( stereotypical of big city living) or extremely upscale condominiums. Availability is almost nonexistent as demand is higher than supply. Designated parking usually is an extra expense."
College Sophomore,2,The Pew Campus does not have its own campus transportation. Students who do not have a vehicle use public transportation ( at a reduced cost) or walk. There is a public bus route that shuttles between the Pew and Allendale Campus; it's usually noisy and overcrowded since its not dedicated just for students.
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you have an inflated budget for meals, you options are limited to Big Boy, Burger King or ""fast food""at the GVSU commons area."
College Sophomore,2,"Financial Aid counseling is accomplished by student employees, standard answer to any question is ""Look it up on the website"".  Scholarships are limited in quantity, information is nominal, Subsidized Federal Student Aid is difficult to qualify for and max amount is not sufficient to complete courses without additional funding ( subsidized at higher interest rat or parental funds)."
College Sophomore,2,"My main classes are at the Pew Campus in Grand Rapids. I currently cannot afford the $178/ semester parking permit; therefore I can only use public transportation or walk. Most of the nightlife in the area is geared toward tourists and upscale/ preppy consumers; I don't fit either classification. Entertainment is costly ( ei: concert tickets average $50-$100 per person, decent meals run approximately $15-$25 per person - if you can find seating accommodations, no movie theaters in the area - plays can run anywhere from $25 to $150 per ticket, etc.) if you are new to the area and not VERY outgoing/agressive you will find that most people your age are extremely clichish and are not open to newcomers."
College Sophomore,2,"The first few weeks and winter screw up the bus schedule so that you could have 4 50s run all together to Central Station but you only need one to go to Kirkof. If you have plenty of patience, this is your school. The 37s and the 48s are great buses though."
College Sophomore,2,"Pretty bad. Winter brings out the crankiness, the sleepiness and the delay-ness out of all of us. Class cancellations and very slow bus runs summarize the harsh effects of winter weather at GV. Every other season: gorgeous!"
College Sophomore,2,"Transportation can get pretty rough, with people waiting 20 minutes to get to class on a regular school day when it's supposed to come every 7 minutes. The only grocery store is Meijer but we have several convenience stores around. To get to the store, you have to take the bus. Don't eat at Fresh! Campus dining is pretty good. Usually around five bucks for a meal. The cost of living adds up so getting a job is a common thing for university students. In every season besides Winter, the scenery is captivating."
College Senior,2,The local weather affects my campus experience by dealing with snow storms we have in the winter or the windy weather. Sometimes it affects me going to class.
College Freshman,2,The weather is TERRIBLE in the winter.
College Sophomore,2,"The snow can get really bad here, especially because of the lake. In the past few months we've had several cancellations due to dangerous conditions. In the spring, summer, and fall however, the weather is nice and the campus is pretty."
College Junior,2,"I only qualified for loans, not financial aid or scholarships. This was discouraging because I worked very hard in high school."
College Freshman,2,Not that fun parties seem to be broken up fairly quickly and they always seem to be very dead.
College Sophomore,2,I don't drive and I live off campus so it's a pain to get to class in a blizzard and the buildings on campus are relatively far apart to walk to on campus as well.
College Sophomore,2,I constantly hear students talk about taking drugs or parties they've been to
College Sophomore,2,"The only reason I say the weather is bad is because I hate the winter, if you like snow you'd love Grand Valley but I hate it. The main campus is a 30 minute drive from Lake Michigan so it gets a lot of lake effect snow in the winter and is not fun to walk and drive in."
College Junior,2,Snow in winter is not good. Hard to drive. 
College Freshman,2,Not very good food. Mostly unhealthy. but the Connection is pretty good. Fresh is a hit or miss and Kliner gets old after a month. good luck.
College Freshman,2,They really do break up the fun. The cops have a bad reputation for handing out MIPs like candy. Be careful.
College Junior,2,Not very diverse at all
College Junior,2,The weather affects EVERYTHING on campus
College Junior,2,There's not really much to do for underage students
College Junior,2,"Parking permits to park on Grand Valley's campus cost $300+ for both semesters. This allows you to park only on certain lots on campus. Parking anywhere that is not a ""labeled"" lot will get you a ticket. Grand Valley Public Safety always has 10+ crew members out patrolling parking lots. If you are parked in a spot without a permit for longer than 5 minutes you will get tickets. Finding a parking spot at Grand Valley is incredibly difficult as enrollment is skyrocketing but not adjustments have been made to accomodate every student. It is typical to get on campus 30 minutes before a class starts simply to find a parking spot. Most available spots leave you with a 15+ minute walk to your destination.  "
College Freshman,2,"Not enough different options, it is always the same thing. "
Niche User,1,"this place is a freakin nightmare . It sucks from every aspect . The professors are basically communists who do not give a crap about anything but themselves . Some don't even come to class . Brought everyone back in the fall semester , took their money & then refused to provide any education besides horrible online classes . Fraud basically . then try dealing with the unbelievable system of billing & administration . No one knows anything , endless hold , just fubar . 
go somewhere else & be abused by communists ."
Senior,1,"Worst school experience for the 3 years of my life. The campus doesn't truly care about their students at all and likes to do everything so last minute without any updates to the students upon future improvements and safety measures. Would not recommend this school to any fellow students unless you're willing to be in debt. Unless the school can compensate students understandably and provide the necessary help needed, then I might change my view upon the school. The professors that I have experienced were not a problem. It's how the school itself runs their businesses."
Sophomore,1,"For much of the second semester, we made the switch to remote learning due to COVID-19. I actually only had one professor who made the attempt to meet online for class and continue the remainder of the coursework. One professor only emailed us twice from the time we left until the time he dropped a final exam on us. While the grading system was adjusted for most of my classes I still feel like it was not an accurate representation of my academic abilities. Not to mention I lost valuable classroom experiences that would've enhanced my knowledge relating to my major and even just writing skills. I do understand it was a very difficult time for all, I just feel like my professors could have done more to help continue our education for the semester."
Freshman,1,"Food sucks so bad and it’s so boring. Don’t recommend going here. Also, they try to make it seem like they’re all about diversity but there’s all white kids."
Freshman,1,"If you need vibrance and diversity in your college experience, Grand Valley State is not the place for you."
College Sophomore,1,"Housing for me was a complete nightmare, to say the least. I was struggling all year with horrible roommate placements and housing advisors that were not helpful or caring at all. Rules were not enforced and some students took precedents over others just because the RA's ""liked them better"". Some individuals in the building (myself included) became outsiders for no reason at all. I strongly believe living on campus hindered me putting myself out there and left me feeling a step behind everyone else my age. These were all things I tried to explain to the housing staff but nobody seemed to listen or care. All of my experiences in Grand Valley housing made living on campus something I will never recommend to anyone."
College Freshman,1,"Mold everywhere, our community bathroom was closed down for over a month, there are always broken laundry machines, spiders everywhere, it is just awful. I do not recommend."
College Junior,1,I personally don't care for the Greek life but that is my personal opinion. They attract unfriendly people and make themselves seem better than other people who aren't in Greek life.
College Freshman,1,We do not have a Greek life
College Freshman,1,Nothing goes on at school
College Freshman,1,Every party is broken up within 20  minutes.
College Junior,1,"All the sororities and frats try to tell you ""we're not the same as the others."" HAH! I'm sure there are some very true, selfless greek philanthropists out there but it's too much of a conformity thing in a college setting for me to enjoy."
College Senior,1,I see no diversity here and that's one of the reasons why I don't like it
College Senior,1,"Our Greek Life compared to other schools is a joke. I view it as the kids in high school who weren't popular now having a chance to be popular. They all think they're better than everyone else and walk around like everyone loves them. Non-greeks find them really annoying. They are also really exclusive with their parties, which honestly are nothing compared to the ones I have been to at MSU. It's just stupid and superficial and I would never join. They just built greek housing last year and it's all secluded into one section behind off campus apartments. It's kind of like ""Greek-row"""
College Sophomore,1,I am eligible for very little financial aid because of my parents income.  This is not fair because they are not paying for any of my college yet I have to put their income on the FAFSA.  There is no other option to apply without them.  The interest rates on loans I applied for are so high that I will be paying a lot of money to get my degree.
College Student,1,There is no place to eat...
College Student,1,Very little scholarships available and I got my acceptance letter after the deadline of all the scholarships.
College Freshman,1,"The party scene at GV is terrible...I would not recommend coming to Grand Valley if you are into the party life.  Campus security and police spend all their time looking to bust students.  I'm not a huge partier, but it would be nice to have a place to go and party if the occasion came up."
College Junior,1,We all hate it im pretty sure.
College Freshman,1,"Absolute worst weather I have ever dealt with! The winters there are really brutal. The last year I attended Grand Valley, it snowed 7 months out of the 8 I stayed there."
College Freshman,1,Close to no parties and activities. Everyone goes home on the weekends and the campus is super dry.
College Sophomore,1,"SO MUCH SNOW. We literally live in a snow globe. I don't even live in a dorm, I live in an igloo."
College Student,1,Parties are in apartments.  There are no bars/clubs.
College Sophomore,1,"The snow is up to my waist, the ice is packed 2-3 inches thick on the sidewalks, and the wind is incredibly cold."
College Senior,1,"It's cold, rainy, snowy, blustery...weather here sucks. But it makes you tougher! The student body bonds over the terrible weather. :)"
College Freshman,1,Not much is around here.
College Student,1,The guys are all rude
College Junior,1,Nothing unless you drive 15-20 minutes
College Freshman,1,Its so isolated it feels so far away yet grand rapids is down road. I dont like it here.
College Freshman,1,"The best nightlife is to get in your car then drive up to cmu, msu, wmu, or any other college."
College Freshman,1,they are crappy they dont party
College Freshman,1,Dorms are so small. You cant hangout in your dorms.
College Freshman,1,"They might have ok academics. But the college experience is awful. The dorms are small, the food plans are terrible, and the party scene is just horrible. "
College Freshman,1,"I have visted many other colleges. (cmu,msu,uofm,wmu,ect) Ive had some of the greatest weekends of my life visiting other college. GVSU is so Strict. Ive been stopped and asked if ive been drinking many times while being sober. While cops at other schools only get involved if there is violence. Partys at GV are a joke at rather go home on a friday and saturday night. After a semester here I realized im not getting the ""college experience"" so im transfering out. "
College Freshman,1,The campus is isolated. So you have to take buses. It seems fine at first but it ends up being a hassle.
College Freshman,1,My dorm is so far from campus and when it snows or rains and it is a huge pain to walk to all my classes when I am either freezing or wet.
College Freshman,1,The weather here is very different. One day it could be warm or a very good weather day and the next day it could be super cold. It causes many students to gt sick.
College Sophomore,1,there is a good variety but it does cost a lot and is hard to pay for sometimes. The do give you meals plus dining dollars so that is nice but they go quickly
College Sophomore,1,I have not ever been told about a scholarship opportunity from the college itself.
College Sophomore,1,"Burger king, Jimmie johns, pizza places, mcdonalds and a local pub. That's it if you don't want to go more than ten minutes."
College Sophomore,1,You have to travel about fifteen minutes to get much variety in restaurants. There aren't many places close by to eat but if you travel about twenty minutes there is a big mall and lots of places to eat.
College Sophomore,1,"The weather in the winter can be AWFUL! I don't think the administration considers how far some students have to travel to get to school. Some teachers understand, but for the most part the administration doesn't seem to care."
College Sophomore,1,"Everybody leaves town for the weekend to go party at other schools. If you decide to stay on campus, it's dead until Monday morning when people come back for classes."
College Junior,1,"It is close to the middle of nowhere. There is a farm down the street. We aren't close to many stores but a five minute bus ride to Meijer, a bank and a very food places."
College Freshman,1,"I hated the food there, I'm so glad I don't have a meal plan for next year. It was extremely hard to eat healthy and for the last 3 months or so all I ate was cereal and fruit or yogurt. The food they made was disgusting, it always made me go to the bathroom right afterwards. It was never worth it to eat at any of the dining locations on campus."
College Freshman,1,GVPD can sometimes be too strict over minor infractions
College Freshman,1,literally nothing to do except apartment parties in Allendale. Grand Rapids has more options but only if you're 21 and willing to pay to go out
College Freshman,1,"There is technically ""greek life"", but it is nothing like Greek Life at a larger college. There are no parties and no houses."
College Freshman,1,It's difficult for minority students here at grand valley to feel apart of the system. The teachers are dominantly white and so are the students. I find it difficult for minority students to feel comfortable in their classes due to this situation. It's hard for some religions such as Muslims to feel comfortable because not many people here are in favor of their religion. Plus there is nothing they offer at GVSU to really break the ice of how people view each others religions. GVSU's campus is full of people that expect very less from the minority groups and it's noticeable in the class especially with some teachers.I think this school is definitely in need of more diversity to liven the school to a higher potential.
College Freshman,1,The GVSU Police are ridiculously strict in enforcing the laws on campus and sometimes even in the nearby apartment complexes
College Sophomore,1,"So many cars, so few spaces.  Commuters should park at the downtown Steward lot and ride the bus to the Allendale campus.  If you live on campus, good luck."
College Freshman,1,"The only reason that I didn't rate parking for Grand Valley highly is because of the cost of the permit. The permits cost $175. Considering the people being charged this rate are college students who stereo-typically don't have much money, this cost is outrageous. Besides the cost though, parking is reasonably convenient, I have never had a problem with trying to find a spot, and as long as you have a permit (or at least a day pass) you won't get any tickets. Lots of people simply use the bus system if they live on campus, so they don't really need a car because the buses go to most places they want/need to go."
College Sophomore,1,"I know there are different places to call home here, but it is not prominent. I have been in attendance for a year, and about the only thing I hear on campus is silence following the welcome week."
College Sophomore,1,"it is very hard to get financial aid  through the school; however, the financial aid office will help you get outside help."
College Freshman,1,"Nightlife on campus is non-existent; cops are too strict. Any parties off campus must be weary of as well. Underage nightlife is hard, because cops within 2 miles of GV are on the prowl to give MIPs. Most of the bar/club scene is located downtown in Grand Rapids. But once you are 21 and have access to Grand Rapids (which really isnt that far away), you really wont want to be anywhere else."
College Freshman,1,"The parking lots are almost always full!! It's not to say that Grand Valley doesn't have a lot of parking lots, there are just that many drivers."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I chose this place over several colleges. I wish I hadn't made this mistake. The people here already have cliques from high school and are very unaccepting to new kids. It is very hard to fit in unless you have had to actually work for something in your life. The students are very selfish and spoiled as a whole. The dining is strict, very limited, and very unhealthy. The housing is a drag and laundry is charged very expensively. Not only that but almost everyone here is two faced or fake. The gym may look big on visits, but is very small in reality. I would never suggest GVSU to anyone I want to succeed in life."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Everything is loaded with grease and fat. If you want any sort of healthy food its a 20 minute walk from Freshman dorms. You are also only allowed 3 meal plans a day, so if you have a visitor expect to use ALOT of debit dollars. (everything is overpriced with debit dollars)"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Wifi never seems to work, but when it does, it is pretty fast."
Recent Alumnus,1,"If you're looking for an easy degree, choose here. This place may be recognized as a top midwest public school, but the classes are a breeze. From Gen Eds to actual major courses, it's a way to slack off and get nothing out of college. Do not come here if you want to be challenged."

Junior,5,"I transferred into VSU fall 2019. I came from a smaller school and wanted to move back to my hometown( Valdosta) and be closer to my family. Ever since I did, it was the best decision I had ever made. Most of the professors want you to succeed and will work you to get you the help you need. There are many extra circulars to join and also VSU is good about hosting campus events."
Junior,5,I was a member of the VSU National Championship dance team the VSU Red Hots my freshman year at VSU. I was a full time student at the time and was still able to maintain my good grades.
Junior,5,"Because of covid-19, I had to convert over to online classes full time. It was an adjustment that I had to get use to. After while I was able to get pretty acquainted with normalization of online classes. I was offered tutoring, and even extra work to be able to learn the material."
Sophomore,5,"I chose Valdosta State because it felt like home to me. I never ran in or talked to now person that wasn't very nice and conversational. That made me feel wanted at the school.

Freshman,5,"I love how everyone on campus is so friendly. Even with it being my first year I left right at home. The campus is so easy to navigate, I learned it in a couple of days without having to use the campus directory. Classrooms are a nice size and the staff at the university is so eager to help. The newly renovated library was my favorite place on campus. Inside you can get private tutoring sessions from a student who had already taken the class and passed with a high letter grade. All around Valdosta State University is the best! There isn’t anything I would change about my first year’s experience. All of my professors were so nice and understanding once Covid-19 began to spread and eventually ended our on campus experience. I love the school so much I’ve been able to convince a couple of upcoming freshmen from my home town to attend in the upcoming fall semester. Go Blazers!"
Freshman,5,"My professors were very understanding and willing to help out whenever they could. Once classes were switched to online learning, we were forced to learn how to adjust together. I didn’t feel alone during this process, we moved at a slow and steady pace. A couple of my professors extended due dates to help a couple of the students out."
Junior,5,"I really not the student to ask being that I will not be staying on campus at all. However, from what I heard living on campus is really fun and gives you a chance to connect with other people qiuker to from lifetime friendships that can not be broken."
Junior,5,I love this college it is very welcoming and easy to get help when needed. It was my first pick of colleges to go to when I started to apply. The only thing I would ask to fix is banner because it often would not load up which can be a problem when doing class work.
Freshman,5,I love their school style it give you that california vibes. I love how students interact in events. I love the staff. Its amazing
Alum,5,"As a student athlete at VSU I had the best experience on the court and in the classroom. My coaches, professors, and administrators were very supportive and prepared me for the real world."
Sophomore,5,I love Valdosta State! Only thing I would change is being closer to home! Valdosta is 4 hours away from my home so I don't get to visit often. But when I do I sure do miss school! Valdosta is my home away from home and I love the friendships I have made there. I wouldn't trade it for the world. I am so excited to graduate and see all the successes that I have achieved. Thanks to Valdosta I know I have a future!
Freshman,5,I would like to see more scholarships given to students who dont meet the deadline. as a freshman entering Valdosta I suggest the meals be better from what im hearing. but overall the school seems nice and has a good diversity. my first choice is Valdosta and I am so happy to see what this school brings me with majoring in computer science. in quarantine I am looking up everything about the school and wanting to know more.
Sophomore,5,"I love Valdosta state. It is such a good school I would rate it a good 10 because it is overall good . The campus is big and beautiful, and very pet-friendly. The dorms are a pretty decent size and the lunch room has great food."
Sophomore,5,"I am a rising Junior. I love the independence, but feel I have can ask for directions. The campus is beautiful. The classes are easy to locate. I do not live on campus, but travel from 45 miles away. The classes are small and the professors are very helpful. I am a Geology major and love my professors."
Freshman,5,"Valdosta State University is a small/medium sized university in Valdosta, Georgia. The campus itself is beautiful and easy to navigate. Getting to classes is easy and quick. There are a number of places to eat on campus, including Chick-Fil-a, Starbucks, Moes, Which-wich, Palms, The Grille, Einstein's Bagels, and The Valdosta Bread Company, as well as numerous restaurants off campus. Along with dining options, there are nine dorms to make for plenty of housing options.  For student life, there are over 100 clubs to join, 14 sports, tons concerts, recitals, exhibits, and plays happening over the semester give VSU students something to do at any point during the semester."
Junior,5,"The staff is very helpful. I needed help with some clerical issues and they were resolved fairly quickly. It was a smoother process than other schools that I have attended. If you're looking for a great school that has a very helpful staff, then look no further than Valdosta State University."
Alum,5,"Valdosta State University is a great four-year university in a small, south Georgia town. I was able to complete my undergraduate education with the engagement and support I needed enjoying the slower pace of a small town."
Alum,5,"Beautiful campus that is easy to get around.  Excellent labs and other facilities.  Professors that care and have the time available to offer additional instruction.  Students are fun and friendly.   Athletics teams are excellent.  Only complaint is the quality of the food and the food customer service, the parking security, and that more students should attend the football games (a better stadium may help)"
Freshman,5,It has good classes to help you get the academic you need to start your career. They encourage you to show as much school spirit as you can for the sports as well as academics. All around Valdosta is an amazing school that allows students to get opportunities they can only have once in a lifetime.
Sophomore,5,I like the diversity and opportunities presented by the college. I also like the opportunities for independent content study and the campus job availability.
Freshman,5,Valdosta has an amazing campus. Absolutely breathtaking. The community is kind and welcomes newcomers and residents to the area. They have a huge list of desired majors that are offered as well as top rated business programs to choose from.
Freshman,5,It is a beautiful campus with very friendly people. I love the environment and the town surrounding campus is great. Everyone is extremely helpful and kind.

Freshman,5,The community and majors they have to offer.  The price is easy to meet. Have a lot of activities you can join.
Niche User,5,I love how VALDOSTA feels like a home away from home. It’s very comforting to know that your Professors won’t give up on you even when you think about giving up on yourself.
Junior,5,"I think Valdosta State is great overall. The only issue I have would be with the parking availability and a few professors. Some professors do not show much interest in you, but the few that go over the top for their students make up for the not so good professors! I will say that every professor I have encountered in the nursing program has been great and beyond helpful. They have made a program that has a reputation of being very difficult to a very tolerable, educational, and somewhat fun program!"
Junior,5,I love being able to make my own class schedule. The teachers are great. They make sure you have all resources it takes to succeed. They are willing to meet one on one if that’s what it takes. VSU also offers many resources outside of the classroom to help you like  the library and counseling center.
Freshman,5,"I am only beginning my journey as a freshman, but from everything I have heard and seen, the staff and professors care much about the health of the students and their well-being."
Freshman,5,"My experience has been better than i expected, you meet some of the most friendly people and it makes you feel comfortable and all the nerves going away. The campus is gorgeous."
Niche User,5,Overall my Experience visiting Valdosta State University was truly a great experience  I see my future career starting at this campus
Junior,5,"Valdosta State is an amazing university with opportunities for all who seek them out - from the amazing student ministry program - Delight - to clubs and Greek life, to sports and the student union - it is wonderful and I absolutely love it here - Southern Hospitality at its finest - VSU! 
The administration and counselors at VSU are top notch, approachable, concerned and helpful in guiding students down the path of success."
Sophomore,5,I love Vstate. It is far enough from home. There is always event to be involved in. We are great at sports. The community is great and it is very easy to make connections! There is a lot of ways to get help with classes if needed. The dorms and food choices are great .
Graduate Student,5,I love Valdosta state. The community is amazing. There is nothing I would change about it or the city. It is also very close to Florida and not far from Albany either. The school is amazing.
Sophomore,5,My experience going to Valdosta State University is I love how everybody can come together and have a good time. Valdosta State has a really good academic support system.  V State is just the right size It’s small enough where your professors could take the time out of there day and help you on whatever you don’t understand. V State also have a great student body I love how diverse the school is. The only thing I would like to see change is where we get to park because the parking garage is far from the dorms and that’s unsafe at night.
Freshman,5,They are very quick to help with any sort of questions or issues you may have and are always helpful in whatever way they can be. They make a point to make every student feel included like their time is valuable to the school and the staff.
Sophomore,5,"Valdosta State is truly my home away from home. Since I’m a South Georgia native, VSU is the perfect school for me because I feel comfortable in my environment, and I’m not too far away from my hometown. I love the atmosphere at VSU. Everyone is filled with positivity, and we support one another like a big family. I definitely recommend VSU to any student that wants to earn a valuable education with hospitality and fun."
Freshman,5,It's a very good school! Nice staff and the professors want you to succeed! I highly recommend anyone who is starting school that term or transferring.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Valdosta state university has been a short one. however, the school is a good place to fid yourself, but the academics are challenging to dive into right away, consider pacing yourself at first, it will pay off."
Sophomore,5,I love the diversity of the school and the closeness between everyone. The school gives out many opportunities for everyone to be included. The environment provides safety to everyone in it.
Niche User,5,"I love the fact they have excellent programs for any occupation you want to pursue. I would love to meet new people and this university will expand my horizon and make me a more intelligent, and an amazing person."
Niche User,5,"When visiting Valdosta, everyone was really nice and very helpful to answer all my questions. The campus is beautiful and very large with plenty of organizations to join! The staff and students are friendly and set a wonderful environment."

Niche User,5,I like how friendly the community is and how the school makes you feel welcomed. One thing i would like to see change is the size of the dorms.
Senior,5,I  I II t take online classes. Valdosta State College is an excellent college choice. The classes are easy to find in  blazeview and on campus. Sometime it is hard to get a parking space. Staff & Students are helpful & friendly. Mrs. Veronica walked me through admissions process. My academic advisor (Mrs. Walden) gave me the support and guidance I needed to make the right choices toward my degree. All my teachers gave me an overview of what was required to pass the class.
Freshman,5,"Something that I love about Valdosta State is the campus. Nothing can beat the look and feel that VSU achieves. One of our top organizations is Fire Pit which showcases the school pride that Valdosta State has. Since we just won the national championship for our division in football, our school pride is on a record high . Our president is someone that I look up to personally. Since every school starts from a good leader, one reason VSU is great is due to the leadership that is shown by Dr. Carvajal, our president. Something that I don't like about VSU is that parking is not built with commuters in mind. That being said, it's certainly not easy for commuters to find parking spots around campus."
Niche User,5,"This is such a great school. The campus, first of all, is probably the most beautiful I've ever seen and just from being there I felt safe and happy."
Sophomore,5,"This is my second year here at VSU. I have absolutely loved my time here and cannot wait to graduate from such an amazing school. Most students know that VSU is a small school. The best way to get the most out of your experience is to involve yourself with clubs and organizations. Something that VSU can improve on is the food. The meal plans are okay, but it would be great to have more options on campus."
Sophomore,5,"This has been an amazing school. The academic programs are top notch. I am learning so much and growing as a person. I love the school, faculty and campus. I am so glad I came here."
Niche User,5,"I like the fact that the admissions office is approachable when it comes to asking questions. Most colleges do not email you back and it sets you on edge, but I have currently been emailing the admissions office and they have been very helpful. My god-sister attended Valdosta State University and told me it was the best experience of her life."
Niche User,5,I have been doing a lot of research on Valdosta State University. So far out of the four colleges I've applied for I chose Valdosta State University as my number one. Valdosta State has a beautiful campus and an outstanding academic program. I look forward to continuing my education at Valdosta State in Fall 2019.
Freshman,4,"It’s A cool school it is just boring honestly, academically the teachers care about your grades and care about the students."
Freshman,4,VSU has a lot of opportunities for you. It's a great school. The campus is pretty and the majors are all pretty great. Housing works really well.
Junior,4,The professors make it as easy as they can. Some of them don't really know how to work the online platforms so I feel there should be some mandatory training on that.
Junior,4,Most professors are quite lenient and more often than not go out of their way to assist you with whatever they can.
Junior,4,"Decent sized University, the professors are usually great. It's ok for most fields. Housing is decent, and food options vary."
Junior,4,I love VSU. Valdosta State is a great school with beautiful scenery. The faculty and overall students there are very helpful. Valdosta is a great place to call home and so is VSU. I am glad I chose this to be my school for the next 2 years.
Sophomore,4,"My first year here was very nice, I felt very accepted and met many new people from different areas. My professors were great and the campus life is amazing."
Junior,4,"I still attend Valdosta State University. I am very appreciative of how understanding this university is of their students feelings and they have a attitude that they genuinely want their students to succeed even after they have graduated. I also love that there are so many opportunities at this school alone to be active and social with other students. I also want to throw in that they are very considerate of their students. For example, when weather is severe, they put their students safety and health first. Right now, 
 I do not have critiques on my campus because I just transferred recently."
Graduate Student,4,"GREAT OVERALL SCHOOL,DIVERSE DURING M-TH BUT LACK DIVERSITY ON THE WEEKENDS.  THE SCHOOL IS PLACED WHERE THERE IS NOT A LOT TO DO BUT BUT IS LESS THAN 10 MINUTES FROM FLORIDA. THE CAMPUS IF GORGEOUS, OFFERING MORE THAN 100 CLUBS/ORGANIZATIONS FOR YOU TO BE A PART OF. I WOULD LOVE FOR THE SCHOOL TO IMPROVE WITH KEEPING THE CAMPUS ALIVE ON THE WEEKENDS, MAYBE OFFERING EVENTS ON THE WEEKEND THAT ON CAMPUS STUDENTS COULD ATTEND OTHER THAN ATHLETIC GAMES."
Graduate Student,4,"GREAT OVERALL SCHOOL,DIVERSE DURING M-TH BUT LACK DIVERSITY ON THE WEEKENDS.  THE SCHOOL IS PLACED WHERE THERE IS NOT A LOT TO DO BUT BUT IS LESS THAN 10 MINUTES FROM FLORIDA. THE CAMPUS IF GORGEOUS, OFFERING MORE THAN 100 CLUBS/ORGANIZATIONS FOR YOU TO BE A PART OF."
Junior,4,It has been a great experience learning online. My teachers have been wonderful and the course outlines have been easy to follow. The only thing I would change would be for some teachers to respond a bit sooner with questions on assignments and understanding.
Junior,4,I have had a great experience at Valdosta. I have enjoyed my classes and my teachers. One thing I might change it that some online teachers be a bit more responsive to aid in better advancement in the classes.
Niche User,4,Valdosta State University is definitely a school that I am happy to be at. The schools engineering program is a great way to get me involved into the modern world of computers and engineers while also giving me an opportunity to create friendships with others who share my  interests so I won't have to explore this field on my own without any help. Overall my time at Valdosta State University so far has been amazing and I'm looking forward to the doors it can open for me through this program.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Valdosta State University has been amazing. My only complaint is how they handle a crisis. They can be unorganized and only release small amounts of information to students at a time. Besides that, it's probably been one of my best decisions. I love how the campus is small but not too small, you run into friends here and there but it's not high school all over again. The campus is also beautiful, it reminds me a little bit of a historic area. There are also plenty of ways to get involved on campus and find your college friends. For me coming from a big city, it was an adjustment to the small-town feel but its not terrible living here. You still have all the main restaurants plus some local ones that are amazing! Overall I'm very happy I chose this school, its become my second home."
Junior,4,"The registration process was simple and easy. My parents and I basically did it all on our computer due to Covid-19. However, so far I am pleased with my experience. I was offered a personal advisor for registration through email and online interaction. It started off as a stressful situation, because I was a transfer student and the school was beginning to shut down due to the pandemic. However, the school quickly put things in place to make it easier for future and current students to continue taking classes online."
Junior,4,I enjoyed being at Valdosta State University these past 2 years. I have found a home away from home in organizations and within the students in my major as an ASL/English Interpreter.
Freshman,4,What I liked a lot about Valdosta State University is the amount of resources they have available for their students. Resources such as career days or free tutoring are very helpful for students
Sophomore,4,"I like this school, very friendly people. I love the atmosphere and the different kind of events they put out for the community as well. The one thing I'm having difficulty with is my major. I came here with an idea but then change my idea and realized that they don't have my major so I have no choice but to transfer somewhere else."
Niche User,4,"Based off of what  I've researched, Valdosta State is a beautiful school with wonderful programs for every major. They have a variety of clubs, sports, and activities to offer."
Freshman,4,"My experience overall has been quite pleasing but there are a few things I would change. While the dining hall was not terrible, I did not always enjoy my meals there. I wish there was more variety in my options as well as more consistent meals that I enjoy. I can also tell there are not very many good options for people who have dietary restrictions such as vegan and vegetarian. I live in GA Hall and I like it a lot, however, I have been to some of the other facilities and they are not as nice. Nothing to say about classes or teachers, the ones I had were satisfactory.v"
Freshman,4,"While attending Valdosta state university there were many things that i fell in love with. The scenery is always nice and the campus is well maintained. The students and faculty are very kind and sweet. The teachers there are very kind and any and everything they can to help you succeed. One of the downsides is there are not many food options and the campus is not that big. Besides that, everything else is pretty good."
Freshman,4,"Valdosta State is a university that should not be overlooked due to its overall size. I remember doubting whether I should attend VSU instead of a larger school, but that thought has quickly vanished after attending the fall semester. There are many benefits of a smaller campus including smaller classes, a close-knit community vibe, and better interactions with faculty. Additionally, Valdosta is a great mid-sized city that any college student can benefit from whether it be a part-time job or activities off-campus."
Sophomore,4,Valdosta State University is a great school to attend. The academics and opportunities offered are bountiful. Being active and ambitious is a great way to stay advanced. The school offers a safe and balanced life for their students.
Junior,4,"I think the campus is beautiful and the library has everything I could need as a student. I would change parking, it’s very difficult to find a close parking spot near the classrooms at Valdosta State and id love to see that change to make it a little more convenient."
Graduate Student,4,"I like the geographic location of the school and the atmosphere between student verse staff and faculty interaction. On the other hand, I wish they raise the amount of stipend."
Freshman,4,"Valdosta State University has an enjoyable environment with friendly staff and peers. Surrounding the university is Valdosta that has many things from Shopping Malls to the local amusement park - Wild Adventures. Here, students are also able to enjoy and participate in many events held by the school such as Music Mayhem- a music concert held in its beautiful front lawn with invited local artists. Valdosta State offers associate, bachelor, graduate, and doctoral degrees."
Alum,4,"I loved going to school at Valdosta State University! The diverse scheduling helped while I was working full time and attending school. I usually was able to complete the courses I needed around my work without having to struggle getting to either on time. The staff and advisers were always very helpful whenever I did have a scheduling conflict or needed to be added into certain classes. The professors also were very responsive to emails when I did have a conflict or needed help understanding an assignment. However, what I liked the most about Valdosta State was feeling like they generally cared about the community. There were so many opportunities to step up and lend a helping hand to someone in need. They also hold an annual Relay For Life event that takes place on the front lawn to help sponsor cancer research and to help those affected by the disease. Being able to participate in these activities really inspired me to do the most to help others."
Sophomore,4,"Valdosta State University is a great school if you are looking for a small town feel. The campus is absolutely beautiful! The staff is extremely helpful when you have questions regarding any subject matter. The professors I have had were excellent. Very understanding and willing work with through any situation. The dining halls are average. Some days, there was hardly any good options to choose from."
Freshman,4,Since attending VSU I have enjoyed the academics and the professors have been very prompt in responding when I have a problem.
Freshman,4,"I'm a freshman at VSU and so far my experience has been phenomenal.  The student to professor ratio is 22:1, which means that students are able to receive and experience a high quality of learning, as well as receive extra assistance when needed.  VSU has a lot of programs in place to ensure that students are successful and are able to graduate within fours years or less. Most notable is Student Affairs, as the department work with students during their freshman year to develop career goals and explore different opportunities within their major. 

If you are looking for a college experience with a twist of home, I highly recommend attending VSU."
Freshman,4,"I am an incoming freshman for Valdosta State University, and I am hoping to pursue my bachelor's in Art Education. I have known that I wanted to attend this four year educational institution for a year, and I am looking forward to a fun college experience as a freshman."
Sophomore,4,"Valdosta State University is a good choice for first generation college students (like myself). Advisers and professors are understanding and realize that students have a life outside of school-- especially the out-of-town students. For first-gen. students, VSU advisers and professors will help guide you through the next couple of years and offer support throughout your journey. The relationships you form here will be bonds that last a lifetime."
Alum,4,It was a good experience. Living on campus provided the most out of a college experience. The classes were sometimes larger than others but if you pay attention it will be ok.
Sophomore,4,If you know the right people it is fun! Small community and parties are fun. Enjoyed my freshmen year. Patterson Hall is the best traditional dorm.
Sophomore,4,Valdosta State is the epitome of a middle-sized school. Classes are small enough to develop a personal relationship with your professors and classmates but the campus is large enough to enjoy the same luxuries a large University would have to offer.
Sophomore,4,I loved the size of Valdosta State University. Everything is close to the dorms and I feel like I've been able to have good discussions with my professors because of the class sizes. One of the  only issue I have with Valdosta State is the housing aspect. I think there are quite a few issues that need to be resolved in the housing department. The Ra's and RHD's who are hired are the same age as the students living in the halls so if there is a complex issues with your room or roommates you have to seek help from staff higher up. Work orders on items such as toilets do not get taken care of immediately and if your roommate moves out one semester you do not get notified if a new roommate is moving in. I experienced this first hand. I came back to school after winter break to a new person living with me in my room without any notice. Overall Valdosta is a good school you just have to be willing to go to staff members that hold a higher position if there are any issues.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful and the professors are excellent, but housing is a nightmare. No one seems to really care and, as a student, nothing will get done until a parent steps in."
Senior,4,"All together, the environment at Valdosta State University is outstanding. Majority of people met here are very warm and welcoming! There is a variety of things to choose to do on campus as far as both, activities and organizations. However, what I would like to see an actual change in is some sort of change with staff if multiple students are having not only one, but the same issues with that individual."
Niche User,4,The faculty advisers are very helpful and make sure you are taking the right courses. In addition the Student Support Center is there to make sure students have a place to go to connect and get the resources  they need to be successful.
Niche User,4,I really enjoy the diversity about the school and the welcoming about Valdosta State.I went to a open house and now this is a top 3 choice on my list
Freshman,4,I love the school overall. Campus life is better than I expected. There is always something to do whether if its on or off campus. The thing I would like to see at the school is a track team though.
Junior,4,"For the most part, my experience at VSU had been great. The school offers hundreds of ways for students to get involved and there is no time to ever be bored. I am involved with the Welsey Foundation, an honors student, in a sorority, among other things and I am still able to balance all of my school work. Teachers are always encouraging and work with their students conflicts, especially things they cannot control, like a death in the family. I have only had one bad experience with a professor in my three years here so far. The campus is beautiful and even though I am from north of Atlanta, I feel very at home here in South Georgia."
Freshman,4,VSU is a friendly beautiful campus and is welcoming to all students. The staff is dedicated to their students and the professors are very well educated and easy to talk to. I love going to VSU.
Graduate Student,4,The professors at Valdosta State University are easy to talk to about your program of study. The one on one access makes the experience beneficial to a student's academic growth.
Niche User,4,"It is a good school, and overall the teachers strive for you to be grate and go on with your life to make you a better person and all."
Niche User,4,"When I visited the VSU campus, I was quite pleased with the outcome. The staff is very welcoming and the upperclassmen are very helpful."
Niche User,4,"Valdosta State University is the best school ever! It is very comfortable here, and I absolutely love the people. You will not regret coming here."
Senior,4,"The diversity of this campus is great, and I have not had a professor I didn't like. The staff go out of their way to make sure students feel safe, and the campus police are some of the best. Beautiful campus, amazing and big library, and great dining options!"
Niche User,4,Talking with the professors gave me a better understanding of the major that I really want to take up their knowledge and my ambition and I know that something that I can accomplish while attending Valdosta State....
Freshman,4,Overall my time at VSU has been wonderful and can't to see whats to come for me in the future. #BLAZERNATION!
Alum,4,"I got my B.S. in Organizational Leadership at VSU as a distance learning student.  I am familiar with Valdosta, and the physical University as I only live 100 miles away, but did not visit much during my time here.  I would say the absolute best thing about my experience at VSU was the administrative support and advising.  You will never feel like a number when calling or emailing administration.  They really do put in effort to help you along the way, especially if you are advocating for yourself.  
Some of the studies feel like robot-mode, and I had a few completely disorganized professors...  I would still say that my overall experience was a positive one, and I am strongly considering VSU for grad school."
Senior,4,"The professors in my department care if we have any trouble and don't mind helping out. There is plenty of activities and organizations to join. I like that there are many jobs fairs for part time and career specific for anyone looking. One thing that could upgrade are the different selections in food. The cafeteria, known as palms, does not have as much healthy variety as is should."
Sophomore,4,"My first semester was great but, like any institution, there were some pro's and some definite con's. Although the school does try it's best to be inclusive, Valdosta is not all that big to be as inclusive as they would like it to be. Other than a couple hiccups and grievances, most of my issues come from the student body and less from the actual university."
Senior,4,"On the outside, Valdosta State University is your average college. You have teachers who will cater their teachings to you and some who won't and  food that may or may not be good depending on the day. What makes it stick out though is its beauty. VSU has a beautiful campus  filled with various colors ranging from a multitude of greens, to fuchsias, bright reds, whites, and even blues, which doesn't stop there. It also extends to the people. At VSU, there may be bad apples, but most are free thinkers, accepting, and kind. If you run out of meal swipes, someone may come and say ""I got you,"" and use their guest swipe on you. If you need help moving in, someone sitting in the dorm lobby would hold the door and help you bring your stuff in. By the way if you sun, heat, and beaches, VSU is right for you. It's always sunny and hot, and it's only 3 exits away from Florida."
Sophomore,4,"My first year was bumpy, but the sheer freedom that this college provided me was something irreplaceable, I was in a euphoric haze, finding my around my town, getting to classes on time, getting my grades up, meeting professors, new friends, and just enjoying the scenic view, it may get old quickly, but, it was kinda worth it to meet the many people I did."
Junior,4,"Valdosta state University is a pretty nice university. If you focus on study and club activity, you will be able to success in university life."
Junior,4,"Valdosta State is a great school to attend. The years I have been here have been very influential to my my life. The school has a lot of extracurricular activities that will lead you in the positive direction. The professors will work you hard, and you will get very little sleep due to all the work you have to do. In the end it’s all worth it, because We all know that we are getting one step closer to accomplishing our goals of graduating from the amazing Valdosta State University!"
Sophomore,4,"My experience was great. I loved almost every moment of my freshman year. I made many friends, ate a lot of food, partied a little bit and still went to my classes and made good grades. I remember staying up at night playing Call of Duty, Madden tournaments, working out at the REC, and playing pool with all my friends. It was the best way to spend my freshman year. Spent money that I shouldn't have, but that's life and I was living it. I would change where the restaurants on campus are because you either fell like you're walking a mile, or you're literally right there. I would build another place to eat out."
Junior,4,I like the scenery of Valdosta state university. It has a nice campus and great academics for students to be successful. I would like the parking and safety to change because the school is open for anybody to come on campus and the parking is horrible. You have to purchase a decal and you still technically can’t park on campus or else you will be given a ticket! I would like to see the parking arrangement change.
Freshman,4,Valdosta State is an excellent school to get your feet wet. The students and staff are very friendly and they are big on being involved in the community. The teachers really care about your well being in their class.
Freshman,2,"So far my online class for English has gone quite well. However the online experience can be quite frustrating because I like face to face learning and for the most part technology isn't always reliable. Technology can crash sometimes and have errors and I just don't like that and I love to ask question, so wording questions online can be quite difficult to maneuver as well."
Sophomore,2,"My online experience has been unexpectedly more difficult than when I was on campus. It was harder to reach my professors and classes that were clearer in a classroom setting lost their effectiveness over a screen. There was also a disconnect from certain resources that were offered at school that were essential to your performance and class and the school was a bit too slow to accommodate these resources, yet still applying the same criteria as if we were still at school ( not true for all cases, dependent on professors )"
Freshman,2,I don't feel safe here at all. I can't walk alone anywhere. Don't even think of going to Walmart after the sun sets.
Senior,2,"I thought I would like it here, but with terrible advisors, lack of course availability, and dullness of school events, campus, and sarcastic professors, it's a costly nightmare.  They can change degree requirements, remove courses, then make you responsible for substituting those courses."
Sophomore,2,"I have attended Valdosta State for one semester and after attending I have regrets about transferring there. The campus overall looks nice but when it comes to there academics it is horrible. Valdosta States academics revolve around taking test, there are barely any quizes or homework meaning that if your not a good test taker you could fail. Most classes at Valdosta State are four test classes and when you ask the Professor what can you do to do better all they will tell you is to read the material more. The overall learning system at Valdosta could be much better. From what I have seen most of the students that attend Valdosta do not fully understand the material due to the professors poor teaching methods."
Alum,2,"The years I have attended this school were not pleasant. There's nothing to do outside of campus, but you are within minutes from Florida (some professors commute to teach at the school). Most of the kids go here to get their grades up and transfer out of the school within 1-2 years. There questions about where our money was going and why, terrible parking,  a lot of controversies including the flag, supremacists,  Trump, Ben Carson, overcharge for certain things, and loads of other stuff. There isn't much open-mindedness because of the area it's in.  But it tries in certain areas especially when it comes to student involvement which is where people take pride in the school. College is what you make of it (the friends I made made the place bearable), but with as many distracting controversies and unanswered questions I never truly felt at home there."
Junior,2,"Valdosta State University is more like a community college rather than a University. The class ranges are limited and the professor choices are also very limited, which makes it harder to get your schedule to work out nicely. The campus is nice but when it comes to the educational quality of the college it definitely needs major improvement."
Sophomore,2,So far I think that coming to this school has really deterred me from being the best I can be. The teachers that are a part of my line of study are constantly being fired and it makes me feel like I would have been better off going to a different school where I know that I can receive the education that I deserve. Don't get me wrong it's a nice school but that doesn't change the fact that I am struggling because of some half-baked teaching methods are not helping me achieve greatness for my future.
Recent Alumnus,2,Campus life is very unfriendly to Greek Life with a ton of unnecessary regulations that take the fun out of it. The top execs' rules and attitudes towards Greek Life need to change. They don't care if Greek Life survived or died.
College Junior,2,There is a ton of alcohol and weed in the dorms. Almost everyone smokes or drinks on weekends.
College Junior,2,"Maybe not the worst, but the rate is very high. I believe 1 in 5 women last I checked. Its very common in Remerton and a lot go unreported. Its not safe for young women to go out drinking in Valdosta period."
College Junior,2,Generally they have a bad reputation among non-greeks
College Sophomore,2,never been to game. we lose most of them
College Freshman,2,It's very hard to find jobs.
College Sophomore,2,"The athletics here are a division 2, there are far better schools out there."
College Freshman,2,"While we do have really decent fields and equipment, as well as awesome football and basketball teams that go really far, they don't have good attendance. The students get free access to the game, and the marching band is always there to entertain, so I'm not even sure why attendance isn't all that great. However, it does take a lot of the fun out of the game, given the atmosphere is very bland and boring."
College Junior,2,I've never lived on campus so I can't really say much in this topic
College Sophomore,2,"has been robbery, armed robbery and so on."
College Sophomore,2,"babysitted, really expensive for what it is"
College Sophomore,2,barely any people pay attention to it
College Sophomore,2,"It costs a lot to get a good place off campus. In many cases you want to be farther away from the campus, because it is well known that the VSU campus and surrounding areas aren't safe to be around when it's dark."
College Freshman,2,It's the same thing every week it never changes
College Freshman,2,Mostly fast food and restaurant chains. Not many healthy options.
College Freshman,2,Rooms and residence halls are not maintained well. Very dirty. RAs do little to solve problems brought forth by residents ex. noise.
College Junior,2,NEED MORE OPTIONS. There is no way this campus needs to chic fil a. How about something cheaper like a wendys or taco bell?
College Sophomore,2,I did not like where I stayed. It was messy. The fire alarms always went off and they were strict on our visitors.
College Freshman,2,"When applying for financial aid, immediately after you finish your FAFSA start contacting the Financial Aid Department at VSU. It took me multiple attempts to get all of the information that was needed turned in, and it honestly stressed me out over the summer before my first semester."
College Junior,2,"Since I've been at the school, a freshman was murdered in her dorm, a guy was stabbed in the throat, not to mention that this year we have had a huge wave of robberies and armed robberies. I feel like Valdosta has the potential to be safe with the cameras and lights and shuttle buses but for some reason just can't stop these things from happening."
College Freshman,2,"The options on campus get really old, really fast. And they don't have really any healthy options besides Outtakes, which is quite expensive."
College Junior,2,The campus police only come out after something really bad has happened and they typically don't solve crimes unless the guilty party just confesses.
College Senior,2,"Quite often we hear of robbery, assault, or hit and runs."
College Sophomore,2,I have no financial aid but i have a single mother
College Sophomore,2,Greek life here is awful. The people are druggies and stuck up.
College Freshman,2,The dining is not that close to campus. There aren't very many in walking distance.
College Freshman,2,I haven't truly applied for a program yet.
College Freshman,2,"I am engaged and it is a pain when I try to have my fiancé over. The RA's must enforce policies over no over night of the opposite sex, but I personally think that is stupid, for the simple fact that what about gays and bisexuals??? It is not fair that they are allowed to have their significant others over but just because were straight they cant? I don't expect this policy to ever change but we're suppose to all be adults here so I just think its discriminate and unfair."
College Junior,2,"Cops do not really do anything but walk around and talk to each other. Students are not educated enough about what to do in an assault situation or where to go after words, how to deal with trauma, or how to handle a friend that has gone through the experience."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus could bring in healthier options. fresher veggies and fruit. Keep the fruit separated. The dining hall pizza is smothered with butter, and the normal line serves good food, but the overall menu doesn't have that much variety when it comes to medical diets."
College Freshman,2,"Valdosta used to be a very laid back school, but because of incident in the past things have changed. Valdosta has become extremely strict with visitation and parties."
College Freshman,2,"A lot more could be offered to Valdosta. Once you exit from the proximity of the school grounds, Valdosta looks like an old city that has not been under reconstruction in years. There isn't much to do and every time students try to have social gatherings the police shuts it down before it gets a chance to start. Valdosta used to be a lively area, but it is slowly diminishing."
College Freshman,2,It gets so hot and unbearable.
College Senior,2,The school has buses but the city does not so you will need a vehicle or way of getting around town. Valdosta is right off I-75 so getting north or south is fairly easy. Parking permits are cheap but parking availability is not great.
College Freshman,2,I may not even be able to go back next semester due to housing expenses.
College Freshman,2,There are not many things out there to choose from.
College Freshman,2,The computers themselves are fine. However the wifi just is not reliable at all. It can be a big con at times
College Sophomore,2,"There are not very many ""hot"" guys on campus that are not total jerks and if there is they're taken. "
College Sophomore,2,"The city would be nothing without the school. The school holds all the economy and spunk about the area. There is no nightlife worth going out to but they make up for it in restaurant galore. There is really nothing to do in valdosta besides bowling, movies, eating, and finding something on campus. "
College Freshman,2,"The weather frequently changes. One day it's really cold the next, really warm. Rain is common so make sure to bring an umbrella wherever you go."
College Freshman,2,Probably one of the worst as far as receiving connection. It frequently drops and the speed is very low.
College Freshman,2,The majority of students take part and enforcement is rarely used
College Senior,2,Students have been robbed at gun point and stabbed on campus at night. 
College Sophomore,2,"We have computer availability but the wireless access is horrible and the network reliability is also bad. Sometimes you can have your laptop in the library and the network is slow or the WiFi isn't connecting. It's extremely frustrating when you're trying to study and get work done. It forces you to use a mainland computer. It's okay to use a mainland computer but when you're up cramming for a test, you want to be in your room in your zone not in a hot computer lab."
College Freshman,2,"While the dining facilities have a calm atmosphere full of current music, the quality of service is lacking. The employees don't seem to care about the customer, evident by poor attitudes. If you try to get food within an hour or two of closing time, you will have a hard time finding clean dishes, and the variety of food is vastly diminished. "
College Freshman,2,Called school several times to receive what I needed for financial aid.  They gave me the run around.
College Sophomore,2,"There are plenty of computer labs on campus  and Wi-Fi network is provided. But word of caution, after the first week of move in, WIFI can SLOW AS A TURTLE. the network is in and out when it wants to. You have to be patient with this Wi-Fi sometimes."
College Freshman,2,"Dining options are limited to a Chick-Fil-A Express with very few menu entrees, Moe's and Pinkberry( both slightly on the expensive side), Starbucks, a Nathan's ( this has an erratic schedule, it seems like it's never open), an Einstein Bros. The dining halls are not very versatile with their menu.  So I suggest that after freshman year, buying a lesser meal plan than the unlimited dining hall meals, or simply forgoing meal plans by buying Blazer bucks."
College Sophomore,2,"Valdosta State University's dinning halls would be much better if the were more dining halls, and if there were more varieties in the menus."
College Junior,2,"The majority of the students at VSU are from the state of Georgia and have a relatively Southern, conservative mindset. Although this is the norm, one will also find a reasonable amount of foreign students studying at VSU, which heightens the diversity of the campus considerably."
College Sophomore,2,"At VSU, you see plenty of Asian international students. Some of my friends even had parents from Africa. In contrast, I was usually the only Hispanic student in all of my classes. I would say 75% of the student population is white, followed by black students, etc."
College Sophomore,2,The weather is very unpredictable. It rains a lot and the games still go on but not a lot of people sit in the rain to watch.
Freshman,1,"Probably one of the worst universities in Georgia. Don't let the beautiful campus trick you. HORRIBLE on campus housing, especially for freshman. But the food is the absolute worst part. The dining hall has the same exact thing every single day and there's only a couple different things to chose from. Then all you got is moe's and chickfila, which get really old really fast. The school is also very segregated and people are not friendly. Although it seems like a decent size, it's a small school, in a small town, in the middle of nowhere. Most people that attend here are already from Valdosta, or Tifton. The university does a great job through social media at making it seem like the perfect place to attend, but it really is not."
College Freshman,1,"Alcohol is very easy to get, I know of R.A. Who will willingly hide it in their rooms for residents, as well as provide it for residents. Weed is very often smelled around the campus."
College Sophomore,1,The bathroom is never cleaned and I bring my own toilet seat covers because I'm afraid I'll catch a disease. The designated student parking deck is robbed ofter. Random people walk on campus all the time and police aren't doing anything.
College Sophomore,1,My dorm is so tiny and the bathrooms are NEVER cleaned.
College Sophomore,1,I absolutely hate this school! I'm a sophomore transferring out my junior year. Don't waste you time or efforts coming to VSU.
College Sophomore,1,"knowing the quality of the classes, i would say little value. Some afam class even give automatic A's"
College Freshman,1,"Dining halls are not clean, food is very unhealthy, no healthy options, and no variety. Only thing remotely healthy is the Chic-fil-a."
College Junior,1,"Do financial aid as early you can, so that you can prepare for set backs. It is always a hassle. It gives students a head ache they do not need......which is why I am doing these surveys I need more financial aid. Financial aid here sucks so bad. My stomach turns every time I have to redo it."
College Freshman,1,"Not only is the food on campus bad, but the customer service is terrible. The people working at Starbucks don't even know how to make the drinks. My friends and I will no longer go to the Starbucks on campus, we'd rather go to the one a few miles away."
College Freshman,1,Worst experience of my life
College Freshman,1,I have been to one and I nearly does from hear stroke
College Freshman,1,The athletics at our school feels like High school at times. The vibe and the issue that we don;t have our own stadium is a problem as well.
College Freshman,1,"Valdosta has one of the worst Greek Life in Georgia. Our Greeks barely do anything on the yard, and the parties are never to be heard of. All of Valdosta Greeks need to step it up big time."
College Freshman,1,"There's never anything to do, then when someone does create something it always gets shut down by the police."
College Sophomore,1,"Its the strictest part of campus! you get fined for the littlest things and those minions printing the tickets are everywhere! as far as finding a parking spot in the decks, you can forget it. Parking off campus is limited, but closer than the decks by a long shot. "
College Sophomore,1,"Campus housing is a bust. It is not like you see in bigger universities where everyone gets along and has floor parties and get togethers. Housing here is strict and the staff is usually rude. The housing department head is extremely rude and presses charges to your account just from filing a complaint. If you have a roommate issue, forget getting out of it. you will be stuck unless someone moves out of another room. Oh, and you'll get charged for that too. "
College Freshman,1,"Campus police are jerks. They give tickets out left and right. It's incredibly difficult to find a good parking spot, making the idea of bringing a car next to useless. It's easier on your wallet to just suck it up and take the shuttle."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking can be considered one of the worst aspects of this school. If your are a resident your parking deck is very far from your dorm. They do provide bus transport however sometimes it has a irregular schedule. and if your out past the time it runs,  you have to endure that long walk to get to your dorm. ALSO the parking department goes ticket happy on you and wont take any pity for you!"
College Freshman,1,"So many students smoke marijuana here, it's startling."
College Freshman,1,The parking on campus is awful! I am a resident and the parking is about a mile away. I work around my classes about fifteen minutes away and getting to my car is very hard before work. I've heard commuter parking is pretty bad too. A few friends have said they have to be at the school about an hour early before class to have time to find parking and to be able to walk to campus.
College Junior,1,There is no local transportation besides high priced taxi's. And if you dont have a car it difficult to get around town.
College Sophomore,1,"The food is not very good. The dinning halls drench everything in grease and butter, and it cant be very healthy. Also, the cost of the food is very high considering what we get"
College Junior,1,"It all depends on who one hangs out with but most of the time people are smoking cigarettes. Other times I smell weed. It just depends on the area, it usually occurs by dorms. I do not do or like either, so I wish all together a policy was passed for no smoking on campus!"
College Freshman,1,"There is a lot of parking but for overnight its horrible. You have to walk almost a mile to get to the parking lot. They just recently made the overnight parking smaller. If you're a freshman get ready to walk to your dorm because the overnight parking spots are by the upperclassmen dorm, Centennial."
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is terrible. They have more staff parking spots than student parking. You have to come to school 45 minutes before your class if you want to find a parking spot closer to the class that you will be attending.
College Freshman,1,"there are never any spots available and if a parent comes to pick you up for even 5 minutes, the campus police will give them a ticket. Don't let that be a factor into your not coming though because I heard they are going to work on it!"
College Freshman,1,"Palms is starting to upset me. Same menu everyday. At first they switched it up in the beginning of the year but went right back to being bland. On the other hand, Hopper is where it's at! I give Hopper a solid A."
College Sophomore,1,HORRIBLE..I cant lie. I wont sugarcoat it...The parking lots are far away from main campus and it is so hard to find a good parking spots and if yo park close to campus you'll get a ticket for no reason...smh
College Sophomore,1,"JERK CENTRAL – The term ""Just a squirrel tryna get a nut"" applies DIRECTLY to the kids at this school...not to mention all the squirrels. It's really hard to find someone who isn't just tryna have sex or whatever here, my advice would be to just keep it in your pants. The worst part is, of the limited amount of attractive people, 9 x out of 10..they're already in a relationship.."
College Senior,1,"No Real Advisement – The financial aid office can be difficult to work with. They require major amounts of information and still aren't very helpful. I was never really advised about financial aid, just given the paperwork and told to fill it out."
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking on campus can be horrible.  There are not enough parking areas on campus.  Students have to park on the street and consequently end up getting ticktets.  The price for a parking permit is ridiculous!
Recent Alumnus,1,"You have to call an taxi or an friend to get around . Also, the school bus take students to the mall or walmart on thursdays at 2 and 4 however, those time arent convenient"
Recent Alumnus,1,parking on campus is ou have horrible experince and you must get to campus an hour eariler to find an good spot to park! It seems to be more parking spots for faulty  than students ..
College Freshman,1,Wasting Your Time – Parking on campus is the worse. You can never find place to park. As a freshman a fredhman you may think that your getting a good deal by paying to park but your not; it is a waste of time. You have to arrive on campus like a hour early to ensure a spot.
College Sophomore,1,"Burning or Drowning – It either rains alot, really hot, like humid, or cold but it only happens in a specific order. Its hot during the day, cold at night then it rains before the sun comes up"
College Sophomore,1,Student Discounts – There's not very many student discounts at all actually. The only ones I'm aware of are at a few frozen yogurt places.
College Freshman,1,Parking here at VSU consists of tow parking decks and a huge parking lot. Oak Street parking deck and parking lot are the closest parking for commuters on campus. Residents at VSU have to walk very far to the Sustella parking deck because that's the only place to park on campus except for a few parking spaces in Oak Street parking lot that are never available. The parking ticket staff are very strict. parking is available in front of all dorms but on for 45 minutes. Parking on campus in general is horrible.
College Sophomore,1,Strict? Oh Yes. The police are the worst. They will get you for anything. It can range from parking tickets to arrests. It is a bit ridiculous.
College Freshman,1,"Wireless Access – The wi-fi on campus is by far the worst, especially in the dorms. During the day you can't really get internet unless you go to the library or the computer labs. In order for a student to get good internet in their rooms they have to wait till about two o'clock in the morning when other students are sleeping."
College Freshman,1,Should Be Better – The only transportation available are shuttles and buses between campus. Otherwise if you don't have a car you are screwed.

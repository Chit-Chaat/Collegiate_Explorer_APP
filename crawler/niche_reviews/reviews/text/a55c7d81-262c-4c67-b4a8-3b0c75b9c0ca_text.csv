Sophomore,5,"Its very relaxed, the teachers get to know students since classes are small. In some cases, unique things are taught, like lock picking, and the teachers make it fun."
Freshman,5,"Great Program, Great people, seeking Great Knowledge! What can be stated? Give it a try looking it this university and give a that old college try!"
Freshman,5,I was enrolled late due to waiting on the VA program for tuition.  I was able to get up and going in no time and was able to start on the first day a mere 1 week after starting the application for enrollment.
Niche User,5,"It was nice, the people there in the welcome area were very wonderful! One of them reminded me of my mom a lot which was good!"
Freshman,5,"We would love to see more video of the campus online.  Another suggestion, maybe to allow the course catalog with times and dates to be reviewed online. modernizing the website would be helpful to find the right links and steps toward application, registration, financial aide, housing, other opportunities available at the college etc.  I think I would have been able to apply for more scholarships if I would have known that most of their in house funding opportunities ended in March.  Luckily the coaches through the baseball team have been so helpful to acquaint me with next steps and useful information.  The financial aide office and registrar have been very helpful when I have made calls to them.  I am looking forward to my new adventures at Dakota State University."
Alum,5,I loved going to Dakota State University. The course work is challenging and meaningful and the instructors were very knowledgeable in the work that we did and needed to be done. The collaborative atmosphere is apparent throughout the classes and made it easy to work with other students even if it was online. This is one of the reasons I was drawn to go to Dakota State University. The course work helps me in my professional career and I am able to use my Health Information Administration degree everyday to help co-workers make decisions and direct my work. I would definitely recommend Dakota State University to anyone looking for a degree in Health Information.
Freshman,5,"I really like DSU a lot because of its environment. It is a small school yet at the same time the school is the number one computer college in the US. Being in a small school is great because you could easily get the help that you would need quickly. Not only that you can engage and learn easily because your classes are not crowded. Also for being an amazing school, it is pretty cheap to get in the university. DSU is a really safe college to go to since it is a smaller school. The professors and the people who work here are super friendly and helpful."
Sophomore,5,Dakota State University is a very great university with the number of students in class being 20-25 or more. You can close with the professors for help and there are tutoring services to help you out.
Sophomore,5,I went to DSU right after graduating high school and it was the perfect college for me. I think that it is a smaller college where the professors know who you are and you get to know the students in your grade. I like that they are big into computer science whereas the other colleges that I was looking at did not have a big computer science program.
Freshman,5,I love it here because it is small and everyone knows everyone and its easy to talk to your professors. its like a big happy family!
Niche User,5,"I first heard of this college from a cyber camp with my friends. The camp made me really want to go there with the professors being very nice and helpful. The campus was very nice. After the camp i looked into the prices and majors and was only further in love with it, highly recommended."
Sophomore,5,"At Dakota State, the education is excellent and the campus is beautiful. Dakota state is the size of a community college, with the education of a high end University."
Freshman,5,"Dakota State University is a small college in a small town in a small state in the greater United States. However, there are students from all around the world, teachers and professors from all around the country, and staff who are kind and know exactly what to do in any situation."
College Senior,5,Best transfer decision I ever made. A much better fit.
College Student,5,"My preference was a small and quiet college with a small student to teacher ratio, and DSU was it. The teaching staff here are very keen to what they teach, and each student receives the help they need in order to maintain high grades. The variety of classes offered was actually pretty good considering this is a smaller college. Technology and teaching education are what make DSU stand out."
College Freshman,5,The professors are very friendly and are willing to answer questions. They also are willing to help in extracurricular activities.
College Freshman,5,"The cyber-operations program is very uncommon, thus the demand for students in this program is very high."
College Junior,5,DSU does their best; the students just don't seem to understand how serious of an issue Title IX and other safety risks can be. DSU does an AWESOME job promoting safety and Title IX preventatives.
College Junior,5,I'm an RA so I think it's awesome :)
College Sophomore,5,So far college has been a blast. It has been fun and the Classes are fairly easy.
Sophomore,4,"For the second half of my second semester at Dakota State, all classes transitioned to an online format due to the Coronavirus. Although I felt that this transition may be difficult, all my instructors were very accommodating and helped make the change extremely easy."
Sophomore,4,"I like that the professors at Dakota State seem to genuinely care about the subject they are teaching and the students they are teaching it to. If I were to pick one thing to change about Dakota State, it would be changing the cafeteria hours so that it opens at 6 instead of 7:30."
Freshman,4,I have only been at DSU since Fall 2019. I live in Higbie which is one of the oldest halls. It doesn't have much in the way of heat and has no A/C. I'd like to see more things for students who aren't able to go home or leave school (because they have no car or home is too far away or both). I have made some amazing friends here and love my teachers. The school is great. The food isn't all that good but I am kind of a picky eater. This is a very safe school and town compared to my hometown and I love it.
Sophomore,4,I like the smaller campus during the winter as well as for becoming personal with professors and even other students in your major!
Sophomore,4,What I like about DSU is that it is a small school in which the professors focus on your success. The town Madison itself is small so renting a place to stay is pretty cheap. The school is very diverse and many people around here are friendly and helpful.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy my college classes and living on campus.  The complaint I have is the lack of food choices in Trojan Zone.  It is always the same options day after day.  My food plan, that I am forced to have as a on campus student, is a waste of money.  Many of us end up making our own food in the dorm or going off campus to eat."
Freshman,4,It has many opportunities for people interested in any sort of degree that has to do with computers. It is definitely the best school of it's kind in the Midwest and you will be guaranteed a quality education here.
Freshman,4,"I had an overall good experience at DSU. They have plenty of resources for the students to help with any setbacks.

Something I would change would be more classes offered at Sioux Falls University Center at night."
Freshman,4,I am a freshman here at Dakota State University and my experience has been great so far people are so nice and teacher are very helpful and want to help you!
Freshman,4,"Dakota State University is an excellent school with friendly peers, staff, and educators. Every faculty member at DSU is determined to help every student succeed in the field that they desire. That being said, it can be challenging to make friends due to the students who are studying technology as if an activity is not mandatory most people will not show up."
Sophomore,4,"It is a good school for computer related majors. It is good for some art, but it is missing traditional music majors."
Junior,4,"I love that DSU is a small campus, and the professors really care about the students. They are relaxed and willing to tell when ever a student needs it. I would like to see DSU have better meal plan options for students, especially for students living off campus."
Sophomore,4,"The classes are great, and most of the teachers are really good.  The food in the cafeteria is sub-par, but livable, and the boy to girl ratio is not the greatest."
Sophomore,4,Dakota State is a great school if you want small class sizes and a small town feel.  Great technological facilities and opportunities with quality professors with field experience.
Junior,4,"I was a transfer student going in, and the administrators were all super helpful in getting me situated back into school. The students are a mix of those going into some form of computers, and teachers. The teachers are all pretty good, with the exception of a few who are either too new so they haven't gotten their bearings yet, or some who are too stubborn to change the way they teach. But as I said those are only a few."
Freshman,4,I am getting my Bachelors in Computer Science online and this will be the first time and I would like to say the advisors are fantastic in helping.
Niche User,4,"I took a tour and it's a good, small school. Seems like a good school with good academics. The people are pretty friendly there too."
Freshman,4,"Dakota State University is a great School for anyone looking to go into a tech or teaching career. The campus is beautiful and all the building are close together, making it an easy walk to get to all of your classes. The teachers here are wonderful and are here to see you succeed. The school offers help to those who need it and lots of tudoring opportunities also. Overall, the school is friendly and welcoming to all, and I highly recommend this school for those who are looking for a smaller campus and smaller class sizes."
Freshman,4,"Here, it's really easy to feel at home, and everyone has similar interests so it's easy to find a groups you got into.
The only thing I would change is a greater importance of art to those in charge. It seems to be on a backburner more often than not, but the art teachers do amazing things with what they're given."
Freshman,4,"This college is most famous for it's Cyber Security degree. All the others computer related degree are also among the best in the US. The Cyber Security degree is nationally recognized by the NSA and DHS.  This is one of the most technologically integrated universities. The professors are really friendly and among the best at what they do. There are a lots of major to choose from. The environment is quiet,friendly and secure but there is not a lot to do around campus.If you're someone who's used to partying a lot and hoping to enjoy college life as they show in the movies, then you might wanna consider other options.  The food is fresh and healthy but it's almost the same thing everyday and not so tasty. But then again, I am an international student who's not used to American foods.
If you're planning to pursue a computer related degree, you'll have a hard time finding better university than this, at this affordable price and level of education."
Sophomore,4,"I liked how small the college is. It makes it easier for me to talk to my professors. The biggest change that needs to be done to the school is the food. The food is not always good, and is always the same."
Sophomore,4,I liked how all the teachers were very helpful and kind. Everyone at the school knew almost everyone. The school year was a bit messy because of all the construction that was going on but the campus was still beautiful! I change I wish there could be would have to be all the construction and adding more parking to the campus. Other than that Dakota State University is a great school!
Sophomore,4,The campus is small so its easy to get from class to class as its less than 5 minutes beween the fathest apart builings on campus.
Freshman,4,"A really good school if you are going into something tech. Downside is they have Sodexo for food and the first year dorms do not have AC. But, other than that really good."
Freshman,4,There is no pressure when checking the school out.  They are helpful in your questions.  It's a small university and everyone I've come across is friendly.
College Sophomore,4,I believe it is good.
College Sophomore,4,I had a good experience.
College Senior,4,They take a very active role in making sure students have a safe space to go in case something happens. They also provide a lot of awareness for students.
College Senior,4,"The admissions process was great! As a transfer student, you were put into a separate section than other incoming freshmen. They also gave you a separate advisor to help you through the transition process and checked up on you repeatedly throughout the first semester."
College Senior,4,"I don't participate much in the athletic programs, but they are enjoyable to watch and taken very seriously here."
College Freshman,4,Its small but very detail oriented
College Student,4,"More than 90% of the graduating students from DSU land a job right out of college. The college offers job fairs quite frequently for the students, and the offered majors at DSU are in increasing demand as time goes on."
College Student,4,"Never was there a passing moment in which I felt unsafe at DSU. A nice, small, and quiet community adds to the serenity of the campus."
College Student,4,"The dorm rooms were pretty small, but not uncomfortably small. There was a nice table in the rooms for the two students to work at comfortably. The distance to the classes was just a short walk away, as well as to the dining services."
College Student,4,"Class size is very competitive, with no more than a 20:1 student to teacher ratio. The advisers at the school are very knowledgeable and helpful. I would definitely choose DSU as my primary school."
College Sophomore,4,"Crime is relatively low on campus - I have not had any problems with safety since going to DSU. The residence buildings are on complete lockdown after 5pm unless students have a biometric scan on file, so going to buildings after hours is always secure too. There are security personnel on campus day and night to ensure student safety, and I feel very safe on this campus. Of course, as a female, walking alone anywhere at night makes me wary, but at DSU I feel confident and comfortable walking across campus. Naturally I still exercise reasonable precaution, but it never hurts to be prepared. Either way, DSU is an extremely safe campus."
College Sophomore,4,"The academic quality of DSU is one of the best things about this place. The professors all seem to know what they are talking about, have the qualifications, and seem very passionate about what they teach. As an aspiring future professor myself, I look zealously for these traits in my own teachers, as it is something I think every teacher should have regardless of the subject they are teaching. 

The professors on campus make me actually want to go to class and learn, but they also offer extensive office hours where the conversations can become even more interesting and insightful than those that take place in the classroom."
College Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love it at DSU. The instructors are really great in their fields, they actually know what they are talking about, and I enjoy going to class to learn from them. Plus, since it is a small campus you really get to know the faculty outside of the classroom too. As an English Education major, most of the English department know me personally and I enjoy just chatting with them. 

Dakota State is very technologically integrated too. Every student is lent a tablet computer for classwork and they work really well for homework. They are not pristine machines, but they get the job done. 

The campus is small, the environment is super friendly, not to mention really nerdy (which I love), and the friends that I have met here are like my new family. I would not change anything about my situation if I could, except to maybe become more involved on such an awesome campus!"
College Sophomore,4,People usually follow the policies that we are given. Though the smell in some dorms could be better it is nice. The dorms are convenient because they are located close to where your classes take place.
College Sophomore,4,"The Athletics are about the same as how it was for my high school. There is spirit and support, but you also have the people that don't necessarily care for sports."
College Sophomore,4,There are parties around town that people attend; also most people get together and play games.
College Sophomore,4,"Certain professors are great. With that said there are professors that are not as great. I have yet to fell overloaded with assignments, and if someone wants a quiet place to study there is a library on campus."
College Sophomore,4,A lot of people are accepting. DSU also is involved in foreign student programs. A lot of the people who work in the food services on campus are foreign.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms at DSU are well kept. They are cleaned daily, except weekends. The people here are friendly and you can usually find someone that has the same interest as you. The dorms are also close to the buildings you have classes in, so they are very convenient. The worst thing about living on campus is that a good percentage of people here don't shower, and if you're stuck in the halls where they don't, it will smell."
College Freshman,4,"I chose this school due to the fact that it was the cheapest in state and had the best graphic design course at an affordable cost. This college is very heavily technology oriented. There are always gaming events going on, which I find intriguing even though I am not a big multiplayer game person. I've recently been recruited to help with propaganda for Nanocon since my major is Graphic Design. I was very excited by this considering that I am only a freshman, and everyone says that you never get any good opportunities when you're a freshman."
College Freshman,4,"The classes are good, and the cyber program is unique. Very few schools have the facilities, training, or degree to focus on cyber security. The professors are approachable and good teachers who care about your success."
College Freshman,4,DSU is a safe campus.
College Freshman,4,The professors are helpful and caring. They take time to get to know you as an individual and are accessible.  They want to see you succeed.
College Freshman,4,I have heard from DSU alumni that the education we receive gives us an edge in the job market.  I'm just getting started here but I am optimistic about my career prospects.
College Freshman,4,DSU is great due to its smaller size which helps create community.  My favorite experiences are hanging out with my friends playing games and studying of course.  The Anime Club is awesome!  I feel at home here.
College Sophomore,4,There is very little crime on campus. It is a very safe environment and you don't have to worry about anything bad happening to you or your belongings.
College Sophomore,4,I am really glad I decided to attend Dakota State. The courses are easy and the teachers are very helpful.
College Freshman,4,"The university is small, friendly, and there is quick access for all classes."
College Junior,4,"Need more study space! But otherwise, great professors and classes!"
College Junior,4,Very good professors who are enthusiastic about what they do; small class size makes it nice. Only wish the courses were offered at more than one time a semester.
College Junior,4,I love DSU! I just wish that the options for course times is more diversified as this semester I am taking three art labs in one day and one art lab on the other day. It'd be nice for it to be more even so I am not sitting in class from 8:30am-6:30pm.
College Freshman,4,"So far, the professors are willing to work to work with anybody that asks for it."
College Sophomore,4,The teachers are young and great at what they do.
College Freshman,4,"I am a transfer student and getting everything over to DSU was a very easy process. They were ready to help me and made sure I applied for everything I was eligible for. At my previous college, I was never aware of certain scholarships I could have gotten and at DSU, they talked with me about them."
College Freshman,4,"I am a commuter student, so I do not live in the doors, but have friends in the dorms. They seem happy with their room and roommate and the cleanliness of the buildings."
College Freshman,2,"Freshman residence is rather poor in that RAs do not enforce policies, so there are people yelling all through the night, despite mandatory quiet hours. This makes life difficult for those who have difficulty sleaping"
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of students do not show support of the sports teams here. The school spirit is one of the worst I have seen. The athletic facilities are super nice, because we just got a new gym floor. There are few fans of any athletes here. Most of the fans attending games are family of someone that is playing. Not a lot of students show up to games, which is disappointing."
College Student,2,same stuff everyday. very bland
Recent Alumnus,2,"The nightlife on my campus is slim to none. Unless you are of drinking age, there isn't much to do. Because it is in such a small town, there are only three bars and they usually have police officers there. Honestly, I am not much of a partier, and I don't believe that the night scene impacts the students in any way. We usually find something to do without spending money so it usually works out pretty well!"
Recent Alumnus,2,The school spirit at my school is very mediocre. Many students feel as if they have better ways to spend their time due to the lack of winning.
College Freshman,2,"There are two different parking passes - blue and green. Blue costs more, and there are less of them, but they are closer to the dorms."
College Freshman,2,"There is only one gas station in the entire town that is open 24 hours. Also, there is four fast food restaurants, and about five sit down restaurants."
College Freshman,2,"Hot in August, no AC. Terribly cold winter - SNOW."
College Sophomore,2,"there are not many kids, and some don't like to be social.  It is usually the same people at every party."
College Freshman,2,"y now, undergrads across America have moved into dorms, tossed the semester's first Frisbees on the quad, and played awkward ice-breakers on the first day of English 101. While making new friends, settling in, and paying attention in class are important pursuits, locating — and experiencing — the dining hall should be a top priority. And discovering which schools have the best ones has been ours.

This year, The Daily Meal went big, setting out to determine the best in campus dining across the nation — from small liberal arts colleges to Big Ten mega-universities. In an epic study that spanned the entire summer, we examined the dining programs at every four-year college in America — more than 2,000 of them. What we found was both frightening and impressive."

Recent Alumnus,2,"There is not really a Greek Life at the off campus site in Sioux Falls but the Greek life at the main campus in Madison has been helpful for that community. They have helped at that community when disasters have it in the past and they do have a night life in the form of parties, which is useful in helping new people to the area make friends, but they keep it out of the public's eye."
College Junior,2,Over all the Greek life of Dakota state is ok. But in all honesty i cant really tell the different between the Greek students but i can go by that the non Greek students for the most part everybody is pretty friendly and the social life couldn't have been better. And the housing around here is very local and pretty much well built in the most part.
College Freshman,2,"No Thank You – Madison is a small town, so the restaurants are minimal.  The dining hall quality is not very good, however it's not always bad either.  It's usually just in between."
College Freshman,2,"To be honest, the Greek life at DSU does not effect the campus that much at all.  You don't hear about them very often, and since most of them require Junior/Senior status in the school, you probably won't know many of them.  Nobody views Greeks differently, but a lot of Greeks are involved in tutoring and academic help.  I think Greek housing is just houses around campus.  I've never personally been to one, so I don't know."
College Sophomore,2,"Technology as a Whole – So the positive thing about the computers here at DSU the students to have access to a computer lab. Printing,network reliability, and speed are a great disappointment for one of the schools known for its technology."
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life on campus.  The campus is not big enough and I believe DSU does not want it.
Recent Alumnus,1,"In my opinion certain professors in the computer courses are not making the efforts to teach the students, but direct them to the manuals, Google, or software  documentation for studying. Some of them are not willing to be contacted and mention that they will respond with the picture of a cat if bothered with questions...
Once the assignments are completed, you have to ask for explanations on what was the solutions, because they do not have any intentions to share with you the results, and they just go to the next class. The assignments have to be completed in 4 days, no matter what... and there is no catch up work allowed. I would think twice before enrolling in this university..."
College Sophomore,1,"Other than the occasional dance or party, there is nothing ever happening in this small town, especially for the college students. It would be nice to have a few more options of fun."
College Freshman,1,"It Snows a Lot, but Don't Expect Classes to Get Canceled – It snows a lot, but don't expect classes to get canceled"

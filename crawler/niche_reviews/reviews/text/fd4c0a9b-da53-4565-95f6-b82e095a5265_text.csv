Sophomore,5,"One thing I like about Wingate University is how friendly and welcoming the students, staff, and professors are. I feel like I belong there."
Sophomore,5,I took online classes for about a month during the pandemic and it was hard for me because I learn better in person. But the professors were very clear and very helpful. They were available to help us 24/7 and really laid back because they know it is a great adjustment for us and for them.
Alum,5,"I did not take any classes online at Wingate as I am an Alum; however, the online interface that Wingate uses works well."
Alum,5,"Wingate is a great school where faculty and staff care about their community and students. After graduating and beginning a career in higher education, I reflect fondly on my time at Wingate. As long as a student gets involved in what they can, they will have a great experience both inside and outside of the classroom."
Freshman,5,Wingate has been woking very hard to make their students transition to online learning as smooth as possible.

Graduate Student,5,"I have had a great experience here at Wingate. The campus is beautiful. I have made lifelong friends and continued my education here.

Sophomore,5,"I am currently a sophomore at Wingate University, but I love attending this school. When I moved in, I only had one friend and felt like I didn't belong there. But then as the first week went by, I made a lot of friends that lived in my dorm and I felt like I was at home. Wingate is most definitely my home away from home, and I cannot wait to go back in August!"
Freshman,5,Amazing music program. Dr. Potter is amazing with working with singers. My sister attended this school before I did and she said it was the best time of her life. I have also enjoyed the school in my time as a freshman. The Café has amazing food and I heard we're getting a Chick fil a next year.
Sophomore,5,"Wingate University is an amazing schooled filled with amazing professors, staff and students. Wingate ensures that their students feel welcomed and at home and most importantly involved with the school throughout the year"
Freshman,5,"I love the academics here, and I love the availability of the teachers. However, can you please add some more eating options."
Freshman,5,"As a freshman at Wingate, it's a clean and very calm atmosphere. Being a small university the one-on-one connection with professors is helpful. The provided Academic resource center helps with every class provided."
Sophomore,5,"I like that Wingate is not far from my home, the campus is clean, and the offer all the classes I need throughout my pharmacy education without having to transfer to a different school for some of the education. There needs to be more safety implemented in the school."
Freshman,5,"Originally, Wingate was not my first choice. I was on edge for a while on whether I wanted to attend this school. Then I got the opportunity to visit the campus. It was absolutely beautiful! Everyone was extremely friendly. The warmth and lve that I felt on this campus was like no other."
Alum,5,My overall experience at Wingate was wonderful.  All the professors were knowledgeable and approachable.  The rapport between professor and student was incredible as well.
Niche User,5,"I love the community between the students, the gorgeous campus, and the amazing athletics. It is amazing how much the professors care about their students."
Senior,5,"I like that it is so small, so I'm sad that they're changing that by adding so many extra freshman each year. It should feel like a family and Wingate it losing its small-town feel."
Niche User,5,I went to visit the campus and fell in love with the campus. This is my upcoming senior year and high school and have already made my decision of where I will be attending come the Fall of 2019.
Sophomore,5,"It’s a good school academically, some things like the food could be definitely improved however and parking."
Freshman,5,"An AMAZING place to earn a degree! Whether you want to be a vocal teacher or surgeon or major in criminal justice or be a concert pianist, this place is for you! Great staff, and excellent orientation! As a freshman, I felt welcomed the moment I stepped through those GATES on my way to be a Bulldog. I am eager to start learning here and know that anyone will enjoy this college!"
Freshman,5,"Wingate University is a super small and cozy campus with beautiful surrounding landscapes. I love how friendly and helpful all of the staff is. The café even has an app to help diabetics find the information needed. The dorms are close to classes and food, which is always good. I realize that it is a private university, but the overall cost should be more lenient and able to cooperate with for students with disabilities who cant pay for school after medical bills."
Freshman,5,I loved Wingate from the moment I toured it because it felt like home. I still enjoy Wingate because I would not want to go anywhere else. It is my home and that is where I will stay until I graduate and find a new home.
Freshman,5,Wingate is a special place. The people here love going to school here and enjoy life as a college student. All of the sports teams are highly ranked and win the conference almost every year. I like how they are so competitive and how it is a big part of life as a college student.
Freshman,5,"Its a great University with many opportunities to join clubs , be a part of staff , Study aboard , make friends and even go to Christian group meetings. Help is right at your fingertips , you just need to ask ."
Niche User,5,"wingate was an amazing experience. Everyone was nice and chill. once you were there, everyone would greet you with hellos and always had a smile on their faces."
Freshman,5,"I loved everything about Wingate. There isn't anything I would change. When I toured the school for the first time I automatically fell in love, it was everything I dreamed of and more. The tour guide Sarah was amazing and all the people we walked past said hi and were so welcoming. The dorms were so cute and just my style as far as set up and my admissions counselor Kayla answered a lot of my questions which just made me even more excited to start in the fall. I am also very glad that it is a christian private school!"
Niche User,5,I have experienced wingate by attending on their campus tours and other activities. I hope to attend in the fall of 2018 as a major in pre-med
Niche User,5,It is a lovely school! The advisors are very helpful and kind. I got to sit in on a class to see what a college chemistry class is really like. The campus is so beautiful with several fountains and water displays. It has an old timey feeling because of the older building.
Niche User,5,"When I had taken a campus tour, I could already tell that Wingate was an amazing institution. The class sizes are just the right size, the staff seem very friendly and welcoming, there are various amenities (fitness building, on-campus shops/dining facilities) to utilize, and I personally loved the diversity of students and clubs."
Freshman,5,My experience at Wingate so far has been amazing. I am thriving well in a college with a small class size and various resources for success.
Freshman,5,"There's so many volunteer opportunities on campus that will help keep someone involved in the community. It gives you an opportunity to network and meet the different kinds of people you find on this campus. The library's service is always on point! They've always been so helpful and it's never been too crowded for me to get a spot at the computer lab or have a place to study. My professors were amazing in every way and I never once left the classroom with unanswered questions. Communication is reliable with professors as long as you attend classes as regularly as possible. At Wingate, you'll get a nice exercise because walking is mostly how students get around."
Freshman,5,There are things to do for everyone to feel involved in campus life. The small class size lends to a positive learning environment.
Sophomore,5,The moment I set foot on the campus I felt at home and welcomed. Their are so many opportunities and events that take place at Wingate University with I love. Something I would like to change is the meal plans for commuter students. I am a commuter and I found that the plans were not worth buying due to the prices.
Niche User,5,"I have officially been accepted to Wingate.  I had an opportunity to visit the campus and right now, it's probably at or near the top of my list. The campus is very nice and inviting.  I'm looking for a smaller campus with a large campus ""feel.""  Everyone was very friendly and my tour guide was outstanding."
Niche User,5,Wingate is a great school. They have a great football team and great academics. I applied to Wingate and got the Presidential Scholarship with the acceptance letter.
Freshman,5,"From what I have experienced, This university is really good, I am excited to get the year started and everyone has been really nice."
Senior,5,"The campus is beautiful, staff are personal and friendly, and there are tons of opportunities for all students on campus. It's perfect for anyone wanting a personal college experience and lifelong friends!"
Junior,5,"Wingate University is a great place to continue your education! I transferred there after obtaining my two year, Associate's degree, and it was one of the best educational decisions I have ever made. There are a ton of majors and minors to choose from and the professors are top notch. The administration at Wingate truly care about the students and do all they can to help. The student life at Wingate is incredible! There is always something going on! I really enjoy attending this school! I have one more year left and I will have my Bachelor's degree!"
Niche User,5,My visit to Wingate was very informative and help. I liked the entire campus and had a great time there.
Niche User,5,I have visited Wingate University twice and I love it. It's my favorite university out of all of the ones that I have been too. Wingate has a beautiful campus and the students and staff are wonderful. The students are full of schools spirit and the staff have been really easy to work with and have been nice. I recommend to everyone that they should go and at least visit Wingate University because they will love and and decide to go there. I have decided that I will attend Wingate University in the fall of 2017.
Niche User,5,"Fantastic, student-led tour.  Beautiful campus.  Excellent opportunities to study abroad.  Met with professors and coaches, who were generous with their time, and very interested.  Highly recommend this school to anyone who wants a good education with a great student:teacher ratio.  Academic and athletic scholarships are very generous."
Sophomore,5,I love Wingate because of the flexible professors especially if you participate in sports. Everyone takes care of one another and it's like a family.
Freshman,5,"Wingate University is a great Iniversity filled with multiple opportunities to get involved in extra curricular activities, I have always loved to dance and be active and I wingate I finally decided to take a risk and auditions for the dance team, and glory be to God in the highest, I made it."
Sophomore,5,"Wingate is a small campus and makes you feel at home. Students are not just a number; professors take the time to get to know their students in and out of the classroom. There are many chances to get involved and get connected with faculty and staff, as well as the community. If there is one thing I would change, it would be the food options, although there will be more options in the next few years."
College Sophomore,5,Mostly well lit areas around housing.
College Senior,5,"Course offerings could be better but it is pretty great! Class sizes do not allow for laziness, professors can tell if you're texting or sleeping."
College Senior,5,"I am involved in greek life. I would encourage anyone to go through. I have really grown into myself and learned a lot about who I am thanks to my organization. Greek life encourages diplomacy, understanding and acceptance. This experience can really help you prepare for the real world. Greeks are not really a concern of non-greeks, we coexist well! The housing is not ideal, there is a greek village on the north-west portion of campus. Each organization has two separate apartments with 4 private occupancy rooms in each. This area is very social and allows you to meet other greeks and non-greeks!"
College Senior,5,"I love wingate. It is my home away from home. I transferred here after an awful first year at another college. I came to campus and was welcomed by orientation leaders and students from organizations on campus. They moved me in and helped me get settled. The welcome week events are great to help you get to know people on campus. Wingate really values this initial experience because they know it will make/break your Wingate experience. The food is mediocre, but you can move into an on campus apartment with kitchens as an upperclassmen! I would choose Wingate again because my professors are amazing and caring, it's easy to be involved, and I have met some of my very best friends here."
College Freshman,5,Nursing is competitive and I am excited to be a part of the pre-nursing career
College Freshman,5,I feel extremely safe with Campus Safety around campus available for escorts and protection.
College Freshman,5,"I cannot complain, I lived in Alumni Residence Hall and we didn't have sinks in the room like JM Smith but the layout and space made the residents close like family and we all got along really well. It was also convenient to be able to leave 2 minutes before class and still make it on time."
Junior,4,I like that its a small school with small class sizes. I would like for the school to be more diverse though.
Junior,4,"My last semester all my classes were online due to COVID-19. All my teachers did really well in transitioning, and provided powerpoints, recorded lectures, and time to talk online."
Senior,4,"Wingate is a beautiful and calming campus. I love the smaller classroom sizes and how you can easily talk and connect with your professors. The beauty of the campus and the small classrooms are what attracted me to the campus in the beginning. As I have been attending Wingate, I have loved the atmosphere of the campus/classrooms, and it's astonishing at how much it feels like home. I am glad that I chose to go to Wingate as my first choice in colleges."
Senior,4,I took all of my classes online when the Corona Virus got bad. I think it was a little difficult for me to transition quickly from face-to-face to online. The teachers did a great job of communicating and still being able to keep on schedule and give updates about what we were doing in the class.
Junior,4,"While I've only attended the University for almost 3 years, I can say that my favorite thing is the campus life. There are always activities and events to go to. Professors take their time to get to know students so its a better way of understanding how they can help the students do the best they possibly can."
Sophomore,4,My online experience was actually good the teachers were able to communicate with us a bit different but they were able to answer any questions we had.
Freshman,4,"Wingate University is small quintessential University in Wingate, North Carolina. Because of its small nature the atmosphere on campus is so inviting and gives off a very homey feel. Southern hospitality is a real thing and every student and faculty member on campus couldn't be any nicer. Wingate is also a very diverse community and also has a vast student population of internationals as well."
Freshman,4,"Classes are VERY challenging.  You have to be on top of your work.  Upper class-men are always willing to help, but you have to ask for it."
Freshman,4,"This college is great if you're looking for a small, close feeling college. The classes are small sizes and the teachers genuinely care about all of the students and you get to know them personally. The only issue is that there isn't much to do around the school unless you drive to Charlotte."
Freshman,4,"I love it here at Wingate. The professors are amazing and really helpful when it comes to any questions I have about the material. Although it is an amazing school education wise, I wish they would improve in other areas. For example, the food is not the best. The dining hall gets old after about a week of having to eat there everyday. The food does not taste the best either. I am really happy about the Chick-Fil-A, however, I feel like we should get three meal exchanges a day rather than two. I also think that they should improve the living conditions of both Old Cannon and Helms. I know in Old Cannon it is moldy and definitely older than other residence halls. I have had countless friends from other dorms come to my room and call it prison compared to theirs. Since we all pay the same price for room and board, I think our rooms should be similar. One person should not get better quality of a room than another."
Freshman,4,"My experience is very good. I've meet great professors who really enjoy and force themselves every day to make sure you learn, and are heading to the right path towards your career. Great people and students who help one another and also guide you. Making sure you are having fun, but also showing you the ropes to the university."
Sophomore,4,So far my experience at Wingate University has been very good so far. Most of my professors have been kind and are good at what they teach.
Niche User,4,"I have traveled to the campus and there seems to be a lot of great activities, clubs, and school events that allow the students to enjoy themselves while they are getting their college education. The cafeteria seemed nice and there were multiple other fast food options.  Overall, it was a nice, humble place to attend as a college student."
Freshman,4,"I am happy with my time at Wingate, I feel like the professors really care about the content they are teaching as well as how you as a student are coping."
Senior,4,"Wingate University has an incredibly beautiful campus. It is small, but this is what makes it more like home. There is a strong sense of community and diversity because a large part of the students are international. I am from Spain and in these last four years I feel I have developed a second family here in America. Students build close relationships between themselves and with their professors, who are willing to help as much as possible. There is always something to do at Wingate, if you want to be involved, you for sure will have a huge variety of clubs and activities to choose from. My team signed up this year to the intramurals volleyball tournament and we had so much fun and met new people. On the other side, one thing I would change is the parking lots. Half of them are gravel and there is not enough room for students, commuters and faculty/staff. Overall, there are always pros and cons to anywhere you go, but I wouldn’t change my decision to study at Wingate."
Freshman,4,I enjoy Wingate very much due to the attention to detail in my lectures as classes are small. They provide excellent opportunities across many different majors and I try to utilize them as much as possible. A change I would like to see would be the size of campus that's all but overall it is a very nice place to live and study.
Junior,4,"Wingate is a small school filled with some really incredible students and teachers. The campus is beautiful and making friends on campus is easy. However, the college trying to get to big to fast. The cost of tuition is going up and it’s a fairly expensive school. Class size is small so there is plenty of room to ask questions and engage in more meaningful learning. All of the professors are open minded and are there to help hep students individually if needed."
Junior,4,It has given me an opportunity to complete my degree and create connections with professors and other important people around campus.
Niche User,4,Wingate University is a beautiful campus that continues to build on it's campus and expand its diversity from housing to athletic equipment. For a private school I like their investments and their support for students.
Sophomore,4,The small classroom size is great every professor knows who you are and will put time a side to help you with any questions you may have about anything.
Junior,4,"Wingate is a school that really looks out for you. The small atmosphere creates a   family feel, but the small surrounding town infringes on the overall quality of the college experience."
Sophomore,4,Very welcoming campus! Diverse student body with engaged faculty with very flexible schedules. Teachers actually care for students wellbeing and will go out of their way to help you succeed.
Sophomore,4,"Wingate University has changed my outlook on life. There is a diverse group of individuals there that offer many unique outlooks on life. Both the students and professors are kind individuals who make a point to share an intimate connection with each other. The campus is clean and offers many kinds of extracurricular activity. Regardless of ones background or beliefs, Wingate University is a campus which has a home for everyone."
Sophomore,4,"I love it at Wingate, I have just finished my first year and it is great, the campus is beautiful and the teachers are wonderful."
Freshman,4,Wingate Universtiy is a great university. It is a small campus but very easy to get around. All of the professors are great they help you with everything you need. The staff is great and very friendly.
Sophomore,4,"Wingate is an above average school in my opinion. On the good side, class size is small, instructors are (mostly) nice and approachable, people are decent and friendly, and the campus is really pretty. On the down side, there are not many events and fun stuffs going on. Overall, Wingate is a decent school, but don't expect too much fun/ events on campus."
Niche User,4,The instructors are awesome and there is a good since of family throughout this university. The classes are interesting and the sports are great to watch and participate in.
Graduate Student,4,"I like the way that we all feel like one big family. The campus is absolutely beautiful. The professors are very accessible,  as well."
Sophomore,4,"Even though it is a small institution, they have everything that I need to be a successful student. All of the professors that I have had so far really want to help, and are available to help."
Freshman,4,"The professors are readily available but the surrounding area is pretty boring unless you want to drive to Charlotte every weekend. Also, the cafeteria food is either hit or miss but the staff is amazing and hilarious."
Sophomore,4,"Wingate Univeristy has an extend variety of activities students can do during their time at Wingate. It can be by becoming part of sports such as volleyball, softball, baseball, cross country, track and field, football, soccer, swimming, golf and many other more that will make a great impact in students life. But not only that, it also forms part of one of the top 10 best private universities in North Carolina, having over 3000 students. Wingate University provides a lot of different scholarships students can take advantage from and that will benefit them in their future."
Niche User,4,Wonderfull school with a friendly staff and great academic programs. This school is affordable for those in a  tight spot. The school also has a wonderful academic reward system.
Sophomore,4,"I like how nice the staff is and how they do anything to help your needs. I like the size of the school, not overwhelming at all"
Sophomore,4,"I love how small it is. However, it's very outdated and needs several updates; especially in the library, the computers and wifi is really slow.  The football field isn't much of a college field at all. I wish it looked better because college football is awesome to see in person. There's few bleachers and it's just a grassy area instead of a stadium."
Sophomore,4,"Small school, great professors, classes are small and close by. Beautiful campus with lots of extracurricular activities"
Senior,4,I had a pretty good experience at Wingate University. The thing I took away from attending this school more than anything else are the life-long  friendships I made.
Senior,4,"I definitely am getting an education at Wingate, not just a degree. The professors truly care about the students and want them to succeed."
Niche User,4,"Beautiful campus, gorgeous halls, wonderful living spaces, and an excellent staff. An all around fantastic University."
Junior,4,"My overall experience at Wingate this far has been amazing, the campus is gorgeous, the professors are so personal with students, everyone finds their home away from home on campus, and it is just an amazing school. The one thing I would love to see changed on campus is parking, our parking lots are small and we have to overflow park on the side of the road a lot. The commuters do not have good parking, and I would love to see this changed for our future at Wingate University."
College Senior,4,"Because of Wingate's policies and work ethics, students who graduate from Wingate have a great chance of finding a great job in their field."
College Senior,4,I have had some of the greatest professors ever at this college. The professors were extremely approachable and were more than accommodating when I had issues with my health or schooling.
College Senior,4,"Our campus security department does a great job of keeping our students safe. Over the past few year we have had some issues come up that were not directly related to the students but happened near the college. Every time Campus safety was alerted to these issues, they acted swiftly and kept the students safe."
College Senior,4,"I work as a student assistant for the maintenance department at my college. I have first hand knowledge of my school's housing amenities. The housing for the students is kept in great shape. I don't, however, know much about the sense of community for the students, since I am a commuter to my college."
College Senior,4,"My college is a wonderful place. It has a great teacher to student ratio. This means that the teachers at Wingate are extremely approachable. You begin to get attached to your teachers and actually begin to get a relationship with you teachers. This can allow the students to feel like they belong and this also means that the students are able to work with their teachers more often and find ways to find solutions to problems. The students become a person, rather than a number in a room."
College Sophomore,4,Some things need to change about class registration.
College Sophomore,4,Slightly difficult to find a job on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Make friends with your Resident Assistant!
College Sophomore,4,"Tailgating is awesome, support your friends."
College Sophomore,4,"Only been one year, not much to base it off, yet."
College Senior,4,"We have a very safe campus. The few times that there have been incidents it has involved people outside of the community that are not enrolled in the university, and they have never resulted in anything that has impacted students."
College Senior,4,The school actively seeks out internships and research projects for students to get involved in. In this way they help the students gain relevant work experience by the time they graduate
College Senior,4,"Most of the residence housing is situated close to the academic buildings, so that there is a 1-5 minutes walking distance to any class. Dorms are okay; apartments are pretty comfortable and nice. Reliable wi-fi for the most part, and water and electricity services have never failed during my time here"
College Senior,4,"Collegiate athletes make up a relatively big proportion of the student population. Compared to the school's small size, we have a lot of teams, such as men's and women's swimming, women's volleyball, and men's and women's tennis, among others. The teams do well, several of them competing at the highest levels in Division II. Student attendance at home games is decent. The best quality of the school's athletics is the athletes' positive attitudes and how they represent the school in the best way."
College Senior,4,"One of the best qualities of this school is that it takes care of the individual student; teachers are approachable and easy to talk to, there are student help services for those struggling with school work and decisions about their major, and the small classes make the classes engaging for all students"
College Senior,4,I have received help from career services and used the database to find an on campus job.
College Sophomore,4,Lotter choosing could be better
College Freshman,4,They are very approachable and helpful
College Freshman,4,The services are very helpful
College Freshman,4,Each team has potential and succeeds
College Freshman,4,It has a great environment and great school overall
Senior,2,"Wingate is a small, mismanaged private school that is overpriced for the quality of student life and education.

In the 3 years I have attended, the tuition has gone up by $3-4k every single year. The school has a vision for expansion that involves constructing new dormitories and classroom buildings at the expense of racking up massive debts that it relies on current students to fund. The school's main income strategy is bringing in droves of freshman each year, the overwhelming majority of which will transfer by the end of their sophomore year. Dorm facilities are surprisingly spacious and we'll kept, and the campus grounds are taken care of and are one of the biggest positives the school has to offer. Campus dining is decent but not all one could wish for. Parties are average in enjoyability but local police have been known to profile based on race and to dismiss sexual assault allegations. Making friends is difficult for non-athletes. Socially, the school is extremely cliquey."
Sophomore,2,"Choose another school. Very very expensive for what you receive. Advertised as a “pseudo Christian University” but once attending is quite the opposite. The surrounding area is not “suburban” as advertised it’s actually dingy and crime ridden. This university itself is old, outdated and anyone can walk on campus, very unsafe! The housing is horrible, they want to stuff everyone together in old disgusting buildings. The school consists of people who should not even be at a college and high school burnouts. They need to advertise this school as it truly is, and nobody would go!"
Sophomore,2,"Wingate doesn't have much to offer on or off campus. They accept anybody with a pulse, the food is terrible, bugs have been found in the cafe, and they have you take a lot of useless classes. They don't mention that you have to attend something like 24 lyceums which are basically hour long lectures about stuff nobody cares about. The professors are very nice and some of the buildings are cool. The Old Cannon dorm needs to be knocked down. It's disgusting. I personally wouldn't recommend going to Wingate unless you don't care about any of these things. Also the town of Wingate is kinda crime ridden. Don't let them make you forget that they didn't cancel classes when someone was shot on campus."
Freshman,2,"The school’s setting is okay. The academic scene could be better. I do not agree with the scholarship program. The food is okay, although i would like to see more & better options."
Alum,2,"Pros: small class sizes, updated campus, easy to get involved in organizations, friendly staff and students, people know your name (you aren't just a number)

Cons: campus ""shuts down"" on the weekends, food is subpar, lack of parking and housing (even though they require you to live on campus all 4 years), campus doesn't feel safe (car break ins, lock downs, hardly any lights in parking lots), campus safety isn't helpful/readily available, tuition is high"
Sophomore,2,"I’d like better communication with administration, better resources, and more teachers to actually teach classes. Incoming freshmen can’t take classes for their majors because there aren’t enough teachers"
College Senior,2,"The overall school is ok. Nothing amazing, nothing awful. It's certainly overpriced for what you're actually getting- a slightly below average education from a  Southern conservative pseudo-Baptist school that no one has heard of outside of a 100 mile radius."
College Freshman,2,People I know who commute here live at least 30 minutes away. It is pointless for a college student to have their own place because of the cost.
College Freshman,2,"Living on campus is expensive.  The process for upperclassmen housing is tedious, but the apartments are nice.  If you live in a dorm it is most likely disgusting unless you live in JM Smith."
College Freshman,2,The food isn't good at all. Everyone reports frequent stomachs from both Klondike and the Cafe.
College Sophomore,2,"I have not received enough aid, and am struggling to pay my college fees."
College Junior,2,"There's subway (closes at 8pm) which is literally across campus and away from everything, Einstein's which is in the library, really small and too expensive (students pay more than you'd pay if you went to a real Einstein's location, closes early), the Klondike (10:30am-11pm) which has rude and unpleasant workers and they are usually crowded and inconvenient especially during the day between classes and they basically get everything in there and it's really unhealthy and a lot of people get sick from eating it. There's the cafe which is open at really awkward hours that are hard to remember and the food isn't that great. We were promised a nice restaurant to open last spring but we never got that and we were also promised a chickfila that we never got. Options are very limited and don't taste very good."
College Junior,2,"I am a communications major and it is one of the worst majors now. Before I got to Wingate, people often bragged about how good the program was but sadly that's not the case anymore. We only have five professors so they have to teach several different courses each semester. This is good for making connections with professors but it's bad for the vibe of the classroom. It is painfully obvious to us that the faculty in our department is overworked and getting worn out. People don't even take our major seriously anymore. The workload for most comm classes isn't bad at all though so that's a plus."
College Junior,2,"There are very few scholarships. Besides the athletic scholarships, the only scholarships I know of are the merit-based awards that range from about $250 to $750 I think, maybe less. Also there's the bulldog award or something like that that is awarded to one male and female every year. There are few opportunities for free aid and if there are more, they are poorly advertised."
College Junior,2,"There is only one gym and only one cafeteria to eat at. There is only two places on campus to get food, there is only one library."
College Junior,2,The workload is a lot.
College Junior,2,"It could be better because it is very expensive and it is small, dirty, and cheaply made."
College Sophomore,2,"There's always parties on campus, but they aren't very good.  You can always go get wasted if that's what your in to, but the parties themselves are mediocre."
College Sophomore,2,"You have 4 options: Caf (Poor Quality; Healthy Options are Rarely edible), Klondike (good food, but unhealthy), Subway (requires Bulldog Bucks) or Papa John's (requires Bulldog Bucks)"
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't really much access to public transit, but you usually don't need it.  If you don't have a car, you can always stay on the campus or ride with someone (most people have cars).  The convenient parking fills up quick, but you can find other places with just a short walk."
College Sophomore,2,"Varsity sports are pretty bad except for volleyball.  I will go to have something to do, but they are not great.  Intramurals are decent, and people will go to watch, but they are not that big of a deal.  Facilities are pretty bad, weight room is always crowded and there is only 1 squat rack for the whole school."
College Freshman,2,No transportation if you do have a personal car.
College Freshman,2,"Wingate, NC is smaill town little attractions, activities, and shopping."
College Freshman,2,It is a struggle to find long distance transportation if you are not taking your car.
College Freshman,2,Off campus housing is not encouraged. The school tries to get as many people as possible to live on campus with few exceptions.
College Freshman,2,"Local attitude towards students is great but Wingate strongly lacks attractions, activities, shopping, events etc."
College Freshman,2,Wingate is a very small town and is mostly located around fast food restaurants.
College Junior,2,Greek life just causes problems if you are partying with them.
College Freshman,2,"There are only 3 places in wingate-chinese, japanese, and mcdonalds. If you go to monroe, there are a lot of restaurants."
College Freshman,2,Not many choices in a small town
College Sophomore,2,The awarded scholarships were decent but a few of my documents were overlooked in the business office which made it harder for me to get by.
College Sophomore,2,"Wingate University rarely has any incidents with drugs. If student do drugs, they hide it very well. The campus is laid back. More students would consider drinking before they ever did any other drug"
College Freshman,2,"I would give the off campus dining places a c because the places are good but after a week of off campus dining around wingate, you get tired of the same few restaurants."
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, the public transportation around here sucks. There are three bus lines as far as I know, but they are all at least 8-10 miles away. If you can't get someone to drive you those 8-10 miles, the bus lines are worthless. I would really love to see a shuttle that goes from Wingate into Monroe."
College Sophomore,2,"There are plenty of places to eat on campus, but the quality of the food comes and goes. In the dining hall the food is usually good in the beginning of the semester, during parent weekend and during the end of the semester. The one thing that remains constant is breakfast; it's always good. They also rarely have any rare meat. A lot o people including myself become sick after eating the food in the cafeteria. Another option on campus is The Klondike. The Klondike is basically a fast type of place. The Klondike takes meal swipes unless you have the 20 meal food plan. If you have that plan, you can only use a meal swipe in the cafeteria. There is a Starbucks in the library where you can get breakfast and lunch as a meal swipe.  We also have a Subway on campus, but a meal swipe cannot be used there. We can use bulldog bucks though. There is a little mart on campus called the Grab-n-Go and is basically like a gas station minus the gas."
College Freshman,2,the rain makes our ground super muddy/soggy. if it's windy it gets FREEZING here.
College Freshman,2,Parties get busted in on a lot. They do have parties in the DPC though so Fridays can be sorta fun.
College Freshman,2,"There is really nothing to do in the town of Wingate besides two small restaurants and a Food Lion. You have to go to Monroe for everything, or even Matthews."
College Sophomore,2,There are three places around campus that on can eat from. And after a while the food gets pretty boring.
College Sophomore,2,"not much around Wingate University, you have to drive at least 10 mins. to get to a bigger place."
Freshman,1,"Wingate was fine for the first week, but once people got real comfortable, Wingate turned into Hellgate from the food to classes. Also, don't believe the 'Christian' school bullshit. If they were really 'Christians', they wont have allowed a drag show or an LGBT club. Don't waste your money on this trash school. It's extremely overrated."
Freshman,1,"Shitty school really. They are hard to contact, admissions and financial aid wise, they only pay for half of your tuition, the rest is up to you. I heard people paying 5k a month in tuition in a SEMESTER. They have you in moldy, smelly dorms, eating nasty ass food, and get this, they just put a Chick-fil-A and even that is disgusting. Professors don't care about you, they rather you teach yourself than to help you. Also, it's boring and people who go there already have their clics made up so don't bother making any new friends."
Junior,1,"The student body is made up of underachievers who couldn’t get into more prestigious colleges. I can’t wait to transfer. Food is inedible, professors have been mostly strong."
Sophomore,1,"Wingate doesn’t care about their students, the academics are pretty good but everything else is not. They only seem to care about the money and don’t any comments into consideration. The food is absolutely horrible, there is no parking, recently students have had to live in a dilapidated days inn due to housing issues. Good luck if you come here"
Freshman,1,"The school is accepting too many students without the means to house them. They stick 3/4 girls in a room that is meant to be a traditional 2 person dorm. They won't tell you they're doing this until a week before move in day so you have no other options. The academics are subpar. The food is absolutely awful. Theres no where to park and when you have to make a parking spot because otherwise you'll be walking a mile from your car to the dorm in the dark (theres not proper lighting or safety buttons on campus) you'll get a parking ticket and if those parking tickets go unpaid they won't send your transcripts to another school so you can get out of there. There's many other issues such as no hot water, disgusting dorms including mold and rotting ceilings  (helms). If you want to experience all of these issues and pay upwards of 20,000 to do it then wingate is the place for you. If not go literally anywhere else."
College Junior,1,Our school lacks school spirit. Not a lot of people attend games and support our athletes.
College Junior,1,The best place to go to have fun is Charlotte. It is about 45 minutes away and as college student not everyone has money every weekend to enjoy themselves and have fun.
College Junior,1,The school does not allow student to live off campus
College Freshman,1,No off campus near by or school transportation to get there and back.
College Student,1,Nothing around except chicken manure
College Student,1,I have been at the school for a few months now and have seen the police 2 times once was to buy my permit
College Student,1,Schools athletics are poor as well as the facilities that accompany them
College Student,1,Only one place to eat off campus...mcdonalds....it speaks for itself
College Student,1,No help or aid with the process
College Student,1,"The school network is very slow with many crashes. The one lab fro the entire school consists of about 20 computers which is not nearly enough. After paying the school $35,000 a year one would think printing would not cost 25 cents per page."
College Sophomore,1,"Don't allow it, plus we don't have enough on campus housing"
College Student,1,I work a lot during my free time. So averagely I would go out may twice a month.
College Freshman,1,"Small campus. Not very commuter friendly. If you're not living on campus, you're basically not part of the school."
College Sophomore,1,"The only upside to parking is that there is no fee for a parking pass. I do not have a car on campus and am happy because there aren't any parking places near my apartment. People have a hard time finding parking spots and ask e even have to park across campus. Also, they are not clear on the parking rules to freshman. My freshman year one of my roommates parked in the zone designated for teachers and was fined even though no one told her there were certain zones for teachers."
College Senior,1,"The vast majority of the students here are white, middle class, straight Christian students.  Although everyone is usually pretty accepting, it can be tough here, especially for students of a minority religion or students who are not heterosexual.  Additionally, we have a reputation for being very conservative, and this is true to a pretty great extent."

Sophomore,5,"Due to this pandemic, my classes have been online since Spring 2020. I do plan on taking online next semester as well though. My professors, for the most part, has been very communicative about how we are going about our classes online on eCourseware. They make sure to accommodate us. I do believe we are getting assigned more work online than we would have if we were on campus however."
Alum,5,Honestly I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. My professors really cared about my growth and development and I never felt like just a number. It's a well laid out campus with good faculty who I learned a lot from.
Senior,5,"The University is making a lot of expansions to the school as of late in order to make it larger and more suited to the needs of the students, and I think it's been doing a really great job. There are also lots of activities happening on campus at any given time to pick from, my personal favorites being the different displays of diversity like the annual Lunar New Year celebration. All of my classes have been consistent in my major about connecting together and forming a big picture which I appreciate as well."
Senior,5,I took five online classes this semester after transitioning last semester to remote learning and I could not appreciate more how much the professors work with you to make online learning fit for you.
Sophomore,5,"My first impression of this University was very optimistic and that was exactly what I got out of it! The student interactions, groups, and food is great! Not only that but the overall tone of the campus makes me love walking around it!"
Sophomore,5,"The staff is friendly and understandable, especially during this time of year. With the COVID-19 issue going on with many other problems 2020 has given us. My professors gave me hope that I can do anything, especially with my education. I will not quit!"
Niche User,5,I heard many good things about University of Memphis. The diversity of this university is so good. The value of education is also very good. We are getting much than what we pay for.
Alum,5,"Excellent psychology program, however not enough professors of color in the department. Professors are extremely helpful and advocates for social change. Definitely encourage people to apply."
Alum,5,Online courses can be hit or miss depending on instructor and course (upper division v. lower division). Strongly suggest using rate my professor to pick online instructors. Some are helpful while others aren't.
Niche User,5,"I love being at the campus. I've visited there many times when I was a kid. The cafeteria has good food, the classrooms are convenient with laptops, and the fields outside combined with a gym and running track are fun to go to when you want to work out or relax."

Sophomore,5,The University of Memphis has provided me with an amazing education while also giving out so many resources for the students to use. They want to help as much as possible and everyone is so sweet. They really do care about your education and getting you there the easiest way possible.
Sophomore,5,"I took a few classes online and personally, I do not prefer online classes just due to how I learn. They make it hard for me to focus but thankfully, the professors made everything really simple to navigate and kept the due dates all the same. They were usually at the end of the week at 11:59. This was the best part because I work full time along with school so it allowed me to do the work whenever I needed."
Sophomore,5,Attending University of  Memphis has pushed me to follow my dream career and having people that are able to give you constructive criticism to help become a professional learner.
Junior,5,"The online learning is very straight to the point. I’m not going to lie it can be a lot of tabs some times which makes it hard to find things but other than that you should be fine on looking for things online .  Depending on the professor the testing times are fair , and some teachers are strict and won’t let you make up work . My advice just stay ahead of your due dates , stay organized, and some times get out the house to do your work because it can get very comfortable at the house. Needless to say I wish they would update the font and make the backgrounds look more enjoyable or let us customize it with a theme the way that we would like but that’s just me . I like our  online classes they are pretty legit."
Freshman,5,"I take some of my classes online, and it’s not as stressful as it seems to be. The professors in my online classes are very understanding and easy to communicate with."

This university is very diverse as it caters to many nationalities, and there is a great residence life staff that caters to the students residential needs."
Senior,5,My experience so far at the University of Memphis has been wonderful. I am able to meet people of all sorts of backgrounds and cultures. I am a social work major and have gained many volunteer hours with my community and have met people with knowledge about the social work world that have given me many resources.
Alum,5,"I transferred there after I took a break for a few years to travel and get married. I finished my last 2.5 years there and had a good time.

I was well treated, the classes were interesting, I made good friends, the campus was nice, and it was affordable!"
Niche User,5,"Everyone is very friendly, however it is difficult to make friends unless you're apart of a club/fraternity/sorority."
Alum,5,Great University! Nationally ranked programs. Not to mention Tiger Basketball and Football!!!! Located close to downtown Memphis. New student housing on and off campus.
Freshman,5,"So far I have loved Memphis. I am only in my spring semester of my freshman year, but so far it is great! The campus is very inclusive to all people and it feels like a tight knit home.  The campus is average size so it is very easy to get around. All of the professors that I have had have been great, just a few language barriers. I would recommend The University of Memphis to anyone!"
Freshman,5,"I was extremely scared to start school because I am a part of the LGBTQ community and with the way, highschool went tensions were high. I realized though that no one really cared and I began to open up and makes some friends with those around me. I did not have to hide who I am. On the academic side of things it was wonderful to all of my professors were great. I am a very slow learner and tend to need things explained in more detail than others; whenever I needed help I received it. There were no overbearing amounts of work to do so that made it easy in all accounts to get things done. I was able to get my homework completed on time, go to work, and still hang out with my friends when I wanted."
Freshman,5,University of Memphis is one of the best colleges I have attended. The academics are fantastic. Anyone is sure to graduate with the degree of their chose with a great mindset and a fabulous education. This college was not my first choice but I know now that it is my best choice.

Senior,5,Very great school. They have great Education Department. This is one big happy family. Go Tigers!!!!
Freshman,5,"My program is extremely hands on, and I am encouraged to gain as much experience in my field as possible within the university and beyond. The program rewards those who work hard and do their best, and that keeps me motivated to continue at my very best. However, my professors desire for me to have a balanced and healthy lifestyle. I am advised to have a manageable work load involving school, job, and extracurriculars. The professors and my advisors truly desire for me to get the most out of the program and for me to live to my full potential."
Junior,5,"The University of Memphis is an excellent school, caring professors who want each and every student to achieve their goals."
Niche User,5,"The University of Memphis is a wonderful experience for me. When I get to college, I want to make new friends, major one subject and so much more.

Junior,5,"I really love the University of Memphis. At first, I wasn't totally sure that I made the right decision, but it didn't take me long to realize that I did! The professors are great and everything is very easy to find. There's a real sense of community!"
Freshman,5,I have just finished my first semester at the university and I have loved it. I am doing great in my classes and all my professors have been amazing. I joined a sorority and I have become very involved with the community. I would highly recommend this university to anyone considering going to college. It has a great atmosphere that is very connected.
Freshman,5,"I love the experience i have at University Of Memphis, I wouldn't change a thing besides the guidance counselor hours of duty. I would push them back a couple extra hours because us students use them quite frequently and everyone cannot get with them in one day."
Alum,5,"I enjoyed my experience at the University of Memphis.  Campus life and events were very fun and affordable.  There are so many good study areas on campus too. My professors were brilliant yet human.  Overall, I really feel that my education here was an investment."
Freshman,5,"So far, my college experience has been pretty decent. I am currently a United States Air Force ROTC Cadet, so my experience is different from many because my schedule is demanding. However, I am impressed how the campus is very diverse with different nationalities. My experience has been fun for sure. I would definitely recommend this college to younger siblings and family members."

Junior,5,I enjoy the atmosphere and how everyone treats you like family. The extracurricular activities are excellent as well from the diverse clubs to the sports.
Freshman,5,The one thing I really like about the University of Memphis is that it has so many opportunities to get help outside of the classroom. Entering from high school the work load is different in college. So I really appreciate the extra help provided.
Niche User,5,University of Memphis is Great! Nice location and student Life. Def. recommend it! The people are great and safety is amazing. The teachers are nice and easy. I would love to continue learning there.
Niche User,5,When I toured the university of memphis I felt right at home. Memphis is a great town to be in because it is not too small and there are so many activities and new things to try. The food at the campus was alright but I know anyone can find something they enjoy. The basketball is outstanding and I know memphis is a great choice for college.
Sophomore,5,"How the good the school is, depends on you. You must pick the right teachers because there will always be good teachers and bad teachers."
Senior,5,Provides a Modern spin on education. I am a full time working and full time student and they do a great job helping me balance.

Senior,5,"I am out-of-state student and enrolled in University of Memphis 2018.  One thing I like about this school is their art program. I never met a school that have so much passion for arts that they always host art shows every months to present students works. Even the city of Memphis is very committed to art programs as well. If you want school that cares about art majors as much as I do, then University of Memphis is the place to go."
Freshman,5,"At the University of Memphis, first-year students can take advantage of the Fresh Connections learning communities. Freshmen choose from themed packages of three courses and take them with a small group of other first-year students, who often become future study partners, connections or friends"

Niche User,5,My first experience would be that I wasn't able to find a building for a meeting. the campus is actually huge.
Freshman,5,I love the easy of finding classes.  Everything is within walking distance.  Everyone that I have worked with have been so overly helpful.  The campus dorms are very roomy and safe. Campus life will be great.   The sports program has been a great experience for me.  The coaches and the teams have been great.  Looking forward to cheering for the Tigers.
Senior,5,"Absolutely everything you could want in a college. So many majors, minors, opportunities, events,...etc it goes on and on. I seriously don't want to go anywhere else and hopefully one day I can send my kids here!!!!"
Freshman,5,"In all honesty, I like the university. My first year there was the best year yet. I made a lot of friends, participated in a lot of activities, joined groups and also went to class of course. I enjoyed the food and the free stuff. I just love the campus overall. I think the University of Memphis is a pretty good school, just don't forget to go to class."
Alum,5,"Received my degree in mechanical engineering, University of Memphis prepared me well. I now have my own successful  business."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Memphis is a very substantial school, and was definitely my first choice in colleges in Tennessee. Even though I am only a sophomore, so far, my professors have been very nice, considerate, and communicative. The only thing I would like to see a change in, is online class fees for students like me, who are not confident in returning to campus during this pandemic, and only have a choice to register online classes to assure that. Other than that, everything else is very considerably good."
Sophomore,4,The uofm has good programs and the dining services aren't half bad. It would be nice if they added some new options.
Alum,4,I took one summer class online. It was an enjoyable experience overall. I don't feel like it was unnecessarily difficult and I think I learn better in person but the teacher definitely made sure we all still had somewhat of a classroom experience with the discussion boards.
Sophomore,4,"I like how safe I felt while walking around my campus, whether it was morning, noon, or night. I always felt okay."
Sophomore,4,"Although it took some time to get used to, online learning has been going great. I like how I get to do things on my own time."
Niche User,4,I heard that everyone is having pretty good experiences with this new type education system. The university took so many precautions about COVID-19. They implemented lots of safety precautions. The teachers are pretty good in their places.
Junior,4,"This is a good institution, they care about their students and the quality of education that we receive for the most part."
Sophomore,4,"The majority of my classes were located on campus. The Online classes that I took were very informative, and provided just the right amount of content to ensure that the student received the right learning experience."
Junior,4,The University of Memphis is a great school to attend all of my professors have been very understanding with me through everything. I feel like I improve each year that i am at the university.
Junior,4,"Online classes at the University can become pretty stressful if you don't actively keep up with your due date, however many of my professor are still understanding"
Sophomore,4,I only took online classes with University of Memphis due to COVID-19. I personally like learning in person better because I am a hands on person. Many teachers did not know how to transition which made many of my courses and workloads harder.
Junior,4,"I have been researching universities for over 5 years and i finally settled on the university of Memphis as it was the one school that a) had the program i wanted, b) was affordable, and c) the only school that offered to help me find scholarships and apply for work opportunities. On top of that, my advisor is the most helpful I've had in my entire school career."
Junior,4,The online platform is easily navigable with plenty of helpful tips and links to assist with whatever you need. Only recommendation would be the offering of additional courses as the online selection is limited.
Sophomore,4,"My learning experience at the University of Memphis is challenging amongst other students, but I have the motivation to achieve my goal."
Junior,4,"I love the atmosphere of my college and we have some of the top programs in the world! Choose your professors wisely . The school always has something going on for you to get involved . I wish the school had a majorette team to dance with the band that’s the only down fall , other than that I love my school and we have dedicated fans to our football team especially and our basketball teams . If you come to this school you will be a true tiger !!"
Junior,4,"I transferred to Memphis after receiving my Associate's Degree in Graphic Design from Southwest TN Comm. College (STCC). The quality of education at Memphis is tenfold that at STCC; I feel that once I graduate, I can confidently enter the graphic design industry with a high chance of being hired. I am also registered with the Disability Resources for Students Office (DRS) and they have been extremely helpful during the current pandemic."
Senior,4,"The University of Memphis, in the Fogelman School of Business, has a lot of programs in place to make sure you are successful after college."
Freshman,4,"I  am a current student of UofM. The school is a very unique school with a lot of opportunities. The school does have its downfalls by not having a large variety of classes, besides that the professors are excellent teachers."
Sophomore,4,I like how easy it is to make friends and I wish there is more diversities in the food Options. I wish that the advisor would help you more and know more than you do because some of them do not really know what they are doing and mess up your schedule. I wish to see more friendly advisor As well. I wish to see tuition go down and a refund on Tiger eats. I think it’s not fair that  you have to use all the money on food and not get it back. I want korean food on campus or even Vietnamese food. I think there is to many non healthy options and very limited Healthy option: but overall the environment is good and friendly sometimes ! Teachers who are good are very helpful and nice. Advisors sometimes don’t give a enough information and do not respond to your email.
Freshman,4,"So far, my experience here at the University of Memphis has been nice. Some of the things i would probably give another look at is the lack of security i have seen. Actually, I am not sure I have seen any besides them driving down the street. Another would be the students that show up under the influence or come just to cause problems. They are clearly not there to learn or help their peers."
Junior,4,"I actually love the school and the staff are very helpful. I haven’t met a person yet, that wasn’t friendly.  I am happy that I decided to come to this state and go to University of Memphis!"
Sophomore,4,I like the overall community surrounding the university. Everyone there makes you feel right at home.
Junior,4,"I am a junior. The thing I like most about UofM is the diversity in foreign languages. I am currently taking Spanish and Japanese. Although Spanish is a common language to teach in education Japanese is not. UofM also offers Chinese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, French, German, Arabic, Italian, Latin, and I believe that's most of them! I hope to learn more languages here!"
Niche User,4,"Field Experience The purpose of field experiences at the University of Memphis is to allow students to observe and interact with teachers, students, and other support personnel in diverse school settings as well as other community settings."
Freshman,4,My experience at the university of Memphis was pretty much exciting and wild to say the least. It’s not everything I taught college would be still am in my freshman year but I know I’ll have many more adventures to have
Junior,4,"I love this university so far. Only major negative is that the counselors are not that helpful, I had to figure out a lot on my own and by asking around."
Freshman,4,I enjoyed my experience at University of Memphis. The admission have been very helpful with my first semester. Wonderful tour guides and lovely people help me find my dorm and classroom.
Junior,4,"I like the University of Memphis because of the diversity of the student body and faculty.  It's amazing and inspiring to see people of color who look like you who are succeeding in a career field that you want to enter.  All the professors and faculty I have met have been supportive, nice, and helpful.  There are many opportunities to volunteer and participate in school functions to get to know your fellow classmates."
Freshman,4,"When beginning your journey here in the University of Memphis, there is a warm welcome to all incoming students. I highly recommend doing Frosh camp! The school has come a long way."
Senior,4,"I am highly satisfied with my time here at the university, but I can't seem to understand why the ranking is lower than some TN schools. Memphis has an edge that speaks both community and indivdualism I see Memphis being a sleeper as a predominate school in the south."
Alum,4,It's a bland state school in general but it is surrounded by a lot of great culture to make up for it.
Senior,4,"Very good university. It's diverse. It doesn't have a high crime rate. For the most part, educators and well experienced in their fields. The campus is clean and the environment is friendly. The parking is expanding which used to be a problem. The campus always looks for ways to resolve problems."
Niche User,4,"I like how each member I have come in contact with is punctual and professional. One improvement that I can think of is ease of student use on website. It tends to be difficult, at least for me, to find what I am looking for."
Junior,4,"I love the atmosphere and the supportive faculty and staff who truly make a big college feel like a small private classroom. I do wish they had more food options on main campus so the lines weren't so long. You also do not get your dining dollars back at the end of the semester anymore so you are required to spend $300 or lose it at the end of each semester. This is frustrating when you do not care for the food choices, or have time in-between classes to wait in the long lines on campus."
Alum,4,"Some of the professors were really great and overall it was a very nice university to attend.  The only issue is that there are some professors, who not leaving any time soon, that are quite terrible."
Freshman,4,I like it so far. I'm a freshman and I've had a very good first 2 weeks. I've learned a lot about my chosen field of interest and can't wait to learn more.
Sophomore,4,"What help me get used to the University of Memphis was meeting people involve in my scholarships. I a First generation student,so it was defintely hard getting used to the college environment. My First Scholar coordinators really help me get used to the campus. They show me around the campus. They give me and my other First Scholars recipient around the relaxation zone, the restaurants around the campus, and the different building around campus. What I love most about the school is the peole around me. Me and the other First Scholar recipients really became a family. We will hangout in the dorm lobby, and really get to hangout with each other. We help each other with homework, and play a lot of games. The professors on campus are so good. They are so easy to talk to. You can go to them when you need help with anything, and they are willing to help you with anything."
Freshman,4,The University of Memphis is amazing! It is a very diverse community of well-rounded students from all over.
Junior,4,I attend the Global side of U of M. I've had to travel to campus three times for books and meetings. Instructors and advisors are always prompt in returning calls or emails. The staff and professors I've interacted with are friendly and passionate about their jobs and push each student to reach their potential.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at the University of Memphis! I graduated with a business degree. Most of my professors were very helpful, always making time when I needed extra help. I stayed in the dorms my freshman and sophomore years and I always encourage incoming freshman to live in the dorms at least one year. It has its ups and downs, but that experience is invaluable - you’re forced to step out of your comfort zone for sure. 
As much as I loved going to sporting events, getting coffee each morning on my way to class, and all the friends I made while in school, I was so glad to walk across the stage to accept my diploma! I’ll even be going back for round two in the fall!"
Freshman,4,Memphis is a beautiful campus with amazing students that attend the school. The campus police work hard to keep the campus safe and clean. There is more than enough options to choose from for on campus dining which are all delicious. The student body is highly diverse which helps with every student exposure to different cultures and religions.
Niche User,4,It can appear to be pretty pricy but overall it is a great institution. There’s tons of stuff to get involved in around campus. It can be a little tedious to get to class but it’s worth every step.
Junior,4,I think the University of Memphis is a beautiful school full of dedicated students and professors. Since I have started I have been happy to go each day and learn more about what I am interested in. It is rich in not only art but the culture of Memphis and I’m very proud to be a Memphis tiger! A change I would like to see happen is the food. I am a vegetarian and there weren’t many options for me as far as the dining and fast food options but am still proud to be at the school and am grateful for the opportunity to advance my career in film.
Sophomore,4,"The University of Memphis is an overall great experience. It is quite diverse and you will easily find a place that you can connect to. There are many  interesting events that occur, which brings the campus alive. You’ll find places to eat all over campus. The UC has a food court and a computer lab. The library is a great place to study and has friendly assistance. Another computer lab can be found inside the Library as well as other devices needed for research. The dorms are kept clean most of the time and are well conditioned. Most importantly the academics is well received, however difficulty varies from professor to professor. The University of Memphis is a safe place with emergency poles placed throughout campus."
Niche User,4,"Looking forward to the responses. Tell us about your visit, 
The University of Memphis is ""in the zone""..."
Senior,4,"I really like the student body's involvement with the campus, tons of activities and school events to attend year round. The food is amazing, with local food shops partnering with the University. I would like to see the University course enrollment policy change."
Junior,4,My experience at The University of Memphis is very good so far. I learned a lot of things pertaining to my major and the career field I will be going into. The food there is ok but I wish they had more variety. The dorms look ok and the college life is nice.
Sophomore,4,"I love going here. I'm around a bunch of bright fun people in my classes who I get along with and most of my teachers are extremely helpful and do a great job teaching.  In the UC, it's very easy to find groups and activities to do outside of classes. The campus itself is also decent looking. They could do better with healthy food options on campus."
Sophomore,4,I like the University of Memphis because of its diversity and location. Professors are understanding and willing to work with you and most want to see students succeed and excel. Facilities are cleans and well maintained for the most part.
Junior,4,"Of my one semester I have attended, I enjoyed my experience. The staff around campus was very pleasant. My instructors were helpful and made me feel comfortable in the classroom setting. The campus is very well kept and is appealing to the eye. I did not live on campus so I do not have an experience on dorm living and life. A change I would suggest is adding more options for eating and drinks. A greater variety of food options would be greatly appreciated. The campus is very diverse and have many ways to get involved to make the college experience personal for the student. Our athletics' department is great and is only getting better. Overall, the University of Memphis is a YES."
Senior,4,"Great educational organization. 100% online non-traditional student. Most of the instructors are good; however, some won’t reply to questions timely."
Freshman,4,"At the University of Memphis, I have taken advantage of all that I can. I have used career services frequently, gone to my professor's office hours, and participated in many on-campus organizations. I am in the Honors College at U of M, and my experience there has been dismal. There aren't many honors activities or opportunities that normal students do not get as well. The career services people are amazing. They are excellent at getting any student internships, job shadowing opportunities, and real-world jobs."
Niche User,4,"The german department and University of Memphis is better than I could have ever imagined. All of the professors are brilliant, kind and understanding. I am so happy that I had the opportunity to take German 1020, 2010, 2020 and 3301 there."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at the University of Memphis good, but can be better. I am hoping to joining organizations that I am interested in. I wish we had better dorms and more activities on campus."
Senior,4,The university of Memphis offers a very diverse class schedule. The campus is clean and steadily improving. The athletic department is really growing.
Junior,4,I loved how dedicated the civil engineering program is for the students. Make sure to teach the curriculum.
Sophomore,4,"The UofM is an excellent school. The professors are excellent and, at least the ones I have had, are more then willing to get to know the students as people and not just as students. The food is great, and the area is amazing. The one thing I would like to see changed is that the advisors be more in touch with the people they are advising. I did not even meet with my advisor, mainly due to the fact they never contacted me when I requested information and were never in their office."
Junior,4,"This was a great decision that I made to attend the U of M. The professors care about your success, and they are willing to help you if you are not understanding a concept. I also love that in order to graduate from the university, you have to complete an internship. Which means you will have experience that majority of these jobs require when you graduate! The faculty here are very supportive of the students and will go the extra mile to help you."
Freshman,4,"I like University of Memphis because they have an excellent music program, and like how they cared about their students."
Junior,4,The professors are very knowledgeable in their fields and likeable. I also enjoyed how accessible the campus was because every class seemed to be within walking distance.
Freshman,2,"Online classes are not ideal here. All of the work assigned seems a bit like ""busy work"", and it's quite inconsiderate because the instructors are not considering our mental health nor is the University as a whole. This pandemic has taken a toll on every one, and I believe they could ease up."
College Sophomore,2,"I Haven't A College Organization , I Hear They're Hard To Get Into."
College Freshman,2,"Some dorms are nicer than others. Centennial is like living in a hotel. Steer clear of Smith. There are roaches, dirty bathrooms, and people defecate in the showers. I shower and wash my clothes at my parent's house because it is so disgusting. If you want to live on campus, go with the LLC or Centennial."
College Freshman,2,"I transferred here from a very large school with a huge greek scene. Greek life isn't good at Memphis. I was part of a top fraternity at my old school, but didn't join my chapter here. The top fraternities and sororities here think they are the best thing since sliced bread, when most of the members in them would only make the cut in a ""bottom tier"" fraternity/sorority at an SEC school."
College Freshman,2,"Not the greatest school in the world. Many of my peers went to inner city schools in the area, which has caused them to fall behind in certain areas. Many classes are not challenging because the professor has to go back and teach things that many of us learned in elementary school. I am currently learning about mean, median, and mode in a non-remedial college math class."
College Freshman,2,A lot of people smoke weed so it's best to not get caught up with that crowd
College Sophomore,2,Memphis cares about Basketball and Football; Don't expect anything much more than that.
College Sophomore,2,"I've applied twice. Chose a different school the first time. Wish I had chose a different school THIS time. Office of Admissions sucks. Don't rely on them to do anything theyre supposed to do. You pretty much have to harass and beg them to take care of things like transcripts and holds on your account, especially if you are a commuter student or a transfer student. I couldn't believe it was worse than I'd expected, and my expectations were low. Definitely don't want to attend next semester, but may have no other option."
College Sophomore,2,I am not much into the party scene but there aren't many on campus options for parties. Any party will be done at someone's house or people just end up going to a club far from campus.
College Freshman,2,"Apply early, and you might get lucky. If you live in state well you're in luck. If you live out of state, try and get into the honors program so you can apply for the instate tuition scholarship."
College Senior,2,"The off-campus housing near the U of M isn't really special. All the houses that are affordable were built half a century ago, and they are mostly run down. Add the rate of crime in the area to that and it's nothing to look forward too."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Bus system is not good at all, no other options aside from taxi, ride with friend, etc."
Recent Alumnus,2,"When it rains or may rain, traffic is bad and attendance is worse. It is primarily a commuter school so students who drive to class struggle to get to class on time."
College Freshman,2,I have had 2 bicycles stolen and now only use the campus rent-a-bike service.
College Sophomore,2,Applying for financial aid is extremely difficult. Getting someone on the phone in the office is really hard to do. I do not receive nearly enough financial aid so staying in school and being able to finance my education is extremely hard.
College Sophomore,2,"The on campus housing options are very poor. The buildings are extremely old and the prices are pretty high, not a great value. I stayed on campus my first semester in 2011, but I returned home two months later because it was disgusting."
College Freshman,2,"It's an open campus, and takes about 15-20 minutes to walk from one side of campus to the other. Not fun when its raining or snowing."
College Senior,2,It is obvious diversity exist at the University of Memphis. All sororities are predominately black or white. There is now a Hispanic sorority but it is obvious they suck.
College Freshman,2,"Like I said before, I live on campus. But I do hear that you need to get there as early as possible because spots do fill up fast."
College Junior,2,Should be able to park on campus and not have to walk so far to class
Recent Alumnus,2,"Being a commuter school, most kids just go home after class. There isn't a lot of desire to attend athletic events and most kids choose to forego them. There is a small group of students that are dedicated to supporting, but I would say less than 25% attend sporting events. Also, the intramural sports are not very popular. There are not very many teams in any of the sports."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are not a lot of ways to meet people, and being a commuter school, everyone sticks to the same people that they hung out with in high school or the groups that they have joined like sororities. School is too expensive, far more expensive for out of state than for in state. "
Recent Alumnus,2,There are rarely parties held. Most of the time you have to just drink at someone's house or go downtown to a club which is 20 minutes away. You have to be very careful about where you go in this city because of the crime.
Recent Alumnus,2,The bus routes have been shortened and getting around involves a personal car.
College Freshman,2,"unfortunately, i did not receive any financial aid. "
College Freshman,2,parking is a big deal at my school. it's very difficult to find a spot due to such a populated campus and small variety of parking spaces.
College Freshman,2,not exactly the best. definitely can be better. not the best apartments and houses available but definitely worth the freedom
College Senior,2,"The dorms are poorly constructed. They look as though they have not been touched since they first built the university. The social atmosphere is poor considering that the university is in the middle of a very urban area which it was not considered a urban area when it was built but times have changed around there since then. It's not safe to be out there at night alone, the amenities are average with nothing that stands out from other school, the cost is affordable for residents because from the looks of it you get what you paid for, and its convenient for adults and people with duties outside of school. Overall if you are looking for a place that is convenient and cheap then our campus is for you."
College Senior,2,"The guys and girls at my school are average at its best. Which means they are that attractive but they are also not ugly. The guys are mostly geeky, jocks, or egotistical. The girls are either urban, under-dressed, and easy-going or Southern belle, health freaks, and plain. If you don't have any friends initially from high school, around town, or the small social clubs we do have then it's hard to make friends or get around."
College Sophomore,2,"Way too much alcohol concentration. Police are called on a regular basis. There is one local club for 18-and-older, but it's known for being pretty trashy. Students don't really know how to have a good time.. they just want to get drunk every night."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The department isn't well put together. A lot of teachers left and I feel that the University of Memphis does not hire good professors. Although most are great in their field, these people do not know how to teach. The workload is sometimes ridiculous depending on what teacher you get. I can say that knowing two people in this department has made this worthwhile. Also, the best learning experience was my internship that I was placed in for credits. I learned a lot about myself, and I have continued to do other research projects in the department because of it."
College Sophomore,2,It's so hard to find a parking spot after 10:00 A.M. I suggest you buy a special parking permitt or get there before then. I suggest the school to make another parking lot.
College Junior,2,"As someone who has lived on campus for three years, the campus life is okay. I am near my school and I do have enough food options t keep interested. There are also restaurants near here but only if you feel like going for a walk. The biggest problem however is obviously the pricing. I know why the reason the would need to make it so high but only to a certain degree. I have done the math for a family of five and the utility does not add up to the prices that they are charging."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking seems to be hit or miss. Sometimes you will luck out and get a great spot, other times you'll circle the parking lot for 30 minutes trying to find something. It really depends on the time of day."
College Sophomore,2,We have very few Greek events and our campus hardly has Greek housing so we don't really have a feel of true Greek life on campus. But we do love the greeks that we do encounter
College Junior,2,"Parking is very difficult, but the campus has been working on reorganizing some parking lots, so hopefully this will help the parking situation."
College Sophomore,2,I know that drug use and drinking go on on campus but I haven't seen much of it. I stay in my dorm unless I'm in class and go home on weekends. But I have heard about it.
College Junior,2,Public transportation is available but it is better to drive yourself or have a designated driver if possible.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The facilities are nice, some parts of the building are old and falling apart--while others are remodeled. The thing that makes everything bad, is the people. Some are extremely childish and cliquish and just ruin the entire feel of the school. They stand outside singing and dancing, acting like monkeys, and harassing the girls that pass by. They'll try to talk to you, whistle at you, sing to you, follow you, annoy you, the list goes on. So it really makes for a bad environment."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not that many 18 and up clubs around campus, which is good and bad. The reason why i say it is good, is because students that 18 really not need to go to clubs. i think that they are not mentally really for that type of partying. On the other hand it is bad because they end up going to house parties which can lead to a lot of trouble."
College Junior,2,"Parking is mainly off campus, people who pay first for parking spaces have the one on campus."
College Senior,2,"Unless the college is on a secluded island, there is bound to be crime near the campus because it's in the city limits where public individuals are able to participate in school events or inquire about campus life and admittance."
College Junior,2,"Crime on campus is not very existent but on the streets surrounding campus, there is a lot of crime."
College Junior,2,The food is good and there are plenty of options. The eating spaces are very crowded and extremely loud.
College Sophomore,2,"There is police activity every single night it seems.  Every week the paper lists off ten to fifteen crimes that happened on campus, from theft to even sexual assault.  The school also implemented an anti-smoking campaign, banning cigarettes from campus.  I suppose this makes it healthier; however, I would much rather have the police doing their job and keeping people safer than going around busting people for smoking cigarettes."
College Freshman,2,It's not what I thought it would be at all. The greek life here on campus could be way better but I understand that Greek Life is not the reason that I come to school so in my case it is acceptable.
College Junior,2,Everybody hangs out at Tracks. The rest is pretty much fast food.
College Sophomore,2,"I absolute don't like the Blue bus because of the following reasons
- I haven't seen any student travel that bus from one end to other.
- Blue bus delays the traffic in the railway line by occuping two lanes and blocking all the cars.
- it doesn't make any sense that students doesn't have to walk long distance because stds can park in either side of campus. The bus doesn't shorten the walking distance.
- the bus is waste of money because it doesn't travel with in the campus but out side of the campus. If the bus travel with in the campus it will be better to reach from one class to another in shoter times."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't many foundation scholarships that I have seen, and unless you are traditional or take a common degree, there is not much available. IT students do get much. This is what I have learned, anyway."
College Student,2,Definitely the underage students are out and enjoying the nightlife. The university is centered around one local bar but other that I don't see many.
College Sophomore,2,"It's Memphis weather. One day this week was 80, the next was 30. You have to be prepared for a heat wave and a snow storm at all times."
College Sophomore,2,"It is very hard to find financial aid and scholarships for students who really deserve it!  I have a 3.4 G.P.A. and I am already $10,000 in debt.  The administration is ridiculous."
College Junior,2,The shuttles have so many stops it takes forever if you really need to be somewhere.
College Junior,2,Not that many general parking areas and they fill up extremely fast making lots of people late for class.
College Junior,2,Student Life can help with many student issues. Campus police helps to keep the students and community safe but there are occasional issues from time to time.
College Junior,2,"Like many colleges, it is tight but you can walk most places on campus"
College Junior,2,Very few off campus house really only for married people. Not to much space to have it. Very expensive and not very nice places
College Junior,2,"They wont let people stay the night.
What if you have a significant other?
What if you have a friend from High School who wants to come visit campus and stay the night?
What if your parents want to visit and need a cheap place to stay?

This rule is unecessary.  Having the check in desk eliminates people who are in the building who shouldn't be.  

So I cannot reccomend wasting money to stay in the LLC."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking on campus is a little difficult, but if you get there early enough you are sure to find a spot."
College Sophomore,2,"They Are Trying – They just started with the Blue Line, however, how it works is very unclear and the parking is absolutely horrible. I recently found out that the reconstruction of the main parking lot actually took away from the parking space and Memphis hardly has any to began with. Three blocks, in every direction of the campus, is completely covered in students parking. It is unsafe, many students end up with tickets, and makes the travel time doubled looking for a parking spot."
Alum,1,Online classes were hit or miss. Some covered new and interesting material but all were quite lacking in promoting good discussions.
Alum,1,University of Memphis is a terrible school unless you are a straight man. Everyone else gets zero scholarships and gets bullied. Shut this terrible place down.
Senior,1,"UofM offers degree paths for majors/minors that they do not offer the classes to complete. I have the emails that show UofM has been aware of FOR YEARS that you couldn't actually finish the degree. 
They will allow you to register for and work towards the degree with no warning that it cannot be completed and then refuse to take any steps to help you after you spend hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars working towards what turns out to be nothing. They're also jeopardizing my future as I've already been admitted to grad schools. 
I was astounded to find out that what I thought was a reputable school would have such an unfathomable scam."
Junior,1,"From my personal experience, UofM is by far the worst University that I've ever applied to. The staff is extremely incompetent, complacent and they have no sense of urgency. As a transfer veteran student, I must say that all of the other colleges/universities that I've been to don't even remotely compare to the lack of professionalism that this school's admin system carries.   And don't even get me started on the hellish parking hunts.  Yeah, this school isn't worth it.  I refuse to be a future student here.   They unfortunately did waste my valuable time along with a non-refundable application fee that I can't even get back. Smh..."
Junior,1,I’m low on this College because it just seems they only mission is to drag all the money you have on something that is half way run. We pay for upgrades that we’ll never experience and quite frankly the improvements still doesn’t help the growth neither. Most of your teachers are just there and the others are to serious as if they don’t recognize that you have a life and 5 other classes it’s just stressful for no reason. It’s like your paying and going into dept for information that one should have common sense to know for a piece of paper that doesn’t guarantee you anything afterwards. So in conclusion we paying to be depressed and stressed for a reasonable chance of getting a better future job
College Sophomore,1,Greek life is very corrupt
College Freshman,1,"Non-existent for the most part. I mean, there are frat parties, sure, but in general you wont find a party where everyone raves about."
College Senior,1,I am really struggling to pay for my own education. I have no student loans or grants and the only financial aid I receive at all is the TN Hope scholarship. I've applied for countless scholarships at the school and I have never been awarded one.
College Senior,1,I can't stand the Greeks.
College Freshman,1,If you have a high ACT score and a high GPA you not getting any scholarships from the school.
College Senior,1,"Even though I received financial aid for being a residents of a border line county, the scholarships and other aid such as loans are very scarce. Basically if you are not a resident of the city or guided into knowing about scholarships outside of the school then you are screwed! You have to check your status daily and make frequent visits to the financial aid office just to make sure you're aid is funded in a timely manner. You also have to make sure that you get a option from more than one financial aid officer because sometimes their are work-study students who do not know more than what you know."
College Senior,1,"During busy times of the day there are not enough parking spaces in general parking lots for all of the general parking permit holders that have classes at those times (typically 9 am to 4 pm). Often it is impossible to find a parking space, and many students revert to parking, against rules, on grass and in non-parking spaces in the lots. This usually causes congestion in the parking lots making parking even more of a nightmare. Unless you have an 8 o'clock class, plan to come 30 to 45 minutes early to get a decent spot."
Recent Alumnus,1,"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!! I was charged so many times, incorrectly and had to file complaints and literally fight to get my stuff cleared up. It is such a disgrace that a professional school lacks professional employees and people who are knowledgeable of the department they work in. I suffered many stress related incidents thinking that I wasn't going to be able to pay for school, when in reality the financial aid department was incompetent in giving the correct information. My advice for dealing with them, make them sign everything they tell you and give you. Seriously! You need to have proof it came out of their mouth because they will deny giving you false information, unless you have proof."
Recent Alumnus,1,"It's a huge culture shock, they aren't any minorities in this school. Mainly black and white. If you are a minority, they treat you like a disease or a foreign object they want to either stay far away from, or harass. The school represents the city, closed-minded and racist. The people here are immature and annoying, some are serious and kind, but the majority are the ones that ruin the feel of the college experience."
College Sophomore,1,"Not enough spots compared to current enrollment. Permits are not cheap, especially for those living off campus."
College Freshman,1,the only free parking space on campus is the side of the road. All visitors have to park on the curve.
College Freshman,1,"I received some financial aid,but it was not enough to cover all my tuition costs.The employees at the financial aid office were sometimes unhelpful."
College Sophomore,1,The University is a dry campus meaning no alcohol or drugs are allowed. If you want to have fun you go to the club or a house party. Fraternities and sororities have really fun parties so i would suggest you party with them.
College Freshman,1,"Parking at the University of Memphis could be one of the most horrible experiences you have while attending the college. If you do not have a priority or residential parking pass, your in for many stressful mornings. I feel as if too many general parking passes are handed and with not enough parking spaces available. So a word of advice: pay for a priority or residential parking pass, its worth it."
College Sophomore,1,There are simply not enough parking spots on campus. I have gotten three campus tickets this year because I made my own parking spot after driving around every lot for 45 minutes.
College Sophomore,1,"Permits don't cost much and it would be best to get one. Most parking tickets are $15. You really don't NEED a car, but having one would be great if you wanted to leave campus. There's rarely ever a good parking space available. Be prepared to walk."
College Sophomore,1,"We have this thing called the ""Blue Line."" It is two gas guzzling busses that drive in a circle around campus and no one ever rides them. All I can say is you better have a bike. But one good thing is the fact that you can call a number and have someone in a golf cart escort you to your dorm at night if you feel uncomfortable."
College Freshman,1,"Traffic is a nightmare! There is little parking and campus police are chomping at the bit to write a ticket for unauthorized parking. I have to park an average of 1.5 miles away from my classes due to the heavy bulk of traffic and lack of spaces. However, it provides me with daily cardio."
Recent Alumnus,1,there are no public transportation options on campus. You don't really need one but it would be nice to have at least one or two buses.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking is pretty bad, especially the first week/weeks back after a break."
College Senior,1,I believe the safety on campus is very poor. There have been many crimes on campus within the past year. Sometimes i do not feel very safe on campus. The police are starting to make more of an effort to handle crime.
College Senior,1,Worse Experience Ever – had some different people telling me I was eligible for certain rewards when in reality I wasn't. told me to apply for private loans without telling me about how getting denied and the companies checking my credit would hurt my credit. Just a bad experience all around.
College Sophomore,1,It's easy to find available dealers walking around campus and staying in the dorms. And groups of guys are always outside smoking loud marijuana.
Recent Alumnus,1,Crappy Housing – Amateurish architecture built by dumbasses. Cheap crappy apartments. Not much with charm.
College Senior,1,"They Are Too Expensive. I do not like off-campus housing because it is way too expensive. The payments for a 3 bedroom apartment is the same as one for a 3 bedroom house mortgage. Also, the parking is horrible. Students park along side your house where you are supposed to park and that creates problems."
College Junior,1,Needing Some Work – The Science and Mathematics departments have really taken a fall these past couple of years. The failing percentage was a whooping 90%. The school overall has a 37% graduation rate.
College Senior,1,There have been at least 15 gun robberies on campus just this semester.  Terrible Security!  I just don't feel safe at all.
College Senior,1,"If I Could – If I could chose another major and do it all over again I would.  I would chose a major that is worth my time and is worthy of $35,000 in student loans.  Psychology is not filling to me, it is not meaningful enough to me. If I could do it all over I would chose a major in business or engineering."
College Sophomore,1,No Variety in Dining – The area around campus has no variety when it comes to food.  The same chain restaraunts can get boring and there aren't many ethnic spots to keep one's interest.
College Freshman,1,"Greeks Do Make an Impact on Campus – Far as Greeks, there are a variety of the fraternities and sororities on  campus. There are minorities, academics, and panhellics. However, minority Greeks are big on campus, but they do not contribute to the campus or the community. Well, probably one or two. Far as academics, there are some that focus more on professionalism and academic success. Greeks on this campus are good for their social events. The organizations on campus are much more legit and well-known for their contributions."
College Senior,1,"Evenly Spread to Me – To me the campus seems to be very diverse. I see all types of people and personalities and skin colors everyday that I attend school. However, we are known to be a predominately white school. One thing I have noticed is that the school activities are geared more towards the white students and what they maybe used to, very traditional. So it causes a lot of the students not to be interested."
College Freshman,1,"The way to get financial aid at the University Of Memphis is to first file a FAFSA and then fill out some paperwork. You then have to decide which financial aid you would like to accept. A few days before classes start, your tuition is paid and any extra money will be deposited into your bank account you have listed or if there is no account listed, a check will be sent to you."
College Sophomore,1,Financial Aid is hard to get. The people in the office are rude and don't seem to want to help (that is if you can even find the office). I have some financial aid but not enough to keep me from getting hundreds in loans each semester.
College Junior,1,"You Just Never Know – If you've ever lived in the mid-South, you know that the weather is totally unpredictable. Some days it will be warm and sunny, the next it's freezing cold and raining. It's not unheard of to see snow and pretty spring-like days in the same week. I keep out all my clothes year-round!"
College Freshman,1,"Living on Campus Is a Plus – It's best to stay on campus because you don't have to worry about riding around looking for a spot. There are currently 23,000 people who attend the University and there is no way everyone can find a spot."

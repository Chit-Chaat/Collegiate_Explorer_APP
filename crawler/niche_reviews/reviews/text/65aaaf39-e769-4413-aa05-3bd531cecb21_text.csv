College Sophomore,5,"The BEST Security ‚Äì The security on Harris Stowe's campus is very strict. They go by every rule and never let anybody slide through them. If any student looked unfamilar either security or a RA would check their I.D to make sure they are students at Harris Stowe. It isn't possible for a outsider to get into our dorms. The doors lock at a certain time. One of our RAs always make sure our room doors are locked before we are alseep. The security guards do not like students to come in drunk or filled with any drug. Everything stays undercontrol from the rooms, the community kitchen, cafe, computer labs, the book store, the library, and outdoors campus"
College Sophomore,5,"Campus Security Is Great! Our campus security is wonderful.  They patrol the school inside ant out at all times.  I feel totally safe at Harris-Stowe.  I've never had any incidents a the university, and the minor incidents that I have seen, security has responded to very quickly."

Junior,4,Overall the online learning wasn‚Äôt bad. Most teachers were understanding if you‚Äôre a student whose more hands on and accommodated the best ways they knew how. But other teachers were unforgiving and acted as if we didn‚Äôt have other online classes to do work for and attend.

I love the diversity. There are many ethnicities in the campus community. The only thing I would consider changing is the cafe food and the campus size."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I liked the acedemic side of Harris-Stowe. The professor were professional at all times. I loved the fraternity and sorority step shows as well. A few things that I didn‚Äôt like was that they weren‚Äôt strict enough about who was allowed into the residents halls. There was a lot of outsiders there late at night. Harris-Stowe food was good but not everything. I lived Midnight Grille. Harris-Stowe is a great campus. It‚Äôs very beautiful and it‚Äôs a nice size. I loved the basketball games and I really loved homecoming week. Also, they have many different organizations to be apart of."
Freshman,4,"I love the energy at Harris-Stowe and I love the activities and clubs they offer. We also have some of the best college housing accommodations in the country with single bedroom suites with full kitchens and bathrooms that we only have to share with one other person. The rigor of classes is pleasantly challenging as well and the professors are always here to help. What I would like to see improve is the quickness with which housing issues are fixed. Many rooms have broken and/or dysfunctional objects that have not yet been fixed after submitting multiple work orders. The food here is good as well. Although we don't have popular restaurants, the food service provider we have gives us options and is open 4 times a day during the week."

College Freshman,4,"To start off, I planned on going to Harris-Stowe only for my first semester as freshmen and transferring to Clark Atlanta. I'm not so sure about that anymore because I have fallen so in love with the school and it's environment. They have many helpful resources as far as help with work, the professors/teachers are very approachable and understanding. There are constant activities going throughout the day/week so that every student has the chance to engage and get a feel of what the school is about. Overall, Harris-Stowe is a great school and I would highly recommend anyone go to this college."
College Sophomore,4,Average class size so talking to the professor is fairly easy the courses overall differ the school should implement more majors and open up the variety of choices but overall the professors are well versed in there areas
College Sophomore,4,Safe food wise it's not very healthy but other than that safe
College Sophomore,4,Decent no real complaints the buildings are fairly new although they do sometimes have wifi connection issues and if an appliance is broken the time it takes to get someone to fix them varies which is a downside it's never consistent
College Sophomore,4,Greeks greatly influence the school some Greeks are cliquey and snobby but for the most part they heavily affect school atmosphere through community service and events held on campus for students
College Sophomore,4,"I am a non-traditional student who thus far only attended school in the evenings part-time.  This fall semester I am attending full-time including days.

College Freshman,4,"I just love the environment and my peers I'm surrounded by. I feel like I can relate to everyone in some sort of way. Also, I'm close to home which allows me to be able to see my family when I need to. I don't see myself going anywhere else. This year was great!"

College Student,4,It is a great experience here.
College Sophomore,4,"For the medical field majors its great, there are big hospitals and many positions and opportunities to get experience while still going to school."
College Freshman,4,It's better than walking these dangerous streets ??
College Freshman,4,I personally think that the rooms should be a little bit bigger!
College Freshman,4,The safety and security on campus is pretty great when people start to get into an argument security does jump in and tries to sovle the problem.  And tries to prevent fuhht to the best of their ability!

College Sophomore,4,We can do just a tad bit better when it comes to sports. 
College Sophomore,4,Their is little diversity on our campus to the fact that we are a HBCU (Historical Black College). We are very polite to people outside of our race and we welcome them with love and kindness. 
College Sophomore,4,Our campus is very strict. We are a a smoke and drug free campus. Many students are involved with not participating in drug activities.
College Sophomore,4,"Safety is very important when it comes to our university. Since our college is surrounded by many bad neighborhoods, our public safety is alert 24/7. "

College Sophomore,4,"At Harris Stowe State University that always comiing up with something new to better the student life on both living and education wise all the time, The only issue that they have is that since we are a small institution orf higher learning its hard for marketing and competing against much bigger schools."
College Junior,4,I stay 5 minutes away from school and I love my apartment. It is reasonably priced and close to downtown and other attractions.
College Freshman,4,"HSSU is an HBCU; when people hear HBCU they think ""Black people"".  It's true that majority of the student population is made up of black American students, but there are people here of other races.  I have a class with someone from another continent, and French is his first language.  There are a lot of cultural, racial, ethnic differences, and the school is also diverse in ideas and beliefs."
College Freshman,4,"The school is extremely diverse, and I don't mean ethnically.  I've seen boys and girls dressed with so many different styles, and the people that I end up talking to always have ideas that are new to me. I don't really know the social scene, since I commute and I go straight home afterwards, but from what I hear everyone seems to get along for the most part.  I've met some guys who are SO handsome and polite, while I've also met some girls who are pretty and friendly.  The campus is small, but I still gladly meet someone new everyday."
College Junior,4,"The weather is good, on warm and cool days, everybody is outside chilling and enjoying the weather. Classes are rarely cancelled unless the weather really, really terrible."
College Junior,4,computer wer always open and priting would run out of ink often but it was ok
Recent Alumnus,4,The computers in the library are cool. I wish most people use them for school and not play videos.
College Sophomore,4,All Labs Are Fine Unless Its Time for Finals ‚Äì There aren't many computers but they do work well. We have good WiFi in one building. Computer labs only get crowed around midterms and finals. You would be just fine if you have a labtop.
Sophomore,2,"My experience was okay,I like to see some changes better tutoring academic and great instructors. The library is too small. The graduation rate is extremely low 8%, unnecessary classes are a waste of time to get to your major."
Freshman,2,"The experience at Harris-Stowe I would say is a ""OK"" experience not very exciting. What I would like to see changed it the organization level and the food."
College Freshman,2,"I've been filling out scholarships , and still haven't received any notice"
College Freshman,2,Too many Rules & Regulations
College Junior,2,You have to have visitors check-in and they cant stay long
College Sophomore,2,"We need the caf√© to be open late nights for those late night snacks or late night munchies. We also need a better variety of food and better taste, maybe some soul food would be great, or different theme nights such as taco night or spaghetti night or maybe even veggie night with veggie burritos or veggie lasagna. "
College Sophomore,2,Drugs tend  to be sold all throughout the year on campus. Public safety is very alert and tends  to do their best by catching people who do drugs.
College Sophomore,2,Most computers on campus do not work or are very slow. It is very important to bring your own computer because there are not many computers that are available 24/7.
College Freshman,2,The workload at the schol is similar to high school course work. Professors think that us as students don't know anything so we are treated like we didn't previously graduate high school.
College Sophomore,2,public transportation is barely around. have to wait around 30 mins for a bus stop.
College Junior,2,Student life on campus is mostly students hanging in lobby. From my understanding there is not a lot of things to do for students who stay on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life at Harris Stowe is ok, I seriously think it could be a little better, but I think its because we don't have all the sororities and frats like every other HBCU."
College Junior,2,"Better Rec Room ‚Äì We have a nice gym, but he weight room is small and dated and we don't have a track field. We need a track field."
College Freshman,2,School Policies ‚Äì The attendance is an issue and Harris Stowe is working on a retention program.
College Freshman,2,"Fan Support ‚Äì The fan support at my school could be a lot better than it is now. It seems as if the students or teacher have no school spirit. A lot of times the team loses, but I believe that the team would do much better if the students or teachers supported more than they do. Another solution may be making the sports more of a deal than we do. They don't even seem to make a big deal out of it, which could be another problem. Overall I believe we could do much better with fan support in general."
College Freshman,1,"Other than having your own transportation, the school offers none."
College Freshman,1,"The rules at this school are what make the school non approachable. With nothing to do on campus, the students are confined to their rooms with strict resident assistants and security at every move. The lobby's close at midnight, and the ""game room"" is always packed and closes at midnight also. It's more like a high school, I wished the school offered another rec building with a pool or other stuff to do on campus rather than holding us in a juvenile boarding house."
College Junior,1,I don't think our school has any feature that really sets it apart from other universities.
College Freshman,1,Criminal Justice ‚Äì Harris Stowe is a University that caters more to education degrees my concern is that I wont get all the information or teaching in my degree background at HSSU.
College Sophomore,1,"No Uni-Sex Dorms ‚Äì The dorms are section off to where women and men can not be on each other floors. But the rule I hate the most is no cell phones, this is not highschool and they do not pay our bills"
College Sophomore,1,Horrible Food. The food in the student cafe is terrible. I would not recommend eating her to an animal. The options are limited and seems as if they have the same foods over and over again.

Graduate Student,5,"I took my last 2 months online due to the pandemic. Classes online for me was good because I live an hour away. However, the professor were very understanding of the circumstances. They were ver supportive about online use and assignment which made it a bit more easier."
Freshman,5,"When COVID-19 hit, I wasn't surprised. Professors and staff had both warned us that it was a possibility that we wouldn't be back after the already extended Spring Break; they were correct. However, that did not stop them when it came to supplying online materials for the rest of the semester. My professors were quick to respond to emails (usually within the hour to 24 hours at the latest) and were extremely understanding when it came to issues with internet and gaining access to supplies when most public services had reduced their hours due to COVID."
Freshman,5,"I had originally graduated high school in 2017, but after a dangerous situation, I decided to drop out and get the help I needed to recover. However, I knew that I couldn't stay away from the academic scene for long. So, being a short distance away from my home, I decided to enroll here. From the moment I stepped in and started my first year (for the second time) at GSU, I was immediately welcomed with open arms and smiles. Most of the teachers were very down-to-earth and honest with their students and offered ample amounts of support with their studies. The teachers, staff, and students were very friendly and willing to talk, even if it didn't contain any issues about the course work. If I could have started my college journey for the first time once more, I would have chosen GSU. It's a pretty quiet college with a good atmosphere and amazing food."
Graduate Student,5,I attended Governors State University after recieving my associates at a community college. The GSU faculty is amazing with their hands on approach to help their students succeed. I have had zero issues regarding my courses. All of my classes transfered easily and I am now graduating this month with my bachelors degree. I have fostered so many great relationships here I have decided to stay for graduate school!
Senior,5,"The professors, advisers, and other staff are highly dedicated to making the college experience as rich and smooth as possible for every student. It is abundantly clear that everyone who works for the school is very passionate about the students. The culture is one of learning and cooperation."
Junior,5,the school is a very nice clean school the professor take care of you and they are very helpful the diversity in the school is great you got people from all sorts of place in the world which is nice to meet and talk to different kinds
Sophomore,5,"Governors State is a great school.  For just becoming a 4-year university in 2014, it is very advanced in several aspects. The tuition is very reasonable and students from all walks of life are accepted and given the education that they deserve. The professors are there to help each student which is made possible by the small classroom sizes that allow for one-on-one communication between students and teachers.  The sports program is great and still growing.  There is still room for improvements but Governors State University is a great place to get an education and be happy."
Graduate Student,5,"For the price, it is worth it by far! The teachers are wonderful and the program I am in is great. For how much I'm saving by going here, it is well worth it. I would recommend Governors State for anyone who is trying to go to school but also be able to afford it. I dont believe you will regret it!"
Junior,5,"I really love the fact that GSU is a diverse campus. From the students to the professors, there are many cultures and ethnicities! It makes everyone feel welcomed and like a priority."
Freshman,5,Governors State University is the best college I’ve ever been to. The classes prepare you for the next step .
Junior,5,I enjoy all the people who go there. Everyone is always so nice and supportive in helping you achieve your goals. The food could be a little better or have more variety
Junior,5,"It is an amazing school, especially for a four-year institution. Teachers care very much about their students, and are always there to help you! Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in going to a comfortable and stress-free university."
Freshman,5,I have enjoyed attending this university and the classes I take. I like the smaller class sizes which make it easier to focus on the material and I like the  smaller size of the school which makes it easier to get around. I like to take advantage of the free gym they have and to be able to use their brand new science wing for my class. If there was one thing that needed change It would be to add solar panels to make the university more green.
Graduate Student,5,"I enjoy Governor State University.  The professors are on point with their knowledge and pretty fair with the students.  I would recommend anyone who is looking for a college to try them first.

The university is pretty locally set, in which, it is pretty convenient to get to. It  is also very affordable.    A student could go to school and also work a job to pay their tuition each semester.  Another great feature that was just added was the building of a dormitory on campus.  It has one bedrooms, two bedrooms, and suites available.  A brand new home and lovely people to room with is a deal you can not pass up.

Therefore, keep Governors State University in mind if you are seeking a college now are in the future.

Senior,5,"I currently attend here, and looking forward to the leadership opportunities that is in store for me for my remaining years here at Governors State University"
Freshman,5,I love how all the staff and students are so friendly to me and the campus is extremally safe with the police station on campus.
Freshman,5,I️ absolutely love Governor State University! Such warm and welcoming staff. Friendly students and atmosphere. I️ believe everyone should consider this as a school to enter. It provides great programs for certain majors. And provides great financial aid help.
Niche User,5,Governors  State University is a public university in Illinois. Its a big campus with friendly staff. their website is self explanatory and has all the details regarding admission and financial aid. they also have assigned people for recruitment on country basis. Since I'm from India I was assisted by their country manager in India. He guided me throughout the process of application. As of now I'm admitted to their graduate program. I recommend the college considering the help I got throughout the process.
Niche User,5,Everything I seen and heard about it makes it a very good school.It is considered one of the safest in Illinois has a lot of variety in courses available to its students.
Graduate Student,5,"I love that Governors State provided educational opportunities for working adults, and that they work towards a quality education that is beneficial to all students."
Junior,5,"Governors State University has a very welcoming and friendly atmosphere for everybody, while also keeping professional systems. They encourage you to keep an open mind and learn more about the world around us and help those in need."
Senior,5,There are many reasons why I like Governors State University.   I like the many choices of the Degree programs. Governors State has become an University that continues to advise students of all ages and backgrounds.   The help from the advisers to obtain classes I need to graduate on time is exceedingly helpful with the attitude that they believe in me and my dream profession.   There are many programs that they have to help every student achieve goals.   These are the reasons why I like Governors State University.
Graduate Student,5,I like the diversity in the staff and the student population.  The departments are easily accessible on campus.
Freshman,5,I like the school As a whole it was very nice I love the dorm and the freedom I receive from the school like being able to have my car and what not it really nice and I’m treated as an adult which is a big plus in my book.
Niche User,5,"I love going to GSU because class sizes are small, teachers have time to speak answer your questions during class because lectures aren't overcrowded, and all the teachers I had during my time there were very helpful and cared about students' success in class."
Sophomore,5,"At Governors State University (GSU), one will have to try to fail. This school is relatively small, but it's fantastic because the teachers become more focused on the students rather than just getting through a lecture. I love how hands-on this school is, there are resources everywhere for students; resources may range from tutoring, job employment fair, health awareness, etc... GSU stays busy with its' activities but given all of that they still pay attention into making sure you as a student will not only succeed, but also understand what you are achieving."
Senior,5,"Going into my senior year and I have had great teachers.   Great college life experience. The staff is very helpful and my mentor has made sure that I am on track to graduate on time.  The student body support and staff support at 
athletics events is just awesome!"
Senior,5,My experience at Governors State University is one of the best experiences of my life I came into this school with my mind set that I will be successful once I graduated I have a current 3.7 Grade Point average. I'm on the multiple honors societies and on the Deans List. Being in a student at Governors State University was the best decision I could've made reaching for my dream in going to law school. I was expertly advised about the options of taking required classes in person or online which is very useful information for students who wish to succeed.
Sophomore,5,Governor State University is a place where the faculty/staff come together to help students get on the right track for success. The library hours are amazing and the school provides great tutoring for any subject. This university is well organized. The grad-programs are awesome.
Freshman,5,"Governors State University is like no other college experience. The professors are willing to go the extra mile to ensure that their students are successful and receive any extra help they need. My life at GSU has not only been able to open my eyes to new cultural, intellectual, and personal experiences, but I have found a community where I feel confident I have the support I need to succeed."
Graduate Student,5,"I love the flexibility in the scheduling. I am employed full time,a wife and a mother. I enjoyed the professorsame that I had as well as meeting new people."
Junior,5,"So far, Governor State is a very unique school. I haven't had any problems out of it. However, you do have a few teachers that just come to school for the pay check and not to fill the students with knowledge. But, that's at any and all schools. "
College Freshman,5,"The professors are really caring and they are trying their best to make students successful. Their teaching is also good because not only they are trying to teach us something, but make lessons less dull with their personality."
College Freshman,5,Governors State University is one of the safest college/university in the Illinois State. They have police cars patrolling around campus 24/7 and GSU is at a peaceful environment.
College Freshman,5,Crime on campus is virtually non existent. We have cops patrolling the campus at all times and proper security measures have been implemented.
College Freshman,5,"The dorms on campus are amazing. They are basically apartments with full kitchens, living room and bathrooms shared with a max of 3 people. The dorms even include separate study rooms and a store."
College Freshman,5,I like the school as whole. The staff at GSU is so nice and friendly. When you walk in you are greeted with a smile and good morning everyday.
Recent Alumnus,5,My experience at Governors State University has been busy.  I welcome the challenge.
College Sophomore,5,This school does have a very good commitment towards internship opportunities. You really need only look to find some assistance in whatever field you apply yourself towards.
College Sophomore,5,People come from different types of backgrounds! It's great!
Senior,4,There’s a variety of classes and the professors strive to do their best. There are a variety of helpful tools if you need extra help in classes.
Senior,4,All professors adjusted to online learning and we are powering through it. There are a variety of resources to help with your classes.
Senior,4,Online is generally easy as any school. But they are some professors here that will just ignore your email for simple to hard questions about the class. Just know they are amazing professor that have that passion to teach. Don't be scared. Ask students or go to Rate My Professor before taking the class.
Sophomore,4,I am currently a sophomore at Governors State University and I love it. There are so many opportunities to get involved around campus. I love how small it is and how it's easier to get things done. The staff are always very helpful and open up their office hours.
Graduate Student,4,"I like how diverse the community is in this school. Also, I like how it isn’t so big which the small community has a strong connection."
Junior,4,"I needed to take fully online classes due to medical purposes. I have never taken any in person courses at this school, so I can not compare anything. I am a transfer from a community college and had in person courses there, and I can say these online classes were roughly equally well. The only issues I had were finding out some grades as well as losing the ability to have hands on learning."
Junior,4,"I fully took online courses, so I can not say anything at all about how campus life is. I spent one semester so far online, and I can say it went pretty well. My only complaint is that some professors either failed to put up grades, or took a very long time. In addition to that, I had some issues communicating with outside services in connection to the school that I needed. Other than that, I can not say I have complaints with the professors nor the courses I had."
Junior,4,"It's an excellent, affordable school with professors that truly want to see you succeed and have been incredibly accommodating and understanding during the pandemic. My advisor is prompt and helpful. Classes are enriching and result in noticeable progression within my studies after just one semester. Although, there's limited housing and smaller athletics programs, this school is definitely worth every penny! I wish I'd started here as  a freshman instead of transferring over my junior year. At my previous school, I hadn't gotten involved in anything, nor did I desire to. I would go to class and then go straight home. At Governors State University, I've made friends and joined extracurriculars because I truly wanted to!"
Graduate Student,4,"It’s a great school, but very low school spirit because of its size. it’s convenient, moderately challenging and the professors are awesome."
Sophomore,4,This is my first year at Governors State University. I started the semester last week and so far it's great. The class size is small and everyone seem friendly & making sure if help is needed that they are willing to help
Freshman,4,"I've recently enrolled into this school; and the advisors and counselors have been extremely helpful. They made the registration and application process easy to understand; and my advisor is really efficient. She makes sure you don't have to take more classes than absolutely necessary; and I just love that. Thanks to her; and as long as I pass all my classes; I can finish my bachelors within a year and a half to two years. This will make my transition into the masters program(as long as i'm accepted of course) an even better thing because I know that they care enough to take care of me. They provide services to alumni and students in school. From mock interviews and help with resume, cover letter, etc. to network connections to get you employed after graduation."
Senior,4,"GSU is pretty average. The Prof are nice and we get real hands-on experience in all our courses. However I am a Media Studies major and I'm trying to be an animator. Sadly, there are not that many useful art classes here.I wish their were more digital art courses. We mainly only have painting, drawing, ceramics, etc. We only have 1 or 2 Prof that teach animation and/or game design. Wish we had more."
Senior,4,"The campus needs to be cleaner. The bathroom are always dirty and smell bad. The floors look really dirty. 
The professors are good though. The are welcoming and are willing to help. They understand life happens and are good resources for help. The staff is overall nice and helpful. They don’t have attitudes like community colleges."
Junior,4,I like Governors State because they are very flexible with offering course at other campus and they also online classes
Senior,4,"The school is a pretty cheap, at least where I am at. I can go on campus and get my work done in the computer lab. Most of the computer are pretty out dated and should be upgraded ASAP. the classes are Not really hard as they are time consuming. I have friends in must classes that we help each other out with home work if one of use is having trouble. The rest of the students are friendly as well. I did meet a lot of new people here."
Freshman,4,My experience so far at GSU has been fairly good. I have been able to focus on my work and if I ever need help with anything there is always somebody there to help.
Junior,4,"Governors University has changed my life and I say this because I am a 27 year old female and in the middle of my college career I got very ill, so I took a break from school which was only supposed to be one year and that year turned into 3 years. At this point I told myself you are too old to go back to school. After sitting home week after week I told myself you can go back to school and do better than before! Getting back in the swing of going to school was hard, but Governors State University made this process very pleasant for me, which made me excited to start school again. I love my school and all of the staff members there, from the professors to the cafeteria ladies and gentlemen. This a great school and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great college!!"
Junior,4,Governors State University has been like another home to me because they are there for their students.
Junior,4,This is my first year at Governors State and so far I have enjoyed my experience.  The teachers are helpful and the curriculum is challenging yet fun.  I have yet to experience anything that would warrant changing.
Senior,4,Governors State University is a great college to attend for students who are looking for an affordable college experience. The professors at this school truly care about the student's education. The school is full of rich cultural experiences and student life involvement.
Junior,4,My experience at Governor State University has been average but I rate my overall experience good. I have had two great individuals as the advisor that guided me and they were the Junior Advisors Ned Laff and Lakia Colquitt.  I enjoy individuals that want to help and guide you in the right direction without making you repeat or give you a class and it was not in your major. They are helpful and it does not matter Lakia would walk you hand in hand to the right place.
Sophomore,4,I love the amount of help that is available here at Governors State. There is no reason not to be successful here.
Freshman,4,I like how close it is to home and how it is one of the more affordable colleges when pursuing a nursing degree. The library itself is a very cozy place to study or take a nap. I receive helpful instructions in their state-of-the-art nursing laboratories.
Junior,4,"I'm a transfer student into GSU. The academics and professors are great here! The campus is a bit of a maze, but there is always someone around to help you find where you need to be and there are signs everywhere helping you figure out where you are. The athletic program is currently growing, so the school doesn't offer many sports yet but is in the process of adding more and expanding its current programs. There are always events going on through different clubs and organizations on campus. GSU has a diverse population of students in terms of race, religion, and age. Many students are commuters and transfer students because GSU only started accepting freshmen a few years ago."
Junior,4,"The college is very pretty, everyone is very friendly and if you need help finding something the staff is always willing to help. It's located almost near Chicago so the zone is not too bad. Classes are generally easy and there is a lot of activities you can do there."
Junior,4,I love that this school is so accommodating and appealing to the working adult. I am able to work full time and complete my degree part time!
Sophomore,4,The university does an excellent job of promoting effective mental health. The professors and administration work well with students.
Junior,4,"I am currently Commuting to Governors Sate University to get a Bachelor's in Accounting. I haven't been there too long, but from what I've seen it is a good school. It is large and offers many different subjects to study. There is a diverse number of people both learning and teaching at the University (3 of my 4 teachers are from other countries). It is a pretty safe school. There are plenty of lights around the school as well as security cameras, and the parking lots are patrolled by security in the evenings. Governors State is always looking for people to add to their roster, and they are willing to work with you towards your goals."
Junior,4,Governors State University is a progressive success. Only time can tell the wonders GSU will continue to produce. This University is well-rounded and is a comfortable environment and foundation for students of every type.
Junior,4,This is the best university that I personally have been too. The fact that it went from a graduate school to a 4 year so is amazing . And it gives the people who didn't want to go away to school and opportunity to be close to home. This school is ideal for the working class.
Junior,4,"One aspect of Governors State University that I love the most is how small the classes are. My personal opinion is that students can not truly connect with their professor if there two hundred students or more in one classroom. What I would like to change about the university is to broaden the full campus experience. Governors State University does not have a homecoming, a wide variety of clubs, nor a budget. With no budget clubs are canceled along with classes if the class is not full. Also, tuition has increases significantly. If Governors State University made those improvements, incoming freshmen may make Governors State University their first choice."
College Freshman,4,The dorm in GSU is an excellent place to live. They have a laundromat in the dorms for people living here and a little store that opens at night. They also have a big courtyard that we can socialize and do outdoor activities.
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school, but it is the middle of no where and otherwise in a somewhat unsavory area."
College Junior,4,Governors State University  has alot of great professors that truly care about their students. The university is located in a suburb. The campus police are always  patrolling the parking lots. I feel really safe because of that.
College Senior,4,I have really enjoyed all my teachers and hope to have them for future classes.  Class-size is good it's about 25 students per one teacher.
College Senior,4,"My  School has  A great psychology department that knows what they're doing and helps the students the best they can.  They are in Fordham school that allows for different options such as scholarships, loans and  grants.  The only thing that they lack in is advisers that are helpful in finding the career for you."
College Freshman,4,Our campus is actually pretty safe we might have the safest one in the state
College Freshman,4,The classes and professors are easy for the most part classes are pretty enjoyable
College Freshman,4,They have a great psychology program that has large enrollment and they have many internships for it
College Freshman,4,I actually love living on campus it's amazing
College Freshman,4,It's pretty easy to get into my school. no essays no interview just apply and telling them all about you in your application
College Freshman,4,The professors I've had so far are excellent and really care for the students. They are easy to meet with and are very interested in the success of their students.
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is great because we have access to the school. The dorms are new and they are apartment style housing which means some rooms have a full kitchen, bathroom and living room area. I love how I am able to get my own room and not having to share a room with anyone."
College Sophomore,4,It does feel a bit safer around campus with the security always posted somewhere around.
College Sophomore,4,"I had heard nothing but great things about Governors State. Although I was hesitant because it was not my 1st choice. I wanted to attend school in California. However, I came to compromise and it was the best decision I made. The classes help improve my skills as an artist both physically and mentally. My professors make the class interesting by encouraging everyone to participate and get involved. I am passionate about succeeding, but even more passionate about art. This school has got me started and I am positive it will lead me to where I belong in my career."
College Freshman,4,The teachers are great and the curriculum is great as well. The registration process is extremely easy. The study abroad options are great.
College Freshman,4,The security is amazing on campus and they ensure the safety of all students and faculty. There are low rates of campus crime and extreme measures are taken to prevent crime.
College Freshman,4,The professors I've had are overall very nice. They are concerned about the students well being.
College Freshman,4,I have a great overall experience at Governors State University. I would choose to go to this again and do it all over because of the small class size. The small school atmosphere allows me and other students to benefit more in a smaller classroom setting as well as smaller teacher to student ratio. This school is unique because it is small but also has great racial diversity. No certain race is considered more important than another so we are not faced with racial issues other schools are facing.
College Freshman,4,Security on campus is Governor State University number one priority.
College Freshman,4,Most of the Professors are good. Their are just a few that have a teaching style that you have to adapt to. Most of them my professor like to interact with the students.
College Freshman,4,Everyone from the staff to the students are friendly
College Freshman,4,The school have a lot clubs there but the basketball team is the most popular team on campus
College Senior,4,"I have enjoyed Governors State University thus far. The professors are what set them apart from any other university. They are willing to go over something if it is not understood the first time. They even take time out of their schedules to send emails out in regards to internships and possible job opportunities. It has been a wonderful experience being able to witness the growth at GSU. During my first few semesters at GSU, they did not have any sports teams, but now they have a women's and men's basketball team and a volleyball team. I would definitely choose this school again because of the environment, the professors, the price, and the location."
College Sophomore,4,i choose my school because it turned into its first 4 year university and now I'm making history. they are willing to hear and give the students here a voice to be heard and takes everything into consideration. Also they are every willing to help when they are needed and are very hands on with each individual.
Recent Alumnus,4,A straight forward school with teachers that enforce engagement
College Freshman,4,"I was always the ""token friend"" in high school, and never had to look for friends. People just came to me, and that sure hasn't changed attending this school. I don't really live on campus, but I tend to frequent the game room here, or go to the fitness center. Outside of those two locations, I'm unaware of anywhere else to spend time after classes besides the cafeteria itself. It's a pretty small town, and with the dorms being only recently built, there's not much goin on outside of student program council events. Some days I wish there were more younger people around, other days I'm okay with the current population of mostly adults in their 20+'s."
College Sophomore,4,"My freshman year was a journey full of many obstacles that I was able to overcome with the help of my professors and peers. At Governors State University, I was able to truly feel accomadated to the environment. The professors are there to fully help you through the courses. If I ever had an issue I knew that I could simply approach my professors without feeling ashamed or embarresed. Not only was my freshman year a journey but, it also was a huge eye opener for myself. At times my character and values were put to the test, I always had to remind myself that if I wanted to succeed in life I needed to surround myself with postive people. My roommate had a huge impact on college experience, she was the person I was able to connect with because we had the same mindset of succeeding in college. Overall, my experience was great and look forward to continuing my studies here!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"I have been to 3 different colleges since 2010 and I honestly have to say this university has made me feel the most comfortable.  I have never had a more welcoming and polite faculty that was willing to help.  I am doing way better in my classes than I ever imagined, I even made the Dean's List for the first time.  My teachers are a big help and they are very understanding when it comes to life outside of school."
College Freshman,4,"I love this school, it was close to where i live but not that close. It was a lot cheaper than other 4 year universities that I was considering that is why this university stood out more to me, the cost. The faculty was very welcoming and helpful throughout the semester and i just loved it."
Graduate Student,2,It is a decent college with a academic counselor staff that needs to learn customer service skills.  The President does not reflect the culture of the school and she is snooty.  She would not shake our hands at our graduation!
Graduate Student,2,"This is a poorly run school by pseudo-intellectuals that have no idea how to connect with students. As you listen and watch the ""leaders"" check for authenticity in communication. Remember that this is a business and this business is trying to draw you in so that you can earn capital, your money. If you want a pretty easy credential and want to spend a minimum amount of money, this is the place! There are some good people, some really good people but you have to find them and it does take effort. There are a few very good teachers but not many. The film program is terrible. They have a saying that goes, ""The little MFA program that could"". But the word ""NOT"" was forgotten at the end of the sentence... Poor equipment, poor instruction, poor structure, poor connectivity and a lack of proper preparation. Perhaps this would be a good school/program for you. Only you can determine this. I wish you well on your quest!"
College Senior,2,Hard to network and advisors not helpful with finding internships.
College Senior,2,Administration is unreliable and unhelpful. They act inconvenienced when you seek help.
College Senior,2,Facilties are outdated and no one wants to use them.
College Junior,2,"This is a weak university on a edge of closing down due to insufficient funds , it's not s popular university due to the lack of activities and the location. This was my last option and hopefully it turns out good"
College Freshman,2,If you don't have a care you are limited tot he places you can order from if you stay on campus.
College Sophomore,2,This is not yet a school that houses fraternities or treats them in any sort of special way.
College Freshman,2,"I am not a party girl, and I do not go to parties, but the one party that I did attend was horrible and creepy, my experience was bad. We are the first freshman class and we have no leeway to have fun when all the older people of the campus are grumpy that we are there."
College Sophomore,2,Its hard to get a good social life since the students mainly commute a good distance
College Sophomore,2,The local weather affected my campus experience because the streets had not been plowed. Card were stuck in ditches and there was a few accidents I saw.  They should probably be aware of the weather and have trucks to clean the snow.
College Sophomore,2,There is not much off campus dinning to choose from. I do not know my way amount the city but what I see there is not much to choose from.
College Sophomore,2,the financial aid office could be managed better.
College Junior,2,There are not many option near the school
College Junior,2,i dont see much going on in relation to varsity.
Recent Alumnus,2,The school is out in the middle of nowhere so unless you have a car you are pretty much bringing your lunch or eating in the cafeteria.
College Senior,2,"I think it is bad because the road is dark, when it snows the roads aren't as clean as they should be and there is no lighting because its in the prairie, a long drive from home too."
College Senior,2,"There are no restaurants around the school area, if you want to buy some food you need to drive like 5-10 minutes to get to one McDonald's and drive farther to get to other restaurants, mostly fast food. no student discounts and its the same price as any other one. "
College Junior,2,GSU has a shuttle bus with various times that shuttles students from the train to the school and back. We have a metra line that leaves students fairley close to the campus. Unfortunately there are no busses that leave students right at the campus. 
College Junior,2,We currently have only 6 sports teams
Alum,1,"Not only is the school absolutely horrible administratively, they have a terrible advising department and care very little about their students. Whether it be through their professors, the way they treat their staff, their financial aid department or their policies, The school gives themselves way too much credit. After spending two dreaded years here, I’m so glad to have graduated and left this treacherous place."
Alum,1,"There is no way that the school invested anything into their online program. They use the same interface as their teaching system and it was constantly running into issues. If they weren’t so cheap, they would invest in Zoom. But they didn’t."
Niche User,1,If I could give it 0 stars I would... the advisors are horrible and tell you lies. They just want you to give the school money. I would not suggest you go to this school if you want an actual college experience.
Sophomore,1,"Governors State claims to be for the students, but I felt like I was tricked into believing that the school actually cared. for undergrads, there is no student life, and most tend to transfer out after one semester."
Graduate Student,1,"Governors State University is a poorly run institutional machine that provides lackluster education.  Generally speaking this is the bottom of barrel in education. You get what you pay for and this is probably the most inexpensive school, of its kind, in the State of Illinois. Cheap education = low quality because many of the folks wouldn't get hired elsewhere to teach. Small classes = small enrollment. The ratio is small because enrollment is low and thus fewer students. The MFA programs are mostly lackluster, especially the film department. Poor gear options, lazy and uninspired instructors. Their claim to fame is a couple of awards but that does not make them good instructors, not by a long shot. There is nothing of interest around the campus, the art is fair in the ""garden"".  It is just not inspiring or interesting. If you are looking to get fired up about life, education, passion and possibility do go elsewhere."
College Senior,1,Unreliable and unhelpful. Staff very difficult to work with and very unorganized.
College Senior,1,Greek life is hard to join and not worth the fees spent.
College Freshman,1,"A group of friends and i wanted to rent an apartment near the school for the second semester since dorming wasn't all that was cracked up to be. Unfortunately with high prices and proof that we worked full time, it wasn't happening."
College Sophomore,1,This is not a school for parties yet. Most people here just come and go to class with maybe a few school functions and events inbetween. The campus housing is still too new.
College Sophomore,1,The area surrounding the school is very poor. It is a building process. The school is working very hard to improve this.
College Sophomore,1,it does not exist right now
College Senior,1,"There is no place in the area, as of yet, that accommodates students. the apartments are all very expensive in the area. The school is building dorms on campus, though, to solve this problem."
College Junior,1,The majority of the students here are working adults looking to gain an edge at their work place or to get a better job. I am 22 right now and I don't bother trying to find any night life.
College Junior,1,"Turn left at the corn field, turn right when you see a windmill...those are the directions to the school and a eyesight into the surrounding area.  Mcdonalds and Wendys is 2-3 miles away.  there are barren fields and a bowling alley past mcdonalds"
College Junior,1,"Unless you like to party like the Children of the Corn, there is absolutely nothing to do in this one horse town.  Theres a couple local bars in the area but nothing for the youth scene.  There is a metra rail system and a shuttle bus but that is about it."
College Junior,1,"Always be prepared and KEEP YOUR DOCUMENTS. GSU's financial aid department is not top of the line and they do OFTEN misplace paperwork. Anything submitted, a double should be kept."

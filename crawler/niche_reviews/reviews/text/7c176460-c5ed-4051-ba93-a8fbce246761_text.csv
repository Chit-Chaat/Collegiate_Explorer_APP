Senior,5,"Although not everyone is used to taking classes online, FDU has made my experience smooth as most of my professors seem to be comfortable using zoom and technology."
Junior,5,"As a nursing student classes are very difficult, but the professors will help you when asked. They have so many events that help you network with others that are in the same major as you and those who aren't. Career Development also host events that can help you network with jobs and internships that you're interested in. The only thing that I would like to be different in FDU is the amount of tuition, I know it's a private university but instead of raising the tuition every year, they should raise it every other year."
Alum,5,Professors provided a detailed scheduled of learner's expectations. Provided clarification and helpful resources when needed. Engaged in routine correspondences with students online.
Alum,5,"Classes are great, teachers are amazing. College has partnerships with community colleges that allow students to attend the college via their local community college"
Sophomore,5,The Professors of Fairleigh Dickinson truly do care about their students. Many professors had contacted me one-on-one to check on my academics as well as my health. This staff is very hands on and very passionate about teaching at such a great school.
Sophomore,5,This school offers great programs and opportunities for everyone. It also has a great staff that cares about the wellfare of their students! I am so proud of being a Knight!
Junior,5,"Most homework is handed-in online though the website Blackboard and it is pretty good. Using Zoom throughout the semester when the school moved to remote online-learning was challenging at times, but the professors I had worked patiently with students and extended deadlines to take the load off."
Junior,5,This is the only school that I could genuinely say has made me feel welcomed and well-treated. They offer many resources and opportunities that I have never been able to receive before and have a great staff to help me out with any problems (academic or financial.) The student body truly is great and the campus is a home away from home.
Junior,5,All my professors were really accommodating when it came to online learning and they tried to treat zoom as if we were in the classroom.
Freshman,5,Beautiful university! Really kind and dedicated faculty and staff! Great opportunities and a really beautiful campus too :) <3
Sophomore,5,I love the campus. It's so diverse and there are so many things to do in campus! The school has different events that go into NYC for low cost or free.
Senior,5,The advisors at Fairleigh Dickinson have been incredibly helpful during my transferring process. Each person I have spoken with has taken the time to review my specific circumstances and direct me with proper next steps.
Freshman,5,"So far my experience has been excellent. I love the environment, small classes, and wonderful professors. The professors and staff want everyone to succeed and do well in their career."
Niche User,5,While I am an upcoming freshman the way I have been treated so far is great! They have reached out to me many times and they really care about their students and trying to hope them get good internships that turn into jobs.
Freshman,5,"So far, my experience at FDU has been great. I've made tons of friends and have learned a lot from the amazing professors."
Sophomore,5,"I love Fairleigh Dickinson University. I'm very comfortable on the Teaneck campus, where I commute to. It's an easy drive and parking is convenient. I love my professors and lectures. The counselors are super helpful in all areas. I made friends in my grade and we have study group sessions, which I love. I also use the gym on campus to get some exercise. I'm very happy with my choice of Fairleigh Dickinson University. In a few years, I'll have a double major masters degree and will be ready to start a new chapter in life."
Freshman,5,"As a second-semester freshman, awaiting to embark my sophomore year of college, this school is great...for me. FDU - Metropolitan can be described as a beautiful, quiet college campus. There are numerous student organizations for students to join, but have set activities planned during the week. For me, this is great. I get to enjoy my weekend studying for upcoming exams and quizzes, and de-stress cause college is VERY, VERY, stressful. To make your own opinion, come check it out for yourself! (:"
Sophomore,5,"I love the classes at Fairleigh Dickinson. The professors are very chill and informative. As a communications major, I love the social media classes that are offered."
Junior,5,"I love that I live close enough to walk to campus. Small classes, and pretty tight instruction. Lots of Study Abroad opportunities, take advantage of as many  as you can, particularly the Global Scholars program."
Senior,5,"I had a great experience, I would recommend this school to anyone who wants a small community and a good education. Fairleigh dickinson brings the beat out of people and shows them their strengths and weaknesses of the field they about to get in."
Senior,5,My school has provided me with the tool and life goal to push harder in life. While I go into my senior year I will miss my school and I try to better myself in the work field. Fairleigh has help my become a better engineer and they made sure I had the tools and knowledge to take my life to the next level. I join many clubs like national society of black engineers and made many friends I hope to keep them close as we leave to make a new chapter in our lives
Freshman,5,Fairleigh Dickinson University was absolutely amazing. When I was there it felt just like home. What I love about it the most is how it is almost like city life. There are so many things you could do at Fairleigh Dickinson University and several trips into the city. There is not a single thing I would change about Fairleigh Dickinson University.
Junior,5,"I transferred in this fall, and my first semester has been great! If you get involved on campus right away there are a lot of opportunities available. It's a little bit on the expensive side, but other than that I love everything about this school."
Sophomore,5,"While attending Fairleigh Dickinson University, I have experienced the ups and downs of being at college. The work load can be a little heavy plus scheduling classes is rough. However, I have also had the pleasure of meeting some great professors. While challenging, classes are fun and informative. The campus is very big so you get a lot of exercise walking to and from classes."
College Senior,5,The Basketball team is awesome.
College Sophomore,5,My school has a lot of wonderful professors that care about us and want us to succeed. All my professors know me by my name. The students work hard.
College Senior,5,"the best Experience ever, the  professors are very friendly"
College Sophomore,5,"the non-Greeks and the Greek, they are good person."
College Junior,5,Campus crime  is kept at a minimum and the university has low tolerance for dangerous crimes
College Freshman,5,"If you're a business major, you'll have no problem in finding a job, especially if you are a good student. As long as you're willing to put in the hard work, you'll be fine."
College Freshman,5,I love it! Wouldn't change it for the world!
College Freshman,5,"Nobody say nothing, each decision is respected"
College Freshman,5,I know that the campus is extremely safe and they always take special security measures for all in the campus.
College Freshman,5,The value of a degree from this school is awesome and important because I know people that study in this university and now have a good life. All of them have jobs with their degrees and I want to be one of them.
College Freshman,5,"I really like my classes. All my professors teach with  different styles, there are many classes that you can take, and per each class there are less than 20 students and this facilities a better understanding in each class. I love it."
College Freshman,5,"Fairleigh Dickinson University is the best in many things. The professors teach very well, I learn a lot of them. Also, both campuses are big. The university have a lot of activities for their students. It is amazing."
College Freshman,5,all the students feel security on a campus because the University have a good safety services.
College Freshman,5,the professors are excellent because we learn more better with them.
College Freshman,5,all the student need to select a good career that we like the best.
College Freshman,5,all of that are so nice because are excellent in all the place.
College Freshman,5,the athletics at school are important to represent the school.
College Freshman,5,the school is unique because I past so good experiences.
College Junior,5,Our University provides psychological services (S-CAPS) to any student who may need someone to talk to or help on with a particular issue and the best part is that everything is kept confidential.
College Junior,5,My experience at FDU with professors has been wonderful and very professional. The professors are here to help you and they encourage you to visit with them if you are having trouble or need help. The class sizes are fair about 20-25 students in a class. There are a variety of different course options taught by different professors either online or in class.
College Junior,5,They help us with our questions and review our problem to help us understand better.
College Junior,5,These classes  are great for learning how to be professional for our careers.
College Freshman,5,"Honestly, I hadn't heard very good things about FDU when I decided to come here. However, I definitely think its on me of the best decisions I've ever made. The campus is small enough to a point where you know almost everyone, but big enough where you could see a new face everyday. Its location is also perfect, as NYC is a 30 min drive away!"
College Freshman,5,I am very pleased with my choice and my overall experience at Fairleigh Dickinson University. I like how the classes are small and you get a more personable feel with the professors.
College Student,5,I really enjoy my time at FDU and would like to graduate from here.  I need all the help I can get to make my family proud of me.
College Sophomore,5,I live at home with my mother.  Its the best place to be right now until I complete my college education.
College Sophomore,5,"I have found a University for my continued education that feels like home away from home.  I have become one with my fellow classmates and we have collaborated as a team and participated in Relay for Life.  We raised funds and enjoyed contributing to this cause ""CANCER"".  I also have realized that by uniting with my fellow classmates and establishing positive relations, I am able to grow more as an individual and as a team player.  I love attending this school and Im elated that I was chosen to be a part of a great movement."
College Freshman,5,"People have different personalities, and different beliefs, and in this school different beliefs are accepted."
College Freshman,5,"The only tip I would recommend is to do your financial aid on time, and be sure to check once you feel you've handed everything in just to make sure your ready to go."
College Freshman,5,This school offered me the most money--still needed a lot of aid
College Sophomore,5,Our campus is very open.  You can do any activity just about anywhere.
College Sophomore,5,I believe Fairleigh Dickinson University is a well-known school.  It provides a lot of opportunities to meet potential employers.
College Sophomore,5,The university has a diverse group of individuals.  We are definitely accepting of everyone from all the international students to the religious belief students to even just the regular students born here in America.
College Freshman,5,Extremely diverse campus. No one will judge you.
College Junior,5,The professors are very knowledgeable and they worked in the field.
College Sophomore,5,the security on our campus is great. the guards are always patrol. if you have any concerns you can call them and they will help you.
Sophomore,4,"My online experience with FDU has been very overwhelming and of course, challenging but it has not stopped me from becoming a better learner and getting my degree. It has only made me want to strive and push through during these circumstances we are in."
Sophomore,4,"What I like most about this campus is how connected everyone is including the staff. Many of the professors genuinely care about your academic performance and want to see you achieve which only makes a student want to succeed. I enjoy how the campus life and the activities also want you to be connected when it comes to different events, clubs, etc so you can make your campus experience more enjoyable. The only change I wish FDU would have is the party scene considering it is a dry campus."
Senior,4,"There are various reasons as to why I chose Fairleigh Dickinson University for my education. One of them being their study abroad program. There are many opportunities to travel abroad, whether it is for an entire semester or short term such as during spring break. They have a campus in England which is great for someone who wants to explore Europe as they plan many trips. Another reason is their 4+1 program depending on what you are studying. You can basically graduate with a masters degree in one year instead of two. Also, there are opportunities for everyone. Their academic advisors and outplacement staff are amazing. They will go above and beyond to make sure you can find an internship or job. They help you make connections and guide you through an interview and hiring process.  As a Marketing major, the Silberman College of Business is absolutely the place to be at as a business student."
Alum,4,"FDU was a university that  gave you the opportunity to thrive. There were a lot of opportunities waiting to be taken advantage of.  There were also plenty of sporting events to attend, student activity events and trips and even studying abroad opportunities. The experience will be what YOU make it.  Not everything will be cut out for you or handed to you.  College will mold you, but you have the opportunity to mold your own experiences for your own benefit."
Graduate Student,4,I only shifted to online classes after the pandemic. We had classes through zoom which was pretty average but not bad.
Junior,4,Love the people and the environment. The food is getting better slowly but surely and it is extremely safe.
Senior,4,"I enjoyed studying at Fairleigh Dickinson University. Teachers are nice, they show interest, and answer any question. I want to mention dr. Francisco Parra, professor, and academic advisor. Very supportive and helpful. I appreciate everything, was a nice journey."
Junior,4,"My professors were very understanding which was great. My online experience was good.It was a bit difficult to transition at first and I hope we don't have to do this again, but overall my professors made it pretty simple. I got good grades even being online so that shows how good my professors were. Its very important for the professors to be understanding during those times."
Junior,4,Small campus so the classes are small which I like. Everybody gathers for sports games together and all the sports teams are close.
Freshman,4,The campus is very commuter-friendly and the scenery is beautiful! The buildings are easy to find and commuters and residents collide smoothly.
Sophomore,4,I feel that Fairleigh Dickinson should consult with students before making major decisions. I understand that they are in charge but we are the ones attending the school. The advisor should actually help the students to make decisions instead of leaving them to fend for themselves. The cafeteria cost is quite expensive but the food is honestly horrible . There are not many options and what is available is not even healthy. The library we pay for is not even open long enough for people who study at night which is most people. The tuition ia rising and being spent on unnecessary renovations
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Fairleigh Dickinson University are very memorable in a sense that everyone that I have met during my freshman year are still the same friends that I have kept to this day; however, the only change I wish to see on campus is to build another bridge for easy access within the campus."
Junior,4,"Great university for communication majors. 
Amazing program with a diverse set of opportunities. 
The con would be the immense tuition. 
Yet I do appreciate the school keeping its facilities continuously updated and engaging students with a lot of events."
Junior,4,College is what you make it at FDU. Take advantage of the opportunities given to you here. Diverse campus with many ways to become involved.
Sophomore,4,"What I love about Fairleigh Dickinson are the renovations that are being made. Since the day I came to visit, I was skeptical about how the campus would look because it reminded me of a construction zone. Now, the renovations make the campus look even more amazing, and they're continuing to make renovations to make the campus look great. What makes the campus even better is the school spirit. Our basketball team won our conference championship and made it to the first round of the NCAA championship which raised our school spirit up to the roof! The students and staff at Fairleigh Dickinson get along very well, and the professors always make sure that their students understand the material to the point where they can answer any question like they have known it off of the back of their hand. So far, my overall experience at Fairleigh Dickinson has been great, and I am looking forward to the next few years here!"
Sophomore,4,"Fairleigh Dickinson is a great schooling environment for those who believe that less is more. With the university being a private institution, students and faculty are able to engage more during and after class. Student body on campus works hard to find and recruit members to get involved in campus activities throughout the school year. I would like to see improvement in the university’s cafe located in the Student Union Building (SUB). The cafe's closing time should change from 9 pm to either 11 pm or 12 am due to the fact that students are now taking classes that last up until 10 pm at night and students on campus are not always able to make it until after closing time. Food selections throughout the week should also be more varied with quality in mind; especially since students like myself, tend to eat elsewhere when food isn't prepared or sat out for too long. This improvement will keep money in students pockets and prevent food that wasn't eaten from going to waste."
Freshman,4,"There are clearly very talented people at the university, but there is a lack of investment for students in terms of the actual life on campus. There needs to be more communication on important issues regarding students and their academics, as professionals need to realize that oftentimes, they have the fate of various students academic lives at stake."
Junior,4,"The University is very diverse and the professors are very polite. I would like there to be more place to eat on campus. Also I always thought that there should be another book store near Dickinson hall or at least something similar. Other than that, the school is pretty good. They're renovating some things so, that should be interesting."
Alum,4,"I studied Biochemistry here and got my bachelor's degree in 4 years. The professors were helpful and pushed students to try their best. They had flexible office hours and answered questions knowledgeably,  especially the ones in the school of Natural Science. Making my schedule each semester was easy for two reasons: 1) incoming students got 4-year tentative curricula to follow and 2) there was always open class sections or they were created when needed. The things I would like to see improve are tuition costs and the student facilities. Tuition increased my senior year and it was difficult paying for the extra amount. Also, the science laboratories need to be renovated and the materials and chemicals replaced."
Freshman,4,"So far as a freshman I’ve come to consider the university my home. There are so many things to do on and off campus. There are so many clubs and activities to participate in. Since the campus is in the middle of two cities there are so many different places to go visit and hang out with. The safety of the campus is always promoted with public safety always around making sure everything is in order. In terms of academics I’ve encountered professor who actually care about me and my future and because of it, made me strive to do better and be the best version of myself."
Sophomore,4,"Fairleigh Dickinson University is a great university that you have to take into consideration, if you are looking for a good college. They have many programs that help Latino students achieve their professional goals. For example, HACER and Latino Promise are excellent programs that you should know about it if isn’t English your first language. These programs allow you take ESL’s classes to improve your English skill and academic courses, as well. This a great opportunity that you should have in mind when you are looking for universities to attend."
Senior,4,"The opportunities to study abroad are numerous which I took advantage of. The advisor for the Two Worlds program helped me transition from high school to college life every step of the way as well as involving my parents and easing their concerns. BUT! She got fired for a legal issue and her replacements haven't matched the bar she set. The advising of those after have been spotty and unreliable. 
As for the professors they are really approachable and insightful, clear and concise. They are generally available for one on one meetings for any questions or concerns you might have.  
Commuting to this school very easy to do as many buses run their route to accommodate the students here; It is located 30 minutes away from the city. Many events are always happening too. Intervarsity and Nubian ladies events are my favorite to attend. Also, the free stuff different groups and guests give from time to time are cool."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at FDU is good. Because of the location, there is not much that you cannot do without a car, but you can easily get on a bus and go to New York. The campus is small, so you tend to see the same people around daily. The professors are nice and want you to succeed. The food is average; it is like high school food.  In the fall, there are a lot of events of campus, but in the spring it is the opposite."
Alum,4,"FDU was good, but I feel as though the MA in Forensic Psych should only be offered with the BA/MA program. To me it felt more like a 5th year undergrad program, rather than a graduate program. It seemed as though it was more introductory than anything else, honestly. It's also only 1.5 years. At first that sounds amazing, until you realize you're taking 12 credits for 3 semesters in a row (full-time for graduate is 9). Spring semester almost destroys everyone, and I wish there was more experience with assessments."
Senior,4,"Very good opportunities to intern, volunteer. Many clubs for involvement and student activities. Very strong alumni base that gives back with many scholarships and seminars"
Freshman,4,"I love this school, except that my financial aid package was changed after I had already been cleared, which meant I had to pay the amount I wasnt prepared to pay."
Junior,4,"The professors are excellent and the courses are relevant. I feel safe on campus. The campus security is very nice and helpful. The campus is not too big, so you can walk everywhere."
Freshman,4,Fairleigh dickenson university is a school with a diverse campus where students have the chance to study with different students from around the
Junior,4,Beautiful and quiet campus! I love the environment and the wonderful students and professors! By far my favorite college with great academics.
Sophomore,4,The metropolitan campus is not the best looking campus that fdu has to offer but none the less the classes and teachers are above average. This school allows for students to have a personal life and to learn everything that they need for there future carears. The workload is perfect as long as a student is willing to put in about 2 hours of studying each day then they should have no issue getting  good grades.
Freshman,4,My experience as a Freshman at Fairleigh Dickinson University has been very positive.  The professors are  knowledgeable and approachable.  The campus is very nice and the students are friendly.
Niche User,4,"Fairleigh Dickinson is a great college offering students immense opportunities to help them in any field of study. Overall, the college is a great pick and nothing bad could be said about it!"
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a student at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck, NJ. FDU is an open campus however, it is in a very safe area. The academics at the university are very good. The school is a leader in global education and offers many opportunities for students to study abroad almost anywhere in the world, including their Vancouver and Wroxton campuses.  My time at FDU has been characterized by me meeting students form all over the world. FDU is pretty small with only about 600 people living on campus and a good amount of students commuting. The dorms aren't like what you see in the movies, but they're not your worst nightmare either. There is one that stands out from the other two choices. Because of its small size, students at FDU form a close knit community, especially the ones that choose to live on campus. There are not many parties at the school, but there is always something going on, or an event hosted by one of them many organizations present at the school."
Sophomore,4,"So far my experience has been interesting. It is a dry campus, which may make it more safe, but less fun for some. This school is mostly a commuter school. We only have one cafeteria that accepts meal swipes which can be a hassle, especially for those whom live in the upperclassmen dorms. "
Freshman,4,Fairleigh Dickinson as a whole is a pretty decent school. I love the sports this school offers and also the Greek Life. Some things i would like to see changed is a more diverse selection of food and more student activities. I also would like there to be a greater selection of clubs to join. 
College Senior,4,As a senior I have never experienced or seen anyone get peer pressured in doing anything they do not want to do.
College Senior,4,"Overall, the people are easy to talk to and fun to hang out with, as well as, find a club/organization that fits your personality and/or major."
College Senior,4,We are aware of where to go in case of any sexual assault. I have never heard of any sexual assaults since I have been attending this school.
College Senior,4,"The application process is not too much of a hassle. Although, financial aid office people may give off an attitude."
College Senior,4,"It can be good for academic reasons, not just for parties, and skipping class depending on what fraternity/sorority you join. Very well involved in other school activities, philanthropies, etc."
College Senior,4,They have a great program in accounting and business. It is great that the professor are experts in the field and give you real life examples.
College Senior,4,"I have definitely had my share of professors who were/are great, amazing; whereas, I've also experienced having horrible professors. Overall, my experiences with everyone of them has surely taught me about myself and how well someone can teach and also learn from those they are teaching. Additionally, the quality of many of my courses were great, but the effectiveness of a professor says so much about the course as well."
College Senior,4,Degrees from FDU are respectable
College Senior,4,"Greek life is more centered on academic organizations rather than ""party"" organizaitons"
College Senior,4,My university is affiliated with the United Nations and actively seeks to enroll students from diverse backgrounds. The classes are small. In my graduate program there was average of about 15 students per course.
College Senior,4,"Though I do not plan on joining Greek life, there are many moments where I have considered it, because of how greatly it is discussed, as well as being great friends with a soror who said her experience has helped her grow as a person. And I love that some things can really help shape a person for the better."
College Sophomore,4,"My first year I was apart of a program called FIS (Freshman Intensive Studies) and that helped me greatly I was put into more smaller classes with 10-12 students and the professors were really nice and wanted all of their students to succeed. I took English, Spanish, a communication course, psychology, and many other courses. I learned something from all of my courses."
College Sophomore,4,I feel pretty safe on campus. I've have been out at night multiple times and never felt scared about my will being. I believe students here know the seriousness about sexual assult and is something that you rarely ever hear about on campus happen.
College Sophomore,4,I lived on campus my first year at Fairleigh Dickinson and it was a great experience. I never really had much of a hard time living on campus. Which is why I'm going to be living on campus this coming year as well. You get to meet many people and the building is clean and the cleaner there are really nice and try to make our dorm buildings look the best they can.
College Sophomore,4,Sports department make out very important for the students in the university to maintain the school spirit. Like we have many events throughout the year to help give support to our school athletes and sports.
College Sophomore,4,Fairleigh Dickinson is a really great school that make you feel part of something important. It basically feels like my second home. The professors and other students there are really nice to one another. It's overall a great environment to get a good education.
College Sophomore,4,"The campus security are focused on protecting the students and staff. When it comes to the topic of sexual assault, the public safety officers do not take an accusation lightly. Personally, I feel safe walking around on campus. I have never felt scared or concerned that something could happen to me."
College Sophomore,4,"The school is focused on leading its students to a productive future. The school cares about making sure its students are focused unlearning and growing in order to be the best that they can be in their future job. When it comes to the topic of jobs/internships, there are opportunities for both. Half way through the year, we have a job fair and constantly have nighttime lectures focused on possible internships."
College Sophomore,4,"The quality of the courses and professors differs due to the fact that there are some difficult professors. I mean, there will always be that one professor who will make a course more challenging than you initially believed it was going to be. However, I have never had any real issues with the quality of the classrooms, courses, or professors."
College Sophomore,4,"I truly enjoy the campus housing. There are many dorm buildings throughout the campus.The buildings, from what I have seen and heard, are in great shape. There is an occasional leaky pipe or construction work going on but, overall, the buildings are great."
College Junior,4,At the sporting events many students show up in the school colors to show their spirit and to support the athletes.
College Junior,4,They offer a lot of organizations which give each student whether a commuter or a resident a chance to get involved
College Freshman,4,"Professors are really great and helpful. They do they're best to help you out, but sometimes you need to accept the mistakes you make."
College Freshman,4,"I feel pretty safe on campus. As long as you keep yourself safe and know the types of people you're hanging out with, you should be good!"
College Freshman,4,The Greek treat the non-Greeks as human beings.
Senior,2,"Some of my professors tried to make last semester work as best as possible, considering the circumstances, and I am grateful to them. Others, however, forced students to teach themselves using videos from YouTube. One professor sent one email every 2 weeks. I am unsure why they are still employed."
Freshman,2,"FDU is a really small school compared to other schools. It is located in the suburbs of  New York City which is appealing to many students. Personally, I think this is not a school that would involve socializing and partying. There are very few girls in the schools and very few people in general. I would recommend dorming because it's easier to make friends and interact with people. There are no bars and no night clubs around, so you would have to travel a couple miles to find a place to hangout."
College Senior,2,"I would love to commute the rest of my experience at this school, but while I await doing such, living on campus does have its perks: being able to walk to the cafe and swipe in with a meal plan is pretty cool, knowing when some campus events are occurring is nice... however, the buildings and rooms themselves are not well kept and it is too expensive!"
College Senior,2,"Personally, I never felt very safe walking across campus alone at night. I've known people who were sexually assaulted on campus. Once there was an armed robbery on the bridge or something? One time I lost my wallet and when I went to Public Safety a few days later, they said no one had turned one in. When I went again a few days later someone had turned it in and I don't think anything was missing from the wallet, so that was cool. There are security cars who will transport you back and forth but I've only ever seen people who were injured use them."
College Senior,2,"Classes are okay. Some professors care, some don't. Administration sucks, especially if you don't know what you're doing/are a first gen student."
College Senior,2,"The classes aren't too horrible, but the administration is all over the place. It's impossible to find answers or get anything done. I also feel that they should not offer my major (marine biology) because there are very few classes offered that relate to marine biology. Most of them are only available through a mandatory semester abroad in the Dominican Republic. If you are interested in marine bio, go elsewhere. If you are the first person in your family going to school, go elsewhere because you will drown in the disorganized and chaotic administration."
College Freshman,2,Not the best school to go to. If you need financial help or can't pay for college (most college students) this would be a good place to go but if you have a little bit more money to spend I'd invest it someplace else. The school is wayyy over priced for what it's giving and the people aren't the friendliest. The best thing about this school is the small class sizes and professors. They're really good but I don't think it's worth it to go here unless you're a commuter. It's way too overpriced and it doesn't offer the best education
College Freshman,2,"I live in Linden 2 and the Linden's is where most people would call the hood. The buildings are out of date but thankfully my building is renovated. Linden's 4 and 5 are not and the bathrooms are absolutely terrible. There's bugs in the room and an exterminator has had to come more than one to fish them out. It's not like it's infested, just a few here and there but still. The rooms like prison cells because of the brick on the wall. IT's not really inviting. There's a lounge area for everyone to enjoy but my lounge area is usually dirty. There is a microwave and vending machine in there though."
College Freshman,2,"This school isn't the best. It's old and worn down. The facilities need fixing. Sometimes the people are rude and there's absolutely no social life. The greeks here basically claim everything, that goes for the upperclassmen too. Everyone says to join clubs but the clubs are inactive and they rarely meet. The cafeteria is small and it's hard to find something to eat. The food sometimes is just straight up slop and the workers objectify the girl students. They also tend to yell and be rude to students from time to time. Some are nice but not many. As for the classes, they have a good size and I've had some really great professors. The university itself sucks and I know a bunch of people who are transferring. I'm transferring out in the fall. Other people may have better experiences but mine sucks so far and I can't wait to leave."
College Sophomore,2,Some professors need to retire
College Junior,2,Not much going on at night at FDU. Mostly everyone goes out to have a good time.
College Junior,2,Not the greatest when it comes to academics.
College Freshman,2,"Cafeteria isn't good. But jeepers and Dickinson Cafe are great. And using Fairleigh1 money at applebee's dominoes, and other restaurants in the area is fantastic."
College Freshman,2,Fairleigh Dickinson isn't allowing students to pledge next year.
College Freshman,2,People usually go home on weekends and the school is a dry campus so there aren't many parties.
College Freshman,2,The food in the Student Union Building is low quality and very scarce on weekends while the Dickinson Hall Cafe and Jeepers are very overpriced.
College Junior,2,"The SUB usually sucks. It's greasy, the options are limited, there are rarely options for anyone with restrictions (vegetarian/vegan, kosher, gluten free, etc) and when those options exist they are often falsely advertized - i.e. cheese in ""vegan"" food.

Jeepers and the University Cafe in Dickinson Hall is much better, the food from the grill is done with more care and the restrictive options are more available."
College Sophomore,2,"Our Fairleigh1Card only works at a certain number of places but it would be great if more places took this, and our Flexxdollars"
College Sophomore,2,"The school throws on campus parties maybe twice a year, Winterball is at the end of  the fall semester, Big event is during the spring semester. There are dorm gatherings that's really fun but they get shut down to quick."
College Freshman,2,I swear to you if I would have known that I would be going through so much stress I wouldn't have attended this school.  EVERY TIME I go to the financial aid office I owe thousands of dollars. I feel like I'm being robbed. No one ever clearly explains where all this debt is coming from.  Another reason why people want to transfer and are transferring schools. Ridiculous.
College Freshman,2,"They were confused about how much financial aid they were giving me , I ended up paying more than i was suppose to. I almost couldn't attend the university because i didn't have the funds to attend and i wasn't granted a loan."
College Freshman,2,You need to travel far to have fun..
Recent Alumnus,2,I feel I didn't get what I deserved
College Senior,2,"most college dorms are bad, unless you go to a school with apartment-like housing"
Recent Alumnus,2,We have no transport because the campus isnt as bag. Public safety does offer rides to students in the middle of the night. Usually after much complaining. 
College Freshman,2,"I just had so many problems and every time my balance gets changed to 3,985 to 1,686 and its very confusing. A lot of paper work, I thought my parents being in bankruptcy would help me get more help but it has not "
College Sophomore,2,"The school HAS a lot of odd programs, Metro campus has a greenhouse near the Kron building, there are a lot of clubs and orgs but they're not well advertised. University Players and SPECTRUM (lgb club) get most  of the posters put up advertising dates. If you want a club related to your field, talk to someone in that department and they can hook you up."
College Sophomore,2,A lot of aid available however it seems like throughout the year the financial aid office is a mess and you end of having fees and balances you weren't aware of. And most scholarships and grants are for first year students only.
College Sophomore,2,"I received a good amount, but my parent we're still struggling to pay for both my sister and my colleges bills each month."
College Junior,2,"If given the chance to enroll in FDU again. I would not. I have not had a particularly bad experience here, however I am sure there is better out there. I personally do not agree to the school's beliefs and find the differences a little much to bare."
College Junior,2,"You have to contact the school several times to get any answers from them. I am a senior with FDU, and they do not give help to those that do not go to the campus directly. They do not give you any help with loans. I am always early with doing my paperwork, but they always seem to wait until the last minute to file any aid."
College Senior,2,I always have to register late to class because financial aid always puts me on financial hold even when I have priority registration due to credits. I would suggest to apply for financial aid as early as possible and I believe it's worth it to spend hours at the office just to check if everything is in order with your account.
College Freshman,2,The campus strictness may be overbearing but overall it's for our own safety. The only problem with their strictness is the money. The school already asks for too much and the fact that we have these poilicies they take advantage of us and the cost unaware that we are struggling college students.
College Freshman,2,"The meal plan only covers the Student Union Building's (SUB) dining hall -- which is close to the residence halls (except for the lovely Northpoint) -- but that is the only convenient thing about them.

The SUB opens at 11am on weekends (too late, IMO) and 7:30 on weekdays. They close at 9:30pm most days, otherwise at 7:30. And get this -- there is usually nothing to eat by 6:30pm!

The food is overall mediocre (don't even go NEAR that thing they're calling ""sushi"") and the meal plans are all overpriced. But having one is MANDATORY if you're a resident. Tough. Pack lots of snacks. Personally, I'd invest in protein bars and nuts, because they're also good on the go.

FDU, despite having many international students, is mostly a commuter campus, so there is not much profit in bettering these services (or that's the excuse they're giving nowadays).

Their saving grace just might be Allen who works over at the grill. Great sense of humor, and never messes up my eggs. The dining hall staff is pretty friendly, actually."
College Junior,2,"The financial aid process, in truth, was more complicated than I could ever imagine. I understand that there are many students in this school that need help. One thing is being disorganized, and another is being rude. My advice is to make appointments with everyone that you need to speak to, make copies of EVERY paper that you turn in, and take down the name and number and date of whoever you speak to. That is the only thing that can make your financial aid process a breeze."
College Sophomore,2,the computers at my school are very slow sometimes.
College Junior,2,There is no wireless in the dorm rooms which is incredibly annoying because my computer always stays at my desk. They do have wireless however outside the dorm rooms in the lobbies as well as the library. The internet can be very slow at times also.
College Sophomore,2,Parking is ridiculous. Almost EVERYBODY has a car & they live in the dorms. The parking near the dorm it's impossible to find a spot. They fill up really quick. Parking here being a freshman doesn't matter. All classes have difficulty getting parking.
College Junior,2,Endowed Grant Is Great – it is difficult to coordinate multiple scholarships and grants
College Junior,2,"Rain and Snow – It's good when it is warm out and sunny. When it rains, the river floods and I hate when it snows because classes are canceled and we have to play catch-up all semester."
College Junior,2,Mostly Just Alcohol – Most people do drugs for recreational purposes in smaller numbers but mostly alcohol is involved in parties and nightlife. Not everyone partakes in this type of lifestyle and no one is persistent in trying to push someone into doing drugs.
College Sophomore,2,The Food Is Terrible – the dorms are ok anyone can live in them. But the food in the cafeteria is horrible i have to eat the same thing everyday because the rest of the food tastes disgussting or simply there is not any food available in the cafeteria when i go there. My schedule varies with my classes and it really sucks that i ahve to pay so much money to live there and i cannot eat a healthy and nice meal. The cost of living on campus is very high but i ahve no other options. I live far away so i had to take loans in order to pay all my tuition and room at the university. The social atmosphere is alright everyone just go there to get an eduacation.
College Freshman,2,"Pretty decent financial aid if you have a scholarship. Other than that, good luck paying to come here."
College Freshman,2,"Overall FDU has a very good Nursing program. As for my time here, I don't feel like I'm getting the experience I expected. This school is also very overpriced. My advice to high school seniors is to not attend this school if you're looking for a ""party"" school. On another note, the campus does not look like any of the money we pay goes into it. Nightlife sucks when you don't have a car and if you aren't 21. I have been considering transferring but the Nursing program is very good."
College Sophomore,2,"Hard Core – I am a Biology major, and at FDU all science majors can be nice, but they are pretty much cut throat.  Everyone is looking for their own rarely wanting to help their fellow classmates.  Although there were a few who did go out of their way, but very few."
College Freshman,2,There are plenty of fast-food resturants and a couple of diners. But not many are open to late at night.
College Freshman,2,is very expensive to live in the university that i am attending now.
College Freshman,2,"Atmosphere Sucks. Fairleigh dickinson is all trees and an ugly toxic river.  Students here usually just go to the target nearby for fun.  there are a lot of local businesses around here but if you don't have a car, you'd have to walk a little bit to get there."
College Sophomore,2,"Barely Anything to Do – There are like two bars around the school, but other then that the funnest thing to do besides hanging out with your friends is going to Target."
College Sophomore,2,"This campus is very strict about drinking and drug abuse. Even if you're over the age of 21, no drinking is allowed on campus. People find ways around it but, if you are caught there are consequences."
College Sophomore,2,Public Saftey Are Annoying – All the other schools I go to the public safety is not as strict. None of the school I have visited has a point system.
College Sophomore,2,"Gyms Are Alright – The basketball court is pretty old fashion, my high school gym is nicer. The weight-room is basic has what you need. The Olympic weight lifting room in back is nice. The campus activities are lame and no one guys they need to be improved."
Recent Alumnus,2,Being on a team helped me transition easier into freshman year...facilities are average..and teams do not get that much of a following..
College Freshman,2,"It's Better Off Campus – there's food here but it's expensive or not worth eating. The caf is GROSS, except for breakfast, that's good. Jeepers and Dickinson Hall have better selections (the first more than the latter) but it's expensive and if you run out of your flex dollars you're screwed. The caf has horrible hours so you'll probably end up eating mostly in jeepers"
College Freshman,2,"the cafe SUCKS they reuse old food
if you want something semi-fresh go to jeepers"
College Freshman,2,"most of the facilities suck
if you're an athlete, the lift area that you will spend the most time in has almost nothing and any of the equipment there is probably older than you are
the SUB and library are ok

THIS IS AN UGLY SCHOOL AND THERE IS LITTLE TO NO MAINTENANCE"
College Sophomore,2,Living on campus is not really how I expected it to be at FDU. There isn't really much to do on campus.
College Freshman,2,"there are a few parking lots in the school and any time of day one is guaranteed to find a spot, but the walk is a long one to almost any destination on campus."
College Freshman,2,"Good Food Is Hard to Come by – Fairleigh Dickinson is located in such a wealthy NJ suburb that all of the restaurants besides Friendly's and other fast food joints are the only student affordable restaurants. Madison is beautiful but has a lot of costly eateries and other shops. Morristown is more affordable but hard to get to unless you know someone who has a car or have a car yourself. If not that, then there's Convent Station. The round trip fare to either town is around $5 but it can add up if you continually go out. 
The Fairleigh1 card that all students have gets us discounts at whole foods and other places but not Five Guys Burgers & Fries which is a big student place to eat."
College Junior,2,"Could Be Cheaper for What It Offers. The classes are only a bit challenging. I like to be challenged. And for what we pay for it is not worth attending the school. Sometimes it feels like I am still in high school However, because the classes are small it is okay."
Senior,1,"I am a senior in electrical engineering and the only advice I have for students that are considering any engineering major is to look for alternatives. The engineering program needs rejuvenation and I seriously don't know how it keeps it accreditation. The professors teach outdated material that is not used in the field and have no motivation to teach. The students here have no ambition to learn, and basically CHEAT their way into graduation. The career services are useless and do not help you land any internships or co-op. Every big engineering firm avoids coming to job fairs because of this school's poor reputation. The job placement after graduation is very low, unless you are okay with working in a factory or low paying job. Do not be fooled with the school's financial aid and scholarship offers because you can get a cheaper and better education anywhere. This is place is basically a community college for rich kids."
Alum,1,"return of investment is garbage, if you want that dream job is about who you know and not what you know. courses have no relevance to actual corporate hands on experience. some professors in engineering dont take their jobs seriously and just read off from their powerpoint presentations. career center doesnt work due to the poor.repuation this college has. berkeley college had wise and frie dlier faculty"
Junior,1,"I'm in the nursing program. The quality control of professors is nonexistant. I have one that's great, another that's ok and three who are unfair, tell you their expectations after an assignment is due, don't cover their own material and can't answer questions directly about material from the book, don't answer emails,  and power hungry. I would describe one as abusive. Tha administration doesn't care. They won't audit the classes and don't allow you to record them. I have never been in such an unsupportive environment.  Do yourself a favor go somewhere else."
Alum,1,"Wouldn't say it was worth the money. like all universities out there, they use old facts about themselves to attract anyone to enroll. getting to fdu was easy in the late 90's, just take the sat and even with an 800 you can be accepted even with a C average. counselors are not that helpful and were more into making sure you follow your bachelor checklist, the engineering faculty is outdated and very much outside the scope of what the actual market asks. hostility and resentment are in the minds of some professors and some exams dont match the course material. dont bother appealing, the director will do his best to  deny your appeal. after graduation, chances are slim if you want to be in a good corporate environment and you might end up doing things outside what you supposedly learned. the networking events are poor since everyone's on the same boat looking for a chance up the ladder, dont recommend them. the diploma seems a bad stain of bad luck, better off at Rutgers or Montclair."
Alum,1,"There was no social life, the return of investment was maybe you could probably apply being a cashier at a convenience shop and much of the so called global education wouldn't even be useful for real world things.  academics were outdated unreal and most of the professors were reckless , uninformed and useless. i tried to transfer out but the gpa stopped me from leaving this mediocre school. luckily i had better gpa and opportunities at NYU than this excuse of a global education, all universities by now global with its diversity. it's a poor sales pitch and they should remove poor quality professors that are tenured."
Alum,1,"Went to this teaneck wasteland of a school due to my school not sending my transcripts on time to my original choices. Engineering faculty was a joke and overall unpleasant, decadent, outdated, close minded and overall cheap. I never heard of fdu before and has not helped me find a job, luckily i did go to an ivy league but fdu was not worth it. It had no social life, dead clubs that ceased in the late 90s, hostile deans, and unfair gradings."
Junior,1,"Education was like high school. The computer engineering classes were not good and it was tough to prove professors errors. They were very hostile. Sure when the ABET  comes to audit, alfredo tan makes sure everyone is treated happily but then turns back to a slum faculty of inept professors. A private university with no social scene and its dark gloomy and ghost town at night.  No good"
College Freshman,1,the is no were to party on campus but the dorm and places people make themselves
College Freshman,1,I wasn't told that I owed money to the school for a month and had to pay out of pocket after being initially told that I was financially clear and it was too late to withdraw. There were helpful people in the Office of Enrollment service who helped me set up a payment plan.
College Freshman,1,I didn't even know there was such a thing as Greek life.
College Student,1,"FDU will trick you into thinking that their school is gourmet and the best of the best. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Within the first two weeks of the semester, the food is decent and it's hard to complain. Eventually, it becomes worse and you could end up on the toilet for the next few days. The food never changes; once in a blue moon will there be something different worth trying. It's $8.75 per meal at the café. At 'Jeepers' the price varies on what you purchase and it's paid with flex dollars ($100 free each semester) Jeepers isn't any better than the main café but it's do-able. "
College Student,1,"Without a car, you're basically stranded. There is a strip mall (if that's what you'd call it) in walking distance but it doesn't have many options. Cars are super important and if you don't have one, you're basically SOL."
College Freshman,1,"I tried to find a good quality off campus apartment for so long but came up with nothing. Nothing is available at an affordable cost, and if its is affordable its way off in the middle of no where. It just wasnt worth it unless you wanted to live 5 other people"
College Freshman,1,There's not much majors you can access here. The main majors that I hear about are either nursing and pyschology. I tell people that I'm majoring in history and they always seemed surprised
College Sophomore,1,the cost of transportation is horrible. I pay six dollars a day to go to school and come back.
College Junior,1,"If you're lucky, you'll get a high lottery pick and end up in Northpointe, which is a hotel style dorm. If you get a bad pick, prepare yourself for the worst!"
College Junior,1,"The facilities are outdated, and the wifi connection is terrible; however, this is one building that is totally updated and upgraded. That is Northpointe. It is a fairly new hotel style dorm, that is, in my opinion, basically all the Metropolitan campus has to offer."
College Junior,1,"Making your own fun is what you are going to have to do to keep yourself occupied. There is almost nothing to do off campus. There is a mall in Teaneck, but you wont have too many opportunities to go there. Most people who attend are way to busy to do that. No attractions or cultural events. Quiet town with quiet people. This is a dry campus."
College Junior,1,"Sometimes, I Wouldn't Feed the Food to My Dog. There aren't many options on campus to eat. You have the cafeteria, a fast-food style place (that has restricted hours and isn't open on the weekends) and a small cafe with limited choices. The cafeteria is pretty much the only place that you can go to eat, especially considering flex dollars are limited to $100 and the places to use them are expensive. In the cafeteria, there's always the same things and always cooked below quality. There have been occasions where food is cold or overcooked, undercooked, sitting out all day, flies flying around and the plates often have left over food still caked on. There have been nights I've gone hungry because I didn't want to face the disgusting hole that is the cafeteria."
College Junior,1,There is no off campus housing provided by the school. You have to find your own house or apartment in the neighborhoods.
College Junior,1,Student Center – This building is very old and falling apart. This is also were our cafeteria is located and the food is awful. Everything is always going bad and not fresh when we go to eat.  There is also not a lot of activities to do for students in this building and it is run by very rude staff.
College Freshman,1,Financial Aid is one of the worst facilities our school has. They are very undisciplined and disorganized. They change up the number of how much you owe alot and promise many scholarships and grants that they end up taking away.
College Junior,1,YOU LEGIT HAVE TO FIGHT FOR EVERY PENNY THAT YOU EVEN RECEIVED AND MAKE SURE THAT IT STAYS THERE
College Junior,1,Theres Strictness ? 0.0 – if you get CAUGHT in the room with alcohol you get written up there is no feasible way to prove the correct innocence of a person...DONT GET CAUGHT OR DONT DRINK PERIOD
College Freshman,1,Buses to get to the school take long and are not always reliable.  Not one bus goes straight to the desired location on campus.
College Freshman,1,Not Much Availability – Teaneck does not have many options as far as off campus housing.  Apartments are scarce and houses are too expensive
College Freshman,1,"It rains here way too frequently.  The campus is literally right next to the river so we are always watching for flooding.  Especially when Irene hit, the campus flooded a lot.  The slightest bit of rain and you see minor flooding everywhere.  Bring rain boots if you come here!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"FDU is very diverse in it's population.  It seems that the university caters to foreigners, giving them ""free rides"" while the non-minority pay full price.  Much of the population at FDU is students from other countries who are getting more from the university than those of us who live in the USA, in particular-white people pay full price while everyone else seems to be getting full scholarships."
College Sophomore,1,Paterson is a sometimes dangerous area. People are getting harm more and more.But we do have some attractions like the falls. And one of our high schools was in a movies and the movies was based on that school.
College Sophomore,1,Can You Say Over Priced Taxis – If you want to pay 30 dollars for a ride that takes fifteen seconds then be my guest. If you don't have a car then you are in trouble. If your a freshman you better make some upper class-men friends.
College Junior,1,"School Spirit Needs Improvement – THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SCHOOL SPIRIT! VERY FEW STUDENTS ATTEND THE FOOTBALL GAMES, BASKETBALL GAMES, ETC."
College Junior,1,"I receive no form of financial aid from my school, even when my sister is a recent graduate."
College Sophomore,1,"FDU has a terrible parking situation.   Basically a student should not move their car if they want a spot later on.  If you do move your car, you are walking a far distance IN THE DARK to get back to a building.  Rutherford parking is the worst.  There are not even spots for half the student living in that building.  Also, the park ave parking lot is not very convenient either.  It is good for the students living in park ave but for the people living in the village, it is a far walk.  Another problem is that the lots are dark.  Yes there are some lights but not enough when its completely dark out and you are walking by yourself.  Permits do not cost anything which is really convenient and as long as you are not a freshman (unless needed) you can get a pass."
College Freshman,1,The nightlife here is what you made it you won't see signs for party this school is built of representation. So the only time you can find parties is through the online scene. Fairleigh does offer an occasional party but nobody really comes it pretty dead at times.
College Junior,1,No Help – The administration staff at this school offers little help and act as if you're bothering them. Financial aid office is also very slow and unhelpful
College Sophomore,1,Its been alot of snow storms lately and the sidewalks and parking lots have been shoveled poorly. Theres ice on all the walking areas even the bridge. For those people who are accident prone they are very at risk.
College Sophomore,1,Public Safety is very srtict to the point where noone is not required to be outside after a certain time if they hear any noise. Any type of noise you are written up for a noise violation and given a $50 fine. If caught drinking all of your liquor is taken and drinked by the public safety officers because I doubt they throw away full bottles. As far as the parties or any on campus event no one who is not a student here is not allowd to come.
College Freshman,1,"The girls on campus are catty, trashy, flashy, and promiscuous. And they tend to recycle themselves. Its enough of them to cast a shadow in a doorway. If youre looking for a wholesome girl, CHOOSE CAREFULLY. Guys are a bit standoffish and its hard to get them away from the flock. Most of the nice guys are commuters."
College Sophomore,1,"There isn't really that much housing off campus, but the one's that I know of are really expensive."
College Freshman,1,"A Painfully Uncertain Process – Before coming to Fairleigh Dickinson in the fall, I was told that the financial aid i was awarded would guarantee e that me a free ride. halfway through the first semester i was sent a letter telling me that I owed the college a semester of tuition.I went to the financial aid office and cleared everything up. I had a free ride for the semester. a few weeks from the end of the fall term I was told that i  needed to pay for tuition I found this odd and went to the financial aid office again, I was told that my application needed to be re-reviewed so I filled out all the forms again. After making my schedule for next semester i was informed that I was on hold due to a balance of roughly 8,000 that i owed to the school."

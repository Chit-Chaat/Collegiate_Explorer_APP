Senior,5,Catawba is a great college to attend. It is a very friendly community with a lot of activities for students to enjoy.
Junior,5,I’m enrolling in an online bachelors degree program and so far it has went smooth and everyone has been so quick to assist me as a returning adult student.
Junior,5,The staff are very interested in my success and have been most helpful with every step by answering questions quickly and providing information I need.
Sophomore,5,"Catawba College has a beautiful campus that makes the students feel like it is home. The people there are very friendly and outgoing, and the teachers really care about their students. While at this school I formed close bonds with professors and students that I will cherish forever. There are a variety of clubs to be actively involved in and on campus activities. I would strongly recommend this school to others."
Niche User,5,"My experience at Catawba College was my best experience out of all the other schools I have been to. Better than all the D1, D2, D3, and NAIA  schools. The campus was beautiful and well kept. Everybody welcomed me in as I walked into the admissions office, even the swim coach came to welcome me in and it wasn't even an unofficial or official visit. Everyone around the campus would wave or say hello no matter what they were doing. And the whole college overall just had a great vibe to it and made me feel like I was at home. I can't wait for this upcoming semester to get the next chapter of my life the right way, as an Indian!"
Niche User,5,All the times that I have toured and visited Catawba College have been excellent and so welcoming. It's an unexplainable feeling that I get when I am on campus. The professors and students have made an overall amazing and most welcoming experience for upcoming students like myself.
Niche User,5,"Just from visiting the campus, I felt like I belonged! The students, staff, and community were all very informative and welcoming."
Junior,5,Great school that places a priority on the education of its students and allows the students to grow both academically and socially.
Freshman,5,Everyone is very helpful and friendly. When you go on campus you feel like family. I am playing football and they have a great program for that. I am excited to get there and get started. The freshman retreat was great and I will now know some people when I arrive.
Sophomore,5,Catawba has given a start to a great education. I love my professors and the campus is just the right size for me. My freshman year was made easy due to all the things they have setup for freshman.
Freshman,5,Small college with big personality! Staff and faculty are passionately helpful and resourceful. Very diverse and involved community.
Freshman,5,I’m an incoming freshman at Catawba College and from the start of our journey to Catawba the entire community has been so open and welcoming.
Freshman,5,They are very personable. They concentrate on you to succeed in college. They seem to respect every as an individual and try to help.
Sophomore,5,Catawba college welcome me with open arms of love.I am so happy I chose Catawba where I am able to study without distraction.  All the students are friendly and we help each other. Administration  are very caring and helpful.
Freshman,5,I love that’s it a very small school which allows you to be more connected with teachers and students. Students help each other just like teachers would !
Freshman,5,Every staff member I have encountered thus far have been extremely friendly and ready to help with student needs. The campus is beautiful and the students are welcoming.
Freshman,5,The campus is small and compact.  They are extremely friendly and willing to help.  They went out of their way to make you feel like part of the family.  The professors are willing to assist when needed.
Alum,5,"I am an alum of Catawba College and I can say I would not be as successful or as educated had I not gone to Catawba. What they say in their mission statement is true 'an education rich in personal attention'. At Catawba you get personal attention from your professors who care deeply about your success. You get to know your professors personally which I think is something beautiful that you do not get at every institution. Ultimately, I believe the college experience is what you make it at any place you attend, but Catawba grants students’ opportunities to become better in all sense of the word spiritually, academically, physically, and emotionally."
Freshman,5,"I have always loved the soccer program. I received a soccer scholarship from here and I love the whole sports program. I also like the scholarship program, they give scholarships to every student that comes here. I am pleased with my offer."
Alum,5,"As a first gen, catawba really helped me thrive. The relationships that were built while I was there have been steadfast. People complain that there's nothing to do b/c they always stay in their dorms. Get out, meet people, have fun, work hard, and you'll come to realize these 4 brick walls titled ""Catawba"" can change your life like nothing else can. Fair Catawba!"
Freshman,5,"Catawba College is where my 2nd home is. I am here 5 days a week. I do not stay on campus but I do commute. Catawba College is quite small but a great school, a lot of diversity and overall nice people. This college is a very good fit for me. I have met some friends and talk to them often. They have many student activities which I like because it makes me feel involved even though I commute back and forth from home to school."
Junior,5,I am in the student evening school and it is wonderful. The schedule works with that of my work schedule and the professors are accommodating.  The program is amazing the courses are fast paced and because of that I will be graduating sooner than expected.
Freshman,5,This has been a great experience.  Meet lots of students who have now become my friends.  The professors are extremely intelligent and offer lots of help since your class size is smaller than major colleges.  Would love to see the dorms be renivated.
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere. I was very pleased with my roommate except he always has dirty close in the room. The food is good . my professors have all been good and very helpful. I would love to have a bigger dorm. The athletic department is were I spend a lot of my time. Thanks to the sports med group that helped me with my rehabilitation after I had knee surgery. They put in a lot of time getting me ready to get back on the field.
Senior,5,Catawba is amazing! Personally I believe the teacher ed department is amazing. The teachers develop a bond with their students and always make time to discuss anything and everything rather it is school or home related. This place has become my home away from home.
Freshman,5,"Great Environmental Department, the Center for the Environmental Department is beautiful and the theater department puts on amazing shows."
Sophomore,5,"Catawba is a small campus, but still they offer so much to the students. The school as a whole is like a family. Everyone is very accepting of others and that makes it a great environment for anyone who attends the college. Classes are small which makes it easy to learn. Professors are always willing to take the time to make sure you really understand and to help you if needed."
Junior,5,"As a first generation college student, I had no idea what I was about to get myself into when I decided to come to Catawba College, but I quickly found out that it would be a very enjoyable experience. I have had a great time in all of my classes and each professor has been wonderful with both their teaching and care for each student. There are plenty of clubs and organizations to get involved in. I decided to join the Student Government Association and was recently elected as student body President, as well as one of the men's organizations on campus that focuses on service to the college and community. There are dozens of other great clubs to be a part of and all welcome new students."
Alum,5,"I attended Catawba from 1982-1986. I believe I received a quality education. I had a great experience with faculty, staff and students. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The cost was very reasonable. Of course the cost has gone up throughout the years as to be expected. There is so much to be said for a small private school. You receive so much one on one support if needed. I highly recommend this school. One of my former church members attended recently and had so many praises for Catawba. I believe everyone who chooses to attend will be pleased with the education, atmosphere and people."
Freshman,5,"What I love about Catawba is the community. Before going there, I never had a support system, but with all the students, professors and staff, I never have that problem."
Sophomore,5,"I love Catawba. It is a small, private, liberal arts college. It has small class sizes and they are personal. The campus has a home- Like feeling and truly you get to know everyone really quickly. However, this can sometimes be a downside as there aren't tons of people to meet. And the caf food isn't that great at all."
Junior,5,I love how the professors make it their priority to know every student they have. They want every student to be the best they can be without any other side bar thoughts.
Alum,5,"Catawba College is a great small college that fit me. If you like small intimate classes with professors who are dedicated and care about their students academic success, then this is the school for you. I had a great  experience at Catawba and I recommend it to anyone interested in a small private school. You become like family with students and faculty. The professors are very nice and always willing to help you gain understanding and knowledge in whatever subject you are taking.  Blacks were the minority, but it did not matter, because race was not an issue with students or faculty. We all got along and helped each other in times of need. When schools are small you appreciate the closeness and individual attention from the professors. I highly recommend this great school."
College Freshman,5,"My overall experience at Catawba College has been truly awesome and inspiring. Not only have I met the smartest and most driven people in the world I also am receiving a wonderful education with Professors who love what they're doing, and it shows."
College Sophomore,5,"My college experience has been great so far. I was worried that going to a small liberal arts school where I didn't know anyone was going to negatively affect my freshman year, but it  made so much better. I got rediscover myself without any baggage from the past. All the friends I made had similar goals to mine and the professors aspired for us to reach our goals. College so far has truly been a life changing experience."
College Freshman,5,"Salisbury is a great place to eat out, which means you spend a lot of money out because the cafe is so poorly prepared."
College Freshman,5,they helped me out in every way possible. they are the reason why i am here.

College Freshman,5,"I love the campus. There is always something going on from student led music shows and performances, to events led by our student entertainment group (WIGWAM), to sports events. "
College Freshman,5,"Academic support here at Catawba is free. They have support groups for most of the classes such as spanish and math, as well as personal tutors which you can request free of charge. There is also the writing center which can help with papers in any subject from brainstorming to the final product. "
College Sophomore,5,"North Carolina weather is amazing! It's not too hot, not too cold."
College Junior,5,Theres plenty of retaurants available in the area.
Junior,4,"Safe environment, pretty architecture, culture not 2 liberal or conservative.Small & welcoming.Professors always willing 2 help.Good food.Good variety of clubs & events.Only NC college offering the major I want & the curriculum 4 my minor seems promising.Close 2 downtown with theatres, art galleries, museums, thrift stores & parks.Not 2 far from Charlotte & has a train station close.Still, I'm glad I transferred from a CC because it would get boring if I was here 4 years & it's really expensive. If I wasn’t a trust fund kid, Idk if it’d be worth it. But I like how transparent they were about their requirements, that they had a counselor who made the process go smoothly & that they accepted all of my credits (transfers with associate degrees from NC CC's automatically fulfill gen ed requirements).Housing 4 transfers. Ranked high by esteemed publications & more selective with their acceptance rate than most NC colleges which makes them more impressive 2 potential employers."
Junior,4,"Took some classes online which were good. Easy to navigate. Knowledgeable, passionate professor.  Mix of live zoom meetings, independent work, readings, activities, pre recorded lectures and more."
Junior,4,My online learning experience has been very nice. My professors have been very great about communicating with me about assignments and new updates through emails and video conferences and have made accessible many resources I can use to help me understand how to use the academic programs that have been made available to me.
Junior,4,"I like Catawba College because I know that my wellbeing and education are always put first. My professors always make time to help me and challenge me to be my best academic self, while also encouraging me to help others and make a positive change in my community. My friends and classmates are reliable and I know I can always count on them when I have a question or need guidance. I also love the beautiful scenery and naturally aesthetic atmosphere that Catawba has to offer, allowing me to feel relaxed and right at home."
Senior,4,Catawba is normally a very face to face based community. Most teachers use blackboard for the classwork and submissions. Have strictly online classes is a different story; not all teachers like that style of learning.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the diversity of Catawba College, and the usual cleanliness of the dorms.  Some of the classes, however, could be more goal-oriented."
Alum,4,"Wish it was less expensive. Loved majoring in music here. Some professors were amazing, others harder to learn from. Loved having a small community."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the fact that the school is small. My old high school actually had more members than Catawba does, but I love that because it gives everyone a chance to meet each other. Especially Freshmen meeting other Freshmen. If I could change anything, I would possibly add a Greek Row. It would add so much more to the diversity and campus life with fraternities and sororities."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Catawba College has been tremendously great. The people and teachers are superior here and are willing to help you through academic struggles or even personal struggles; because they really care about their students. Another positive of this college is that the campus is a reasonable size and you will not get lost. On the other hand there are some little things that this college needs to work on, such as having a better wi-fi that will work for everybody and it will not kick you off of the wi-fi. Another thing that could be improved is the food they serve in the cafe, they could use more variety and add flavor to their food. Their are positives and negatives to any college you attend too, although the overview of Catawba College I would strongly recommend enrolling in this four-year college because of their excellent assistance, beautiful small campus, and all of the academic opportunities."
Senior,4,"If you want a small schools and catawba offers your major, it is the perfect place for you. All individuals whether the faculty, the staff, or the students want you to succeed. Catawba is a home where one learns, challenge themselves and expands their world in and outside of the classroom."
Freshman,4,"I loved the landscape of Catawba College: the cathedral, the library, and the Environmental Building. All of the staff and students were very welcoming. There is a plethora of activities and courses to explore on a regular basis."
Freshman,4,"This is my first year attending Catawba, I can honestly say so far my experience has been great! Although I do wish professors should communicate with their students more, I understand it is our responsibility to go to the professors for any questions. There is a great amount of diversity, I already have a couple friends from parts of around the world, from Mexico, India, to Brazil and etc. I do not stay on campus, but I do have have who stay in dorms. Dorms are pretty big, and look comfy. Because Catawba is a private school, it is quite expensive, but by applying quick, they do give many scholarships!"
Freshman,4,"So far I am enjoying the school! The professors are involved and the campus is beautiful. The party scene is a little slow and the caf isn't the best food, but overall a nice school with nice people."
College Sophomore,4,Security constantly patrols t he campus
College Sophomore,4,The school has many job contacts from alumni
College Freshman,4,Public safety is less than a phone call away and you can always count on them to be around campus or close by when you need help.
College Freshman,4,"We have a wide variety of sports that you can sign up for, and there's never a dull moment when attending the games and/or meets."
College Freshman,4,"It's a nice small school, however it can be difficult at first to try to get started with communicating about registration."
College Sophomore,4,Professors really care about how you are doing.   And they can give great refernces.  Some of the buildings could use repairs.
College Freshman,4,The athletics program at Catawba is great! Students and Professors all go support each other and the teams.
College Freshman,4,A lot of the faculty have connections that allow for clear paths to jobs or internships.
College Freshman,4,The professors are incredibly knowledgeable and really care about their students in and out of the classroom.
College Freshman,4,"The overall experience has been great. There have been a few issues, but hopefully they will get taken care of sooner rather than later."
College Freshman,4,The freshman RAs could do a better job at keeping Woodson put together.
College Junior,4,"I love where I go to school.  The classes are small, the professors are attentive, communication is great here, faculty know you by name even if you've met them once, the campus is small enough to get to know everyone (and make it to class on time), and the school is really generous with financial aid and providing students opportunities to get the most out of their educations."
College Freshman,4,The college does not affiliate with any off-campus housing and it is relatively difficult to live off campus unless you are over 21. There are many apartments in the area that are relatively affordable and work with students if you can get the premission to live off campus.
College Freshman,4,Catawba has a very nice balance of how strict it is compared to where the students get liberties.
College Freshman,4,the options to live off campus is great. There are many places to choose.
College Freshman,4,the food off campus is great. you have options of many things.
College Freshman,4,the food is good. they let you choose the menu for the week.
College Sophomore,4,Living on campus is great! Stanback was just renovated and it is very nice. I wish I would have lived in Woodson my freshman year because I would have gotten more of the college experience. SR was very quiet and sometimes I would be the only person who stayed on my hall for the weekend. I like living in Stanback and I enjoy the majority of the people who live here too.
College Sophomore,4,"I changed from being a BFA Musical Theatre Major to Integrated Marketing Communications. I am just getting started and warmed up to the way this new major operates. I like it a lot so far though. I think it will provide me with the knowledge I need to get one of the best jobs and most competitive jobs in our society. It also goes hand in hand with my first love, theatre. At the end of the day the major is helping me become a well rounded human being and it is helping me exercise all of the talents and gifts that I have been so graciously given."
College Sophomore,4,Everyone seems nice and friendly. Some are stuck up but I haven't met many like that. 
College Sophomore,4,"It's my hometown, so I love it. Plenty of restaurants and cute stores. "
College Sophomore,4,"Student life is okay, but I think they should have more activities for students living off campus. "
College Sophomore,4,I feel relatively safe on campus and the health center is great. 
College Sophomore,4,The Chaplain of the college rents out places. 
College Sophomore,4,A lot of people have school spirit.

College Freshman,4,"Even though drinking does happen on campus, it's not all that noticeable. "
College Freshman,4,Everyone here is really friendly and really open to meeting new people. 
College Freshman,4,They know that paying for college is tough so they are willing to work something out with you as long as you talk to them.
College Freshman,4,"Even though it might take a few  minutes to connect to the network, there are multiple computer labs to use and you are even able to check a laptop out from the library. Tech support is always willing to help with any problems you could encounter.  "
College Freshman,4,"They treat us like adults and they realize that we are in charge of making our own choices, but they do get concerned if your grades begin dropping because they are interested in our future."
College Junior,4,"Catawba College just started charging students living on campus a parking fee. It is minimal though. Since our campus is small, any parking space will provide you with access to anything on campus. It is not necessary to have a car while living on campus. There are many shops and restaurants that are in walking distance. Plus someone with a car is always willing to take you along when they are out running errands."
College Junior,4,"One of the things that has impressed me about Catawba College is campus events and activities. The ""Wigwam"" organization is responsible for hosting numerous events throughout the year, such as Catawba Palooza in the spring. These guys go all out to make these events a major part of student life. At the Palooza, events are held outdoors and there are carnival type rides, food, music, and stations like a dress up photo booth and tons of prizes. Theater and music are also a big part of student life on our campus. In fact Catawba is known for it's Theater Arts department and the productions are amazing. Plus students, whether they are majoring in music or not, can perform for their peers once a month in the student union."
College Sophomore,4,On campus there are many parties and activities supplied by the school. Plus Charlotte is only a 30 minute drive away.
College Sophomore,4,People at Catawba college don't really use too many drugs. There are always those people that do but they are very few. Alcohol is the main thing.
College Junior,4,I haven't felt unsafe here. Its a small school with not very much traffic by strangers.
College Senior,4,"There are people from every race, religion, and sex. Everyone is free to be themselves."
College Junior,4,"When it is pouring down rain it is difficult to move around campus, however is not something that hindered you to bad."
College Junior,4,"The fees are not huge, and the security assures that those who are not welcome are not staying very long. Parking is cheap and something that is really easy to find as well."
College Sophomore,4,"The restaurants near campus arrange for anyone's expense.  It can range from average to above average, which is very convenient."
College Sophomore,4,"The school recently upgraded the majority of the computers on campus to Windows 7 Professional (they were all Windows XP *blahh*) so now the computers are MUCH MORE faster.

Every student gets 450 free pages a semester to print, and we have two 24hr computer labs, along with a few other labs in certain other buildings on campus. We do have a color printer, and you can use the copier to make copies for about 10cent a page."
Sophomore,2,"advising is terrible, instructors are not knowledgeable in their subject,  very little disability services. The whole idea of a private college is smaller class size for more one on one time with instructors but the instructors don't provide it."
Freshman,2,There are no handicap accessible  dorms or facilities.  Some professors are not willing to give extra help if asked.  It seems that there is more emphasis put on athletics than academics.  The campus is small  and there is not much to do. T The city that it is located in offers nothing to either.  The cost is too high for the little that is offered.
College Freshman,2,SR was nice until the mold. Woodson is...not good.
College Freshman,2,"After making 8 on the list of 10 worst dining halls in America, there wasn't much hope. They have tried to change, but the food is not quite up to par. I understand how difficult it is to cook for a large number of people, but there is no variety and the food is sometimes overcooked or raw. McCorkles is a good break from Cafe food, but we only have so much money on their until we have to either upload additional funds to an already expensive meal plan or eat only in the cafe."
College Sophomore,2,Our athletics are okay. I came from a high school with a lot of school spirit and involvement but that isn't as adamant here. I don't spend a lot of time participating in athletics so it really does not influence me all that much. There are times when I have a disrespect for certain athletes just because I feel like they don't care about or respect our education. They just want to play football and drink on the weekends.
College Sophomore,2,Overall our off-campus dining is average. I wish we had more options considering our cafe is so bad. It gets repetitive when we are constantly going off campus to eat.
Recent Alumnus,2,Not much selection.  Charlotte is the closest place for a true club/bar atmosphere and that is 45 minutes away.
College Sophomore,2,"Kind of a small town, not too terribly much to do unless you are up for a drive.  However there are plenty of parks and people are generally fairly nice to students.  Most of the nearby business give discounts or accept student ID cards."
College Junior,2,"Not Bad but Not the Best Housing Around – The dorms are better than some other schools in NC notably because of free cable and air conditioning. Freshman rooms are rather spacious compared to other colleges.  As you progress you can have the option to live in some poorly built apartments that the college recently erected.  Overall the dorms are not too bad, however the maintenance is awful and quite often you will find halls that go uncleaned for days at a time. The dorms do not provide a good social atmosphere either, there is a lack of common rooms and RA's are generally a bunch of kiss asses that are just looking out for their own job security.  The VAST majority of students just go home over the weekends because there is nothing to do on campus. The cost of living on campus is very expensive as well (~$8300 a year) and totally not worth it. If you break it down you are paying $830 a month in rent.  It is highly recommended that students move off campus."
College Junior,2,"Watch What You Eat – Dining hall experience is very up and down. Some days meals are great, others its terrible. However there is a restaurant on campus that is open during the week. Food there is good but you have to pay cash. It has its ups and downs but I'm sure most colleges are like that."
College Sophomore,2,"It All Weighs Out in the End. Catawba is located in a very small area so the availability of bars/clubs is almost nonexistant. On the upside, during the week Catawba offers alot less distractions from schoolwork. Salisbury also neighbors Charlotte, and Greensboro, which are notorious for nightlife."
College Freshman,2,"This Ain't ""Animal House&quot – As a small private school, its hard to call what we have here ""Greek life."" There are a few club-type things with greek names you can get initiated into. But a lot of the Greek societies are honors groups, or major/ interest- related groups. No real frats or sororities to speak of."
College Senior,2,"Being that the school is predominantly white, you see a lot of couples together. There's an ok amount of good looking guys that attend; both white and black. However, come the weekend time, there's nothing to do..and it's easy to get bored quickly; unless you know some people."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Average, at best – I think that the campus dining service needs to take way more pride in their preparation of food in the dining hall.  I think most of the time it's a lazy selection, and it doesn't seem carefully prepared.  It's average, at best."
College Freshman,2,"Very Random – One day it will be nice and warm, the next day or two it would be rainy, and then it will get cold."
College Senior,2,"Alcohol Is the Drug of Choice – Due to the large number of student athletes on campus, drugs are hard to come by and I can usually find pretty much anything. Also, having such a small student body makes it harder, too. Most people just have pot or painkillers. I can't even find Adderall on this campus."
College Senior,2,"Half - and - Half – Most of the dorms are terrible, but there are 5 new dorms (3 apt style and 2 suite-style) that are really nice.  The student center main level has recently been renovated.  The library has recently been renovated and is really nice, but the hours are not student friendly. Football field doubles as lacrosse field in the spring and was built in 2004 (home side is nice) -- high school stadium feel. The gym is huge, but sitting/lighting/sound is not much better than high school.  One HUGE auditorium that back stage connects into a smaller theatre -- super cool. Classrooms are average. The campus is eye pleasing esp in fall and spring."
College Junior,2,"There is only one African American Accounting major at Catawba. As far as I can gather, most of the African American population here came here only for sports and end up majoring in sports management or recreation. Most of these students end up staying extra semesters also. I find myself as one of the very few hispanic students here and I believe I was academically recruited for this reason. Diversity needs improvement... NOW."
College Senior,2,The only way to get around Salisbury is virtually through the use of your own car unless you call a taxi.
College Senior,2,"Most of the student body at Catawba College consists of varsity student athletes; however, because we are such a small school, it is difficult to get excited about our programs.  Our sporting events are lackluster and not very well-attended.  Additionally, there is little to no support for the creation of club teams and intramurals."
Alum,1,"This school is cleverly disguised. At first you dont see it, but after you've been there for about a month you'll see that its actually just another football/drinking campus. The academics are a joke. The professors don't care. They rely on test scores to get you by and thats not an education: thats a scam. They care very much about sports teams and not enough about academics."
College Sophomore,1,"I'm going to say that the Administration sucks. We had a meth lab on campus, a female employee cheated on her husband with multiple student athletes, and they fired the cheerleading coach without any reason. They honesty are just looking out for themselves and not the students."
College Sophomore,1,"First off, the Business Office and Financial aid department are HORRIBLE!!!! You can not view your student account and will charge you whatever they want. All this school wants is your money."
College Sophomore,1,The food is horrible. The caf staff is rude and not friendly at all. There is only two places to eat on campus and its not good.
College Sophomore,1,"Rooms are ok. RA's don't really do anything. The Student Affairs suck!!!!! They aren't friendly and only look out for themselves, not the students."
Recent Alumnus,1,Special application needed to live off campus. Makes it difficult to get a house off campus.
College Freshman,1,"There are very few public transport options near Catawba. Taxis are available if you call, but there is no regular transport options."
College Junior,1,Getting into my program sucks which is Therapeutic Recreation. They only offer the major classes every other semester. Its no help if you transfer in and you miss the first course you have to stay an extra semester just so you can get that course completed.
College Senior,1,I do not receive any Aid at Catawba I have to get buried in loans to get a Degree.
College Freshman,1,The connection takes 5 minutes just to connect to the internet.
College Freshman,1,"Let's Talk About the Food – The quality of the food is not very high. It has a great variety, but it's more quantity than quality. I have actually had the experience of not knowing what meat I was eating... I thought it was chicken, the sign said turkey, but it looked like pork. Luckily there are two small alternative dining areas available to students."
College Junior,1,"Boring Area – Catawba is located in a residential area of Salisbury away from the downtown area.  There are no shops, bars, or restaurants that are close to campus.  The nearest places to go are the grocery store and gas station which are about a half mile walk.  Dont expect to get around well without a car, there is no bus stop on Catawba's campus and other than buses there is no public transportation.  The closest major attractions are located about 45 minutes away in Charlotte."
College Junior,1,"As an athlete at Catawba I have not had a great experience.  I currently am on the cross country team and our team cannot afford to supply us with shoes.  My high school team received more gear than this college. Some sports receive more than others however.  Fan support and school spirit is awful. During our last home football game the school we played had more people in attendance in the visitors stands than we did in our home stands.  Athletic facilities are sub par as well and comparable to a small high school.  Intramural sports are an absolute waste of time as athletes often play these sports anyway.  Because Catawba is such a small school that competes at the division II level, the majority of our student body are athletes.  If you do not play a sport and you are a student at Catawba you are certainly in the minority."
College Junior,1,"The academics at Catawba College are simply a joke, there are a few notable fields such as Theater, Chemistry, Biology, and Environmental Science. However, besides these fields the college simply fails to deliver a satisfying education.  This is not surprising as many professors are paid about the same (some less) than high school teachers.  Also notable is the fact that Catawba College practically accepts any student that is willing to pay the steep (33,000) tuition and often classes are filled with students who should not be in college in the first place.  A lot of material is watered down and many professors teach slowly as if all students were idiots (which most are)."
College Senior,1,"We have just over 1300 students, most of which drive cars, and about 800-900 parking spots on campus. It's absolutely ridiculous."
College Freshman,1,"the sports at catawba are usually of relatively high quality.  our teams are of the of the best in the conference.  however, one HUGE piece of athletics that is missing from catawba is the school spirit and athletic support form the student body.  i went to a small high school but our student section at football games was close to 5 times larger."
College Senior,1,"Hope You Like Barbecue – Within walking distance there are two barbecue joints. There's an express Japanese place that's alright. There are chain places like Domino's nearby. There's a new joint called Zaki's but I haven't been there yet since it just opened last week. Looks interesting though. You're going to need a car in order to get anywhere in this town, so if you don't have one make friends with someone that does. On the upside, the prices here aren't going to break the bank."
College Senior,1,"Public Safety Might as Well Not Exist – They don't make rounds.
They don't want to help students.
They are total jackasses.
They sleep and NEVER answer their phone."
College Senior,1,"UNFAIR, POLITICAL, UNJUST – Depends on who you know and who you are on what punishment they dish out.  The same offense will likely have two different punishments for two different people.  It blows and as SGA President, I have tried to change it, but the administration just sweeps it under the rug."
College Junior,1,"Live Off Campus If You Can! THE CAFE SUCKS. The leftovers from lunch end up in something at dinner. The chef's are forced to mass produce rather than actually show some creativity and talent. If you're lucky, there will be one appetizing protein and one okay carb. Other than that, its PB&J or the salad bar which often times has items that are past their date. Sorry.. I just can't eat pizza EVERY night (even though this is supposed to be college)."

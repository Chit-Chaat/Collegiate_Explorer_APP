Freshman,5,"I like that everyone knows each other and is super friendly, but sometimes it feels too small because everyone knows each other."
Sophomore,5,"I love my school. I'm constantly surprised by the beautiful campus, the dedication of my professors, the professional opportunities, and the caring and passionate community. Go mules!"
Sophomore,5,"First of all, I have no idea why this college is being described as a “Christian college.” Not true! Like many colleges that have been around for over 100 years, it did start with Christian (Lutheran in this case) roots, but that has certainly not been the case for decades! At this time, the students are 1/3 Catholic, 1/3 Jewish, and 1/3 other. No religion courses are required at all. 

It’s a fantastic school for anyone interested in 1) Pre-Med/sciences. 2) Business/Accounting/ Finance/Econ. 3) Theatre"
Freshman,5,"Muhlenberg is a place where students and faculty truly care about your success and well-being. The school is full of kind and passionate people with a variety of interests. The food is absolutely stellar and easily the best I've had at a college. Academically, it is a very collaborative environment where students do not compete but instead encourage each other. The student body is active and there is a very unique sense of community here. Financial and merit aid is usually very generous, especially if you show Admissions how much you genuinely want to be there. The only downside is that the party scene is lacking and the surrounding area does not have a ton to do. There is a downtown about ten minutes away with restaurants, cafes, etc and a coffeehouse behind campus. Most of the social life here is based around the arts/performances. There is a large LGBTQ+ community which creates a very accepting environment that allows me to comfortably express myself as a gay student. Love it!"
Sophomore,5,"I love my life at Muhlenberg. One thing that I love about Muhlenberg is that everyone will open a door for you. Seems kind of silly right? But rain or shine students, faculty, administrators,  will always keep doors open for you. I am from New Jersey so I’m not used to politeness like this. I was always a person to keep open doors for people but getting it in return was not common at all in jersey. I have never seen anything like it, no other college was as welcoming, restaurants, stores the politeness and mindfulness beans from the campus. It’s the most wonderful feeling to me."
Niche User,5,There atmosphere is great and everyone is friendly and amicable. The dorms however are a little outdated and not as clean as you would hope.
Sophomore,5,"Muhlenberg was the perfect school for me. I get the conservatory feel within the Arts program, as well as professors and mentors that will go above a beyond to get me to learn and grow to the best of my abilities. I wouldn't change a thing, but simply hope that more artists get the opportunity to study at this school with such kind and warm people."
Niche User,5,I only visited this college once and automatically fell in love. For one I was welcomed and continued to feel welcome throughout the whole tour. The class sizes were small which is a good thing for me being that I ask lots of questions. The dorms were perfect sizes and multiple residents were nice enough and felt comfortable enough to volunteer their dorm for us to see. And I don't even want to get started on the food!!! It was to die for and I highly admired the cleanliness. The last thing that I want to talk about is the administration team. They were so involved with tour and were the nicest set of people.
Alum,5,"What I appreciated the most about Muhlenberg, beyond the sense of community and delicious dining hall food, was the ability to grow regardless of what I chose to do. There were a tremendous number of opportunities that I took advantage of, from being a double major to being an RA to working as a peer tutor while also stage managing. It let me explore new areas in academia and make professional connections that I have sustained since graduating. There are, of course, things that could always be changed, specifically relating to the bureaucracy of the school and how its investments are managed, but my experience was overwhelmingly positive."
Sophomore,5,"Muhlenberg was my first choice and I am so happy with the decision I made! There is always something fun and exciting to do on campus! There are so many clubs and activities to get involved in. And it's fun to watch the sports games and cheer for your fellow mules. Majority of the people I've met are friendly, kind, and passionate about what they are studying. I'm personally studying theatre, psychology, and music. All of these departments have great faculty and solid reputations. And I loved my classes! I always feel safe on campus, no matter what time it is. The food is really great, and if you have allergies, the chefs are awesome at accommodating. And the campus itself is just beautiful! The dorms are nice; I lived in Brown my freshman year and loved it. My first year was one of the best years of my life, and I can't wait for what the next years will bring! GO MULES!!!"
Freshman,5,Muhlenberg is a great school with a lovely sense of community and helps to foster close personal relationships of all kinds.
Sophomore,5,"It is a great school, everything is top notch.
The buildings the students and teachers are all great. Come for a visit you'll love it, I've loved my time here. Everyone is supportive and tries to build each other up. Go mules!"
Freshman,5,"This is only my first year at Muhlenberg College. I am double majoring in biology and French. The professors here are amazing and they want you to succeed and be the best version of yourself. Some of the help offered at Muhlenberg are Professors' office hours, Workshops where LAs help you with further and extra help, and tutors. I decided to major in Biology because I am very interested in medicine and one day I want to be a doctor. The French and foreign courses here are also amazing. My level 2 French class is literally speaking in French and it is only level 2. They make sure you understand what they are teaching you and it is always great to learn and have a new language that would benefit you later on. I am a commuter so I don't dorm but the dorms are always taken care of and well-organized."
Niche User,5,"I visited several times and attending in the fall of 2019, it's absolutely amazing. Beautiful, and a wonderful enviroment."
Alum,5,Great place for college. Small classes. Caring professors. Many ways to get involved in the community. Something for everyone. Suburban campus. Not too far from Philadelphia and NYC. Lifetime friends and memories.
Alum,5,"Had a fantastic four years here. The science programs are really strong. Out of my friends who graduated with science degrees, one went to UPenn for med school, one went to UPenn for veterinary med, one went to Uconn for dental and I went to UPenn for dental. They work really hard to help you get into the post-grad program of your choice. 

I ran xc & track and field while at Muhlenberg and had a great experience.

The food is great for cafeteria food."
Sophomore,5,"Muhlenberg carries an atmosphere of acceptance and togetherness. It’s very hard to come here and not find a place where you belong. Our academics are challenging with a faculty that pushes students for greatness. While it’s no walk in the park, you can be certain you’re receiving the best education possible. Oh, and let’s talk about the food! 5 Star food and staff."
Freshman,5,I'm an international student and it's amazing that I decided to choose this one for all the support that I got from here has enhanced my studying abroad experience.
Sophomore,5,I transferred from another school to attend Muhlenberg College. I have been here for about two months now and I am happier here than I ever was at my old school.
Freshman,5,"Everyone is very nice and supportive, the professors are very interested in the students and their personal lives. Many different activities to do on campus or off campus. The people here are very friendly and there are always dogs on campus. The campus is a perfect size if you are looking for a small campus. Academics are challenging but worth it!"
Alum,5,"Muhlenberg was an amazing place to grow into an adult.  I am currently in graduate school (at a substantially higher ranked school) and often question the wisdom of these rankings.  The people that I went to school with at Muhlenberg still rank among the most intelligent, engaged, and creative people that I have ever met."
Freshman,5,Friendly and accepting campus. Professors really take the time to get to know you and care that you know the material and put in effort.
Freshman,5,"One of my favorite things about Muhlenberg is that everyone is super nice and welcoming. Whether student, faculty, admissions officer, coach, etc. everyone respects everyone, no matter their race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, or personal history."
College Freshman,5,It is very easy to find or talk to your advisor if you are interested in finding a job or internship in your career field.
College Freshman,5,All of my courses have been related to my major and all of my professors are extremely helpful and care about my education.
College Freshman,5,I feel extremely safe on campus.
College Freshman,5,Greek life participates a lot in the community and furthers to better the town they live in.
College Freshman,5,This school is extremely helpful in allowing you to achieve your future goals and all teachers have a huge passion for teaching their students.
College Sophomore,5,"Being an athlete, we are given a strength and conditioning coach that pushes us past our limits, and we are asked even more so from our coaches. The school doesn't really show a lot of support for any other sport besides football, and even then it isn't a lot. Less can be said for basketball and tennis. Overall there isn't a lot of support for the athletic teams. There is a fairly large divide between the students of the arts and the athletic teams. They just don't support each other which causes tension throughout the school. My team was fairly successful during out winter season, but only when we made it to the later part of the season did students show up to games to support us. The facilities are some of the best i've seen at a division 3 level school and i am proud to train every time i step into the weight room or field house, knowing that i will be a better athlete than when i entered the room. I only said athlete, not person, due to the coaching staff. There is some tension between the players and the coaches, so we aren't all always on the same page. There have been times i've heard from other athletes that they don't like how they are being treated by their coaches. Now many of the faculty the run the field house and physical education department are coaches, so we see them frequently on campus."
College Freshman,5,They are really helpful but stay out of peoples business unless you need it
College Freshman,5,Such an underrated campus. Stunningly beautiful
College Freshman,5,They are pretty cool and throw good parties.
College Freshman,5,Literally state of the art facilities and great support from the student body.
College Freshman,5,They really look deep into the applicant
College Sophomore,5,I joined a sorority this year and I love it. I made many new friends and have a new circle of people who I can go to with problems or share good news with. My social scope has expanded as I have made new friends in other sororities and in fraternities as well.
College Sophomore,5,i feel very safe and protected. There are always campus safety officers around
College Senior,5,the best in the country
College Senior,5,"Not the stereotypical greek life, throw lots of parties"
College Senior,5,Division 3 school with Division 1 facilities
College Senior,5,"Awesome experience, loved this place. School is so spirited."
College Freshman,5,I live in Brown and the RAs are great and the girls are very easy to live with.
College Freshman,5,"You don't have to audition into theatre, but it's still an absolutely incredible program. It's easy to start taking theatre classes."
College Freshman,5,"Yes, if you get caught with drugs or alcohol in your room and you're underage you're going to be facing the consequences, but besides that, campus safety is great. They're really great if there's a protest or rally in letting it happen, so long as it doesn't violate any laws or school rules. They'll also intervene if someone's being overtly rude to the protesters to the point of causing the protesters to get angry"
College Freshman,5,"I have a night class that ends at 10pm and I feel totally comfortable as a female on this campus walking back to my dorm across campus alone, although typically you can find someone else to walk back with if you feel you'd be more comfortable walking with a buddy."
College Freshman,5,"There are a number of off-campus dining options, a majority of which offer student discounts. There are also a few 24-hour places, which is always nice."
College Freshman,5,"I love this campus; it's the perfect size and everyone is so nice. It's commonly said that, at Muhlenberg, even the wind holds the door open for you."
College Freshman,5,"The food is excellent, the staff is friendly, and they make everything right in front of you  and sometimes it's made-to-order, so you always know exactly what you're getting. They clearly label the nutrition information, whether or not it's gluten-free, and which options are vegetarian or vegan. My only qualm is that GQ, or essentially the campus convenience store, is far too pricey."
College Freshman,5,"Biochemistry is very hard at this school, but it will definitely prepare me for med school. There are so many research opportunities and the professors definitely want you to succeed."
College Freshman,5,"We have many computer labs on campus with free printing. It is still useful to have your own computers. Also, bring plain printer paper incase buildings run about (especially dorm buildings)"
College Freshman,5,"The gym is absolutely beautiful, but Muhlenberg is D3, so our sports are kind of a joke."
College Freshman,5,"If there are computer labs I have yet to find them, but there are computers in most classrooms"
College Freshman,5,"I was given a lot of money based on talent, as well as a separate scholarship for merit."
College Freshman,5,I love being a Mule. Everyone around me makes me happy and pushes me to do better. Wouldn't want to be anywhere else. 
College Freshman,5,Everyone is so friendly and im actually excited to go to class. I dont know how they did it but learning is fun. 
College Freshman,5,Theres a bunch of places to eat but not many within walking distance. Luckily the school shuttle runs every hour for free. 
College Freshman,5,Anyone can get alcohol if they want to. But that doesnt mean they have to. 
College Freshman,5,Theres parking lots all over campus and the campus is pretty small so youre never too far from anything.
College Freshman,5,"Allentowns a pretty big city, but dont expect anything like New York of Philly. Theres some stuff to do but sometimes you need to look for it. "
College Freshman,5,You can get away with most things as long as youre responsible and arent making a huge scene. Just use common sense. no ones out to get you but the'they'll catch you if you make them.  
College Freshman,5,School is really high tech. All HW posted online. Great computer labs. Free printing everywhere. 
Alum,4,"Online classes that I took substituted in-person discussions with discussion board prompts, which was very helpful in hearing other opinions and learning more."
Freshman,4,"I love Muhlenberg the community is something indescribable. Although students are a bit disrespectful in communal spaces, like bathrooms, but not everything and everyone can be great! The food is good the only other downside is not enough lights around outside when walking back from the dining hall or night classes. At least not enough to feel safe in the dark at night by yourself."
Junior,4,"Muhlenberg College is what you make of it. The opportunities are there, and you can learn a lot if you want to. On the other hand you can absolutely slide through doing the bare minimum."
Niche User,4,When applying to Muhlenberg the thing that really stood out to me was the caring environment of both the students and the teachers. With this environment I knew it would be the best environment for me to receive my higher education.
Junior,4,"Muhlenberg College is a welcoming college with a beautiful campus and many opportunities to learn and grow. Some highlights for me so far have been the one-on-one relationships you can establish with professors, leadership opportunities, and let's not forgot the amazing food! The one area that is lacking is there is not enough diversity on campus."
Sophomore,4,"Muhlenberg is one of the friendliest colleges I have ever seen, and I grew up in a college town. It is filled with theater people and performers, which gives a very specific atmosphere to the school. It can get tiring for those of us who are not into theater nor performing, and can even seem ridiculous at times, but it is a friendly and welcoming school with good professors who really, deeply care about you."
Freshman,4,Everyone on campus is extremely friendly.  One of my favorite things is the food.  Everyone on campus is always extremely busy whether that be with academics clubs or other activities.  Sometimes it feels like being on two different campuses - some students are really invested in sports while others are really invested in the arts.
Sophomore,4,"Academically, Muhlenberg College is great! The professors are passionate about what they are teaching and want to see every student succeed. The people on campus are great, but the social scene is lousy."
Senior,4,"You will get an excellent education by coming to Muhlenberg and you will be extremely prepared for any graduate school endeavors that you may plan on taking, no matter the field."
Senior,4,"This school is far from perfect, but it has a unique academic mindset. You can really pick whatever you want to do here, most professors are good people and genuinely want you to succeed. This is not a party school by any means, which is exactly what I wanted."
Senior,4,"Muhlenberg College is an amazing place to go to school. While downsides include the high tuition and minimal diversity, the advantages and opportunities you get along with the fantastic professors and students you get to meet make these costs worthwhile. You get amazing mentors through the professors here."
Sophomore,4,"Muhlenberg is a great school with great academia, athletics professors, and campus food. Although the school could use some more diversity, student life, and especially parties."
Alum,4,"It's a good, safe school that will get you a good job once you graduate. There are several good teachers who care a lot about their students. The downside is that it's very small and sheltered, so you will be limited in that regard."
Freshman,4,"Muhlenberg is a great college for a certain type of student. Maybe one that needs the extra support and care that a larger school can not provide. Students work closely with professors, and freshman have great access to many additional supports such as student teachers and the tutoring center. Even the dean is willing to help students who may need an extra push. Muhlenberg's social life is interesting. There are many clubs, acapella groups and shows to see, if you seek them out. It takes effort to stay busy, but if you look for it, it is possible. Parties here are tame, and often get shut down quickly. You can often find a party at one of the sport houses on Friday and Saturday nights.  Partying is definitely not the only option to stay busy as many people choose not to partake."
Junior,4,"Overall, Muhlenberg College is the ideal place to earn a degree. The small class sizes allow students to cultivate personal relationships with professors, who are really passionate about what they do, and with peers as well. Sometimes it can feel small, but it also allows you to take advantage of so many opportunities on campus. The food is amazing, and the people are all so nice. Classes are challenging and rewarding."
Niche User,4,"I went on a overnight visit to Muhlenburg for athletics, and fell in love with the campus, the other students, and the atmosphere that the college gives"
Freshman,4,The school at first doesn't feel like the right fit for you at first but it starts to grow on you once you find the group people you can rely on to make everything worth it. I am a student in color and I finished my first semester okay but the Emerging Leaders Program made it possible for me to feel like I belong in this school despite the high number of white students on campus. This school has a lot to offer but is all about how you use the resources to your advantage.
Graduate Student,4,I enjoyed my experience at this institution. I would have liked it more if there were online courses available throughout the semesters.
Junior,4,"Welcoming, generally academically rigorous, and (comparatively speaking) a good place to get a liberal arts education. Some programs are incredibly robust (theater and dance are always ranked within the top 10, and rightfully so), but Neuroscience, English, Psychology, and Biology have consistently produced  significant research, jobs, and postgrad success in recent years. 

It isn't cheap, but the financial aid office isn't out of reach, as Muhlenberg was the least expensive school on my shortlist of other small liberal arts colleges. Not a diverse campus and there's a sharp difference between athletes/science/business majors and humanities/arts students that can make Muhlenberg feel like two different colleges at times. Generally speaking, however, the campus has space for marginalized students and (I hope) continues to build on this diversity in the future."
Freshman,4,"Muhlenberg College is the quintessential small liberal arts college.  Students and professors alike are excited to share their passions, and the school definitely lives up to the ""caring college"" reputation it has."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus Housing is clean, affordable and socially valuable especially in a small college like this one."
College Freshman,4,"The dorm rooms although they are average, they are still very clean and provide the necessary equipment needed for everyday living."
College Freshman,4,There are many athletic opportunities for students to discover.
College Sophomore,4,"The class sizes and professors are great. The main reason i chose Muhlenberg was because of the quality of the education i knew i was going to receive. I wasn't just a number, yet sometimes i did get lost in the shuffle of class. Most of the professors breeze through the material, so quickly that at some points i wasn't even able to nail down the concept generally to be able to ask a question before they moved onto the next topic. I was at the end of the acceptance period, and i believe that the main reason i was accepted was due to me being a successful athlete in high school. So successful that i was to be on the team at Muhlenberg. Had it not been for my above average talent on the basketball court, i do not genuinely believe that i would be attending Muhlenberg, for i would not have been accepted during the application process."
College Freshman,4,"I'm so glad I chose to attend Muhlenberg College. I thought I would hate being only 10 minutes away from where I grew up; however, I've had so many new and wonderful experiences this past year. Everyone is super nice and special in their own way. No one is afraid to be who they are. I would recommend my school to anyone."
College Freshman,4,"Good facilities, only missing a few things."
College Sophomore,4,"People feel comfortable leaving their wallets and phones on tables in the dining hall because no one will steal their stuff. People walk around alone at all hours of the day and night. We have a very helpful campus security staff who are present on campus and quick to come to aid if called for help. I feel pretty safe on campus, I don't feel generally concerned that anyone will  attack me in any way."
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the professors and classes I've had have been great. I've found few subjects to be inherently boring, but ones that were usually had professors which made them more tolerable. I have had two unpleasant professors who did not seem to care about students learning or improving. They did not explain things well or respond positively to questions."
College Sophomore,4,"The housing for underclassmen is not ideal but I think it's better than at many other schools. There is only one dorm with really small rooms, but the rest give ample room for sleeping as well as socializing. Upperclassmen have many choices between suites, apartments, and houses which is nice."
College Sophomore,4,There are great with communicating concerns and are quick to action if anything occurs.
College Sophomore,4,There were some professors that were awful and I've had great ones but thats just how it goes.
College Sophomore,4,I wish the rooms were bigger and newer with more social spaces.
College Sophomore,4,They throw great parties and do a lot in the community. Plus they aren't arrogant.
College Sophomore,4,Its a great atmosphere and Im surrounded by a lot of great people. Ive been able to get involved in a lot of different activities.
College Junior,4,"The Theatre & Dance Department is very strong (#6 in the country), and most people are here for that. A lot of people are also here for the sciences (Pre-med, Neuroscience, etc.) and psychology. There seem to be a fair amount of business majors, but the program is limited, especially if you're looking into entrepreneurship—I know someone who was here for that, and he transferred to Drexel. The English Department is fantastic!"
College Junior,4,"The English department is brilliant. The Theatre & Dance department is well-funded, to say the least—just be careful to take classes with a professor who suits you. One of the theatre professors is the worst teacher I've had in my life; I retook the same class with a different professor (Larry Singer), and he's one of the best I've had in my life. Take risks! If something looks interesting, give it a shot—I signed up for a film class on a whim; it fulfilled one of my graduation requirements, and it was my favorite class of the semester. The professor (Tom Cartelli) also was extremely supportive when I was going through personal stuff. I took dance classes and hated it, but I took Movement Workshop for Dancers & Actors, and it changed my life! However, if you're not doing well in a class, you should withdraw right away. I tried to push through, and because I put so much effort into it, my coursework for my other classes suffered as well—NOT worth it. The classes are small, which is great, although the downside is that you will be heavily penalized for missing class, which can be a problem if (e.g.) you get sick."
College Sophomore,4,I wish that the theatre program faculty and facilities could accommodate the amount of students in theatre. There are too many kids and I feel like the quality of the program could be suffering as a result.
College Sophomore,4,"I am a theatre and philosophy major at Muhlenberg. The theatre department is amazing..and this is coming from a critical eye. Muhlenberg was my safety school, but I can now saw that I am POSITIVE I am getting conservatory level training. The professors are great and students are held to a very high level of accountability. The philosophy department is also excellent. Overall, my experience has been great."
College Freshman,4,"Muhlenberg is a liberal arts college, and thus emphasizes a comprehensive education of different fields. This of course, gives it an advantage. The downside is, though, that there are no engineering majors."
College Freshman,4,"The academics are definitely pretty great, there is a lot of individualized attention and opportunities for extra help if you need it."
College Freshman,4,I feel safe all the time and the health center is accessible and easy to get to if you ever feel sick or need help.
College Freshman,4,"I live in Prosser, which is probably the worst freshmen dorm quality wise. But it's really wonderful socially I've met a lot of people and made a lot of friends. The only struggle is it's loud and quiet hours are rarely enforced."
College Freshman,4,"I have really enjoyed my academic and social life here. However, clubs and performance groups are not easy to get into and it can leave you without much to do."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I had an amazing experience while I was at Muhlenberg. I met my life long friends there and potentially my future husband. Within my major (psych) the professors were always there to help every step of the way. I also joined a sorority which is something I am so grateful for. Everything about this school (campus, activities, parties, food, classes, ect) was amazing. If I had the opportunity to go back and attend college anywhere I wanted, I would only want to go to Muhlenberg."
College Senior,4,"It is a friendly environment, and I have access to lots of resources on campus.  

I have made many friends.  I was led to Christ by the Christian Fellowhip/Ministry on campus. 

I am learning what I want to do after school.  I feel I have learned who I really am on this campus."
College Sophomore,4,I absolutely love my school. The creative environment and amazingly friendly people make me a big fan of the Berg.
College Junior,4,"The main factor in choosing Muhlenberg was the Theatre department.  They have a great program, and I've been involved in several projects as an actor, singer, and stage manager during my two years here.  The campus has a very friendly atmosphere, as well.  The dining hall is known for its high quality food.  It needs to work on increasing diversity and representation of historically marginalized communities on campus.  The small student body makes it easy to form relationships with faculty and staff members.  Students can receive individual attention in class.  It is very common to pursue multiple majors, minors, and/or concentrations."
College Sophomore,4,"GQ

Good selection of snacks and drinks. Everything is overpriced, and often one or both cashiers leaves the checkout counter, causing a delay.

KOSHER

Muhlenberg's Noshery has the best kosher food available at an American college campus. Many non-Jewish students choose to get food from them, too. Noshery North is for dairy food (sometimes vegan!) and Noshery South is for meat.

On Friday nights, students go to Hillel for Shabbat dinner. Unfortunately, the Saturday options are mediocre (there is a selection of cold foods for the whole day instead of separate lunch & dinner options, and it's pretty much the same every week).

At GQ, there are rarely kosher meal options. Sometimes they have a couple of refrigerated sandwiches, but these are even more absurdly expensive than the rest of their food. However, no need to panic! There are plenty of kosher snacks and drinks (also overpriced).

In general, Muhlenberg dining is great. They just have to tweak a few things."
College Freshman,4,"My family has had a hard time getting everything processed because we aren't that organized with taxes, but the FinAid office has been very accommodating and helpful."
College Freshman,4,GQ is super expensive but overall the food is great.
College Sophomore,4,The food available on campus is great. Compared to the options that other college students receive we are quite fortunate to have the variety and style of cooking that we have. Our dining hall is definitely among one of the best in the country. It fails however to provide a better variety of food vendors that other bigger colleges have. It would be extremely pleasurable to have close places to walk to during the later hours of the night for food other than GQ.
College Sophomore,4,"Muhlenberg College dorms are like an average dorm living space. Although there are better quality dorms the ones available for underclassmen are not in the most pristine condition. Further renovation is required for certain halls. Other than simple renovation the housing on campus is pretty good. It provides a great social atmosphere and the right amenities. As with most private colleges however, the cost is extreme and unless there are available scholarships or financial aid can be quite hard to afford."
College Senior,4,Campus safety is present on campus and have the students' best interest in mind. They're very willing to help students out whether it's driving them back to their dorms from the library at 1am or dealing with a sexual assault case.
College Senior,4,"I don't receive financial aid, but I got an academic scholarship from the college. From what I've heard from my friends who receive financial aid, the college is helpful and generous."
College Senior,4,"My program is intense, but good. The workload can be heavy at times, but the professors and fellow students are always willing to help. The job opportunities are really good in my program. Almost everyone has a job lined up by the middle of senior year."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Student-to-faculty ratio is great here--it's easy to get to know your professors, and office hours are very convenient. Classes are small and many of them are discussion-based, which is more engaging than a huge lecture. Most classes take attendance, though--so don't skip!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are a number of off-campus restaurants--mostly chains, but also a few individually owned places. Students frequent Cali Burrito, Trivet Diner, Manhattan Bagel, and for late-night food, Wawa. Check out Brewworks or Bamboo for a sit-down, date appropriate dinner spot. You need a car to get to all of these places, though."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Students can't rush until sophomore year, which is great because they have time to adjust to the campus and coursework and meet people more organically. I rushed and really enjoyed Greek life--I met great people and developed lifelong friendships. However, if you aren't interested in Greek life, there are tons of other ways to get involved on campus--it's not a necessity at this school (though if you're not on a sports team, in Greek life, OR in theater, you probably won't have much of a social life). Fraternities and sororities have a strong presence on campus (often seen holding events, wearing letters, etc.) but Greek life doesn't dominate the school. It's a pretty good balance."
College Freshman,4,"The work load can be intimidating at times, but once you learn to manage your time effectively, you should be okay. The theatre curriculum is rigorous and there are a lot of classes you need to take, but you get to choose which ones to take after a certain point from very specific categories, and all of the classes are immensely applicable to theatre in the real world. Also, honors programs are amazing; I'm an RJ Fellow and, yes, we need to take the FYS and CUE together, but other than that, we have 3 classes we get to choose from a huge range of options that we take with other, non-RJ students and they're all quite fascinating."
College Freshman,4,"I can't speak to them very well, but our Life Sports Center is amazing; there are plenty of machines in the gym, and there are several gyms for various sports. Also, we have both fencing and quidditch in addition to the more mainstream sports typically seen on college campuses."
Freshman,2,Most of my professors kind of gave up on the classes once we transferred to online classes. Me and the friends I had in those classes ended up teaching ourselves the material which was hard with absolutely no guidance.
Junior,2,"You will get a great education and enjoy above average dining hall food. The facilities are very good and are constantly improving. There is very little to do socially. MAC (Muhlenberg activities counsel) runs below average events that are poorly attended. Party scene is pretty dead, especially for non-athletes. People here treat me like crap and I feel like this school doesn’t care about me at all. Muhlenberg seems to have been the wrong choice"
Sophomore,2,"The classes and academic resources are great. The food is amazing. The facilities are fantastic (especially Seegers and Life Sports Center). However, there is little diversity here and the social aspect is very poor. At Muhlenberg there are really two groups: athletics and theater (there is also Greek like but it is not as prominent). The Greek life here is terrible, the athletics are cliuey and don’t branch out outside their teams or to “non-athletes” and treat you as if you are lesser for not being on a team. Many people here are stuck up. The campus is largely geared towards theater people. Those are the two main social groups and if you do not fall into ether category, then this is not the place for you. You will have no social life and the school will not care about you."
Freshman,2,"I am a really extraverted person. I love to party and have fun, but Muhlenberg is so boring socially. Academically it’s easy and it’s not hard to get an A. WARNING! do not come here if you want to have a stimulating college experience. Going to Muhlenberg is one of the worst decisions I have made in my life and I am so happy that I am not coming back sophomore year."
College Freshman,2,You can get away with doing pretty much anything.
College Freshman,2,"Besides the food, I do not love it here. There is not much focus and academic motivation, and I wonder how many kids gained acceptance here."
College Junior,2,"The diversity is notoriously bad. There are few students of color. There is a huge LGBTQ population. People always say that there are a lot of Jews, but most are secular Jews, which makes it very hard to be an observant Jew."
College Sophomore,2,"For the money we spend on Muhlenberg, the housing (at least for freshman and sophomores) NEEDS to be updated. Some buildings aren't so bad, but Prosser and ML, for instance, NEED to be fixed up. They are old and dirty. We pay a lot for housing, why do underclassman have to suffer?"
College Sophomore,2,"I am not a fan of greek life at all. I do not and would not participate in it. However, other people at muhlenberg seem to have fulfilling experiences. Greek life is definitely chill at Muhlenberg; it is present but not overwhelming"
College Freshman,2,"I'm not involved in athletics so I can't really say what it is like, but from an outsider perspective it almost seems like no one really cares about varsity sports. They only care about the parties afterwards."
College Sophomore,2,I am still dealing with it now... fingers crossed.
College Freshman,2,Way too expensive for the average student.
College Freshman,2,"Unless there's a frat party, you're condemned to the sport houses. They all suck, football is the worst. Frisbee, however, is actually okay--just mad crowded."
College Freshman,2,A diner and a bar/grill. Good luck finding anywhere nice to eat. Limited to the late night GQ visits for food (the on campus fast food joint).
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's bad Pennsylvania weather. Winter is long and unforgiving. The 3 weeks at the end of the year when spring finally hits is phenomenal, though."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Allentown is a bad town. It used to be a steel town and vibrant (so I'm told) but now its mostly run down. On one side of campus is a rich suburban area and on the other side is a very poor urban area. All in All, it's kind of a cultural desert outside of the campus confines."
College Freshman,2,"There is definitely not a lot of racial diversity at this school. However, everyone is so accepting here, no matter what race, sexuality, gender, religion, etc you may be. Everyone feels so comfortable."
College Freshman,2,"Most people are White, Christian, upper-class Democrats. A third of the population is Jewish, but there aren't many Jews who consider themselves observant. There are plenty of students who identify as LGBT. There ARE a few exceptions to all of this — Orthodox Jews, Asians, Blacks, Latinos, Muslims, Republicans — but they're very conscious of being in the minority. The same goes for students from lower-income families. That said, most people here are accepting and willing to befriend people from different backgrounds."
College Junior,2,They do not offer a decent selection of scholarships opportunities.
College Freshman,2,"There are not a ton of computer labs.  It is difficult to rely on them for printing. If you are able, 100% bring your own computer and printer"
Sophomore,1,"Muhlenberg is a white-washed, un-diverse school with  a sea of micro-aggressive people. As an International student, I was told by the Dean of Students to be ""more American"" and adapt to their ways in a situation. I found this straight up racist."
Freshman,1,"I've had a horrible year at Muhlenberg College and am planning on transferring. I've been getting a pretty good education (although the classes are a bit too easy) and most of my teachers have been pretty nice, but the school itself is horrible. The campus is far too small and since it's not connected to any sort of city (It's separated from Allentown by a graveyard, and Allentown itself is not a very nice place to be) there's nowhere to get away from the school and no sense of community with its surrounding. The students can be HIGHLY cliquey, and don't interact much with people outside of their groups. The mental health and disabilities services are TERRIBLE. I have a lot of anxiety and it has been worse this year, but they've given me no help as they're extremely understaffed and overworked. These are just a few reasons as to why I'm unhappy here. I have many more. Admittedly, some people do seem to be happy there, but that hasn't been the case for me or many other people I know."
Freshman,1,The social scene here is an absolute bust. All parties are shut down by 12pm and everyone hangs in the common area after. Absolutely depressing and upsetting. Don't come here if you're looking to have any sort of fun.
College Freshman,1,you can do whatever you want
College Freshman,1,WAY too little to do besides drinking.
College Freshman,1,"You do not get what you paid for, in my opinion."
College Freshman,1,"I am so sorry I chose such a preppy, stuck-up school."
College Freshman,1,"Very elitist, many problems with greeks on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"In every on-campus sexual assault I know of, (1) the process was drawn-out and painful, (2) the school ultimately did nothing for the victims, and (3) the assailants received no consequences."
College Freshman,1,"Huge Jewish population. The School made a large effort to recruit Jewish students--that being said, there are very few students of any ethnic background. Trans students and gay students are ""supported"" but not really.  Any ethnic students are underrepresented and the school is very backward as far as diversity goes. The students are generally ""liberal."""
College Freshman,1,There is very little to do off campus. You are trapped on campus and can only do the things offered by the school for the first year. Then you can get a car but there still isn't much to do. Don't come here from a big city.
College Freshman,1,"A majority of Muhlenberg is accepting of gay and lesbian students, but there are no trans students nor much advocacy for them.

The Muhlenberg Feminist Collective is absolutely terrible, especially because it should be called ""The Muhlenberg Cisgender and Straight White Feminist Collective""

There's a big push for ethnic diversity, but you get the general impression that the student body at large doesn't care much about it and the administration is very slow at remedying the strange problem of having an almost completely white college in the north in 2014.

If you're a student of color here, you'll find the best camaraderie if you align yourself with members of the various racial advocacy groups on campus (BSA, ASA, Communidad Latino, or the sorority Theta Nu Zi). If you don't, well, you'll probably be dealing with white people the whole time you're here.

A lot of the white people who go to Muhlenberg come from high income households and have no clue about casual racism and few have a desire to educate themselves."
College Freshman,1,"Its a theatre school, athletics are not a part of campus life."
College Sophomore,1,If yo are under 29 it is an A+ they have campus on an off housing for traditional students. If older it is not their problem at all. The property around the area the school bought out the homes and only traditional ones can rent from them. The restof the area are slumb landlords and losts of crime.  You have to pay around $750 up to get a decet apartments. The rest are slumb landlords. In order to get a good apartment you need tobe able to drive and be able to pay for a good area. The older students cant live on campus they discriminate with regards to housing and age. If you are older you must find your own housing etc.
College Sophomore,1,You really need a car or to live on campus and go with some one who has a car.
College Freshman,1,"You can't rush until sophomore year which really sucks if you would like to be involved freshman year and meet more people.  Also, there are only 4 sororities and frats so there are very limited options to choose from.  "
College Freshman,1,Nothing happens here.  Most of the time it is very hard to find a party on a friday or saturday.  And most of the time they are not very fun.  
College Freshman,1,"The school is 60% women and it definitely shows!  It can be very difficult to find a guy here. The people here are generally good looking, but they are mostly athletes who keep to themselves.   "
College Freshman,1,"There is no diversity on campus in any sense.  Everyone is white and there are a lot of Jews.  Everyone is from new york or new jersey.  As someone not from those states I feel very disconnected.  Also, everyone is a theater major"
College Freshman,1,Allentown sucks.  It is a small city with nothing to do.  It is also dangerous

Sophomore,5,I love being a student at Charleston Southern University. The professors are knowledgeable and kind. The campus is an enjoyable place to live and learn.
Niche User,5,"chose a different school to finish my degree faster, but loved the student body and the close knit atmosphere of the campus."
Sophomore,5,"Overall Charleston Southern University had a great transition in to an online experience. I finished out my first year second semester online. I feel like both the professors and administration made sure to provide students with an experience as close to regular in person class as possible. Using video calls and open availability for office hours, I was able to have a in class interaction with other students and professors, while still having opportunity to ask for help as needed."
Sophomore,5,"After attending Charleston Southern University my freshman year I fell in love. The campus is not only beautiful but it is easy to walk from class to class. I also enjoy that it is a smaller campus so you can get a more one on one experience with teachers if needed. Along with the great learning atmosphere, the campus has a dedicated campus security staff which is available 24/7 for emergencies, escorts, and a variety of other services.  Overall I have really enjoyed my first year at CSU and can not wait to see what the next three have to offer."
Junior,5,This is a faith based school that really cares.  Everyone is so helpful at the school.  Beautiful campus.
Alum,5,As a military veteran this school offered all the tools to help me earn my Bachelor’s degree. I also liked the fact that it was a Christian college. Everyone of my professors made an effort to relate Christian values to everyday life.
Graduate Student,5,The professors are very kind and help a lot. They want the students to do well. There is not much help with financial aid if you are not an undergrad student. The campus is beautiful and near the heart of Charleston.
Graduate Student,5,I graduated with my bs and it was a Greta school. I really likes most of my teachers in public health. They were very helpful if I ever needed anything
Freshman,5,I like the culture and the heart at CSU. It is an amazing place for growth and prosperity. Making new friends or even academic opportunities are always there.
Niche User,5,i don’t attend charleston southern university yet but i have not been there for a field trip and it was a nice looking campus and the people were really nice. I also wanted to play baseball for charleston southern university for a long time but it does not look like that will happen. i would really like to go to this school because it it close to home and i would not have to pay for room and board because i could just live at home.
Freshman,5,Charleston Southern University is considered one of the best colleges in our area.  It is one of only 2 colleges in SC that offer the music therapy program I was looking for.  I'm excited to attend!
Freshman,5,"Easily found others who shared the same interests, goals and passions. Lots of ways to plug-in to campus life. Beautiful campus."
Graduate Student,5,Great school! Excellent staff and professors. Very helpful and caring. Christ centered environment for knowledge accumulation.
Niche User,5,CHARLESTON SOUTHERN IS AMAZING! I honestly don’t see how it has a C rating. They are a really great Christian university
Sophomore,5,"This is a great school with very caring faculty, and a great body of students which provide an excellent space to enrich my education."
Graduate Student,5,The international student office takes care of every aspect of international students. Accommodation is cheaper than the community.
Freshman,5,"CSU is an excellent school! It's a private school, so it's a bit expensive, but it teaches you how to succeed in life as well as your courses. It was my BEST first-year experience at college!!"
Sophomore,5,"Charleston Southern has a beautiful campus and everyone is friendly and helpful. The campus is a size that is not over whelming. CSU is close to many activities, shopping, and only a few hours from my home town. They offer lots to do on campus like football games, movies, student organizations, and various events throughout the year. The nursing program is very organized and up to date on current standards. I am excited to start the nursing program this year."
Junior,5,What I like about Charleston Southern University is the campus layout is not confusing it is easy to get from class to class. The buildings are not too far spread out. The professors are nice and they actually know what they are teaching and make little errors.
Freshman,5,"As an out of state student, the family like atmosphere rooted in the faith of Jesus Christ while also obtaining the highest professionalism in the classroom is a unique characteristic that CSU holds and maintains. Plus it’s close to a city, close to the beach, is warmer than my home state year-round, close to mountains and hiking/outdoorsy outlets, has a beautiful up in coming safe campus friendly staff, and is the smallest D1 school in the south! What’s not to love!!"
Niche User,5,During the summer of last year I went with my school on a field trip to Charleston Southern University and it is a school I knew I wanted to attend. Being around the scenery and also understanding how the campus itself works really was intriguing.
Niche User,5,I liked how they're not like other universities because they integrate Christianity in their daily lives.
Niche User,5,"I really liked the hospitality about Charleston Southern. When visiting, I realized that this is where I really want to go and that I will have an easy time fitting in. I am excited to become part of this college."
Sophomore,5,Great College where students can focus on studies and academic success. Christian focus for each and every course helps eliminate typical college diversions. Better environment for learning.
Alum,5,"I graduated from Charleston Southern in 2009. They gave me a full ride with academics and athletics. My experience was great! Everyone, students and faculty, was like family."
Junior,5,"Love the professors on campus, most are always willing to help and want to see you succeed. I'm a commuter however I've heard the dorms are not good, and the food in the cafeteria is not great either. They just got sushi and a chik-fil-a so I can't complain about that!"
Senior,5,It is a great campus user friendly layout of buildings but more importantly the staff and educators are very helpful. I would highly recommend this college.
Sophomore,5,I love everything about this campus. I love the diversity and the incorporation of Christianity. I would recommend this campus to everyone.
Alum,5,My experience as a Buccaneer was nothing short of incredible. I am deeply amazed by the faculty who are not only brilliant but also extremely caring and compassionate. My life has been changed for the better by being here. Just go. No hesitations. I 100% recommend this school to anyone.
Sophomore,5,"I like the atmosphere at CSU. It’s a Christian atmosphere but it isn’t shoved down your throat. Everyone welcomes you with open arms, that’s just how it is."
Sophomore,5,I really liked Charleston Southern University.  It's small and easy to navigate. The teachers are great.  The teachers I've had work with the students and are very nice.  Me being a Veteran they worked with me while I was still active duty.  The area is great and safe as well.
Junior,5,I love this university and have for many years. My sister attended here so i grew attached to this campus and fell in love with it. I feel I was led to attend here and I am glad I do. This campus is so beautiful and is like my home away from home.
Senior,5,"It is a very Christian friendly campus. Students and teachers work well together, and are generally pleasurable to be around."
Freshman,5,I love the diversity and location of the school. Very historical are whit a lot of knowledge for the students.
Graduate Student,5,The University is an amazing school I love how they integrate the real world with the biblical teaching.  The professors are about helping the student succeed in life they bring in their real world experiences to help you understand the reason things have change in the workplace.
Alum,5,I loved attending Charleston Southern University. They gave me the opportunity to complete my degree to become a teacher with the help from professors that care about you and are willing to help you in any way possible!
Sophomore,5,I love this school! Even though it was not my first choice (it was my second) I do not regret it one bit.  I love the environment and the people there.   I enjoy how the professor and student ratio is 1:15 so the professors are able to form a relationship with the student and know their needs.
Junior,5,"This up coming summer will be my 3rd semester here at CSU. I transferred from TTC a 2 year college here in Charleston, SC after graduating with 2 degrees. Being here so far has been amazing. The people are friendly and wonderful and well-knowing. I've had no issues thus far with getting settled in and I got the hang of the online format within the first week of me being there. I recommend this college to anyone from a new student to a transfer student to older adults."
Sophomore,5,"Charleston Southern University is a wonderful institution. The professors are widely diverse and always available to lend a helping hand even if they are not teaching you. Like most campuses there is room for improvements such as the food and housing, but I made the best choice of my life attending Charleston Southern University. Go Bucs!"
Niche User,5,I would not change anything about CSU for it is surely the place that God intended me to further my education.
Freshman,5,Charleston Southern University is a good school. Charleston Southern has great professors and offers many resources for your academics. It is also a small campus that is very easy to get around. I would like to see two things change about Charleston Southern: the student population and the athletics. I think Charleston Southern needs a bigger student population in order to create more diversity. It also needs a better athletics program.
Freshman,5,"Small university with a BIG vision, I look forward to my time here. The Christian Atmosphere is not overwhelming, but you can tell that the staff works through God's word. They actually care about you and will take the time to help you acheive your goals."
Niche User,5,"Charleston Southern is an excellent school for students to consider. If you are considering majoring in Nursing, CSU is your best option. The ratio of student to teacher is remarkable. Any questions or problems you have, the professors will do anything to help their students. The campus is beautiful and opportunities are endless."
Niche User,5,This is a good place to go. I would recommend going here because you will truly excel academically. This place is a little pricey if your family doesn't make what's necessary. They have lots of clubs and activities and I really would recommend this college.
Junior,5,Awesome school that gave me another chance at getting a degree! I would recommend them to any student looking for a Christian based school as well!
Freshman,5,"I love CSU!  The campus is so peaceful and beautiful, just the right size, and the perfect focus: Christ.  There are many opportunities to serve Christ, further my knowledge of the Bible, learn leadership skills, and CSU has quality academic instruction with much rigor.  On top of that, the student body includes many different cultures, and the people are just lovely."
Freshman,5,"I love the environment and how friendly everyone is. It is truly such a fun place to be, especially with charleston right down the road. I would recommend this school to anyone wanting to go to school. Even though it is a christian school, not everyone here is a christian."
Freshman,5,CSU has given me the best experience for college. I love the way professors are willing to meet with you individually and give extra help. The classes are in great walking distance from my dorm building. I don't think I want to see a change on this campus. It is basically perfect. 
Niche User,5,I've recently joined Niche and I'm already in love with it. They guide you through this experience very well. There connecting you to schools that best fit you and saving you some time and worry
College Freshman,5,"I love the courses that I am enrolled in, the professors are the absolute best, they teach from real life experiences."
College Freshman,5,"I love CSU, it's Christian based & the professors are eager to teach you."
College Sophomore,5,I love everything about it.
College Sophomore,5,I love everything about this school.
College Sophomore,5,I feel pretty safe on campus.
College Sophomore,5,"I don't live on campus, but my friends love it."
College Sophomore,5,We don't have Greek life at all.
College Sophomore,5,I love this school. There's nothing bad to say.
College Junior,5,I try not to see color or religion.  I just see human beings.  I just wish this world especially the USA would stop basing everything on color and religion.
College Sophomore,5,The curriculum is tough and professors are sometimes fair.
College Junior,5,"In my opinion Charleston Southern University is a great place to earn a degree, and employers look at the graduates very highly. I know when I graduate I will already have a job lined up for me at a local hospital."
Sophomore,4,"Online learning has been an adjustment for everyone, but the professors are very helpful in making the experience the best that it could be."
Alum,4,"Overall, I had a great experience at CSU. Their Biochemistry degree program was interactive and intense. The teacher are always willing to help you and get you to where you needed to be."
Niche User,4,did not take classes online but they probably would have been good. the in person lasses are very good as well
Senior,4,I like how personal they were and how most of the teachers help me to succeed and help me be a better individual.
Senior,4,"A lot of my teachers are great. Most of them really care about their students. All of the staff are friendly. I wish the food places were open longer, especially on the weekends."
Sophomore,4,The professors at Charleston Southern University are amazing. I wouldn't have gotten through 2 years without their support. The campus is beautiful and a great place to study. The Christian atmosphere is very supportive and calming. I've met so many life-long friends at this college that make it 10x better.
Freshman,4,Charleston Southern is an amazing Christian Institution. Staff and students are friendly and the environment is beautiful.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy going to Charleston Southern University. They love to do a lot of things to get the students involved. They also do things that help other. This year we packed over 5,000 boxes for operation Christmas child, an organization that gives children gifts that are not able to get gifts around the world. I would like to see things such as better food. I would also like to see some buildings improve in the future. i would love to see Charleston Southern University expand."
Freshman,4,"Charleston Southern is a great school. It is community oriented, the staff there is friendly and wants to help you strive to do your best."
Sophomore,4,"So far, my experience at Charleston Southern has been a great growing opportunity. This school may not be for the student who enjoys the party scene or is looking for raging student life on campus, but the people who go to the school is what makes it amazing. I have met such caring and loving people who include students, faculty, staff and many of the professors. I have already made such quality relationships with people here. If I had to change anything, I would try and up some of the student life on campus, and make changes to some of the rules that seem outdated. However, our new president is working with the students to make the school an outstanding place to live and study."
Graduate Student,4,Cares about international students. Plenty of campus activities. Most of the professors are friendly and willing to help.
Junior,4,I transferred here as a commuter student from Florence-Darlington Technical College. The environment is peaceful and God’s Spirit moves in the campus. I have no complaints at all. This school is the best choice if you want a Christian learning in your academics.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Charleston Southern is a good university but, it does have some cons. For example, financial aid is a bit confusing and there are a lot things you have to do to complete your financial aid. The food is better than average and they're places on campus and off campus that you can go to. The campus is very safe and I do appreciate that. It is a small campus so some might view that as a con but, I enjoy a smaller campus."
Sophomore,4,It's a very nice school however they're aren't many events to keep the students excited and energized throughout the school year.
Niche User,4,"I loved CSU, it is a smaller campus in the sense that everything is within a reasonable walking distance from your dorm. Security is always prepared and ensures the safety of all students and staff."
Sophomore,4,"Charleston Southern University is a cute little college nestled in Charleston, which gives its students access to just about anything they could want. The campus is beautiful, but small. The facilities are new, and the campus is constantly growing with new buildings and new staff. The students are kind and diverse, which enables everyone to walk among other walks of life. The best parts of the college are the little nooks and crannies, which can be the secret lounges, the shady walks around the reflection pond, and the gorgeous hiking trails. The campus is very safe, despite being so open, and the security staff, administration, and the president, Dondi Costin, are wonderful people and incredibly good-hearted. Great Christian environment, and they are always willing to help you succeed."
Niche User,4,It is a good school. It is one of the best schools in nursing. Enrollement is kind of complicated but they have gotten much better over the years.
Graduate Student,4,Online masters program is great. The set up is super easy  for those already in the work field. Super easy to work in with other jobs or families. Very Christian oriented. You have to buy new textbooks for every class. Sometimes 4 books and an online subscription for one class.
Freshman,4,Charleston Southern is a place of enriched learning paired with faith-based principles that provide for an education that can lead to very promising futures.
Freshman,4,"Charleston Southern is a great college for its Christian environment. All your professors are walking alongside you in faith, and making sure they integrate that faith into the classroom. Classes are extremely challenging and require a lot of time spent studying and preparing for the class. With that being said, professors are more than willing to open up their office and help you until you understand. I would not change where I am for the world."
Junior,4,I absolutely love my academic adviser! Very caring and approachable individual. I feel that way about the school in general but the financial aid office is rude and unhelpful. Their return policy on books is also absolutely ridiculous.
Freshman,4,"I'm only a part time student but so far I've really enjoyed the experience I get here. The professors are nice and so are the staff. The rooms could be a lot nicer though and so can the students. However, it's an overall good college to go to."
Sophomore,4,"Charleston Southern is a small but great 4 year university that actually wants you to succeed. With the small classroom environments, your professors actually try and connect with you and if you need help they will do the best to their ability to help you out. It is a private Christian school so they also do a good job integrating Faith in the classroom. Charleston Southern also provides great academic assistance in the situations when you need help with a class. I would definitely recommend this university to anyone interested."
Senior,4,"Charleston Southern University will help you out in any way that they possibly can. The staff overall is loving ,kind, and they all love Jesus. I will say that they could be a little more lenient with finances"
Senior,4,Charleston southern university is one of the best colleges in SC to consider furthering your education. The safety living on campus is ranked very high and diversity within the students is well balanced. The professors are among some if the best they engage with their studemts and help you in any way they can to succeed at CSU. The cost is average compared to other private colleges and the level of education you will receive prepares a student for his or her career.
Junior,4,Charleston Southern University is a Christian based college. Everyone is welcomed here. It's a great place to go to school. The professors and the staff are on your side to help you succeed.
Senior,4,"I am currently a senior at Charleston Southern University and I have enjoyed my experience here thus far. The campus is absolutely beautiful and it is always clean. It sits right in the middle of things, so it is easy to get to and from places, and there are a lot of restaurants to choose from. As far as academics, I feel like I am getting my monies worth."
Sophomore,4,"The Classes can be tough, but the school is a welcoming and nurturing environment. There are tutoring services available, and there is good food in the dining hall."
Sophomore,4,"Charleston Southern University is by far one of the best colleges in my area, for both commuters and residents. There is never any crime here, and everyone is amazing, nice, and respectful. I love this college with all of my heart."
Junior,4,"I will be starting my first semester at Charleston Southern University for the Spring 2018 term. So far, I have been completely satisfied with any questions regarding my class schedule or new campus. I look forward to the upcoming opportunity."
Freshman,4,"Big fan of the Christian environment! Small school population makes it easy to connect with people for bible studies, study groups, etc. Plenty of friendly places to hang out and study on campus."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is very small. I liked that there were small classroom sizes that allowed us to interact directly with the professors, but there are few campus clubs that applied to my interests. The dining hall had a lot of healthy options available and I enjoy having the Chik fil A and coffee shop right on campus."
Sophomore,4,"Honestly at this point, I absolutely love this college. All the enrollment people have been so helpful! I am transferring into this college and when I enrolled into my previous college I barely heard anything back from them and had to hunt people down to answer one question! With Charleston Southern I have received at least one or two letters a week on reminding me of things I still need to do before I start in the fall."
Junior,4,"The professors are very caring and always available to students. Most of the classes except, except for survey classes, are kept small.  They have amazing nursing and education programs as well and graduates usually have little to no trouble finding jobs in these majors. This university also promotes internships which helps to get much needed real world experience. The biggest downside is the price. It is expensive and most students would not be able to attend it not for financial aide. They also have a strict code of moral conduct. No drinking, no smoking, and of course no drugs. It is a Christian school but it is not a requirement to attend."
Freshman,4,"I adore the professors and they have a wonderful education program. One thing I as a student would like to see changed, is more attention to students who are not financially able to continue their education."
Sophomore,4,I love the college that I attend. It is a christian university. It has free tutoring and counseling. They offer many opportunities for their students. They are growing in size and it is exciting to see. I live on campus in the dorms and all of my classes I am able to walk to in less than 10 minutes. I spend a lot of time in the library which is available until midnight. They also have lounges on each floor of the dorms. You can use these for studying or relaxing watching tv with friends. The professors are encouraging and care for their students academic performances.
Junior,4,"It's a great school, also it's a private university. It's small school with between 25 -40 students in  a classroom. So that makes learning much easier. But overall its a great campus, with different activities and organizations. "
Junior,4,i've been going to this school for 3 years and it's an amazing school. the only downfall is how expensive it is. also housing is so crowded and everything seems to be unorganized. 
Recent Alumnus,4,We get speakers from different occupations to talk
College Freshman,4,CSu hosts career fairs and the professors have relationships with employers in the area.
College Freshman,4,From what I see they provide a lot of service to the community.
College Freshman,4,Standards are set high for CSU athletics so that they can excel on the field & the classroom.
College Junior,4,I love my Christian school
College Sophomore,4,The athletics are very important at CSU.
College Junior,4,"I chose Santa Fe College right out of high school because I was offered a chance to play baseball at the college level. It was always a dream for me to do so. Any junior college offers the same classes, so academically, the choice was easy. I wanted to complete my dream of playing college baseball, as well as earning my Associates Degree. Now that I am done with Santa Fe, I have received a scholarship to play baseball at a Christian school in South Carolina called Charleston Southern. It has always been one of my dreams to play division 1 baseball, but I was not aware of how much it actually costs to go off to college. Earning money to pursue my dream is just another stepping stone I am willing to try in order to earn my bachelors degree, while playing baseball."
College Sophomore,4,They search rooms regularly and enforce the rules.
College Junior,4,"The nursing program has been great, the staff is amazing and the curriculum is very tough. I can tell that everyone on staff really cares, and professors are always there to help, especially in the nursing program because they know it's tough. The class sizes are usually about 30 people of less which is great because class interaction is more personal. The professors that I have had so far have done a great job at keeping the classes interesting."
College Junior,4,"I love going to a smaller college because it is a more personal learning experience, and it is easy to get one on one time with a professor if help is needed. I would definitely choose Charleston Southern University if I had to do it all over again."
College Junior,4,You constantly see security riding around  24hrs a day.
College Junior,4,It's a good school.  The instructors seem to care about you compared to a previous college that I attended.
College Sophomore,4,Greek life seems easy and fun but can be expensive.
College Sophomore,4,CSU does not have a well known greek life.
College Sophomore,4,The athletics at Charleston Southern are wonderful and important but do not over shadow the other wonderful aspects of the school.
College Freshman,4,I love the dorm life and i have nothing bad to say about it. The dorms are in a great spot compared to where classes and the cafe take place.
College Freshman,4,"Every faculty member, staff member, and student supports the team. They are really good at what they do. They are 10 times better than my high school team."
College Junior,4,"Greek life makes you want to aspire to do better with academic standings, but nobody is jealous of them."
College Sophomore,4,"Not only are there a variety of courses, but a variety of professors and their personalities as well"
College Sophomore,4,"At Charleston southern university, you pretty much feel safe 24 hours out the day. Security is active and has pretty good coverage of the small campus."
College Sophomore,4,"The reason why Charleston Southern is so great is because of several reasons. These reasons include allowing to learn in Christian environment, friendly staff, and the small campus allows you to make more personal friends."
College Junior,4,I don't know much about the Alumni network but some programs of study require the students do internships. As far as I know the professors do their best to find internships for their students.
Junior,2,"Great school to get your education at, while also becoming closer to the Lord. However this school treats its students like children! They are bunk beds in the dorms for grown  people to sleep in. The  dorm room is fit for one person, maybe two, but they shove three people in there. The dorms are old, molded, and have been there since the 1920s. Being a female, having to share a small room with two other girls is bad, but having to share a bathroom with five other females, is worse. Not only are the are the living accommodations horrible, but the food is just as bad. The food is unseasoned, inedible, and sad. The wifi doesn't always work, there's not enough parking, and there's not enough washers and dryers for three floors worth of residents.  For the money I'm paying to attend this school, it's not worth it!"
Freshman,2,"This is a Bible thumping Christian school.  If you're anything like me, you won't be happy here; in fact, you'll probably be close to miserable.  The first thing you have got to understand is that if you're looking for a true ""college experience"" this is not the place for  you.  You can't have the other sex in your room.  You can't drink.  You can't have any tobacco on campus.  There's little to no parking and if you park illegally campus security will be very quick to give you a ticket.  There is 0 greek life on campus.  NO PARTIES ARE HELD ON CAMPUS. The professors are very respectful and understanding. Sports teams here are good and the Football team is one of the best in the FCS.  If you want to party you'll need to go downtown to a bar (you'll need a fake id if you're under 21).  The school itself isn't even in ""Charleston"".  It's in Goose Creek or North Charleston which isn't nearly as nice as Charleston.  They drown out the college feel of this school. "
College Sophomore,2,There is little to no support for greek life at Charleston Southern University.
College Freshman,2,They run out of two person rooms fast. You can get stuck with people you don't like. Lots of issues with plumbing.
College Freshman,2,Greek life here is not actually important or well known. It is actually a campus joke.
College Freshman,2,"Housing is a joke for what you pay for it. The washing room is tiny and made for my whole building. There are three people that live in a room made for two. The third person has to share closet space with the first two people (there are only two closets), and sleep on the top bunk, The AC/Heating units are dated as well as the rest of the building actually. The policy for having the opposite gender in your dorms are overkill. The cable blocks popular channels such as MTV, VH1, OXYGEN, and BET. It is like the school is trying you protect you from the outside world and experiencing living away from home. Also, you can not live off of campus until you are 20 years old or if you stay with your parents in the tri-county area. This is college. Let's be mature about this CSU, I'm not 12 anymore."
College Freshman,2,Greek life here is not like the greek life at most universities. The greek life at CSU is pretty low key and only become noticeable for the couple of events they do on campus. Greek life is mostly community service based and conservative.
College Freshman,2,"It's bad because of on campus housing and the experiences that go with it. Three people are housed in two person dorm rooms which is disrespectful. There are two closets so the third person has to share some of the closet space with the first two. The third person is also on the top of a bunk bed so they do not get to have under-the-bed space for things like suitcases, refrigerators, and storage. The other side of the three person dorm has two people joined together by a bathroom. That means that five girls/boys share one bathroom. The dorms are also in need of remodeling as they look dated. Also the cable at CSU blocks a lot of popular channels such as MTV, VH1, OXYGEN, and BET. The cafe food varies from day to day and does not have very many options. The people in the front offices are either rude or don't really know what they are doing with some exceptions of course. Diversity here is a joke. My high school was more diverse. This college does not let you live off campus until you are 20 years of age. The ""kitchens"" that are in some of the dorms actually do not exist. The laundry rooms are not good. The washers smell like mildew and often have hair in them. Also, there are about 4 washing machines and maybe 6 dryers for my entire building! Many college campuses also have a clinic that you can go to on campus to take care of basic health needs that college students may have. The clinic on CSU's campus does not exist. Try your luck at a local emergency room or urgent care instead; hopefully you can find a way to get there. The list goes on. Perhaps the only nice things would be the good professors that care and the time it takes to walk to class due to the small campus."
College Freshman,2,"The food in the cafeteria (or caf) is pretty bad. I'd suggest eating off campus if you can afford it.

."
College Freshman,2,"Late notices are a given, whether or not the debt is paid. Several times they have lost or misplaced crucial information."
College Freshman,2,"The dining hall has various benefits such as the soda fountain, ice cream machine, 24/7 cereal bar, and typically great salad bar. Our Fried Chicken Wednesday is honestly the only thing that keeps me eating there because it is the closest thing to home cooked you're ever going to get. The food is typically bland, without taste, and if there's any taste, it's typically bad. I suggest signing up for only 15 meals a week because you're bound to go else where to fill your stomach. I get my fill at Java City, for they have great coffee and treats."
College Freshman,2,"I have had the most trouble with the financial aid office. They are very slow. I've been dealing with them nonstop since I started, and I'm almost done with my second semester. Once they realized I needed things expedited so I could get my materials together to transfer schools, they slowed down even more."
College Junior,2,During the period that most Greek organizations are looking to recruit is about the only time I've seen them
College Freshman,2,The cafeteria food is horrible. I ate at Chickfila all the time.
College Freshman,2,There really isn't a party scene since Charleston Southern is a dry campus.
College Freshman,2,The financial aid office is very slow and not very helpful. I have signed papers twice to have my work study money deposited straight to my account and I am still receiving checks at my home two hours away from school.
College Freshman,2,Students either live on campus or commute. There isn't an in between.
College Freshman,2,"The Caf and Chickfila are your only options on campus. The Caf is poorly managed, and the food is almost always questionable. The pizza is good, and so is basically everything at breakfast. The hours are horrible because it doesn't stay open all day and the dinner hours end at 6:30. Chickfila is good,and you're provided with x amount of dining dollars whether you have a meal plan or not. They do not offer their full menu."
College Freshman,2,"CSU is a very safe and small campus. That being said we also have security which although is present is not very attentive as anyone can tell. Also there is no form of student health center and when one would ask about it they would be directed to a very close, but also at times expensive local health center."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life at CSU is not a big deal, it is not what one would generally think of as Greek. They are more clubs that wear matching T shirts on occasion."
College Junior,2,May be one party a year. Go somewhere else.
College Junior,2,Very strict rules and no kitchens
College Junior,2,"Being a Christian school, the administration is very strict about everything that takes place on campus. Students don't enjoy the strictness."
College Junior,2,"There isn't much room on our campus, and there isn't too many student activities going on throughout the school year with the exception of intramurals, the campus life isn't anything special."
College Junior,2,The internet is extremely slow unless you are using a library computer or are in the center of the library with a laptop.
College Freshman,2,"There isn't a lot to do at night on campus. Even so, fifteen minutes away is downtown Charleston. there is always something to do there."
College Junior,2,"There's a few fraternities and even few sororities. If Greek Life is a big thing you're looking for, this isn't the school for you. I wish there were more, especially Christian based ones, but it's a small school."
College Junior,2,"I didn't live on campus and I know it's bad. There's so many different things to do just to have a friend over in your dorm, and if it's of the opposite sex, forget about it. They're only allowed at certain times, on certain days, all doors have to be open, you can't have any blankets, and they aren't allowed to even sit on the edge of the bed."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The dorms were small and looked like a prison. Students would make the most of what they had but no kitchen, microwave, or oven are provided for students to cook and the overall scenery of the dorms is enough to make a student want to drop out."
College Freshman,2,The only transportation available is the public bus and it costs $1.75 to ride which is not worth it if you only need to go to the grocery store which is about 15 minutes away.  
College Sophomore,2,On weekends there are no students on campus. It is near downtown which is good and near the beach. 
College Freshman,2,They are just here to write tickets. They are old and slow.
College Sophomore,2,There's not many parks for the girls and we always have to find spots that's not close to the dorms after a certain time.
College Freshman,2,"Since I don't have a car for this year, I'm really sure what the cost is for a parking permit is for a car.  However, I do know that parking is a tough action because a lot of kids have cars that they don't really need and yet still complain in general.  It would be better if we would not get in trouble for parking on the grass when we have no other choice."
College Senior,2,There is always a big event in the Fall where the Greeks are signing up but that's all I see of them each year.
College Senior,2,"The dining halls, menus, variety, and value at CSU are all pretty good!  It's the hours that aren't appealing.  If you want a late night snack you're out of luck, everything on campus, including the coffee shop, closes down with the sun."
College Sophomore,2,"I really didn't socialize during my first year of school. The dress was like any other college in America, and the interests are mostly centered around Xbox nights in the lounges, and bible studies. I couldn't tell you much about the boys. The ones I encountered kind of got on my nerves because they were so busy living ""the college life"" and not attending classes, then whining about their grades. Xbox at 2am? Cookout at midnight? Skipping your 8 am class? Spare me. Go home, and save your parents/the government the $36,000 they are wasting so that you can be an idiot. So I spent most of my time in my dorm, or in the library. Mostly alone."
College Sophomore,2,Either you're black or you're white...
College Sophomore,2,It tends to rain pretty often and I have to walk for at least ten minutes in order to get from one class to another.
College Senior,2,"Parking is insane on campus. We have a lot of commuter students that attend Charleston Southern and it is barely enough space for them to park. There are more faculty parking spaces but they are not there majority of the time as students. The security guards love giving tickets to students. The parking decal cost $10 which is reasonable. Overall, get to school early to get a great parking spot."
College Freshman,2,"There is some diversity at Charleston Southern University. There are not many different religions at my school, mainly because it is a Baptist University. Majority of the students here are some form of Baptist, there are small amounts of Catholics, Lutherans, Jewish, and non denominational. As far as races the school is a little more diverse, we have predominantly African Americans. But we have a lot of white, Hispanic and foreign students."
College Junior,2,It rains alot here making campus dull at times because it close to the water.  The campus is overall good unless it rains randomly.
College Freshman,2,The food is sometimes okay but on the weekends they don't cook and they always have rice and no variety
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms are very small and cramped especially if you are put in a 3 person room.  There are no upperclassmen dorms so even as a senior you get the same dorms as the freshmen. Also student are not able to move off campus until they are 20, which stinks for students with late birthdays and students who graduated high school early."
College Junior,2,"Ok, the football team is not very good. So far this year they havent won any games at all. I personally dont go to the games because none of them are at night. The reason for this is because there is a senior living facility behind the stadium and wont allow stadium lights to be on at night ""bothering"" the seniors. The baseball team is awesome and the softball team is pretty good too. The other sports im not quite sure of because I really dont got to any games."
College Junior,2,Difficulty Getting Answers – My difficulty has been getting answers about using my secondary education degree for a middle school teaching career.
College Freshman,2,I don't mind parking it is ok coukd be better. You have to arrive early from vacation in order to get a good spot. If you a  good spot it is hard to find another one close. You don't have to drive to your classes only if you live off campaus then the parking is horrible you have to get there early
College Junior,2,"There are many different ehtnicities and cultures that attend Charleston Southern University at the student level but, there are no black or other type of color any teaching position. There are black security guards but no administrators or professors. It is hard to teach students about the world of business if they can only teach from one point of view."
College Junior,2,"You Will Become Broke – The food costs way to much for the small portions,"
College Freshman,2,"Process Can Be Way Better – Financial aid here is not as great, its too much of hassle especially when paperwork come up missing."
College Freshman,2,"It's Alright – I am a commuter student myself and spend about 30 dollars bi weekly getting to school. I see a bus for carta but I wouldn't imagine this school is an easy trek for people who live in Mount Pleasant, IOP, James Island or anywhere else that isn't around the summerville area."
College Freshman,2,Awesome School – This school is very diverse but the tuition is a bit steep which does weed out a majority of middle to lower class students from applying.
College Junior,2,The financial aid process was a little tough because they made me feel like they didn't want to help me get the aid I needed. When I have a question they always result to go online instead of telling me what I need to know and do.
College Junior,2,The Pros and Cons – Some of the professors at CSU help the students to achieve thier goals and to help them pass the class while others just expect the student to just know the material coming into the class and expect them to pick up on the topic with ease. I feel that the professors should tailor their teaching styles to the student's learning styles in order to allow the students to become more sucessful in the course rather than making the process easier for themselves. The registration process is fairly easy but the financial advisors sometimes take forever to return your calls or just to give you any feedback on your account. As the student I shouldn't have to chase behind someone just to get a small piece of information when its your job as my financial advisor to make sure I get the information when I call for it especially when there is a change to my account.
College Sophomore,2,"Punishments Are Harsh – Living on a Christian campus, there are more rules than a regualr campus. The punishments however sometimes do not match the deed that was done. Most every offense will get you suspended off the campus because they try to uphold a Christian environment."
College Sophomore,2,Good for the Most Part – the weather is good for the most part very warm weather.....but when it gets close to december threw febuary somtimes the weather is really cold........to the point where it's hard to get to class
College Freshman,2,"I understand why you give special privilege to the upper-class women residents, however most of them are not on campus that much or they live completely off-campus. Besides there isn't even enough ""special parking"" for the upper-class women so some of them never get there anyway. The guys dorms don't have special parking; Why should the girls?"
College Freshman,2,"School Spirit – There just isn't much school spirit throughout the entire year. I think there is an attempt to bring in the spirit but more often than not, it's a failed attempt."
College Sophomore,2,"Since Charleston Southern is a Southern Baptist college it does have some rules that some may see as ridiculous. Girls and guys are not allowed in each other's dorms except for during specific times and even then doors must be open and lights must be on. That seems to be the rule that most people dislike the most. CSU is also pretty strict on alcohol and drugs. Students sign a letter during registration their first semester saying they won't drink or do drugs, even if they are of age, on or off campus. The punishments for these actions can be pretty harsh if caught in violation, but it's really not all that hard to abide by the rules."
College Freshman,2,"Not Good at All – There are three options for food on campus. There is the cafeteria which is always pretty gross and unhealthy. There is also Edwards Express which is good to just run in and grab something to take with you, but it's not that great. Then there is Java City, which is just a cafe that has coffee and sandwiches. Java City is good, but it's not included in the meal plan."
Senior,1,"Do not come to this school. Do. Not. The students are incredibly cliquish. If you don’t find yourself in a social group, you are not welcome. The professors are generally good but the rules placed on students offer an EXTREMELY sheltered college experience. If you are looking to find the wonderful college experience of your dreams: DO NOT COME HERE. I am a Presbyterian christian through and through and i think this school is more concerned with money than anything else. Do yourself a favor. Stay in away."
Alum,1,"This is as superficial a school as they come. They push Christianity as a front.  The administration is much more concerned with your money than anything else.  They provide subpar housing. I have lived in rooms rampant with leaks and black mold.  The food has been served raw at times.  If you’re a commuter then this may be a good option for you but otherwise, save yourself years of misery.  Go somewhere else."
Freshman,1,"Eh! There's a reason why the enrollment here is so low. The academics here are pretty good and the cafe food is alright I guess, but that's about it. As for the location, the university is not even in Charleston it's in North Charleston but it's closer to goose creek and Ladson than anywhere else. The campus life sucks horribly! The dorms, especially the quads, are disgusting!! The bathrooms are horrible, which you have to share with four other people, the rooms are terribly small and they try to fit three people into a room, and there are literally spiders everywhere. The res life here is very very very strict and annoying and will check your room regularly and if things are not perfect you  get a ticket. There aren't any open house hours and you can never have anyone of the opposite sex near your room ever, Family member or not! This school is definitely not worth the money they charge. Any intelligent person would take their chances somewhere else. Honestly!"
College Junior,1,"I just think the nursing process is extremely hard when it comes to registering.  The other majors can just register for classes.Nurses can't, we have to have a meeting where we draw from a hat and an advisor helps register us.  That needs to be stopped.  I wonder if MUSC students have to do this?"
Recent Alumnus,1,A very boring experience with limited options for fun.  It makes it very easy to study for academics.
Recent Alumnus,1,Greek life is almost non existent and I wouldn't know where to go to even pledge for a fraternity if I wanted to.
College Freshman,1,"Honestly, all that this school is concerned with is religion. There is no push to grow academically. All of the classes are an absolute joke, except for the required Christian studies ones, of course! Those are taken extra seriously. You'll meet one or two professors that actually seem to care about what they do, the rest are obviously just along for the ride. I am so excited to transfer and get out of this place."
College Freshman,1,I feel as if I'm still in high school.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Our campus was too strict but I guess that is what you get for going to a private christian institution. We were a dry campus which didn't allow any tobacco or alcohol for anyone even if they were of age. Also, members of the opposite sex were not allowed in one another's rooms. If any one of these rules were to be broken the student or students would receive a ridiculous fine and/or be expelled."
Recent Alumnus,1,The school didn't provide off campus housing. Most students stayed off campus by their own means or they stayed with their families. Other than that students stayed on campus because it was cheaper and more convenient.
College Sophomore,1,The food is awful. There is not a large variety and what is there is poor quality. 
College Freshman,1,Our security is extremely strict. Underage drinking and drug use is completely forbidden and is cause for expulsion.
College Sophomore,1,The weather can never Mae up its mind. You'll walk outside in the morning and it'll be cold by the time your first class is over its hot. Also it'll start pouring rain out the blue.
College Freshman,1,Public transportation is available but the campus is small and I will be bringing my bike!
College Sophomore,1,"Fried chicken wednesdays are okay but don't expect much on the weekend, especially if the football or basketball team is out of town!"
College Freshman,1,There are plenty of 18-and-older clubs they just close way to early.
College Freshman,1,Charleston Southern University does not offer much night life on campus. There are not many social events nor is there any parties. Charleston Southern is a dry campus so any drinking activities must be help off campus. The closest bars and clubs are downtown Charleston which is a good 25 minuets away. Charleston Southern is not the best place to attend if you are big on night life.
College Freshman,1,Greek life is almost non existent at Charleston Southern University. There are a few sororities and two frats. Majority of campus activities are through Christian based clubs or groups. The school has a lot of fun activities with out Greek life.
College Junior,1,Everyone sees everyone as one person not different people.
College Junior,1,Parking was terriblr for me when I was an underclassmen. I worked kinda late and when I would get back to campus all of the womens parking would be full so I would have to park at the guys dorms on the opposite side ofthe campus. Now that I am an upper classmen the ease of finding parking is great because upperclassmen have the first four rows to thesmelves and underclassmen cant park there.  I gave a D because my car was recently stolen off the campus along with 3 others. I now keep a wheel lock on my new car and walk outside to check on it periodically.

Sophomore,5,"Everyone is always really nice and willing to help. Although it's hard to get used to college and what activities you're able to do. I feel like there's a big range of opportunities for everyone from music, theater, sports, science, art, or even just relaxing enjoying all the parent-free time."
Sophomore,5,The dean of students is amazing and helped me through my first year. I was scared and you learn so many great things not only academically but socially.
Sophomore,5,The faculty is amazing and helpful. The professors are amazing. There are so many people that work there that care about us and want us to succeed
Sophomore,5,"An amazing school.  As a smaller school, it is what you make of it.  Its is so easy to fine your community and make connections with professors, they are always available.  As an athlete, the community is so supportive of each other.  If that isn't your scene, the beauty of Manhattanville is our diverse range of programs.  We also boast a great preforming arts/music program.  Campus is small and you may see the same people a lot, but the school offers a free and frequent shuttle into New York city if you need to get away.  Proximity to the city is also a huge benefit for jobs and internships.  Some may complain about access to social activities, but as mentioned before it is what you make of it.  Resources are available, especially through the athletic alumni network.  As a two sport athlete and double major, I love it here."
Graduate Student,5,"Manhattanville is more than just a school, it's a community. With a plethora of amazing classes and professors it was a no-brainer that I get my Masters here!"
Freshman,5,"I can’t wait to start my freshman year 
I have a 3 because I don’t know how my experience will be. All I know is that the people there are very helpful every time I called for any help they were there for me. Sometimes as a new kid on the nick you have concerns and questions but the staff here made it smooth for me. I appreciate all of them and I hope this continues. Not only now but for my next 4 years"
Niche User,5,manhattanville college has been a weird experience for me and the people I know. we have had encounters with some different people that you wouldn't usually see everyday. a lot of religious people go there and also the professors are a bit strange.
Junior,5,My major is sociology. I love Manhattanville because of the class sizes. I love this school because of its beauty. I love all the clubs on campus. I love all the professors. My friends are like my family.
Junior,5,"Great professors, nice student body, great value for the money. Safe and lovely location in Westchester.  Easy access to NYC and cultural landmarks"
Junior,5,"Manhattanville College has a diverse and welcoming community, with a rich history in social action. The faculty and staff are committed to the enrichment of their students and are well-versed in their specific fields."
Niche User,5,"A gem! with top-notch professors/faculty on par with any  Ivy League. The array of majors--traditional and not-so-traditional--is impressive. The campus is beautiful, from the manicured grounds to The Castle. The college sponsors parties, concerts and other fun events throughout the year. As a Manhattanville student, you are near to New York City, Connecticut, Westchester County Airport, and White Plains. A talented chef oversees the dining hall, preparing great food that is also healthy.  If your child wants to ""party"" and waste their time and your money, this may not be the school for him or her.  And, ""no,"" this review was not written by the school, but rather by a very impressed parent with very high standards."
Alum,5,"Incredibly diverse community, beautiful campus, brilliant and engaging teachers who were always easy to reach and eager to share, top notch food compared to many other schools. I'm very proud of how our Mville community has evolved over the years."
Freshman,5,Manhattanville is a wonderful place to get an education. There are always awesome opportunities to further our education here such as extra trips and activities both at the college and provided outside of the college.
Freshman,5,"I love everything about this college. The professors and students are very welcoming. It is very hard for you to fail. The classes are in between, hard and easy. The campus is so beautiful. Also, it is very peaceful on campus day and night."
Senior,5,"Manhattanville is a private, liberal arts college located near White Plains, NY. It is special because it contains a unique castle that is the main centerpiece of the campus. The school is on the smaller side in size, which makes connecting to other students and faculty much easier due to the small class sizes. I would personally recommend this school to people who want this kind of personal interaction with professors and classmates. Because you know your teachers so well, you feel comfortable asking questions or just participating in general. There are students that come from all over the country, and many international students as well. Overall, it's a school with a beautiful campus and a tight community."
Freshman,5,"I made new friends to know much about them, who are international and different culture. I liked the programs to do service and clubs activity. I hope that Manhattanville will be my memory of enjoying in college and making the community into better place."
College Sophomore,5,Manhattanville has a very diverse campus where everyone could feel comfortable at
College Junior,5,"Personally, love this school. From, the professors to the close commute to the city, this college has everything I need to succeed. I have done my fair share of college shopping, and no college felt more open and welcoming. The communications program which I am majoring in has internships and major based classes that will help you acquire skills both on and off-campus. If I had a do-over for picking my college process, I would choose Manhattanville again and again."
College Freshman,5,It is a very diverse school.
College Freshman,5,SUPER diverse here like no ones from the same country
College Freshman,5,"I feel very safe on campus! I feel that maybe other colleges around the world may have a few many issues involving with safety but I feel with our college we don't necessarily need to worry like crazy about it, because it's not really any kind of issue at our college."
College Junior,5,The campus is very diverse
College Junior,5,Campus safety is great on campus! Always there to help!
College Junior,5,The professors are absolutely amazing. They are all very helpful and great. The classroom sizes are not huge they are a comfortable size. Activities on campus are very nice & everyone becomes sociable.
College Student,5,"I really cannot say enough good things about this school. The professors really get to know the students and care about how we do. The internships and experience I have had will lead me to succeed in my career. At Manhattanville, students are individuals, not numbers. NYC is fun to visit and just a train ride away. I went to a Broadway show with my class! On the other hand, I did not want to live in the city and wanted a campus feel. The campus is gorgeous and I really like it in the fall."
College Freshman,5,"Love manhattanville so far, for all the reviews that complain..college is what you make of it. Manhattanville gives you opportunities and recourses and it is up to YOU to take advantage."
College Senior,5,"I love this school! First of, Manhattanville College is absolutely beautiful. THERE'S A CASTLE! The atmosphere is welcoming and the community is so diverse. This school has so many opportunities for students academically and career wise. All the departments work together to help students achieve their goals. The fact that my classes are small allows me to have the one on one time with a professor which helps me academically. I've come to realize that the professors here have a lot of experience in their field and also have connections where internships and networking are concerned.  

I would choose my school all over again due to the fact that I am having a great experience and couldn't imagine having it any other way."
Recent Alumnus,5,It is White Plains after all. This is the best thing about Manhattanville. It is honestly sad that this is the best thing about Manhattanville.
Recent Alumnus,5,"If you enjoy doing drugs and drinking alcohol then this will be paradise for you. You can get away with anything as long as you're not intentionally trying to get busted. There is a place literally outside my resident building some 20 ft away that is called the wall. Older generations have called it the hill. It is a rock bench that people sit on and smoke cigarettes and weed as well as drink and be social. People smoke weed there literally all day long. Even though the resident buildings are only 20 ft away from it no one cares or does anything to stop anyone from doing anything. There have only been a couple of times in my two years living here where campus saftey was called and they did absolutely nothing but ask us to be a little more quiet. As far as noise complaints go, do not expect campus saftey to follow through on anything. I've had a hall party outside of my dorm room going on for literally an hour at 1 a.m. on a thursday when I have class at 8 a.m. They come by, ask everyone to be quiet and then leave. I've only had one situation where I was close to being in trouble once for smoking weed outside of a resident building because someone called campus on us. They acted all tough and interrogating and made the whole group feel uncomfortable and overly unnecessary scared. If anything gets stolen or damaged they will not do anything. If someone breaks down your door while you're off campus and steals stuff from you're room it is still not their fault. If doing drugs over and over again to relieve yourself of the constant boredom is your thing at Manhattanville you will fit in great and be down 90% of your bank funds in 2 years. I you have an addiction to cigarettes like I once had and live in the building Tenney, RA's and RD's will tell you it is illegal to have tobacco in your room just sitting there not being smoked because they are a ""health promotion bulding"". Meanwhile I've seen the same RD who talked down to me smoke cigarettes 1 ft from the building."
College Freshman,5,They give a lot of Financial Aid and Scholarships at this school which most students have.
College Freshman,5,"I love the dorms on campus. All freshmen love spellman hall because you are around all of your friends and you don't have to walk between the suites like the upperclassman have to do. It's also great because the dorms are big, they have sinks in the room, closets and dressers which are nice, and also built into the wall with cabinets. The suites are super nice too because you have the option of having a single or a double in the suites style which is good for options. Founders is like spellman because its more of a dormitory living. There are also some houses on campus you can apply to live in as well."
College Freshman,5,Living between White Plains and NYC is awesome. Everyone goes out to the bars and parties in white plains just about every weekend. And during the day there is always stuff to do there. We also go to the city on some weekends and go to clubs and bars down there. There are also great places to eat and ALWAYS something to do with your friends. Going off campus is always fun and there is always something great to do. Its honestly a perfect location.
College Junior,5,24 hour security at gate and on campus
College Senior,5,Great academic reputation especially within the business programs.
College Senior,5,Amazing food at the PUB go there!
College Senior,5,"Great experience, great friends, great job."
College Senior,5,There are amazing opportunities in the NYC area for top ranked graduating students.
College Senior,5,"Great scholarships especially merit based or athletic based, everyone should apply."
College Senior,5,"Hot guys and girls are everywhere, easy to find but especially in class."
College Senior,5,No greek life exists yet.
College Senior,5,Health and safety is a priority on campus. Campus safety patrols the quads 24/7 and their are many emergency blue light machines around campus.
College Senior,5,Get involved in sports or intramurals on campus they are extremely popular and a great way to meet new people.
College Senior,5,"Most students live on campus, but if you are interested in off campus living their are plenty of opportunities available."
College Senior,5,"Campus housing could use a little updating, however that is in the plans for upcoming years. Student's can enjoy overall great living conditions."
College Senior,5,"Great night life area, in downtown purchase/white plains, also Bedford is close. If you are looking for massive house parties and fraternity parties this isn't the place, but the sports teams know how to have a good time."
College Senior,5,Not bad but as it is a small school if you want a massive variety of options you may want to swing into the local white plains area.
College Senior,5,Academics are rigorous but with determination and ample planning students can flourish. Also the campus' proximity to New York City lends itself for students to explore the plethora of opportunities.
College Senior,5,"Faculty and administration are extremely welcoming, for students who don't yet know what career paths to take, just spend some time with teachers who can share their real world experiences."
College Senior,5,"Great, small campus vibe. If you are looking for an enormous school this one is not for you. Alternatively Manhattanville is small and quaint, students are able to foster relationships with their teachers to grow and open the doors to countless career opportunities."
College Senior,5,"The administration strives to provide a great academic environment for the students on campus, there are countless organizations to join and career development opportunities."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Love it, classes were picked for me, perfect times which are in the morning. Very happy and encourage anybody thinking about Mville to do it!"
Recent Alumnus,5,"One of the most diverse schools out there, reperesented by 35 or more countries. Extremely diverse."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Gave me the best finnancial aid out of all the schools i applied to, very happy and pleased with the aid."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Campus security is always around, and there are an abundance of emergency phones around campus. The campus is very safe and has many people there to help you if your in need."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I am a freshman, but i love my courses so much. They picked my class times etc and its perfect. Class times are in the morning, and my professors are extremely nice. Classes aren't extremely difficult, they just require you to pay attention and put effort forth."
College Senior,5,Manhattanville is as diverse as diverse gets.
College Senior,5,I received a very generous scholarship and loan.
College Senior,5,"White Plains is about 5 minutes away which has pretty much everything you could ask for. Rye and Port Chester are also near by. Purchase itself is pretty dull, consisting of only mansions and neighboring SUNY Purchase."
College Senior,5,"The diversity on this campus is huge so it's hard to really describe everyone. There's the sports teams, the artsy people, the skater/rocker people, the international students, the dancers/actors, and a bunch of other cliques in between."
College Sophomore,5,One thing I love about mville is the fact that were a small community.  We look out for one another. We do not take the health or safety of our peers likely
Freshman,4,"Due to the Covid-19 pandemic I had to finish my freshman year attending courses online. As this was new to most teachers and students, I found teaching online to be pretty good. Even though I did miss the interaction with my friends and the campus itself, learning online wasn't nearly as bad as what I thought it would be."
Freshman,4,"My overall experience with Manhattanville College has been very good. I have enjoyed the college atmosphere on campus and meeting new people every day. Academically, Manhattanville is excellent with getting students on the right track for their future professions. Most of the professors I've experienced have been knowledgable and are always available whenever they are free to help."
Junior,4,Decent. The gen ed professors are a joke. My computer teacher struggled to login during online classes. However the prof in my major department are great and that's what I'm there for anyway.
Sophomore,4,"It is a nice community, but somewhat lacks academic rigor. The campus is small so everyone is connected, but there is limited amount of student activities. The gyming equipment are nice, cafeteria is about average"
Junior,4,Moving far away from home was not easy but Manhattanville made it very easy to make the adjustment. My peers are all so welcoming and friendly. Very happy with the decision to come across the country and attend school here.
Graduate Student,4,"Manhattanville College has a variety of majors for students to explore and activities for students to participate in and get to know the community. Classrooms are also small, so students have more access to professors both in and outside the classroom."
Senior,4,I like the fact that it is a small school but maybe a little too small. I also am not a fan of the no off campus housing or apartments on campus for upper class. I do like that it is close to so many things and they have a very competitive hockey program and an amazing coaching staff (women's) I think it is too diverse for my liking but others may like it a lot.  I don't like that wherever you go you have to pay to park.
Senior,4,"Manhattanville College is a small but very welcoming college. Throughout my four years there I learned a lot of things in my field. Professors are willing to help you if you ask. The only things I would change would be the food and the parking for commuters, many times it is difficult to find parking."
Freshman,4,"Food sucks for a vegan (only reason for star deduction) they have vegan options but they're occasionally mislabeled and not too tasty, incredibly diverse campus from the food to the people. There are always fun activities happening on campus even in the winter. The professors are great and they're (for the most part) super easy to contact and get to know especially since the campus is so small. The small campus might actually be my favorite part (in the winter at least) since all the buildings are so close there's minimal walking outside through the cold and you can also cut through buildings to avoid the cold. Also the athletics are a huge part of the campus and all the teams get together and its super easy to make friends. I'm not at all a party person and there's still plenty for me to do (other than study and do homework)."
Senior,4,"I've loved being at Manhattanville College, I have not only discovered what I love to do and where should I do it, but my possibilities have also been so much wider than any other since I have New York City only 30 minutes away from me,"
Sophomore,4,"I have made great friends and acquaintances in my short time here. I love the size of the campus and how easy it is to find your way around. I also always feel welcome on campus and in the classroom. Something that could improve is the quality of the food. Otherwise, everything else is pretty solid."
Sophomore,4,"It is a cute small school that is an easy 30 minute train ride away from New York city. It is a close community, when passing there is always a familiar face to say ""Hi"" to. Overall it is a fun school that you will love."
Senior,4,"The professors at Manhattanville are excellent. I studied in both the music and English departments and both sets of faculty were great. If you are looking for a small, close-knit liberal arts college on a beautiful campus, this is the place for you. We're close to White Plains too. There's a lot of campus activities to get involved with and everyone is super busy! It's a place you can really explore your options."
Junior,4,"Manhattanville is a place full of opportunities and potential for growth/development.  The campus is beautiful and there are a lot of fun events to attend. Academics are a very individual experience. It is small, but it has a nice feel; and individual growth and conneciton with professors."
Junior,4,"The college is great a lot of diversity ! Nothing seems to be really the issue, probably something to improve would be sometimes the organization of student accounts. Other than that its a great school."
Niche User,4,"Going to Manhattanville college, i enjoyed the campus and all alumni who greeted me. Its a really nice environment that i would like to surround myself around on a daily basis.  The teachers are nice and help you when you need it. you are able to be connected with teachers on personal levels. One thing ill change about Manhattanville is their sports. Not really a change but an add on. They lack a football team. I believe Manhattanville will be complete if a football team was present."
Alum,4,"Manhattanville was a comforting environment. Clean air, close community, well-maintained campus where you have the chance to meet just about everyone at anytime. The only con is the lack of diversity in teachers, since the college is a bit small."
Junior,4,"My experience at Manhattanville has been a great one! I’ve met some amazing people, such as professors and students. It’s here that I’ve managed to discover my passion for literature and creative writing. The people are lovely and the campus life is always fun!"
Sophomore,4,"I’ve had a really great time here at Manhattanville. I’ve most certainly found my home and it was really an easy adjustment. The school is small and I’ve really liked that because it has allowed me to create relationships with my professors and it has allowed them to get to know me as a person, not just as a student. It was really easy to get involved and make friends and find things I like to do. Sure it can get slow on the weekends, but college is all about what you make of it and if you put yourself out there and look for things to do, then you will have no problems!"
Senior,4,"Overall this was a good experience. The teachers actually care about your learning, the class sizes are an average of 15 students; the small class size allows one-on-one with teachers and keeps students from being looked over. The smaller classes also allow for class discussion and in class questions/ comments that further learning."
Junior,4,"my experience here is great with the education experience and there unique academic First Year Program, you will begin to make connections with some of the key people, programs, and services of the College.  By taking advantage of all that Manhattanville has to offer, you will have the opportunity to become fully involved members of our vibrant community."
Junior,4,"It's a very diverse campus, with several opportunities to grow as a student, challenging yourself and helping others."
Freshman,4,"Essentially, this school is very great at aiming a student towards their goals and purposing them in meaningful ways.  There are so many opportunities that it is almost impossible to not network oneself or make money on campus with work."
Senior,4,"My overall experience here at Manhattanville has been worth the wait.  I am a Music Major, and a soon to be graduating Senior. As a college senior, I partake in much of a diverse environment, which helps me gain and attain responsibility and devotion, towards all that I do.This form of diversity allows my individual self to explore much of what if offered, and much of what I have done independently. I have been able to explore options in Interning outside of College, for an organization that is dealt with my field of study, Music. Here at Manhattaville, I have gained confidence and moral support in all the professors and faculty I have worked within both academics and Music. I'd hope that the future might hold more opportunities for the Music Department, Opera and Voice, specifically. This will help and enhance future musicians' qualities and experiences for future lead roles."
Senior,4,Teachers are very willing to help. Course load s are diverse helping students create the best path and majors to apply for.  Communication between my professors was top notch.
Niche User,4,the campus was beautiful and big and the faculty was very nice and helpful. the people who spoke were very informative and it was overall a great experience.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are very open to questions and are accommodating to all of their students
College Sophomore,4,The career center works with all students looking to find a job
College Sophomore,4,security does a great job at protecting the campus and making sure all of the students are safe.  If there is ever a problem they take care of it right away with no issues
College Junior,4,I love to run at the gym and work out during the week and over the weekend. The facilities are clean and there are always people there so I don't feel unsafe.
College Sophomore,4,Most students play sports and support all of the teams.
College Sophomore,4,Manhattanville is a diverse community and offers a lot to you as students.
College Freshman,4,I think the professors are great but some areas of study need more options for students. Not a lot of work but you will also be challeneged.
College Freshman,4,I've heard that a lot of students haven't had trouble finding jobs and internships. The coperations around the area will hire people. The school is near NYC so there are a lot of options there. Alumni also help out with finding work and the services here also help.
College Freshman,4,I really like this school however I'm going to transfer because I want a better sociology program and a school with more school spirit.
College Freshman,4,The health center is great and security is very friendly. I wish guests can stay longer though like other schools. I feel very safe on this campus and there is a blue light system.
College Freshman,4,I wish the school had more school spirit.
College Sophomore,4,"The facilities are really good and the teams play pretty well. What is not that good is the school spirit, there should be more people attending the games, other than that everything is great."
College Sophomore,4,"What makes the school unique is the diversity, there's a chance for every person to join a group or club to know people. You never feel left out, there's not much cliques also."
College Freshman,4,"Professors are the best part, good people."
College Freshman,4,There are numerous opportunities for internships and jobs! The Center for Career Development office really does a great job with aiding students with work-study opportunities and internships/jobs.
College Freshman,4,"Haven't thought to look for a job on campus, but the career center does a great job putting the word out there for other students if they are looking for a job on-campus."
College Freshman,4,"I think were have great athletics at the school, unfortunately I could not continue Cross Country at college but in the future when I have a car and things are less crazy I would definitely join the Track Team at my college because it's really fun and is something I miss. As for school spirit many students attend the events, it's quite lively and there's a lot of fan support."
College Freshman,4,"Mville's best community I would say runs within the English, Music and Art Departments. Most of the professors are very helpful and do care about your education and future. So far as a commuter the first semester went very well- it is a bit hectic but if you balance out your job with school-work it can be manageable."
College Junior,4,There is a great variety of academics at Mville.
College Junior,4,I am not an alumni to answer these at the moment.
College Junior,4,I am not an athlete. But I have heard great things about the departments.
College Junior,4,"Manhattanville College is an overall amazing experience. The classrooms, professors, my on campus job, everything is a blessing."
College Sophomore,4,I really like being a part of the Manhattanville Community. I also really like the castle and the chapels on campus...it makes our campus very unique.
College Freshman,4,My high school was great. It was very family oriented in a way. They believed that all students and staff members were family once entering the school building and that is what made my high school experience welcoming and comfortable. That is something that made my high school unique.
College Junior,4,"My school is very diverse. It is small, however, each day I meet someone new."
College Sophomore,4,I haven't started school yet I move in August 21st. But honestly so far I love it everyone is so welcoming at the school. Beautiful campus.
College Freshman,4,Before i visted manhattanville College i didn't think it was going to be a great school for me because it wasn't my first choice. I had some issues with the office of financial aide because they took forever to process my package and i was unable to get student work study. Those are just the financial aspects. When i went to my new students orientation i was completely inlove with the welcoming energy of the staff and my orientation group was really fun. My orientation leader who was a student at manhattanville told me alittle more about the school and his experience which helped me decide if i really wanted to enroll. There were so many fun activities that the school planned out for new students and we were taken into an amusement park went on rides and it was the best time of my life around a school environment.
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy the small classes because I find I do well
College Junior,4,"I would certainly choose Manhattanville College for my advanced education again if given the option. The school is constructed of a great (although small) student body and supported by a strong, encouraging, friendly, and accepting community within the school that is further improved by the great staff and experienced teachers."
College Freshman,4,Make sure you go to Gyu-Kaku and noodle+
Recent Alumnus,4,"Athletic life is great for atheletes who want to play for a little known named school like Manhattanville. They offer a nice gym that is considerably far from the resident buildings and sits toward the edge of campus. Omly atheletes are allowed to use it. Non atheletes use the gym in the student center which is very lacking. Good to be an athelete if you already are one. If you have dreams of becoming one on the other hand, think again."
College Freshman,4,"In White Plains there are loads of dining options. Chipotle, Buffalo Wild Wings, Panera, Ben & Jerry's, Friday's are just a few in the area. There's something for every diner to enjoy, and for every price range. A visiter could have cheap Chipotle or Panera or expensive sushi or Italian. Despite this variety, very few of the restaurants in the area offer student discounts, which does suck. However, most students only go out to end once in awhile to splurge with friends, it's not something we feel we have to do."
College Freshman,4,"My mother works at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut, and she is part of a tuition exchange program. Manhattanville is part of that program, so I only paid for boarding this year, which was great. I did receive the highest scholarship, which was also great."
College Freshman,4,"I personally really like the food. I am not a picky person and so I can always find something to eat somewhere. I love the main cafeteria, I always find healthy options and that the staff are helpful and accommodating. The food in the Pub I generally avoid unless I want a premade salad or sandwich. Prices are somewhat reasonable, though I hardly ever spend my own money on food. I like the three swipe a day meal plan, I find it works well for me and If I get hungry I have snacks in my room to eat. The Brownson Cafe is handy and always good for a quick breakfast, I think it's great that it's in the building and opens so early."
Sophomore,2,The professor were very nice and as helpful as they could be with the change but i feltlike a lot of the in-person was being thrown onto us. There wasn't much of and effort to make things easier and must of the time I was just given an assignment and told to hand it in by 11:59 so there waasn'tm such learning just way more stressing.
Freshman,2,"There were a few things that made the experience tolerable, friends and outside food. The overall experience I had personally sucked mainly because of 3 reasons. 1) the school made a “mistake” and took my lunch pass to each, so I wasn’t able to eat for a good 2 weeks or 3. 2) the dorms were okay but there were things that they should’ve fixed but didn’t. 3) the food is repetitive literally."
Niche User,2,"I’m sorry but this school is really tough to attend. I transferred freshman year but this school made it easy. I was an athlete there and even being on a sports team didn’t help. I tried really hard to stay here but I couldn’t. You can’t go out and party unless you have a real New York ID or you’re 21. So for the first 3 years you really can’t do anything on the weekends. Everyone is depressed here and the athletics is very bad. It is weird if you go to a sports game which is not how college should be. Everyone is so unfriendly and not open to making new friends. If you like to stay inside -study and do nothing everyday, this is the school for you.Trust me!"
Freshman,2,"The administration here does not treat the students well at all. This school covers up rape and sexual assault and then blames the victim. Many of the professors are rude, unprofessional, and discriminatory. However, there are several good professors who are genuinely good at their jobs. There are few events on campus, but there are several buses into white plains and NYC weekly."
Freshman,2,This is a good college but it lacks a lot and I think that adds to their very low endowment. I know a lot of kids who want to transfer out and I am as well. This school is also very easy but just know when coming here your not going to get the best college experience and you're going to pay way to much.
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of people like to go out and party but there are people who enjoy just hanging out around campus, White Plains, or NYC"
College Freshman,2,If you have a fake ID then you can go to the bars in White Plains. People go into the city also and there are small parties in rooms. People also do smoke a lot and some drink.
College Freshman,2,People party in there rooms or go into city or White Plains. There not much of a party scene at this school. People do smoke a lot and drink even though the freshman dorm is a dry dorm. If you have a fake ID then you can get into the bars in White Plains.
College Sophomore,2,"Most professors are really passionate about what they teach but I also had my share of teachers who couldn't care less and wouldn't even bother to come on time. No one cares about the Art or Science departments, its all about business majors. Yet, not even people who take business are career-oriented given that most of them are athletes who only care about sports even if they suck at them.

Financial aid is good, and location is good too because its so close to New York. But the school itself kinda sucks."
College Sophomore,2,"By far the most dissapointing college experience. Literally no one is career- oriented in this school. The school spirit sucks, yet the athletes only seem to care about sports and not at all about college itself. There's also a lot of cliques, and most people who came here are only because they didn't want to go too far away to college. People are very close minded and there are only a few clubs that one can join to be an active part of the student body. However, there is a kind of elitism in all of the dance groups on campus (which are not even that good). There isn't a lot of international diversity, most international students are from DR, Puerto Rico and Canada for some reason. Also, the Art Department sucks too.


Nevertheless, this school gives great financial aid and scholarships which is practically why people come here in the first place."
College Freshman,2,"Overpriced, Student body is immature, Gross inside buildings, and to be honest just a mistake of a school."
College Sophomore,2,They are never organized and they mess up a  few times on numbers
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you do not play a sport or do drugs you won't fit in. People come and go here so often that if you make a friend they will likely be gone by the next year. You can't blame them. This school was a huge dissapointment for me. I'll look back on my ""college years"" and remember how lame it was. Living here is atrocious compared to living at home in High School. The food is awful and repetitive. I've been here two years and the food hasn't changed even a little bit. I do not know how people make it four years here without being intoxicated the whole time and addicted to drugs. Seriously this school is not worth it. If you're looking for that college experience you heard about or seen in media and movies this is not it. If I could go back in time I would have commuted to a closer school, save so much money, and be a lot happier. I've wasted two years of my life here. I should have gotten out after the first year when I had the chance. I am glad I am making the right decision now. I am happy I got to experience everything I thought I needed to living at college, but to me, I could have learned these things in a different fashion in a much more worthwhile way. At least I will never have to wonder. If you're reading my review please take heed of my warning as I came to this exact site and read reviews and still chose to come here. I made this review to save you! So please make the right choice. I hope this review has impacted at least one of you and saved your life. Good luck and if you choose to come here don't say I didn't warn you!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"As far as courses and professors go, it is mostly good. I've had probably 2 or 3 professors out of 20 that I considerably did not like and I am the kind of person who can see the best in people. Unfortunately in terms of getting in the class you need / want it is an awful process and good luck with that. You will have to survive the 4 years here to get a good pick on your schedule. If not in your senior year, prepare to pull out your hair. I'd only go to this school for the education, and even at that it is just average. You're better going to a bigger school with more course offerings and better schedule timings than a small school with a super strict, hard to get into classes system like this one."
Recent Alumnus,2,Off campus housing via the school is not even a fully functional thing as of 2015 of May that I am writing this. I know there are plans in the works but the availability that they are planning is so little your chances of getting it is absolutely impossible. If you try to rent an apartment on your own be prepared to take out a loan because White Plains is not an affordable location whatsoever.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Food here is not pleasent. In the beginning you will likely thing it is very easy to live on this food for a semester. Think again. The Pub is the take out place. You will only enjoy the food dependin on when you go. You could get lucky and get the batch of food that has been freshly cooked and prepared, or you could get unlucky and get the food that has been sitting there all day that feels wrong when you hold it in your hands and worse when it goes in your mouth. The staff do not speak good english and if you try to ask for anything that isn't simple they will give you a hard tims. For example, if you prefer they toast the bun prior to placing your desired food on it they will look at you like you have two heads. I had someone literally drop the lettuce tongs on the floor infront of me, place them back in the lettuce, and ask if I wanted lettuce. That is how much they care about your health and saftey. The Cafteria is your best bet. Prepare to be a loner and seen as a loser if you go by yourself. The Pizza and Pasta station is the only thing edible. Whatever they cook monday and don't use you will see again the next day. For example, they had hash browns monday, then you see them awkwardly on the side on tuesday, and never to be seen again until friday. Breakfeast ends at 11:35 a.m. If you get in line at 11:30 a.m. and wait in line, get your food, and swipe at 11:35 a.m. you are forced to use your lunch swipe. You will not be allowed to swipe again until 4:35p.m. Once you do not use a swipe, it is gone forever. Other schools let you hold onto the swipe you ""lost"" and use it again no matter the time. Manhattanville doesn't. Why? Because Manhattanville is not a school, it is a business. Eating off campus is like a god send but good luck affording White Plains expensive delivery service. On the weekends you have only two swipes. Brunch and dinner. Prisoners get three meals a day. Manhattanville on the weekend you get two meals a day of food that will make you sick."
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you come to Manhattanville as a freshman you will live in Spellman Hall. You will likely have decent space and a sink in your room. Unfortunately, my freshman year I was given a room half the size of the average room people were given and we didn't have a sink. You will share a bathroom with your whole floor. The third floor had disgusting bathrooms people trashed constantly and only had one bathroom stall with a working lock on it known as the poop stall. I use poop for lack of a better word. It only gets worse as you progress. The housing lottery system is awful. It takes place only one day during the last couple weeks of classes. You will likely have to skip class and wait in line and hear people yelling numbers. You will need someone who is a junior or senior to have a shot at getting a six person suite or live in a dingle ( a room meant for one person but two people live in it) with a shared a bathroom connecting you and your neighbors. Both situations are awful. I share a bathroom with five other people. We have black mold in our shower. No one cleans anything. There is hair all over the sinks among nails and puke. If you live in the dingles in founders you will have bunk beds. If you live in tenney or dammon you will have six man suites. The space gets tighter than what it was at Spellman. You are so close to your roomate when sleeping a simple iPhone backlight when surfing the web or texting will irritate the other person trying to sleep. If you're good at sleeping 2 feet away from someone you just met with a snoring problem then maybe you'll be alright here. The walls are all white and have stains on them including the ceilings. The outlets are always in places that are of the least convienent. Do not under any circumstances think that you will have consistent reliable internet for you to play any online video games or watch netflix. The internet constantly goes out throughout the day even in the lower peak hours like 7 a.m. Living here was the worst."
College Freshman,2,"The party scene here really sucks. If you don't have a fake iD, you're not going out on the weekends and you are stuck on campus getting drunk in a room with maybe three other people. The campus or club hosted parties are poorly attended, even the biggest parties on campus will get a small crowd. Essentially, if you don't have a fake id you're not doing much, and everyone else goes out and you're left behind. If you're ok with small dorm parties though, the suite buildings have parties hosted by friends or friends of friends. But if you don't know people with fakes to get your alcohol, you won't be draining. The party scene at manhattanville has not positive impact on students here, because there is not party scene."
College Freshman,2,"Spellman hall is a complete dump, and everybody alway breaks stuff so students are constantly charged for damages they didn't contribute to."
College Sophomore,2,"It's bad, anyone can come in and out of campus even if they dont go at Manhattanville."
Recent Alumnus,2,Anyone can drive in and say I have an appointment and drive through.
College Freshman,2,"One thing I have complained about is that our health center right now sucks, we only have a doctor on campus Tuesdays and Thursdays which I find super inconvenient. There is a walk-in that the bus takes you to, and other doctors near campus which is good, but can also be expensive and a huge hassle."
College Freshman,2,"As of now there is not greek life on the campus, but many students are trying to get it recognized so I'm sure within the next few years it will some how make its way onto campus hopefully."
Recent Alumnus,2,Not much around from what i can tell.
College Junior,2,They do not take noise complaints serious enough.
College Junior,2,"The grounds are not well kept. The school looks trashy, and there is drunk teenagers everywhere. Noise complaints are not taken seriously."
College Sophomore,2,Need more parking spaces. The spots fill up rather quickly
College Sophomore,2,I wish there were more buses running because relaying on one bus every hour on the half and hour and not guaranteed your going to get on is a pain in the ass. So it's much better if you have a car
College Freshman,2,Class has been cancelled a lot this winter. The school almost never plows or salts around campus. It's a total slip and slide.
College Junior,2,"Not a lot of parking spaces. Every year, depending whether the student is a commuter or resident must pay a parking fee. Recommend, to only pay the fee once and leave that sticker for all four years. Commuters:$50 Residents:$100 per year."
College Freshman,2,The valients schedule needs to be more flexible and more available at earlier times.
College Freshman,2,Its alright. I mean this is a 3d division school.
College Freshman,2,The percentage of guys at the school is very low and the percentage of cute and kind guys are high. There are alot of duche bags and their ugly. Only a handful of guys worth any time. Social life and relationships are bad because it seems like petty high school all over again.
College Freshman,2,It is pretty boring most of the time and the parties are empty with about five or more people just standing. I like to go to Suny purchase to party because its more fun
College Junior,2,They have limited our printing to an extreme
College Junior,2,everyone gets blamed for one persons wrong doing
College Junior,2,Food isnt flavorful and food is sold for so much more than in outside stores.
College Senior,2,It seems as though not many people are able to describe the academic process at Mville.
College Senior,2,"We only have about 4 to five computer labs and they tend to fill up relatively quick. In addition, not every computer has the same software. The worst part though is the printing system. It's just a burden to print something in the library. Things get lost very easily."
College Senior,2,"Most of the buildings are outdated and need to be redone. The only building that really has a sense of community is spellman which is where all freshmen live. None of the rooms have kitchens in them, even the apartment style buildings."
College Senior,2,When I first arrived to manhattanville it was a lot better. People would actually attend the parties. Now most of the parties are ghost towns
College Junior,2,They don't even have a doctor on campus everyday....that's dangerous. And they only have 1 EMT on campus at a time as well. 
College Sophomore,2,"The single and double dorms at Manhattanville in Spellman is so small that you feel like you're living in a closet. However, some of the quads are pretty big. There are not the prettiest and the bed are not the most comfy. It is not worth over $50,000 but you just have to make the best of it. Founders have the worst wifi and there seems to be mold whenever you move in to the dorms with connected bathrooms. As for Dammann and Tenney, their dorms are huge and I would totally live one of those buildings any time."
College Junior,2,"I received an unfair amount of financial aid. Even with what I was granted I still had to pay the school 10,000 dollars a year, out of pocket."
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is bi-polar. When it is hot, it's scalding. Then during winter it is constant rain, snow, and fog."
College Senior,2,"I did get generous financial aid from the school. However, they were terrible as a department. They supposedly received customer service training but it didn't seem like that went too far."
College Senior,2,Basically only in the library or macs in the student center. We used to have another lab but they got rid of it without saying anything. That was nice...
College Senior,2,The nightlife isn't great on campus. Some parties are held on campus. It is best for students to go to White Plains or to New York City.
College Freshman,2,Campus Safety does not do anything about the drug problem. The school is not very strict at all the RA's don't do anything even though the halls smell like weed.
College Freshman,2,Not that many choices. There isn't much to do around campus.
College Junior,2,"There is no such things as dorm parties. If you're underaged and get caught with liquor in your room you get documented. Second time, you meet with the dean of students. And a third offense you are usually kicked out of the school. Other offenses apply if you are an athlete or an international student, etc."
College Sophomore,2,Mville Sports – not very popular at all. Would be much better if it was more popular.
College Freshman,2,"I'm Living Here?! The dorms at Manhattanville College are not at the top of the pack. They need alot of work. Spellman hall where freshman live is constantly falling apart, and needs major improvement. We just had an entire floor full of asbeston removed in the past weeks and the same for Founders Hall. There are improvments being made but as of right now they are not as good as theyy should be."
College Freshman,2,"It is extremely easy to gain access to alcohol on this campus. If you know a friend who is old enough or has a fake ID, there are plenty of liquor stores in White Plains that are just a short drive away. Some stores in White Plains don't even card people. Every weekend you're bound to see people walking around the halls drunk. Spellman is a dry hall, but that doesn't stop anyone from drinking. There are always parties in Tenney and Damman. It doesn''t seem as if the RA's and staff are strict about this at all. From my experience I don't see much of the drug scene. Weed is really popular and I always smell it somewhere. I'm not sure about other harder drugs, but I'm sure they're there."
College Junior,2,"Better Have a Car – While there are public transportation options available, it is more convenient to have a car. The buses stop running early and taxis can be expensive depending on how far you're travelling."
College Freshman,2,"Cell Block – this is a ""commuter college"" so if you want a social life you better be over 21 or have a fake ID"
College Freshman,2,Alot of Rain – The weather here is actually really weird. Its usually grey and rainy. On the days when it's sunny it can be nice. But its also usually cold and when it snows we get a lot of it.
College Freshman,2,Not Worthy the Money – It really depends on what building you're in and what floor you're on. Certain floors have a reputation for being a party floor. A lot of the people are friendly but most of them drink at every possible opportunity so they get really loud and like running around ripping signs and breaking things. Manhattanville is also one of teh most expensive when it comes to paying for dorms and the rooms are definitely not worth what they are charging. The only upside is that they are really close to where classes are.
College Freshman,2,"Not Much to Choose from – There is not much to choose from on campus. Many people that attend here do not dress up, and are a part of the sports teams, so they are usually in athletic apparel. The campus is pretty boring, with no social life."
College Freshman,2,"Pretty Laid Back – Although I haven't had a negative run in with authority, from what I hear things are pretty lenient. Drinks and drugs are brought onto campus and used without much enforcement from campus safety. When it comes to visitors, I know people who have stayed over without being registered at all. Campus safety will help you out when called, but with the amount of things I see being gotten away with, I don't think they care much."
Junior,1,"Should have transferred when I had the chance. Nothing to do, lots of cliques and terrible people here. Classes for my major are boring, and i have lost my drive for my degree. Every year is a living nightmare here. The food is unstomachable, have hair in it, and is overpriced. Most professors are nice but really awful at teaching. I have never been more miserable in a school setting. When something bad happens here, they sweep it under the rug. The only good thing here is a nice campus. That is it. 0/10 would NEVER recommend. We are rated high up on the most miserable schools in America for a reason."
Freshman,1,"School is terrible rethink it before you Apply. Honestly, not worth the financial depth, you will regret it. The only thing worth in that school is the castle. All the money you pay in tuition you do not know where it goes. Literally, a community college is better than this school. The classroom are terrible. The dorms are horrible. They never have the equipments needed for classes. For example , if you'r a bio major like I was, they don't have the equipments needed for the course so they substitute. Honestly, like every other schools it varies from having good and bad professor. It just a mediocre school and its so small that everyone and their mothers will know your business. So be aware and rethink it before you attended. Thank God I transferred right away."
Works Here,1,"Very irresponsible colleagues, terrible working environment. Extremely unwelcoming atmosphere and no cohesiveness among departments. Really wish to work somewhere else."
College Junior,1,There is no Greek life on campus.
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek Life on campus or an equivalent.
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life
College Freshman,1,We don't have them and I wish the school did because then I think there would be more going on.
College Freshman,1,I made such a big mistake coming here. It is truly an awful school.
College Freshman,1,The dorms are disgusting and everyone just trashes them like we're in elementary school. RA's do nothing but hold stupid little events that no one goes to. I've had to deal with the stench of weed in my hall every day to the point where it made me sick and RAs did NOTHING. I also have to live across the worlds loudest neighbors who are up till 1am on a monday night screaming their heads off and again what do RAs do? NOTHING.
College Freshman,1,"Everyone sits around and praises the atheltic teams here to the point the athletes think they're gods amongst men, NEWSFLASH you play for a D3 dinky ass liberal arts college"
College Junior,1,"Manhattanville College was more of a High school. They like to say there is diversity but most of the students are from spanish speaking countries and they all stick together like a clique. There are many rich snobby students and some of the female staff that speak spanish, talk s*** behind or in front of your face. It is pretty obvious because of their face, body language. The food is very repetitive, a lot of the time cold and stale. It will also have you running to the bathroom. They cheat of out of your money at financial aid and more than half of the people that came in freshman year, has or will transfer out. I have already transferred out because it just horrible. The only good thing that i liked was the professors, they make the class fun and engaging. Also if you do not have a car, you are not leaving campus. There is a bus for white plains but there is nothing to do in white plains. Bars? not 21. The financial aid team is also very unorganized and confused, they gave me a refund then told me it was a mistake and that i had to repay the money because they made an error."
College Sophomore,1,Boring parties no one attends needs more popping parties
Recent Alumnus,1,There is no greek life. They are in the works of having greek life somewhere off campus which doesn't seem like it is going anywhere as it is just not practical for such a small school to have off campus greek life. Do not come here if you are hoping for greek life. This is not the school.
College Freshman,1,It's nearly impossible to find off-campus housing for a reasonable price.
College Freshman,1,"There aren't many choice to select from. There are tons of diners that serve the same stuff, however."
College Freshman,1,"Manhattanville College likes to tell parents that they take illegal drug use and underage drinking very seriously, but that's not the case at all. I know people who have smoked pot with campus security. Also, nobody takes the consequences of drugs seriously. They think it's all a game."
College Freshman,1,"Manhattanville College is one of those places that makes the ""more established"" families pay for their child's education, while they basically throw money at students who are ""not as established"". It doesn't matter if someone that comes from a secure financial background is more qualified/ deserving of a scholarship. Manhattanville College is a complete joke."
College Freshman,1,"Manhattanville College has an overpriced food program ($5,000 annually), few menu options, and serves old/ expired food that makes you super sick."
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life at Manhattanville.
College Sophomore,1,The worst when you don't have a car.
College Sophomore,1,The food is very unflavored. The food is also very overpriced.
Recent Alumnus,1,"For the amount of tuition they charge, the administrative offices really don't know what is going on with students, nor do they seem to care.  There are so many who don't even graduate on time because of mistakes made by administration.  This school is really not worth the money."
Recent Alumnus,1,They cram 1 semester into 5 weeks!  It is not effective.
Recent Alumnus,1,They cram 1 semesters worth of work into 5 weeks in the Jump Start Program.  It is not effective.
Recent Alumnus,1,"This schools hires ""professors"" 2 days before classes begins.  You experience this especially in programs such as the Jump Start Program.  Some professors aren't even qualified to teach graduate level classes."
Recent Alumnus,1,You don't need this school to help you find jobs at the lowest raked companies/schools.  You can find those on your own.  What they don't tell you is that unless you have connections you will be finding jobs in unsafe neighborhoods and poor performing schools.  They sell the Jump Start Program by claiming that 95% of their students find jobs.  They don't share with you how many actually like the jobs or how many lasted in the field or how little Manhattaville school does to support you.
College Junior,1,Everyone at this school is freaking weird.
College Junior,1,I need help financialy and the school just is not helping.
College Sophomore,1,Financial aid is the worst they are not helpful as they should be. You have one person working on our award letters. This is one department I hope they fix soon
College Junior,1,"Financial aid is completely incompetent and has almost no options for students in need.  Student Accounts is a pack of leeches that will suck you dry, and if you don't have money for them then you are barely even worth talking to."
College Freshman,1,"The wifi is horrible. In dorms, i can not even get any wifi"
College Sophomore,1,Needs more places where we can park our cars
College Sophomore,1,There's no off-campus housing there's no point of it
College Freshman,1,"Greek life just came to Mville this year. The school is small and no offense to the Greek students, but they are mostly the misfits who think they will be someone after joining. If you want to be somebody at Mville, you were recruited to play a sport there."
College Junior,1,They don't even let you really live off campus unless you pay here and there for the cost of living. it's a rip off to because they take away scholarship money....
College Sophomore,1,"There is almost no nightlife. The majority of the school hangout off campus at the bars and comes back around 3. For those who stay on campus you generally are stuck either drinking with a few friends, playing video games or being bored of doing homework."
College Junior,1,"The school is in a residential area, but I don't think there are many aparentments that are close and affordable."
College Freshman,1,"It is rare to find off campus housing in Purchase, which is mostly residential. If a student does find off campus housing, they will most likely be paying a ridiculous amount, as Purchase/Westchester is an affluent area, and is an expensive one at that."
College Freshman,1,"The drug scene at Manhattanville College is pretty prominent. Weed is very popular, and some students even experiment with ""harder"" drugs as well."
College Freshman,1,"Their is a lack of school spirit, the varsity sporting events aren't packed like a big university. There is no intramural sports that I am aware of, but I think that their should be. It's a good way to meet new people and something fun to do. I played sports in high school but I do not want to commit to any sports in college because I want to focus on school. Intramural sports would be nice."

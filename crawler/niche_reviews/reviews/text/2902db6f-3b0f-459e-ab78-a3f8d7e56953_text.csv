Graduate Student,5,"I have truly enjoyed my time at UALR. I've enjoyed the coursework along with the research opportunities. The seminars bring a variety of different professionals to speak to us, giving us insight and real world knowledge from an assortment of areas. They emphasize acceptance and diversity,  and the students think of themselves as a family and help and support each other. The campus is safe and well located."
Graduate Student,5,The education I received/ am receiving has been amazing. The professors I have learned from all had real world experience that they were able to leverage to help me get the foundational knowledge needed to start my career as a programmer.
Freshman,5,"Although we had to finish the semester online because of COVID, the teachers adapted pretty well. At first you could tell they were struggling with switching everything over, but once they did it was amazing."
Niche User,5,"The University of Arkansas at Little Rock is an amazing place to go to or visit. The campus is beautiful, the people are kind, and the professors are great. The college shares a campus with a high school and it is amazing to see the support the college students give the high school children. With the University of Arkansas at Little Rocks rigorous academic plan you'll be sure to graduate within 4 to 5 years with the mindset you need to go into your career."
Freshman,5,"Small town experience with a city availability. 
There are staff and students from everywhere.
Yet you really feel like you like you fit."
Freshman,5,"I visited UALR on the Discover Day and plan to attend in the fall of next year.  During my visit, I found everyone very friendly and helpful.  All the facilities were excellent and it seems like an terrific university to study at.  I really enjoyed the opportunity and it has me pumped up for attending next year."
Junior,5,I love ULAr . The teacher are hands on and I wouldn’t care anything. At this school u have access to the material needed. They also have a library on campus to have a quite study area. A living area that convenience to the study.
Sophomore,5,I have had a wonderful time since enrolling at this college. The instructors have all been very helpful and available if you need extra help. The library stays open really late so that if you don't have internet access at home you can stay late at the library doing your homework. They provide so many services to students that I never feel lost or as if I'm not getting the help I need. I recommend this school to everyone.
Senior,5,I think UALR has great professors that truly care about your education. They look for ways and opportunities to help the students grow and achieve their goals on and off campus.
Alum,5,A diverse university which exceeded my expectations and was the perfect match for me.  Since graduating in 2007 it has gotten even better. I will always recommend UALR!
Sophomore,5,"My first-year experience at UALR was amazing! In the year of 2018-2019, I met many different amazing people, it's a welcoming campus along with students and staff. The food is great, the scenery is breathe taking, everything about this institution is just perfect! If I were to change anything about this campus, it would probably be transportation, because some classes are too far away from each other and it's hard not to be just on time."
Niche User,5,Campus is beautiful and it's close to home.  I've heard from others that the professors are really good with their classes.
Junior,5,"The University of Arkansas at Little Rock is a great school for students to attend. The faculty and staff are of great assistance to students for all of the programs that are offered. The college offers a strong sense of community. They understand various circumstances that students are in. So, they are more than willing to work with each of their students."
Sophomore,5,So far I am enjoying my time enrolled here. The staff and teachers are all very helpful and make sure that I receive the aid I need.
Senior,5,I actually loved a lot of things about the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. One of them was the fact that my boss always work with me when it comes down to my sick mother. She always let me go and make sure that she is okay. I also love the tuition discount that has help me get through college due to fact that I pay out of pocket.
Niche User,5,"University of Arkansas at Little Rock is honestly the perfect fit for anyone. I like the friendly, safe environment feel they offer and how everything isn't far from each other. I plan on attending there in the fall of 2019 but, I've been there multiple times."
Alum,5,"I am returning as a post-Baccalaureate student. UALR is convenient and familiar. The staff, save a few, are not difficult and thrive on seeing their students succeed."
Niche User,5,"I love everything about the university ! The tours, campus, food and much more. I have visited University of Arkansas at Little Rock plenty of times? They have so many activities for seniors in high school. I want to attend that college because it is close to home. I also want to attend University of Arkansas at Little Rock because in my opinion it's the best college to attend in Little Rock for a business major. I want to major in business Management. I have spoke with plenty representatives at the university about business. The first time I visited the university was a prospective tour, it was two students giving me and my parent a tour, i fell in love with college after that. Another time i visited the college was discover day, they had fun activities, gave away scholarships and more.  I don't want anything to change about the college. I love it!"
Niche User,5,It's been a college that is welcoming and fits my future as an NP. I want to get my 4 year degree and BSN from this school. Then transfer because it doesn't have a Masters or PhD degree plan but besides that pretty good college.
Niche User,5,Staff is friendly and helpful and military friendly   Definitely worth at least visiting if not to go to school. Not too big of a campus and if you get lost the library is in the very middle of every thing
Senior,5,"The professors at UALR are very dedicated to helping students succeed. They find creative ways to make learning fun and exciting, and they do not mind taking time out of their hectic schedule to assist students in grasping course material that they may not fully comprehend. They are also very down to earth and understand that sometimes, situations arise in life that are out of a student's control and may temporarily affect their ability to perform at their best. They are willing to work with you so that you do not fall behind and are able to come out on top of your studies...whether you're attending on campus or online. Attending college at UALR is one of the best decisions that I've ever made."
Freshman,5,The student life is amazing and I feel very safe. They have a very diverse campus and everyone is so welcoming. I feel like I'm home when I'm at Ualr
Freshman,5,"My experience has been very positive. From my campus tour, placement testing, and all other pre starting activities we're all very positive and informative"
Graduate Student,5,UALR has become my home. The diversity and hospitality that the campus offers adds so much value to my education. The professors are dedicated to student success.

Sophomore,5,"The atmosphere on campus is welcoming. No matter your race, gender, or how you look or act you will always find somewhere to fit in and be your self. The university of Arkansas at Little Rock is like a second home and that's what I love the most about the school. The academics are good the student life is fun and you will have the best college experience all while living on a beautiful campus."
Freshman,5,They have great educational programs matched with a great support system geared to help students succeed.
Freshman,5,"I love the fact that its ""A home away from home"". It has a great nursing program and the professors seemed very loving and kind. Overall the campus areas are easy to find and very organized. Its a very magnificent university."
Junior,5,Great small school with good connections in the community. It has become more diverse and offers good opportunities to get more hands on education
Sophomore,5,I overall have enjoyed my experience at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock thus far. I enjoy the student to faculty radios and I also enjoyed the on campus dorms.
Niche User,5,"the whole environment felt like home, the people there were very friendly & helpful. the courses they offer are amazing I can’t wait to attend this up coming fall."
Freshman,5,"I go to the online eversity program through thr school and love it. It makes it easy for me to work full time, take care of my 2 year old and not forget about myself and my needs in the process. They help you as much as they can to see you succeed."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely LOVE this place! The campus is beautiful and there is always something going on! The dorms are nice, the professors are helpful, and everything is always so clean and flexible."
Freshman,5,"I have only just started, however, my experience has been phenomenal so far! The staff and faculty have been incredibly helpful and flexible with helping me get everything ready to start school."
Freshman,5,"I love UALR ❤️. The environment and enthusiasm of every person there is delightful. There are so many things to do, and the campus is beautiful. I love going to UALR!"
Freshman,5,"Great university, great students, great teachers, great scholarships too. Lacking in medical field jobs...."
Freshman,5,I like that at University of Arkansas at LittleRock we are a family & how the professors here care about us and our education.
Freshman,5,My experience at UALR has been amazing. You meet new people and make new friends. I love UALR because the teachers here want to see you accomplish things and they will take their time out the day to help you. The only change I would want to see is probably the temperature in the classrooms either than that I would recommend UALR to everyone.
Junior,5,University of Arkansas at Little Rock is really a growing school. It is very diverse it offers many degree programs and opportunities.
Junior,5,"UA-LR is a fantastic school. The first thing that I loved is that the school has its own police force task team on campus. So you know that you are safe on campus, no matter what senario may come up. I am an English with Creative Writing focus major and I love how dedicated my professors have been to help me succeed. The school overall has been great. I was a transfer student from my local community college and my Admissions Advisor helped to make sure that majority of my credits  could transfer over to my major. I love my school and I am proud to represent myself as a Trojan for the rest of my career."
Sophomore,5,My experience so far at this school has been great. All the instructors I've had have been great. They don't mind helping and giving further assistance with home or class work.
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at UALR, is fairly  good. There a lot to school programs that anymore can get into and the students and staff are very friendly and caring."
Junior,5,"I really like my school. The professors really like to help their students when it comes to academics. The college is in a good location and is not in a bad neighborhood. UALR has really helped me grow and move forward in my education. I have learned so much while attending the school and is able to get help with anything I need. Good school to attend, great academics."
Freshman,5,"Being in a fraternity I would love for there to be a greek row on campus with all of the fraternities and sororities together. the saftey of the surrounding area is also a problem at u of a little rock, but other than that it is an amazing campus"
Freshman,5,"I love that the University of Arkansas has a very friendly and clean 
campus. If there is a problem, they do whatever they can to fix and make the environment better for everyone. There are lots of things to do and many ways to get involved around campus. I was very shy when I first came, UALR has gotten me out of my shell. I LOVE IT!"
Freshman,5,The UALR campus is beautiful and very open. I enjoy the smaller class rooms and helpful staff on campus. Great school!
Sophomore,5,"Academically, UALR is highly (some might say ""too"") underrated. The return on investment far outweighs any of the larger/more prominent state schools. It's nestled in the heart of central Arkansas, minutes from the downtown area. The professors are amazing and engaging too! We are not really a party school per se, nevertheless, Greek life does have a small presence on campus. Many local and national firms hire out of UALR too. As a business major, the College of Business has made it their goal to help me and all other students secure a job once graduated (an internship in the meantime). Being a part of the economic hub that is Little Rock, the opportunities to succeed are plenty - and being at UALR is extremely beneficial."
Niche User,5,"My overall Experience with University Of Arkansas is that I attended the
Orientation and Visitation on August 7, 2016. It was a very positive experience.The tour of the University and the campus was very
enriching for me. Meeting and talking with staff in the  American Sign 
 Language Department was a very educational experience and gain a
lot of knowledge learning from the culture of Deaf People in Arkansas.
 The whole day experience left me in awe wanting more information.
                                                                                               Karen R  Jack"
Graduate Student,5,UALR is a great school! The professors and staff are great people and very helpful. They have built several new buildings in the past decade and have centralized student services. They offer many online classes and have several accredited programs for students.
Senior,5,I am honored to say I am a student in the BBA program at UALR.  I love the diverstiy at this institution.  Many programs to choose from. The overall acceptance of students from all walks of life is admirable.
Freshman,5,The University is amazing. The dorms are really nice and so are the RAs. The campus is big and beautiful. They have everything you could need here form a commons market to a gym. The professors really care about you and what you need. 
College Sophomore,5,Since my degree will be in nursing and we have 2 teaching hospitals I think the recruitment is great.
College Sophomore,5,I am attending the Benton campus and it is amazing. The professors are very knowledgeable and teach accordingly.
College Sophomore,5,"Our athletics makes up most of campus life . We have every sport except football but we will be getting a team in a couple of years. and you would for sure know when it's game day . We have a Maroon Mob which consists of students who support the teams , we have one for every sport. I know we won plenty of games as well as championships. Our basketball team won the sun belt tournament back in April . Tv's were set up everywhere on campus so students can watch. UALR has wonderful school spirit. Whether we win or lose . We know they did there best."
College Freshman,5,"I love it, it feels like home."
College Freshman,5,"UALR has great school spirit and everyone is a fan to support our team. UALR's basketball team, Trojans, are well known for their competitiveness and winning-streaks."
College Sophomore,5,"I've yet to have a problem, I feel safe on campus its just the area directly outside of campus is a little scary don't like to be on certain streets or visit certain stores close to campus at night."
College Sophomore,5,"Pretty good, haven't had many problem so far, the only issue that I've seen so far is the fact that there aren't drains in dorm bathrooms when things have overflown the water has ended up in our rooms and that kind of disgusting and inconvenient. But other than that the housing janitors, RA's, and maintenance are excellent!"
College Sophomore,5,"Love, love, love Greek life, the Greeks make being in the cafeteria and going to certain events worthwhile, they're fun, welcoming, and devoted to their sorority/fraternity, and also they're big on recruiting so just seeing them around campus and talking to them will make you just want to become apart of them."
College Sophomore,5,"Absolutely love everything that the athletic department offers us students at UALR from our beautiful Jack Stephens Arena that we visit for basketball games, special ceremonies, and commencement ceremonies but also the gym and soccer/track field are also awesome additions for us non-athletes."
Graduate Student,4,"I have not been 100% happy with my experience taking online courses, but then I've only taken 2. I find that I do better when the teacher is in front of me to ask questions of. I have been told that the courses I have taught online were well thought of. I think that a stronger platform would improve matters."
Graduate Student,4,My overall experience with the University of Arkansas at Little Rock has been great. The instruction I received while at this University helped to prepare me for my present career as a programmer. I am very thankful to have had the opportunity to learn from so many intelligent instructors.
Junior,4,"The University of Arkansas at Little Rock has been a pleasant experience! Great price, great education, and great people!"
Junior,4,Many of my professors made the transition to online schooling very easy! They took a personal interest in making sure that I understood the material and was there when I didn't.
Freshman,4,"The University of Arkansas is overall a good school. I am a first time freshman and I have really enjoyed my first year. The teachers actually care about not only your success in their class, but also about your mental health."
Junior,4,"Best school for a transfer student. I never regretted my decision to come to ualr. I  recommend anyone coming to this school. As a student, you will learn so much and grow on this campus because of the cultural options and diversity."
Freshman,4,"I just finished my freshman year of college, and it's been good so far. I'm about to start nursing school this summer, and I'm very excited about that except for the fact that I'll be having to take my first nursing courses online due Covid-19."
Senior,4,Overall my experience at this University has been a good one. All of the professors that I've come in contact with are very dedicated to the success of their students and are very accommodating to any special circumstances students may have. The biggest and only problem I've faced is the lack of interaction from some professors in online courses. Since the personal aspect of the class isn't there I would like the professors to reach out and interact with the students more rather than just posting assignments.
Senior,4,I started school here in 2014 and I graduate in May 2020. The school offered me a scholarship that covers half of my tuition to help with payments and I was able to set up a payment plan to cover the rest.
Freshman,4,"Communication between departments can be lacking, but, honestly, my only complaint is that there's no ice cream in the cafeteria, which isn't that big of a deal."
Niche User,4,Good experience thus far. Campus could stand a lot of improvement. Non traditional returning students will feel at home here.
Junior,4,"So far the professors and students have all been very welcoming and helpful. The financial aid department could use quite a bit of work, however."
Senior,4,"University of Arkansas at Little Rock is a good school. They teach and also make it challenging for you so, that you are engaged. The teachers help when they can and everyone is very friendly. The bookstore is also pretty amazing. Their variety of stuff they have is fabulous. The one thing that needs a little help on the campus is diversity and making sure multiple cultures feel welcomed on the campus. Events need to be geared to all types of people and not just a specific section of people."
Junior,4,"I have attended the university of Arkansas for two years now. It has been a fun journey not only because of down time. It is mainly because the professors are willing to work with you when you need help. This is key to learning especially when you begin taking your upper level courses. The students are also willing to help ,and all these things create a great atmosphere for learning."
Sophomore,4,There are a lot of pros and cons when attending the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. We do have a high school campus on our college campus. During lunch time it'll be a lot of chaos from the high schoolers mixing in with the college crowd. They've finally taken care of this situation. I wish that most of the financial aid situations were taken care of with more pace. A lot of students were dropped from the university due to the lack of help from financial aid.
Junior,4,I like the aesthetic there. The natural look and feel. The workers are all very nice and helpful along with the people there. The professors are also very helpful working with the students on completing their work and preparing them for their careers. The one thing I would change would be the bathrooms. Maybe remodel them to look more pleasing.
Junior,4,"The University of Arkansas at Little Rock is an outstanding college. Being here at UA Little Rock has had its perks and challenges. I come from a very small town, so there are not many opportunities for me back home. This particular college is at the center of the capital of the state, so it is a booming and constantly changing city. There are other colleges in the Little Rock area, but UALR has been the most dominant in the region. Coming to the University of Little Rock has changed my life in many ways. There are several opportunities here at UA Little Rock, and you won’t be disappointed."
Freshman,4,I have loved my time so far at this University! It offers the college experience as well as a place to get a degree in the major that I want.
Niche User,4,I'm in a concurrent credit program and have been for a couple of years now. My online classes have been great so far.
Freshman,4,"The campus is not too big, not too small. I live close to the campus so I don’t live on campus.  The city is a little dangerous but campus activities are fun. I am a nursing major and they have a really good RN to BSN program, and it is not as competitive as other universities. Haven’t had any favorite professors, but the work load is a lot and you must stay focused!"
Senior,4,The courses or classes offered is very diverse but not much focus on health sciences which is obvious since it's mainky business and IT kind of college. I like the convenience in taking classes since it's close to home and online campus is great too.  Students can set up payment plan instead of having to pay full upfront.  The tuition keeps getting higher though.
Sophomore,4,The teachers are very interested in making sure that their students make it in their classes. There are good perks to going to school there. There is a gym and there is also a pool that all students can use. The bookstore has all of the needs for success in school.
Sophomore,4,"I chose this school because they offer both Spanish and American Sign Language programs. It has very good foreign language programs that help you practice outside of class. Its great that they have lots of nontraditional students and commuters, so I never felt out of place."
Senior,4,"I have really enjoyed the years I have spent at this university learning from my amazing professors. The school offers a great network to meet other professionals and get involved with the local community, yet I wish that students were more active on campus. I spent time leading several campus organizations, and student participation was difficult. Overall, I’m glad to have had the opportunity to study here!"
Niche User,4,"University of Arkansas at Little Rock is a great school. There's lots of diversity and the students and staff are very welcoming there. There are only a few things  I would want them to consider changing. One the security, while I'm on campus I often feel very unsafe and uncertain whenever I walk alone. I feel like there should be more police patrolling and a number you could call to get a nearby officer to accompany you to your location. Another thing that can be fixed is their campus.  The campus isn't very appealing, adding some gardens or some fountains would beautify the campus greatly. Although the University of Arkansas at Little Rock isn't perfect, I still think it's a great school!"
Junior,4,A great place to learn with a great campus. The Computer Science degree is on the rise with great expectations.
Junior,4,I love most of my professors and classes it just the issue with scholarships and financial aid. UALR will drop you out if your classes if you don’t pay.
Junior,4,I love that I am actually able to learn and understand each subject taken. Each professor takes time to make sure you understand within the subject.
Sophomore,4,I love the diverse in the school. Everybody seemed to fit in and the teachers are very helpful. I also love how the campus is so big. I like how they have a building for every major .
Junior,4,"Love that we care more for education than sports. There is not a big party scene. People here are diverse and there is always something going on , on campus. We are small but good quality."
Sophomore,4,"Our party scene has gotten so much better, and there’s pretty much always something to do on the weekends (just look to the athletic teams). Campus is actually really beautiful and has the feeling of home. Food in the cafe is pretty average except for brunch on the weekends, and sub connections in the EIT building. The surrounding area is pretty lame when it come to night life, but downtown give many opportunities for pictures! Over all it’s a great school!"
Sophomore,4,So far I have had a good experience at UALR.  The atmosphere is nice and the academics are challenging.  You can learn quite a bit from the professors there and for the most part everyone seems to care and show empathy towards their students and everyone's individual situation.
Senior,4,"University of Arkansas at Little Rock has an amazing art department. Our professors are understanding and hardworking, and really just want to see students succeed. They have a state of the art Design building for all art majors and classes. Really great experience."
Niche User,4,"It was a nice campus, nice people, and a lot of things to do. Ualr is a very nice school. It may be a slight older building wise but, it doesn’t take away from ualr being a great school to attend"
Freshman,4,It’s just okay! The staff and teachers are nice but...it needs to change wall color of some building! The ground needs to be cleaned up (too much leaves falling) and it needs to plant some flower or grass to fill up soil!
Freshman,4,Its full of good people from all over the world. The place is well diverse and the people you meet are kind and unique in their own different way. its a colloge I recommend people to visit.
Freshman,4,"This school is a very great school!! At first I was iffy, but it grew on me. There are almost always events that are occurring on campus"
Freshman,4,"i have only been here a semester and i love it! its my home away from home! its very diverse , the professors and greaat. the people are very friendly"
Alum,4,"I liked that it was a commuter school, and I could live at home in order to take classes.  This saved my family money on housing bills and allowed me to utilize that money for tuition."
Freshman,4,I love it and all my professors. The only thing I would be parking. We need more parking and east hall need to be renovated.
Freshman,4,I love how the campus is not too big but also not too small. It makes it easy to get to classes and if you have questions after class you don’t have to worry about rushing and running around campus.
Senior,4,"I have had some pretty good teachers in my time here and I have had some pretty bad ones, but that is with any college. The campus is quite nice and they have high quality technology. They push their students to succeed here."
Senior,4,"Currently, I am a senior and I have been there for 5 years. Its a great and safe environment for students that do not want to be far away from home and live in the city. I am a non-traditional student as well so this school a great choice for those who are older with responsibilities wanting to go back to school for a brighter future."
Freshman,4,"All the staff is so helpful in getting you what you need. Even the student workers are helpful. Everyone on campus seems nice and like there is a friendly environment. I don't know much about the party scene as I'm not one to party but there are plenty of sororities and fraternities to choose from. I wish the local area was a bit better but there isn't much the college can do. Despite the local area, the college campus is very safe."
Sophomore,4,"Great to school if you're ready to learn. 
 Also the campus is close to many recreational things such as the park, or trail, or soccer field. 
EVEN The mall and the grocery store nothing is too far away. The faculty and staff is really caring and want to make sure you understand any and everything dealing with the school. They make sure you take advantage of all the FREE resources provided on campus. WHO DOESN'T LIKE FREE THINGS?! 

Its is VERY convenient  campus is basically in the middle of Arkansas that if you like to travel to different colleges in Arkansas."
Sophomore,4,I like the diversity and the people there and how there is more to do than what you think there is. A lot of good people and a good campus! Definitely like it!
Senior,4,University has a great campus. There are a lot of outdoor spaces and buildings are relatively close together which makes traveling from class to class a breeze. There are several food options and the Cafeteria food is actually extremely tasty with many options to choose from! The staff is great and the student life always has an event going on. Love this college!
Senior,4,"My experience at University of Arkansas at Little Rock has been better than I expected. The campus is beautiful, campus police is great, and the professors are very caring! They want to see the students succeed. One thing I would like to see change is more parking (free) for students!"
Freshman,4,"Loving my freshman year so far here! The campus is small,  but that is perfect for someone like me,  who would have trouble with distance at other colleges.  The food is very bland and okay tasting,  but the staff are so fun."
Freshman,4,"Although UALR is not located the best neighborhood, it offers so many opportunities. In my 1st month at UALR, I noticed how professional they are. Also, professors here have plenty of free time after class to have one on one discussions with their students. There are lots of groups at UALR that offer to help find internships and much more. UALR is located in the capital of Arkansas, so there are many job opportunities available after you've completed your study for your major. I would like for ther to be more activities to do on campus, but I enjoy attending UALR."
Junior,4,I love that the college is small enough so that everyone knows each other but it is big enough to have amazing professors from all over the world. What I do not like is the location because it is very unsafe. 
College Sophomore,4,We have an amazing Greek life on campus that are involved in community service.
College Sophomore,4,Team spirit is very visible on and off campus.
College Freshman,4,"This college turned out to be much better than I thought it would be. With a diverse environment close to home I feel comfortable, focused, and ready to learn. There are a few kinks like some rules more strict than other colleges but overall it's a great experience. I love it here and I feel like I can really evolve into the person that I am striving to be."
College Sophomore,4,It's been great so far
College Freshman,4,"For me, going to UALR is the best decision I could have made. I'm wanting to be a teacher so I've never expected much of an income after college. UALR worked with me to make college affordable and I have been so impressed by the professors and how much they care about me and my peers."
College Junior,4,The professors have always been helpful. The courses are interesting to say the least. Most o them are basic and some of the teachers are difficult. It depends on the teacher and the class.
College Junior,4,I wish it wasn't a gun free zone. I would like to be able to carry to protect myself. But the security guards are in every building and the campus is enclosed which makes me feel safe.
College Junior,4,"UALR isn't fancy, it's not the high end college you'd expect out of a ""college experience"", but it's close to home, it's convientent, the teachers are there for you, and it's the best college experience I could ask for."
College Junior,4,A lot of people to network with.
Senior,2,"The administration of UA Little Rock does not work to better the experience of the students. They have intentionally raised ""fees"" so that tuition and board stay the same price, allowing the school to make more money off of scholarships and grants. The school is very unsafe."
Freshman,2,"I like the educational setting of the university. However, as a college student, I should have a better college experience on campus if I pay all of this tuition. There should be better campus activities available for students to make it more enjoyable and less dreadful."
Senior,2,"There is a great deal of diversity on campus, and several places to go or participate in if one keeps up with their email newsletter. But cost is extremely steep for what you're getting out of this place, and housing is horrendous when you need to get on the wifi to complete assignments. They do not do a good enough job to remind regular students about sports games going on or plays from the theater majors either. Sodexo is still terrible but World of Wings has become the better alternative than the Trojan Grill that was before it. I'd advise not going here if only to save your money. Take a trade or learn firsthand from workshops. A highly stressful environment."
Junior,2,"I loved the small campus and small class sizes, but the university as a whole is only focused on the money that they can get from their students. Scholarship funding is being cut, clubs are losing funding, and the administration cares very little for their students. The wifi rarely works. Parking is a joke. The food is terrible and overpriced. It's also in a very poor part of Little Rock where crime is very high. The immediate area surrounding the campus is very dangerous."
Graduate Student,2,I would like to see improvements in all areas at the UALR campus especially in academics and safety of the campus.
Freshman,2,"When I first attended the University of Arkansas at Little rock I enjoyed it! Later as the semester went on, so did my experience. Most of my professors were very nice but I had one that was very rude. My experience with dorms was horrible, I did not like it at all! Also UALR had began to charge me for everything. I was charged for 3 parking tickets and I did not have a car neither did I have a parking permit. My experience was not so nice."
College Sophomore,2,Our school is located in a bad area. We have had shootings two streets away from our campus as well as robbery on campus . Security most of the time is never around . We have emergency locators in every area on the campus but couple of months we heard they do not work. I'm not sure if they have been fixed yet. I feel comfortable walking in a group than alone especially at night leaving the library. Crime usually happens not on campus but near it . Hopefully this year will be a better turn around.
College Freshman,2,"I go to UALR and I honestly think it's okay. I have to live at home because of my parents and have to go home right after classes end, so I don't necessarily like it. It's so boring to me and I won't/can't have any fun experiences. I want to transfer for the second semester and I need scholarship money for that."
College Sophomore,2,"I feel like it was complicated to understand, and they were always too busy to help you. If it weren't for family and friends I would have missed out on alot of financial aid."
College Sophomore,2,"It could be worse, but the food is nasty."
College Junior,2,"There aren't many options for food on campus, you have either taco bell, sub connection, or quiznos. The quiznos is almost always out of what you want, sub connection is decent but overpriced and taco bell is as good as any other taco bell. But it's better than eating in the cafe because even if there is good food being served in the cafe, it's expensive if you don't have a meal plan."
College Freshman,2,It bad finding out the last minute that you don't have enough financial aid to pay for school
College Freshman,2,Its no unity and the school is so diverse
Recent Alumnus,2,"Houses are cheap/affordable and spacious for students in the neighborhood surrounding UALR, but there are a couple problems.  The first being SAFETY!  Students are frequently robbed, mugged, beaten, and generally hassled throughout the semester when they walk around the outskirts or even on campus.  All you have to do is open the campus newspaper to read about the most recent assault on a student or professor.  That aside, the neighborhood is historic and beautiful (especially in the Fall, hence it's name Oak Forest) but students are discouraged from living off campus because the area feels unsafe.  Also, UALR instituted a new rule a couple years ago that all incoming Freshman must live on campus in new dorms that they recently built.  Students are not allowed to park in the surrounding neighborhood either, which creates an insular atmosphere that discourages interaction with the community.  In terms of cost and convenience, off-campus living at UALR could be really nice and affordable for students.  BUT.. safety if a concern."
College Freshman,2,Its like a prison at first but once you get use to it its not big deal. Just go with the flow.
College Junior,2,I don't believe the party scene has a good effect on the students experience. Mostly because I've heard there is always drinking and similar things. It's not a good reputation to have for parties.
College Junior,2,"Getting Financial aid through the school is almost impossible unless you take a Student Loan. The scholarships are difficult to win, even if you are over qualified for them."
College Junior,2,"I don't live on campus, but I have plenty of friends that do. They hate it, saying that there is always a smell of smoke or pot in the halls, even though there is a ""strict"" no smoking rule. I have no idea from personal experience though."
College Junior,2,I don't feel that the campus is strict enough on enforcing some of their rules.
College Sophomore,2,They don't really do anything.
College Freshman,2,"There was an instance where someone I knew had be caught smoking in his dorm room. Little to no action was taken then. When it happened again, still, nothing was done about it except have his paraphernalia taken away. However, when another friend of mine was caught smoking in his dorm room, he was kicked out of housing in three days and can not come back on campus for three years. This second student had much less on him and in his room than the first student. I'm just saying that the system is pretty messed up and backwards."
College Sophomore,2,Its is difficult and time consuming to get nearly anything accomplished with financial aid.
College Sophomore,2,Its not very important to the social atmosphere of the school.
College Sophomore,2,"There are very limited choices for on campus dining, which is why I bring my food and drinks when I need to."
College Junior,2,Every time I go into the cafeteria I have to go to the Taco Bell on campus because they have nothing. It all costs the same 8.50 but you don't get anything but mush if there is anything at all. 
College Sophomore,2,The parking involving anything with this school is lacking. I live with my parents so I don't really know much about housing. 
College Sophomore,2,"If I lived on campus, I wouldn't venture out after dark. The crime in this area is quite bad. I only have classes during the day, and even then it's still a tossup whether there will be trouble. "
College Junior,2,"Sometimes it seems like when you really need the financial aid advisers, no one can assist you."
College Junior,2,"The weather is the normal wishy-washy Arkansas weather, but when it rains it can get flooded in spots which isn't good for your shoes."
College Sophomore,2,It's all right lots of fast food.
College Sophomore,2,They up there safety just this year. But schools not located in the best of community's so off campus living wouldn't be anywhere close. But that's my opinion I like an hour away from my school.
College Freshman,2,"In the area the weather is up and down.  The spring and summer seasons are ok, but in the winter you must come prepared because the classrooms are cold as well."
College Sophomore,2,"The parking lots are too full and too far away.  Especially when its dark, its too dangerous"
College Sophomore,2,"The area is dangerous.   They need to upgrade their security system, because there is just too many crimes.  They also need to make more parking and stop having to make us walk so across campus for class.  Other than that, the teachers are pretty good."
College Junior,2,"The school is surrounded by your typical fast food spots, which gets pretty dull very quickly. But there are 2 or 3 hole-in-the-wall spots close to campus that serve some pretty good food for cheap. I suggest buying groceries and cooking though."
College Junior,2,"There is a lot of campus crime, mostly robberies. The campus is very open and very public. There are always non-students walking through. We had a kidnapping and murder last year, which spurred some positive change in the way of campus security, but tensions remain high. I know a lot of people on campus, so I feel safe."
College Senior,2,"Recently the university started accommodating other students rather than traditional students. I have applied for them and wasn't very successful, so I ventured out of the university for more options with scholarships."
College Junior,2,"You have a very narrow spectrum of culinary venues. As if that was not bad enough, the service is usually bad and no student discounts...."
College Junior,2,Parking is hard since its primarily a commuter school
College Junior,2,"Many people get mugged on and around our campus. Although security is at an all time high it is still a scary part of town. They do have trollies now to take you to the parking lot, but what is safer: walking in a bad neighborhood, or standing waiting for the trolley in a bad neighborhood?"
College Freshman,2,i dont really enjoy the quality of the food on occasions. and also I wish that there were more places to use your meal plan. more variety would be nice
College Junior,2,It is sometimes so difficult to get through the classes and the students are not supportive neither are mast of the professors. The criteria is really cut-throat. I graduated with an Associates degree in Nursing already and have not spoken to any of me peers from class even though we work at the same hospital. I would not recommend this program to anyone unless they are determined and have no other interests than finishing school. I was married and had three kids while attending this program.
College Senior,2,"Applying for the BFA program was not hard. I did feel like it was a bit of a joke. None of the faculty had any questions to ask me about my art and they hardly said anything. Getting in was easy, but it's the BFA, I feel like it should have been challenging. The school's overall admission process for the semester is a living hell until you get used to it. It's hard to get anyone who knows what they're doing or talking about. You're left on your own to figure it out for the most part. Nobody knows nothing."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I am rating this as a C, due to the fact I was a distance learning student, and the problems with blackboard and the over all structure of the classes were horrible. The professors provided much better coverage during class sessions than they did in online classes, this is not fair to the students that cannot make it to campus. The CJ department was very sketchy on providing help with classes, and any other registration issues."
College Sophomore,2,"Don't really hear of anything, but I'm a commuter..."
College Freshman,2,It will be more exciting staying on campus because of the activies we have on campus every other week.
College Senior,2,"Parking on campus can be hard. The parking spaces closer to the classes are hard to get because there are so few of them. The parking deck is easier to get parking in, but you have to pay one dollar to park and still have a decent walk to class. The free student parking is also nice, but is a very long walk to class. You have to arrive at least 30 minutes before you should to make sure you get parking, and maybe even earlier if you want to be able to park and then have enough time to make it to class."
College Junior,2,Not Many Labs – The labs we do have are very limited and usually packed with students.
Recent Alumnus,2,Health and Safety – They do have a Health and Safety department and issues are addressed as they arise. There are medical personnel on staff if needed
Recent Alumnus,2,"UALR is a decent campus. The cost of attendance is high and continuing to get higher. There are functions for students that make it more enjoyable, but overall it could be improved."
College Junior,2,I have met many nice and friendly people. and some that were not so nice
College Sophomore,2,Too Expensive – Just recently turned the off campus apartments to on campus
College Senior,2,"Off-Campus Lack of Housing – Although it has improved from when I attended 30 years ago, there is still not enough student housing available. Rental houses are pricey, and if they aren't, they are in bad neighborhoods. I'm lucky and have a friend who lives close by, or I would have to commute daily. There is even less housing for non-traditional students."
College Senior,2,Not Feeling Safe – Our security does not always have a strong presence and as a result there have been numerous robberies.  I personally had my car broken into twice while in the parking deck.  A young woman was kidnapped and murder in a parking lot across the street from campus.
College Senior,2,Hard to Get Any Help – I felt the financial aid office wanted to keep the money for themselves. They never offered suggestions on how I could find more scholarships.  They also never told me about the limits of pell grants and the academic challenge scholarships.
College Sophomore,2,Most of the dorms seem to be of average use and characteristics.  It is very different than when I went to Texas a&m.
College Sophomore,2,"Fast Food – For being in the middle of Little Rock, most of the options for off campus dining still resorts to fast food locations.  I wish there were more actual restaurants in the immediate area."
College Freshman,2,The computer labs at UALR are usually crowded at all times. There is not enough computers for the number of students at UALR.
College Junior,2,"It is a very diverse campus. But the majority of the people who are on campus are black. The majority of the clubs are focused on black people. But this makes sense because the area that surrounds the campus are almost all black families. There is good shopping close by at Park Plaza mall and Midtown, so this is a plus. Not in a very safe location overall. The zoo is close by, so another plus. Good food places in midtown area about a mile up the road. Area has potential."
College Freshman,2,"well i keep to myself at first so i avoid peer pressure all together... i made it through high school without giving into drugs and such..i know A LOT of people use, but visibility isn't much of an issue.."
Freshman,1,"This school is terrible. The academics are too easy, I'm not challenged. There is low student life and the sports are terrible. If you go here, expect to have no social life."
Junior,1,I have worked here and seen mold growing in the air conditioning and this campus is horrible. Worst ever
College Junior,1,missed deadlines. wasn't made aware of scholarships until the deadline was passed.
College Freshman,1,I have been a student here  for many years and they do not provide any extra food or gas discounts like other colleges do.
College Sophomore,1,"I don't party, but I see plenty of partiers on campus. It doesn't look like they ever leave to go to bars or anything. They all get their alcohol and bring it on campus! "
College Junior,1,"UALR is not in the best location, we are in the middle of the inner city. "
College Junior,1,"I will attest that our campus has multiple dining options, but our dining cafe is not the best. I myself am a vegetarian and I feel that we are overlooked when it comes to options. The vegetarian/vegan bar has two choices and the options that we do have are tasteless/flavorless and I will not eat them. I am reduced to eating cheese pizza everyday because I am required to buy a meal plan since I live on campus. I don't agree with this policy."
College Junior,1,"I have had a horrible time receiving financial aid. It's a hassle to deal with the people, on the phone or in person. If you intend on coming to UALR make sure you read the fine print of every scholarship or financial aid. They will tell you what you want to hear in order to get you to choose their school."
College Junior,1,"The parking is horrible. You really can only have any surety of finding a spot at the off-campus big lots parking lot, and it can take up to twenty minutes to reach your class from there. There are plenty of parking lots, but we are not allowed to use them nor purchase parking passes for them!! I see lots go all day long without even being half filled, but passes for those lots are not available for students."
College Sophomore,1,"The security is never around in the parking lot. As a prank, my friends told me they pulled the emergency alarm in the parking lot and over an hour later they decided to leave since no one ever came."
College Sophomore,1,You never know. It be cold one day hot the next. rain one day sunny the next
College Senior,1,"I am currently a senior in college and have yet to see campus police out and about.  There a multiple robberies on and around campus, not to mention a murder kidnapping case from last fall that is still unsolved. I think if campus police showed more presence, then less crime would be committed."
College Freshman,1,"The parking at UALR is ridiculous! You either have to pay every day, or not find a parking spot. I have people drop me off so I don't have to deal with the parking."
College Sophomore,1,Generally there is not much student confidence in security especially at night.. And crimes do occur regularly throughout the year
College Junior,1,Rains a Lot – Its always raining and the distance you have to walk to class is ridiculous. So by the time you get to class you are soaked.
College Junior,1,Below Average – Not many attractions and the attractions that are in place are very unsafe to be. especially at night. I feel unsafe walking to my car at night even at the school. I just try to stay out of that area unless I have classes.
College Sophomore,1,"Hardly Any – Public transportation sucks in Little Rock. If there is a system, it isn't very reliable."
College Sophomore,1,Trying to park as an off campus student is horrible.  You can't find parking unless you get there early or have to walk miles to get to class.
Recent Alumnus,1,As a non-traditional student at UALR..Greek life was non-existent in my eyes.
College Sophomore,1,"UALR is located on a important intersection, rather a previously important intersection that seperated the white and black neighborhoods prior to 1950. As a result all of the area up until that intersection is relativley safe, after this ""line"" however is considered the hood. The implications of which have resulted in a kidnap/murder of a girl in my history class just last semester. I also heard a report of some kids beating up a student who was walking to his car.  As a result i have take precautions where i park and what hours i take classes. There are emergency phones through out campus but did not see an increase in security as i would have liked to after the murder of the girl in my history class whos name i can not remeber at the moment."

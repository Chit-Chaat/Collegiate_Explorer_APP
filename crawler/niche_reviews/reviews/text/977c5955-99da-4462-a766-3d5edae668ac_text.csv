Sophomore,5,All my classes were online and all of my professors made it very easy to navigate through and find what assignments were due and when they were to be done. It made my life a lot easier and more organized knowing every week i knew what I had to do.
Sophomore,5,Tabor college welcomed me in since day one and made me feel at home instantly. Everyone is approachable and helpful and overall just good people. I don't see the need to really change anything. Teachers and staff hold all students accountable and ultimately get the best out of them. This is a fantastic school.
Sophomore,5,Very easy and straightforward when learning through Tabor College’s online resources. Didn’t have to many complications with it at all.
Sophomore,5,"Great environment and they make you feel like your family there. I feel like they made me fit right in with no doubts, especially it being a new change of scenery for me. Feel at home!"
Niche User,5,"I loved the community around Tabor, and all the friendly professors. There was always something to do on campus, such as freshman events, parties, sport events, and more. I loved the campus life."
Freshman,5,I love Tabor!! I am so thankful that I was recruited to go to this college! I have already made so many friends. My professors are all great and I feel like family here. I couldn't have asked for a better college!
Sophomore,5,"Love the community on campus. Great place to deepen your faith. I have grown so much as a student, individual and disciple since I have been here."
Senior,5,I love the atmosphere here. The people are great I can tell the professors care and Tabor really takes their faith seriously!
Junior,5,"I love the smaller community that pours into the students. People come here from all over the United States as well as from other countries, bringing their experiences with them to create a vibrant and inspiring college. Tabor has deep history in Kansas and that provides a lot of stability to the school. Alumni continue to return to campus and reminisce about their college stories. I have enjoyed every year at Tabor and look forward to my last year and the opportunities that I will get to participate in."
Alum,5,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Tabor College. A small Christian school affords so many opportunities and I was able to pursue both music and sports simultaneously. The area I most enjoyed was dorm life. I came from out of state and was matched with a girl who has been my best friend for the past 30 years. A Christian school also allowed me to grow in my relationship with God and see how He is a part of every aspect of life.
Sophomore,5,This is my second year at Tabor College and it has been a wonderful experience.  The faculty are outstanding.  The campus is a great place to learn and and become the person you want to be.
Senior,5,It's a small school compared to most but by far one of the most welcoming and friendly. Tabor is a Christ centered school and is very family oriented as well which is nice.
Freshman,5,Tabor has a great family atmosphere and a small home town feel.  I am just freshman but so far I like Tabor.  If you looking for a college to party this not it.
Sophomore,5,"It feels like home. There's no place I'd rather be. I love the community feel, I've made lasting friendships, the professors are amazing, and I love that you are able to have a personal connection with them considering the class sizes are so small. I can't wait to come back!"
Freshman,5,Being a student at Tabor has had a big impact on my life mentally and spiritually. Being able to have access to my professors outside of class and makes it easy to ask questions when I am confused about work or specific topics.
College Sophomore,5,The professors are great. They are very engaging and interactive with their students. They truly want the best for their students because they want them all to succeed in the long run. The class sizes are great because they are small enough for each professor to engage with each and every student. With the class sizes like this the professors can have more of a one on one experience with their students. In my opinion this is better than any other class size at a bigger university with approximately 500 students in one class.
College Sophomore,5,"Tabor College is very unique from other colleges or universities because of the atmosphere. The overall atmosphere is enlightening. Everyone on campus is very friendly and accepting. This being said, everyone seems like family."
College Freshman,5,Great freshman year!  The student life is fantastic!  The faculty and staff are supportive and accessible.  The community feels like family.
College Sophomore,5,"If you're a sports person, then this is for you."
College Sophomore,5,The program is great with wonderful professors.
Sophomore,4,"I love it at Tabor! It is a family based community that I have met so many friends. I play soccer there and the environment is great and I can’t wait to come back. I want to go back but the only problem is that I don’t have the money. It is a Christian school and I love it so much, but money is a big deal and this private college is too expensive for me to attend."
Sophomore,4,"Coming to a smaller school was unusual for me at first, but it quickly became my home. The faculty and students are very accepting of everyone, and the Christ centeredness is apparent in all aspects of campus/classroom life. The professors care about each student as a person and a learner and are always willing to do what it takes to help them achieve their lifetime goals."
Alum,4,"Tabor College was a great place for students who wish for a quiet, out-of-the way location to study and interact with likeminded people. Additionally, the atmosphere is pleasant for those who like to partake in religious activities."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy Tabor College due to its small town feel and community. I love that everyone on campus knows everyone. I made many friends since I have been at Tabor. I look forward to finishing my education at Tabor College. There are many great majors to chose from and a great support system at Tabor.
Sophomore,4,Tabor is a small school based on sports and religion. It has a very nice community and very supportive of the students.
Alum,4,I like how Tabor is family oriented. They are a Christian based school and they don't judge you from where you come from.
Junior,4,"This college is very small, no more than 600 students in all of the semesters that I have been here. This can be an advantage and disadvantage. The advantage is that you get a lot of one on one help from professors. Class sizes are usually 20 students. There are a few general education classes that have 40 but the more that you get into your degree the fewer people that you will have in your class. Another advantage to the small size is that as a student you are encouraged to keep yourself  busy with school activities, whether that be joining inter-mural sports or joining clubs and student boards. Some of the disadvantages though are that it is a small college in a small town which means that there is not much in the community to do. If you are wanting to do anything ""fun"" you have to drive 30 minutes to an hour away to the bigger cites.  In general though it is a perfect college for those who love to be involved in student activities and having small classes sizes."
College Sophomore,4,The value of getting a degree from Tabor College is tremendous because Tabor does not only help further a students education but it also helps further their faith with God.
College Sophomore,4,"Tabor College has a very safe environment. This being said, the campus crime rate is really low."
College Sophomore,4,Tabor College is predominantly student athletes. This school clearly is revolved around athletics. Most students and nearby residents come together to support their local school during season and cheer the athletes on. Everyone gets into the games and wear their tabor blue as school spirit. Some people even get a little more spirited than others and paint their faces.
College Freshman,4,"Almost every sports team here is quite dominant and they usually win conference and are ranked top-10 nationally.  The only reason I don't say it's the best is because despite the massive athletic success, the facilities are kind of subpar."
College Senior,4,"I have really enjoyed my school because of the Christian atmosphere that it provides. Although it is not perfect, (no college is), I am pleased with my decision because this was where God placed me. I have seen his faithfulness come through in so many ways. I couldn't be more thankful! I know that I will be prepared for my field after I graduate, and that the college experience will be one that I won't forget."
College Junior,4,"Tabor is very strict about attendance and while it is good to get students to go to class, it would be nice if I did not have to worry about getting a bad grade if I miss a couple days of class. The open hours are a headache because that takes away from the social part of college. I have friends that are guys and it is hard for us to hangout when the hours are so tight."
College Freshman,4,"There is a large variety of foods available, and the cafe is open throughout the day and evening.  A late-night option would be nice, however."
College Freshman,4,"The facilities are old, but they are clean and well-maintained.  The on-campus community is fantastic!"
College Freshman,4,"Tabor tries to have teams that can compete at a high level, considering our size.  Fan support is very big, as is alumni support."
College Freshman,4,"Guys and girls mix very well.  Some are looking for relationships, and some are just interested in having a lot of friends."
College Freshman,4,They really worked  hard to make sure I had the financial aid I needed.
College Sophomore,4,"Nice choice, though there could be more."
College Sophomore,4,Everything is pretty good here.
College Junior,4,I plan on having an internship because it is required for my major. I don't think it will be terribly difficult to find an internship.
College Junior,4,I enjoy the history program at Tabor. I would definitely do it again. I plan on pursuing my Masters and Doctorate so that I can teach as a college professor. Finding a college that needs a history professor may be difficult.
College Junior,4,"I am double majoring in History and Communications. The history department gives a hard workload without it being too much. The curriculum teaches a broad survey of history, both world and American. There are also great resources, such as, the library and the archives."
College Junior,4,The professors at Tabor are good at ensuring that students understand the information. They also have many opportunities to study abroad and take trips for credit.
College Sophomore,4,"I knew that I wanted to get into Physical Therapy school. Before I could do that, there were several classes I needed to pass. With this list of classes there were three majors that I could choose from; biology, athletic training, and psychology. My academic advisor helped me make the decision to major in biology. Her help made this process very easy."
College Sophomore,4,We feel very safe!!! There was an incident off campus at a town near us which resulted in the death of a Tabor football player. But for the most part we feel safe walking around our campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Tabor is a religious school, there isn't a large problem.  There are some people that do drink on occasion as there are at most schools. I do not participate in either and feel no pressure to do so either."
College Junior,4,"I took an internship in the environmental field. The pay was decent, although not excessive; housing was provided. I worked about 7 hours a day teaching reenacting and teaching regional and natural history."
College Freshman,4,"I am a part of Tabor College athletics, and I think that they are very considerate of student-athletes.  There are also great facilities, and the coaches are very considerate and caring."
College Senior,4,The printers can be a pain at times; but the computers are usually always working. The internet speed can be slow at times when everyone is trying to use the internet at once; but the college tries to keep the networks updated as best as they can.
College Sophomore,4,"Hillsboro gets a little shifty after dark, and theft is kind of a problem. Overall, though, I feel pretty safe on campus."
College Freshman,4,"The atmosphere of Hillsboro, KS is very unique. While some may complain about there not being much in the town, the attitude towards Tabor and their students is very positive. The community loves seeing Tabor students around town at restaurants, church, etc. They also are very involved in athletics. Hillsboro, KS is definitely a college town."
College Freshman,4,"Tabor has great Professors who really care about you. Student to prof ratio is 13-1. Not many schools can say that. While we have small class sizes, the programs are very up to date."
College Junior,4,"Small Classroom Settings – I love academics at Tabor College, because my professors challenge me.  My professors are always willing to help you succeed.  There is a small classroom setting which makes it great for class discussion and individual help."
College Junior,4,Very Safe – I feel completely safe on Tabor's campus and within the town.  It is a small and clean community.  I was never aware of very many crimes except some theft on the campus.  So keep your cars and doorm rooms locked.
College Junior,4,"It's a Uniquie Campus – Tabor has a wonderful atmosphere full of loving, caring, Christian people.  It is a small campus, but I love it because I can make friendships with a variety of people.  Student activities, atheltic events, and friendships is what makes Tabor a wonderful place to be.  There is a great teaching staff and you definitely get your money's worth learning all that you can!"
College Junior,4,Everyone Seems Pretty Good – There is all sorts of help on campus. You can get free tutoring and the teachers let you know they are always there for you.
College Freshman,4,"The facilities at Tabor are probably one of the nicest ones around. They have almost all new facilities and if the facilities are not within 5 years new, they are redone every once in a while and always kept clean. The student center is fairly old, but very nice and well kept. Tabor campus and buildings are never dirty or messy, they are very  nice and well kept."
College Freshman,4,"Computer Availability Is Great – The computers the college offer are very good! They have printers that allow you to print 500 pages a semester for free, and allow you over 12 hours of availability to the computers a day with 3 different computers labs that are accessible on campus. No owning a computer at Tabor is not much of an issue, because there are always computers available for students!"
College Freshman,4,"Everywhere Off-Campus Is Close – All the off-campus housing around Tabor is fairly close to the campus. Hilsboro isn't a very big town, therefore everything around here is fairly close. The school also does a very good job at helping students find off-campus housing. It also is not very expense when you have the school help you because sometimes you can live in a school sponsored house."
Sophomore,2,"While the community was okay....... the value was not. I paid way too much money for what I got at Tabor. Like I said, the community is great. You make a lot of new life-long friends and you build plenty of character in the middle of nowhere in Kansas."
Niche User,2,"Needs to have a health and wellness center on campus. There were no nurses or doctors on campus and no mental health professionals on campus. Colleges need those professionals to succeed. Also poor leadership and a lack of respect and care for the arts programs within the school. 
With more care for students' mental health, this school could thrive more than it does now."
College Freshman,2,"I've talked to many others who feel the same way as me.  And we all say that we like the athletics, but the college itself and everything else kind of sucks.  Almost every other day something is wrong in the dorms... the toilet doesn't flush, mold in the vents, etc.  I am transferring after this semester and so are many other people."
College Junior,2,"there are only like 6 places to chose from and none of them are very healthy. It is all fast food stuff that you can only eat so often when dieting. it is all decent in price, but that is because it is fast food. Little Pleasures is a nice place, but it is too expensive to visit very often."
College Junior,2,there are not a lot of places for people to go and have a fun time. This is a small town so the best places to go and have fun are outside the city. the party scene is not as positive for students because we are so sectioned off. People usually only hang out with the same people. There is not a lot of mixing or socializing. People don't like to participate in everything so it isn't as fun.
College Sophomore,2,There is not a lot to do when the sun goes down.
College Senior,2,no scholarships are available unless your church gives to you then the school will give some to you as well. Other than that there isn't much available for regular students that are not athletes or music/theatre
College Sophomore,2,There aren't any because the campus is so small. You can walk or ride your bike everywhere.
College Sophomore,2,There is no off-campus housing selection here because if you are enrolled full time and not married you have to live on campus.
College Senior,2,About 3/4 of the student body is in some type of sports; and this puts pressure on those non-athletic people to try out just to fit in. Some sports are seen as more superior to some teachers than others also.
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you are on a sports team or know someone that is on one, other than that no type of nightlife is present"
College Junior,2,it is an extremely small campus with limited facilities
College Sophomore,2,"Race and Religion – I feel that there is a good mixture of ethnic diversity. I do, however, feel that some professors are races in the fact that many non-white student have difficulties passing classes. The reason for not passing or barely passing is because the teachers say they do not receive the students assignments, yet the students have proof of turning them in. I also feel that if a student is not of a christian faith, being that the school is Christ centered, other students/faculty look down on them."
Freshman,1,If you are a minority do not attend Tabor College . Some of the white people are scared to interact with people who don’t look like them . Most of the people who act like this are from that small/weird fake people town . Horrible stereotype people town .
Freshman,1,If you are a minority do not attend Tabor College . Some of the white people are scared to interact with people who don’t look like them . Most of the people who act like this are from that small/weird fake people town . Horrible stereotype people town .
Freshman,1,"This place is terrible. Don't come here unless you like getting served jail food every meal, rooms that are so old they're literally falling apart, items stolen constantly and classes that are considered remedial at any other school. The one good thing I will say about the school is the sports teams are good."
College Junior,1,"the only way to live off-campus is if you are a fifth year student, married, or over 23. That makes it impossible for a lot of students to live off-campus to try and save money. There are plenty of places to live off-campus, but I am not allowed to. It would be awesome if I could because I could save money. It would be worth it to pay monthly bills in order to save on housing arrangements."
College Sophomore,1,The options close to campus are very poor. We are limited to what we really want.
College Freshman,1,"Since Hillsboro is so small, there is no public transportation to any other town."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Doesn't Cater to a Diverse Population – As a private college, Tabor doesn't cater to or attract a very diverse group of students. Students who fall outside the expected religious affiliations or don't abide by the conduct code might expect some ""dirty looks."" that said, most every one can find someone who shares their views."
College Sophomore,1,"A student can ride their bike almost any where in Hillsboro. If they want to go to another city, however; they will need a car or find someone who will drive them. There is no public transportation here. Most of the students usually walk or ride their bikes if they are in town."

Freshman,5,"This is my first semester at Ohio Northern University.   I live on campus in one of the dorm rooms.   The college is attempting to maintain normal class schedules and extra curriculum activities as possible.   Some classes use a hybrid style - most of the time face to face with limited online work.   My professors are very helpful and knowledgeable.   I feel the truly want the student to learn and succeed.   My fellow classmates also help with the studying.   Getting together for study groups.
The marching band still practices and performs at school functions.   Although, no sports are being played presently.
My dorm is located away from the buildings holding my classes.  But the walk doesn't take long across the tundra.   The dorm rooms in my building are either male or female.   Two residents per room with their own bathroom.   The laundry room is located in the building next door.    
Overall, my first experience with college life is positive."

Alum,5,"If you want a party school pick BGSU/U.TOLEDO.

If you want an education you can't go wrong here. Engineering, Law,  Nursing, Pharmacy, Education, The Sciences...it is a wonderful professional institution...43 years out and going strong. Go Bears."
Freshman,5,"When I first came to ONU, I was expecting typical college life where people put their headphones in, hoodies up, and looked straight down as they walked past. Here, everyone says hello, people will hold the door open for you, and the overall atmosphere is so great. Even the professors are one of a kind and truly do their best for their students."
Sophomore,5,I love the beautiful campus it's my home I feel so safe there and I just love going there. If I had to go back and choose again I would pick onu over and over.
Freshman,5,"Professors are great, food is pretty good, only big issue is that the freshman dorms are tiny. New engineering building is fantastic."
Freshman,5,"First year student. Great atmosphere. Perfect fit for me. Small town, but bigger cities near by. Definitely worth a visit."
Freshman,5,"I love Ohio Northern! The atmosphere is so very welcome, I knew the first time I stepped on campus that this would be my home away from home.  The professors actually care about you and want to see you succeed.  The smaller class sizes make It easier to learn and the smaller campus makes it so much easier to make friends and get around.  I can't wait to spend a few more years here."
Niche User,5,I like how nice the community is and the campus has a comfortable environment. I recently went on a college visit and enjoyed my tour very much and i received plenty of information. I also like that at Ohio Northern they have a very high job placement rate once you graduate.
Niche User,5,"Ohio Northern is a small campus located in a small town of Ada, Ohio. Everyone there is very nice and help in any possible way they can. They encourage you to ask questions while visiting the school. They also have a very detailed tour and you are able to talk to people who major in the same field that you want to."
Sophomore,5,Ohio Northern has a beautiful campus that I always feel safe on.  The professors care about their students and provide everything they can to help a student succeed.  The professors are always willing to help their students in every way they can.
Niche User,5,"The new engineering building is amazing! I would not change anything as of now. In the future I might find things that I would like changed, but right now it is great."
Alum,5,"Some of the best experiences I’ve had in my life were here the past four years. I graduated from the Music program. You don’t really go here for the college life experience in a city, because it can be very quiet. It is a college town. But there can be quite to do on campus and it has some of the best and most caring professors I’ve ever met."
Niche User,5,I loved how kind and welcoming everyone was when I toured the university.  Financial Aid definitely wanted to make sure you knew that they wanted to help you get to the university if it was the one for you.
Sophomore,5,I love the fact that every time I step out of my room and walk through the campus I always see someone I know or I see people walking and laughing in groups. It has such a home away from home feeling that I just can’t get enough of and I wouldn’t choose anywhere else to attend for my degree. The friends I have made here are definitely going in be in my life for the long run and I will cherish them forever.
Freshman,5,The academics and science programs of a large school with the option for D3 athletics and a smaller campus.
Freshman,5,ONU is a wonderful school located in a small town. Staff is very helpful and always ensures that students not only pass their classes but strive and excel in their field.
Freshman,5,"Overall, my experience with Ohio Northern University thus far has been absolutely wonderful in all aspects. They are small enough to personalize for the students, yet big enough to be recognized as one of the better colleges in Ohio."
Alum,5,"Beautiful campus, easy to navigate, lots of fun events for students to attend.  Student-oriented and a wide variety of majors to choose from.  Their goal is your success."
Sophomore,5,"The atmosphere on this campus is unlike any other. The staff is very welcoming even if they may appear to be the typical grouchy old professor. Within your major there is plenty of communication and great support. There may be some issues with a smaller school, but I believe that Northern does a great job putting these down."
Niche User,5,I think it was great and nothing really needs to change. I think the food could get a little better and but other than that I think everything else there are perfect professors housing and people there all great and the surrounding area is great and it is local to me. I honestly don't know who wouldn't want to go here. So if your looking for a college definitely apply for ONU.
Senior,5,I liked the small campus and all the professors knew my name. My class size was around 10-20 which I truly enjoyed learning in a small atmosphere. I received strong internship and job opportunities that I believe I would not have received by attending another university.
Sophomore,5,"I love the opportunities that the school offers. I also take a lot from my classes, while they are challenging and require effort, the outcomes and what I can away from each class at the end of the semester is worth the effort."
Niche User,5,"Great experience as a prospective student athlete there. Good visits, lots of info, campus is great. Can't wait to start my academic career there in July."
Alum,5,Ohio Northern is the home to some of my best memories.  I have close friends that I met there that I keep close contact with.
Freshman,5,"ONU seems to be the perfect college for me to have chosen. It has a great engineering program, and lots of other groups and clubs to join. I’m on the wrestling team, and even though it keeps me very busy, it also gave me a group of people to hang out with and bond. Many of them are also engineers, so we have a lot of the same classes too. The professors here are also great, for the most part. They’re always willing to help and respond to emails you send them. The only bad part of ONU is the price, but if you put in the work in academics while in high school, the scholarships you can earn make up for it. I love being here at ONU, and I don’t think there’s any other college I’d want to be earning my undergrad at."
Graduate Student,5,Good for everything. I like that. I feel sogood to here. I want to money for studies here. I get something. I love here. I say truth.
Freshman,5,"Ohio Northern is great. The professors seem to genuinely care about my education (as an individual). They have open office hours and provide resources for the students to utilize. They are very helpful in answering questions. The athletics and facilities at ONU are amazing as well. Our sports teams win numerous conference championships across all sports every year and the facilities that they play in are top notch. The campus is not too big, as it is a small school, but it is wide open and breathtakingly beautiful."
Freshman,5,"Ohio Northern is a very prestiguous school full of opportunity. My experiences here so far have been greatly beneficial to my future already and have allowed me to start making numerous professional connections just 8 weeks into being here. The small community here makes everyone feel like family. The one-on-one time that you can get from your professors is extremely beneficial. Every professor cares about YOU succeeding. Every department is successful here and I do not know of many small town colleges that are strong in every single major. You'll even see plenty of furry creatures such as the squirrels, ducks, geese, and swans! Plus, chicken tenders from World of Wings Cafe. Nothing beats this small and diverse campus."
Sophomore,5,"Great campus, always something to do at ONU. Whether it be watch a football game or visit a career fair there is something for everyone."
Senior,5,"Ohio Northern University is a great place to grow as an individual. The academics are astounding and the majority of the professors really show they care about you. It is easy to get involved and build relationships on campus to aid your career path, and you will meet great people there. Although there is not much to do in Ada, you will build great friendships where you can find anything to do and will make fun on your own. It is an awesome experience."
Senior,5,Very close-knit University. Everyone knows everyone. The professors want you to succeed and do their best to offer as many resources as possible to help you get to your goals
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this school. Small classes, and professors know each student and are willing to help with anything, not just that class topic"
Niche User,5,"When I visited Ohio Northern University, I was in a program called HOBY Leadership a program that emphasizes the need to help the community. It was a fun experience and through that experience I also had a privilege to look around the university. The students there are proud of their school and it shows. They are enthusiastic and are helpful. Their campus is nice and presentable, they have nice lakes near the dorms and unique animals like the turkey vultures and swans. However what I find really appealing about Ohio Northern University is there engineering majors there. I know they're most recognized for there pharmaceutical program but I like there engineering programs the most. In my school we focus on technology and machine industry, so my teachers talk about this college a lot and how good they are. Also I seen how many programs they have there, it is overwhelming in my opinion but I'm still sticking with engineering."
Junior,5,"Overall I have had a thoroughly impressive experience at ONU. I feel close with my friends from class, clubs, Greek life, with my professors. I have been given countless opportunities to collaborate with students on my work, which is a perk other pharmacy students don't receive at competitive colleges. I am a leader in many organizations because of the small size of this campus and the many roles available. I know my resume will be very full when I leave, in addition to the number of positive social experiences I've had. Truly, ONU has some of the kindest people I've ever met."
Alum,5,"Ohio Northern University was a great experience. Firstly, they are committed to helping their students attend by providing extensive financial aid to those who need it. The professors are all very committed to the students, and do all they can to help you not only in class, but with anything you might need outside of class. There are many student organizations on campus, including religious groups, multicultural groups, academic groups, and even for fencing, video games, dance, and writing. The Student Planning Committee (SPC) is also committed to hosting at least one to two big event(s) each month. The campus is beautiful, and the facilities are great. As a student you have access to a lot of great technology and resources. It's also very safe. The format of ONU's degree requirements pushes for a well-rounded education, and guarantees that you will have opportunities to put your learning into practice, ensuring you will graduate with real-world experience."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel very confident that after receiving an education from ONU that I will be able to find many opportunities in my field of interest. They have been very helpful in every aspect of my education. I have been involved with the community, sports programs and social clubs as well as the great academic program ONU has to offer. I'm looking forward to my life after graduating knowing that I have the opportunity for a great start !"
College Sophomore,5,"I wanted to attend a small college because I am interested in an education not a ""party school"" and that is exactly what ONU offers. I enjoy meeting new friends who have the same interests as I do but also enjoy the diverse campus and meeting students of different cultures. I like the way the President of ONU is active and seen and well known by all. It's a very family friendly school. I have had an amazing first 4 years and am looking forward to finishing my educational experience at ONU."
College Freshman,5,"I love the friendly atmosphere and wonderful people. The classes are very good, and the professors really are there to help you. With free tutoring and writing help, there are many resources to help you succeed."
College Freshman,5,"The athletic facilities at this school are amazing, the athletes are great, and many people attend a majority of the athletic events."
College Freshman,5,"Ohio Northern has made my life so much better and I am only in my second semester.  This is my home away from home, the people here are the nicest people I have ever met and I have made friends from all over the world, including individuals from Japan, Costa Rica, Denmark, China, and Canada.  The professors here care about how you do in their courses, they will go the extra mile to make sure that you succeed.  I have no doubt that the education I am receiving here is going to give me the knowledge and the opportunities to easily get a job after I graduate in my field."
College Freshman,5,Super safe. I never feel like I'm in danger on campus
College Freshman,5,"It is a wonderful community and from the moment I stepped on campus for my first visit, I knew that ONU would be a perfect fit for me."
College Freshman,5,This is rural Ohio. People take safety to a whole new meaning. There is literally nothing here that could be considered a threat.
College Freshman,5,"companies from across the globe search for people who graduated from here. The career fairs are very profitable, and worth your time."
College Freshman,5,"I am not a part of any group in IFC, but I am a part of other frats, and all of the groups on campus do amazing things for the community and the world."
College Freshman,5,"It has been a wonderful experience so far. I have joined two different fraternities and am a part of religious life at ONU. Something that make my school unique is the ability to join so many organizations. I would choose here again because it is so close to home, the teachers honestly care, and the community is terrific!"
College Sophomore,5,I love being a polar bear! The atmosphere is wonderful! Even though it is a small campus in a small town there is always something to do. The professors are great and very helpful. The Alumni are very involved and love hearing what is currently happening on campus.
College Student,5,I am a sophomore at ONU and I love the college and campus. The smaller campus allows students to get to know each and their professors. The college provides challenging courses that are sure to challenge anyone. I am very happy with my decision to attend ONU.
College Student,5,I love already being in the pharmacy program.  I do not have to take the PCAT because of the direct entry program.  In six years I will be a Doctor of Pharmacy.  The workload increases each semester.  The teachers and professors are very good about making themselves available for help if needed.
College Student,5,There is currently a 100% job placement with Ohio Northern's Raabe College of Pharmacy.  Students can easily find internships and jobs.
College Student,5,"I love the Raabe College of Pharmacy! It is a direct entry program.  I will graduate in six years with a doctorate.  The professors and doctors are very nice and always willing to help.  Some are stronger than others though.  The workload is greater each semester.  The curriculum is set in stone, respectively, so you know what is coming.  There are plenty of lecture halls, classrooms, labs, and lounges to study.  The school helps with interning and rotations."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are fabulous, and there is a vast array of options for classes."
College Freshman,5,I love the small town atmosphere. However there aren't many grocery options within twenty minutes
College Freshman,5,"All off campus dining options are near enough to walk if motivated, have a great variety and easy access"
College Freshman,5,Everyone in attendance seems to be exceedingly friendly and open to making new friends. It's easy to meet people within your classes
College Freshman,5,There is a vast variety of students on campus. However since I have only been there for. Year I have not come into contact with everyone
Recent Alumnus,5,"Abundant opportunities,supportiv staff, individualized attention"
Recent Alumnus,5,Internship and international opportunities are available for students.  Faculty members truly maintain an open door policy.
College Sophomore,5,Everyone in the program is really dedicated to pharmacy and they really care about the students.  I would chose ONU again in a heartbeat because I know its one of the best.
Junior,4,"The classes and professors are both challenging and encouraging for the career path I have made. Though there is a lack of diversity that I would like to see be changed at the school, the school does support all students and their beliefs and lives."
Junior,4,The professors are very good at informing the students of upcoming assignments and projects they must do. The professors do have some trouble getting all of the information they want to teach across as clearly as possible and at times it is hard to ask questions because the information will be record and posted rather than live.
Sophomore,4,I took classes online for the remainder of semester due to COVID-19 and almost all professors were very helpful in the transition and allowed some leeway with assignments.
Freshman,4,"If you’re looking for a homey & close-knit college, ONU is for you. It is almost an extension of high school in some ways. Since it is D3, you can pretty much continue any sport or club you did in the past. But honestly, if you’re not coming for pharmacy, engineering, or law, look for somewhere cheaper!!"
Freshman,4,"Overall, the campus is great and the staff and faculty are awesome. The other students are pretty nice, and everyone is willing to help out. The community bathrooms in the dorms should be cleaned twice a week instead of once a week. Also, the roommate selection for first year students should be different. You should be able to view profiles and request a people as your roommates, instead of having to go random and possibly getting stuck with someone that doesn't match your personality well. Most of the professors are great at what they do and there are tons of tutoring resources available."
Sophomore,4,"Most of the professors here care very much about their students. Getting ahold of them outside of the classroom is pretty easy as well. There are plenty of clubs and organizations for students to get involved in. The only downside is the lack of food options the cafeteria has. There are options in the town, but you have to use your own money instead of meal swipes or points. The library has reasonable hours for students to be in there for, except it not opened 24/7."
Niche User,4,"I have visited this school twice, and fell in love with it more each time. I hope to enroll in fall of 2020. The campus is beautiful, and the visits were so personal. You could tell they truly wanted you to be there. Optimistic and very positive experiences."
Freshman,4,I love this school and all the people here. The worse part is the cost they give you a good amount of financial aid but you still end up paying a lot.
Freshman,4,I really enjoy the program I am in at Ohio Northern University. The size of the school is so great for connecting with professors and getting full use of their knowledge. Some things like the food and dorms could use updating.
Freshman,4,"The professors, academics and sports at this school are excellent. However, I would not recommend this school to anyone who can not see themselves adjusting or fitting into a very rural or small community."
Niche User,4,Overall they had great labs and a great community feel. One thing I would like to improve is the chapel because it is very small and out dated.
Freshman,4,The Professors at Ohio Northern University really do care about every individual that walks through their doors. The campus is beautiful and has an amazing small town feel. The campus offers many opportunities for its students to grow.
Freshman,4,"Students engage with knowledgeable and friendly professors.  Everyone is very kind and the community is small and close knit.  The university is known for its competitive Pharmacy program.  It is also planning on breaking ground for a new Engineering building soon.  The campus is picturesque with many trees.  There is a lot of open space.  The university has begun to make a commitment to sustainable energy and has three wind turbines at the edge of campus.  The university also houses its own observatory, perfect for viewing the dark sky.  Located in the village of Ada, security is never a huge issue.  However, there is little to do off campus as Ada is small.  Overall, the university is a great learning environment with most students graduating on time."
Sophomore,4,"Ohio Northern is a great place. I love the students, atmosphere, and overall education. We really need to work on student parking though."
Freshman,4,"Ohio Northern University is a great college.  After completing my first semester here I am very pleased with the college I have chosen to pursue my degree.  Overall, the professors expect a lot from students but it is only because they know you can handle/accomplish it.  One thing that is some what of a down side is how small the city of Ada is.  The campus is big and lovely but if you want to get off of campus for a while you might have to go to a bigger city (i.e.-Findlay, Lima, etc.).  This is a great college and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
Freshman,4,"I liked the school as a whole. The food was not as good as it could have been, but I like how they had holiday themes in the mac dining area. The material for pharmacy school was challenging but I pushed through it"
Freshman,4,"Great school if your not a party person and you're all about academics. Very safe and quiet environment. Although campus is small and town is also small, it's very beautiful"
Freshman,4,"While there are a few things that are slightly annoying, I find the overall experience here at Ohio Northern University to be a pleasant one. The  academics are outstanding and the fact that I am able to walk away with a Pharm. D in 6 years is just amazing. The beautiful campus along with outstanding professors makes it worth it. In all my college visits Ohio Northern was the school to show that they were home rather then just say it."
College Sophomore,4,My professors have all been very understanding and are easily accessible for help when help is needed
College Sophomore,4,"It really depends on which area of greek life a person joins. If its service, it can look very highly of you to join it"
College Sophomore,4,It is a joy to go to classes as well as having the freedom provided by the smaller size student base
College Sophomore,4,Security has not been an issue on campus since I have been a student at ONU
College Sophomore,4,I am in a professional sorority and we are required to do a lot of community work. The school is in a small town and I believe the people appreciate the time and energy we put into the community. It's also great knowing that when you graduate from this school you will always have connections with a wonderful and well educated group of people.
College Sophomore,4,We are fortunate in that we are a small school but still excel in sports. Both women and men sports teams are supported and have many advanced athletes. We have a lot of school spirit :)
College Freshman,4,There are so many different Greek lifes to pick from. They have ones for all different activities and groups and majors. They do a lot for the community and student body. The large ones have their own area in Affinity that they live or a house. Greek life seems pretty popular for a lot of students.
College Freshman,4,"I am not in sports, but I hear others talk about them. I hear few complaints and it seems like the college does well in most areas."
College Sophomore,4,ONU has a number of security guards that patrol. The campus is relatively safe. I never feel uncomfortable walking anywhere unless it's late at night. There is very rarely campus crime and security issues warnings whenever an event does happen. The campus has a great clinic and free counseling center that I recommend taking advantage of.
College Sophomore,4,The campus puts on multiple job fairs each semester. They bring a large diverse number of employers seeking different majors. There are usually a number of on campus jobs available as well.
College Sophomore,4,"I love my professors, almost everyone of them I have developed a friendly and professional relationship. The professors really care about the students and want them to succeed. They try their best to accommodate all students."
College Sophomore,4,I live with my best friend in a large suite style dorm. The neighbors are usually respectful and quiet. The hall hosts activities at least once a month. The entire campus does free laundry which is great. The cost is good for the amount of space you get once you get out of freshman dorms. There are plenty of apartments on campus which makes housing easy for all four or more years.
College Sophomore,4,"University is fun and challenging. I've made great friends, and I'm always excited to return back to college after breaks. The University has a warm cozy feeling that makes you feel at home. Some of my favorite experiences are just having relaxing walks around the campus with my friends."
College Freshman,4,The class sizes are wonderful. The professors know their students by name
College Freshman,4,The size is sometimes an issue but you just have to adjust. I love spending time with my friends who live down the hall from me and my roommate. It makes me feel like I have a place that I can call my own to unwind at the end of the day.
College Freshman,4,I'm not in a social sorority but I am part of Kappa Phi. It's a great organization that I look forward to each week.
College Freshman,4,I don't participate in athletics but I attend the events and they are great for all students to spend time with friends and classmates.
College Junior,4,"This is a small school in a small town, so that is not for everyone. I like that I have access to my professors easily and they generally do care about me and my success."
College Freshman,4,"You are always going to have that ""one professor"" who is impossible to deal with, but other than that, they are there to help you."
College Freshman,4,"The football team is what you would expect from a D3 school, nothing to write home about, but they are still my favorite team in college sports."
College Student,4,I like the overall layout at Ohio Northern University. The small college gives me an at home experience. The professors truly care about what they teach and that surprises me because most universities have teachers that just care about a paycheck and not about the students. I would choose ONU again because of its safe campus and its' caring towards it students.
College Sophomore,4,"I love attending ONU. Yes, it is difficult, but in the end the teachers are proving an invaluable education as well as th.e resources they are willing to share with the students are innumerable."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school and the program I'm in, but I am very overwhelmed by the price that I am paying. I knew going into college that I was choosing an expensive school, but it didn't really hit me or stress me out until this summer. I am now trying to figure out how I'm going to pay for my second year of school in and I'm finding it incredibly difficult."
College Student,4,Orientation has gone well and helped me prepare for the fall.
College Student,4,"I love that the size of the school is small allowing for small class sizes.  However, it is out in the middle of nowhere and without a car you are kinda stuck on campus."
College Student,4,"I received a lot of scholarships, but I still have a lot of money left that I am trying to take care of.."
College Sophomore,4,Just research the area. You will see
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus is a great experience. From the actively involved Residence Life star to the influx of provided programs, the living environment is outstanding."
College Sophomore,4,Overall pretty cheap. Nothing in town is very far from the school.
College Sophomore,4,"The rules are understandable and clearly there for the students' safety, but sometimes the parking ticketing seems a bit excessive."
College Sophomore,4,I received scholarships that I simply have to accept. It's great.
College Sophomore,4,"I love that there are campus apartments. They're generally well set up and being close to academic buildings is great. However, they are extremely expensive for housing in this location and there are not enough washer/dryers in the apartment complex."
College Freshman,4,The administration sticks to its policies as stated in the student handbook.
College Freshman,4,"I was able to get lots of financial aid based on my grades in high school, intended major, and my parents alumni status. I suggest looking for any available scholarship through the school, there are some that aren't very well advertised that require separate applications."
College Freshman,4,"The freshman dorms are small and cramped, but the dorm atmosphere is wonderful and I enjoy spending time in the building. The dorms are also within five minutes of my classes, which is great when I'm about to be late!"
College Sophomore,4,"I play two sports there and i love both, for division III they are about as good as its going to get.  Better for football than anything else"
College Sophomore,4,"I love the school, great people, great teachers.  But the weather sucks and the partying sucks."
College Student,4,The community is very welcoming towards ONU students.
College Student,4,I have a great dorm room and I like my roommate and dorm mates as well
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not quite sure if I will have an internship, being from out of state it's a tad harder for professors to help with."
College Sophomore,4,"Freshman year was the typical college dorm experience we see in movies, with densely pack hallways, cubicle-like rooms, and a hallway bathroom with shower stalls. Sophomore year consists of spacious rooms, though further away from campus, we get our own bathroom. Newer more aesthetically-pleasing buildings in general,"
College Freshman,4,"They were really accommodating for my video submission, and international admissions made a huge effort to inform me about what was going on with my application."
Sophomore,2,"Education department does not know what they are doing, as they admit to their students. Food is subpar at best, and very overpriced. The campus is nice however, and the dorms are mediocre... They would be great if they are actually cleaned the bathrooms regularly (every three days is not regular!). I don't know why this school was highly rated for safety either. There are students who express stories about how students have been raped in a wooded area near the freshman dorms, known to students as the 'rape forest'. Doesn't feel safe in the slightest at night."
Niche User,2,"It is very wealthy and full of great resources, but I went there and they didn't tell me they didn't even really offer my degree track, even though it is on every website. I wasted my money not learning for a semester because they didn't offer it. The chair of the department advised no one else take this track either, but failed to tell us. The sciences are strong and engineering and business. Music and arts are not. English is okay. They have chicken tenders though and are polar bears which makes everything better. People are very stuck up and mean rich kids. Athletics are strong and academics, but it is not a friendly place. It is more of a battle field. I had a professor give my class all the answers to a final. Very unprofessional in the arts departments."
College Sophomore,2,There is not much campus diversity. What little there is feels like they are overshadowed and hidden away. Would love to see more diversity on campus.
College Student,2,"For how much we are paying, you'd think they would give us better food..."
College Sophomore,2,McDonalds could provide better food.
College Sophomore,2,Not very many parties. None are good to go to unless you already know people there.
College Sophomore,2,It's convenient but not very good.
College Student,2,"The dining hall is pretty much always not good (at least there's a buffet - you can always eat as much mediocre food as you want), unless it's a really big visit day or something like that. White Bear is passable, and meal swipes can be used there, but the food always remains the same so it can get pretty tiring. NOM is good but you need to use points or real money there so if you run out of points you're done until next semester. The hours are kinda inconvenient, with each meal open for no more than two hours at a time. Breakfast isn't served on weekends, and White Bear is not open on Saturday, Friday after 6:00PM, and Sunday before 6:00PM."
College Sophomore,2,"One stuck up douche bag who takes his job way to seriously, and tries to get students in trouble all the time."
College Sophomore,2,"There are two bars in town and one of them is a townie bar, don't go there."
College Sophomore,2,Sororities are pretty big but fraternities suck.
College Student,2,I should have qualified for a higher award based on my ACT superscore but I could not get anyone to recognize their error or make any changes.
College Student,2,"There are some great options for off-campus dining but there are only so many.  If you want something besides pizza or Mexican, you have to drive at least fifteen minutes to find somethings."
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you drink, there is nothing to do. One bar and another half bar kind of place that has karaoke every week."
College Sophomore,2,"Other than McDonald's and Taco Bell, your choices are pizza, pizza, pizza, and two Mexican restaurants."
College Senior,2,"The campus is somewhat diverse, and most people are accepting of the different ethnicities.  We even have an exchange program with a college or two in South Korea (we send students there over the summer, they send students here during the school year).  However it is a Methodist college so when it comes to things outside of Christianity people aren't so accepting (this also applies to sexual orientation)."
College Sophomore,2,Not very much places to eat at in this little village.
College Sophomore,2,There isn't much of a nightlife because Ada is such a small town. If you want to have fun somewhere most people head out of town on the weekends but it is still a very fun campus
College Freshman,2,"If I had to do it all over again, I probably would not have chosen Northern for my major quite yet. It is still in development, and will one day be an amazing program, just not yet."
College Sophomore,2,The money from financial aid is distributed by simply putting it toward what they want.
Niche User,1,"I did not take any classes online with Ohio Northern University. However, I would not advise anyone to take classes here."
Alum,1,"Option did not exist in 1977. Would not have wanted to do it. 
There is nothing that compares with meeting new people and experiencing  new cultures and situations."
College Sophomore,1,"Literally awful, you should live off campus and cook, dont eat mac."
Recent Alumnus,1,The campus is isolated so there are no public transportation options.
College Senior,1,"Living in the dorms isn't horrible (even our freshman dorms aren't as packed as other colleges) but they are ridiculously overpriced.  To top it off, they force you to live on campus for three years unless you happen to fit in a specific loophole (married, military, etc.).  The worst part is the food.  When you're living in dorms you are forced on a single meal plan (since the semester switch they still haven't created any kind of choice with different meal plans) and there are very few places to use a meal swipe at, and the food is nowhere worth the price."
College Junior,1,"Clean and cute.... but absolutely nothing to do in Ada, Ohio or within an immediate distance."
College Sophomore,1,There is no public transportation here. If you want to travel you will need a car.
College Sophomore,1,The weather here is bipolar.  It could be 60 degrees and sunny one day and snowing the nest.  Winters are extremely cold. Summers are hot.
College Sophomore,1,Not many options.  Only 3 fast food and around 5 local restaurants
College Senior,1,"Speaking only for the college of nursing: the professors whose job it is to provide nursing education and support their students are instead more interested in berating and humiliating them. When I began to have trouble in one of my courses just one semester before I was supposed to graduate, rather than helping me or providing any semblance of moral support, my preceptor yelled at me, embarrassed me in front of the patients that we were attending, made me show up early and then did not bother to show up herself, and accused me of mistakes I had not made. When I went to the higher-ups in the program, including the dean, to discuss the situation, they did not offer any support or even listen to my problems. Instead they backed up the professor who had tormented me, ignored my previously spotless academic record, and basically accused me of being a poor student and a whiner. They all saw fit to see me fail the course and delay my graduation for a year rather than provide me with help. I cannot stress enough how much I recommend NOT joining this nursing program. A vast majority of students fall prey to these uncaring, vindictive professors, and graduate a year or more later than they were initially supposed to. If you want to get your bachelor's degree in nursing in four years and want to do it with a nursing staff that cares about your academic well-being, DO NOT attend Ohio Northern University's college of nursing."
College Freshman,1,"There are only a few parties each weekend, and they are at either sports houses or a few fraternities. There are almost no other bars or nightclubs within miles"
College Junior,1,"Pretty Awful – Parking passes cost ~$50 a year and limit you to 1 lot that's usually full or really far away from your room. You'll need a car (or a friend with a car) if you want to go anywhere off campus (shopping, food, movies, anything really). And don't park anywhere but your designated lot, security has nothing to do but dish out ridiculous parking tickets."
College Sophomore,1,"You Saw a Minority Where?! There are such a limited number of minorities on campus that it is often shocking to see one.  The football team comprises of 90% of our black and hispanic students, while the rest only hang out with each other."
College Freshman,1,There are not enough food options which is really bad
College Freshman,1,"Very Limited – There are houses that are right off of campus that some students (mainly senior I think) rent, but the choices are very limited and they aren't all that well maintained. There may be more a bit more spread out in Ada, but I don't know."
College Sophomore,1,No Clubs and 2.5 Bars – There is not much to offer interms of nightlife. Parties hosted by sports teams are fun though.
College Freshman,1,"Parking Tickets Aren't Fun – The only problem I've had with campus security is parking tickets. Having received three in the last six months, I should know. However, the first ticket is waived and it is really just a matter of luck on whether or not you get caught."

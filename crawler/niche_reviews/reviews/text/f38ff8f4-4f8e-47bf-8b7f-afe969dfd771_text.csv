Sophomore,5,Jackson State welcomed me with open arms. It was the first school to give me a complete tour of the campus. The students and faculty there are friendly and helpful. The class size is small so it’s easy to form educational relationships with your professors.
Sophomore,5,"Being at Jackson State University has been nothing , but a great experience. Everyone on campus makes you feel welcomed and loved. It's like walking on campus with a big family.

Niche User,5,ackson State University is a very diverse school. If you enjoy being around people and a sense of community this is the perfect school. Attending this school will greatly teach you things about yourself..if you want things done you have to do them yourself here as with most schools. The advising and guiding could be a lot better. Allowing students to slip through the cracks should be improved quite a few delayed graduations. As far as education I can only speak for my department but I believe that they taught to the best of their abilities and would help their students out when they could. I don't think this school is worth the tuition costs. Jsu doesn't handle money well and can get a bit greedy. Overall I enjoyed my matriculation through this university.
Senior,5,Jackson State University and their school of Life Long Learning is awesome.  Anyone who has a desire to complete their education can now do so. The coaches are willing to help all that apply. It is never to late as long as you have yur health and strength. Striving to improve your knowledge is a great opportunity for all who want to complete their undergraduate degree.
Freshman,5,"I love everything about Jackson State! Everybody is really helpful and truly wants the best for you. In my experience you will meet a lot of great professors here as well as students.

Alum,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed my college experience at Jackson State.  What I appreciate most about Jackson State is that I was challenged to step out of my comfort zone by all of my professors.  There was no sitting in class without participating...which I was previously accustomed to doing.  Also, I loved the family atmosphere.  We always helped each other out and there was no competition...like that.  We genuinely cared and  wanted each other to succeed."

Sophomore,5,So far the time I've spent at Jackson State University has been excellent. The professors are friendly the campus is easy to learn. The upkeep of the campus is top of the line and all my classes are in close proximity of one another. The police on campus aren't too pushy. They let me in a week early so I could explore the campus and learn the layout. And the campus offers a wide food selection from what they cook up themselves to fast food restaurants on campus. So all in all my experience so far has been excellent and I hope this review will inspire others to join the tiger family.

Senior,5,I transferred to JSU from a 2 Year Community College. The transition was was easy and I received helped from each department.
Junior,5,"""Thee I Love."" Whenever those significant three words are presented together as a unit, everyone knows they are a representation of THEE Jackson State University. I chose to take a tour to JSU during the springtime of my senior year of high school and immediately fell in love. Every student, staff and faculty member spoke with enthusiasm, which caused me to recognize that I was surrounded by a lot of southern hospitality. I felt that being an only child and advancing onward in a new state with thousands of people, a friendly environment like that would be a necessity and a healthy way of adjusting. Enrolling as a student at Jackson State University made it very easy to become involved in organizations, events, community service, etc. After my first year at JSU, I knew I had found my family. We really are a group of individuals that are accepting, supportive and collectively one. I would not change my decision at all and I would recommend ""Thee I Love"" to any and everyone."
Sophomore,5,"So far my experience at Jackson State has been an exception one. As a person who considers themselves as an introvert, living on campus and attending this institution has open my eyes to new experiences and opportunities. The many school activities gives me an excuse to not stay in my room all day and meet new people who are helpful in my growth. The teachers have been nothing but influencial and knowledgeable. All the faculty and staff are ready to lend a helping hand whenever I need assistance. And this has been my first year at Jackson State. So far I am really enjoying being at Jackson State"
Senior,5,"I recommend everyone to attend Jackson state University. I’ve had fun experiences, learning wonderful things. Challenging minds changing lives."

Senior,4,My experience was wonderful despite the covid-19 pandemic outbreak. The online courses are very easy and simple.
Senior,4,My online courses were very simple in instructions and easy. It wasn't a hassle at all. I learned and gained alot.

Senior,4,The online classes was well balance.  I was able to Excell after being out of school for forty-four years.  The work was hard on me but it challenge my thinking.
Sophomore,4,"Due to the Covid-19 I had to take all of my classes online. The experience was fine, since my face-to-face classes already had me to do my assignments online prior to the epidemic. I did not have any problems with working online. I was able to do my assignments at a reasonable time that it was given and had no problems with submission. The only problem I faced was that some of my professors would not respond to their emails at a reasonable manner or at all. Other than that, the online experience for me was pretty decent."
Freshman,4,I Like all the opportunities that was presented to me at orientation.  It appeared to be a very vibrant and warm environment.
Junior,4,"Jackson State University is a well-rounded, diverse school full of talents, excitements, and academic success."

Their Engineering program is innovative and top-notch. They are ever-evolving as they are student oriented and culture-concious. I am proud to be a Tiger. They understand the social, political, and economic climate in the nation, and they aim to impact it for the better. I came in as a Transfer and as I became more and more active, I gained more and more recognition from my colleagues, professors, and peers. Their Legacy food court and Heritage Dining Hall serve vegetarians as well as they serve people with traditional diets. Their professors care about their students and encourage them to become strong, independent leaders."
Sophomore,4,"No school is perfect, of course, and they all come with their own little quirks. Jackson State is no exception but what it lacks in administrative duties, it makes up for with its entire student culture that brings life to the university."
Freshman,4,"Based on my college experience, Jackson State University has been extremely helpful when it comes to obtaining my degree. Jackson State University prepares you for the real world and your future career. Jackson State University has taught me numerous life and school skills. There are professors and staff workers there who teach you with respect while making sure you know the accurate information that goes towards your degree. Although most people see Jackson State University as a party and a fun place, it is totally the opposite. I can see my experience at Jackson State University getting better and better."
Senior,4,"The well-rounded college curriculum serves as an awakening from the slumber of
adolescence. This academic environment strives for greater analysis of the
complexities of society, through numerous areas of study, as well as one's own
individual outlook. It is through my own increasing awareness of the world
around me and fascination with courses that reflect and dissect society that has
led to an interest in sociology, and the Individualized Major Program has allowed
me to focus my interest in feminism into what I feel is the well-balanced and
inspirational major of Women’s Studies."
Senior,4,I love the joyful atmosphere of learning with hospitable people. The change I would like to see is more parking places.
Sophomore,4,I love the environment and the food options! The academics are great as well. I’m a computer science major and all my professors will take the time to explain a concept if I don’t understand.
Junior,4,"I like the people here and I wish we had more school activities for everyone to come together. The ones we do have are good, but I just wish it was more."
Junior,4,"This school has been around for many years helping the people of Jackson, Ms and surrounding areas receive a great education.  The cost of this school is reasonable and the teachers and great.  I have taken more that 30 hours at this school so far and I haven't had a bad experience with a teacher yet.  The bookstore is great, your books will be mailed directly to your house if you need them to be.  The teachers are willing to help you and answer any questions that you may have."
Freshman,4,"JSU is a very energetic school with some of the most determined people i’ve ever meet. The events are consistent and frequent. The class aren’t too hard to where you feel like you’re struggling too much and the professors are easy to talk to when you build a relationship with the,."
Freshman,4,What I liked about Jackson is the people that care about their school because people that do not know Jackson state have heard that it is  a poor lower school were kids just like to party. I look at this school as a home because I feel comfortable and gives me a good feeling of putting my hard working money into this school hands.
Senior,4,"I love the bond between faculty, staff, and students. Professors go above and beyond measures to ensure that each student is gaining the academic knowledge in which they deserve while being that home away from home."
Niche User,4,I only heard and my cousin is a graduate so I cannot  rate it I can only ate it on what I have heard.

Freshman,4,"Jackson State University thee I live is a place anyone wants to be,  but I feel the treatment of international student isn't right,  though the teachings are Good, the environment Is condusive and the student life is OK,  I think more should be done for the international students,  as international students, your housing and application is with the general US citizens,  and the school does not provide a dedicated housing for international students,  also,  the scolarship opportunities available for international students is limited,  and you would have to struggle to get as little as $500 scolarship.     
The athletics aspect of JSU is fantastic,  and the student life is great for US citizens"
Sophomore,4,"My experience with Jackson State university is great, the faculty  and staff welcomed me with open arms, it's my second home. What i will like to see change is having more restaurants and more school activities."

The student life is great, its always something to get into on campus and many things to get involved in.

Other than minor things, this is a nice school to attend."
Sophomore,4,"With my previous year of college at Jackson State University, the experience has a great take on my life. Jackson State University teaches me the importance of community service, campus involvement, and most importantly pursuing accedemic excellence."
Freshman,4,I’ve been at Jackson state for a semester and it has been awesome. The culture is great and campus life helps you a lot .

Alot of people consider Jackson State the party of life school but it is more to it then that. The only thing I would change about JSU  is the area it is located other then that everything else is wonderful.
Sophomore,4,Jackson state is a small school in a rural area where you will probably know most of the students or see a lot of the same people on a daily basis. Make sure you always go to class because teachers do not tolerate abscences.  All of the students at this university may not be the best for you friend wise. Pick and choose who you want to share your life with and make sure they are participating in a heathy college lifestyle.

There are improvements that could be made just like any other university. However, overall Jackson State is one of the best choices I have made."

They could make the whole registration process go smoother."
Alum,4,"Jackson State Univ. really taught me independence. I value everything I learned throughout my undergraduate career.

My professors were very reachable and I'm very grateful that 4 years later they are still in contact with me."
Niche User,4,"I went to Jackson State University for a Student Council convention in seventh grade. The people were really nice, and helped me to the places that I needed to be. The auditorium fits many people, and could hold many different types of events. "

College Freshman,4,the school takes much pride in our sports but still stresses the importance of school work
Senior,2,"My 2018-2019 senior year. I started out with $12,300 in subsidize and almost $3,000 in Financial Aid. I was later told I didn’t have any Financial Aid due to summer school. I didn’t attend Summer school. I was then told they didn’t update my 2018 Spring information. I requested for a payment plan on my balance of $789. I was told I had to pay a process fee plus 25% of balance. I applied for other loans, but wasn’t lucky. I then decided to start paying on my balance in November. I received my classes in December for the Spring and decided to order my books. I checked my canvas page and it states I’m not registered for any classes. The school doesn’t try to work with some students in payment plans."
Freshman,2,"I Love the instructors at the school of life long learning. Getting information is not such a bad expsrience, but keeping you informed about your books and other information is the pits. I suppose the student has soul responsibly for that. I don't like the proxy exam. Overall I will give the School a 8 out of 10"
College Sophomore,2,"There are campus police visible majority during the day, but at night they are hard to find. I don't think it's safe to walk alone at night because there have been many incidents reported related to rape and robbery."
Recent Alumnus,2,I don't recommend walking around on campus at night by yourself. Girls have been known to be assulted.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Most of the time, our public safety officers don't really take things serious. Now there are some that care about the students' well being, but not all of them, especially the 3rd shift workers."
Recent Alumnus,2,I just don't like the roommate situations.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The football players are the rudest on the campus, and it's always the ones that don't play. When complaints are made against them, the coaches always sweep it under the rug."
College Freshman,2,The security could be a lot better.
College Junior,2,It really depends on your major.
College Junior,2,"Most teachers are not the best people in the world, but you learn a lot."
College Junior,2,"Everyone wants to be Greek, but they make it difficult."
College Junior,2,"Our coaches try their best, but sometimes they don't get far."
College Junior,2,Campus police are visible but not very helpful.
College Freshman,2,We don't have a good football team or basketball team
College Freshman,2,Honestly the band is more athletic...
College Freshman,2,Don't feel so safe not that much security which is bad
College Junior,2,I don't enjoy it. I have a problem with my teacher's grading integrity. I have to take one of his classes EVERY semester.
College Freshman,2,"The cafe can get really bad sometimes. Like there won't be a lot of  choices on the weekends and sometimes the food is just straight up nasty. But all the other source of food is pretty good. Like chi chic-fil-a, Burger King, subway, etc."
College Sophomore,2,No info is ever given
Recent Alumnus,2,The cost of off campus living  is very expensive
College Sophomore,2,Safety is a big issue that worries me. For activities to do in the area there is very little to do.
College Freshman,2,People can just be very hectic
College Freshman,2,"My financial aid process was very difficult, I kept applying, reapplying and I did not receive anything."
College Senior,2,Do your financial aid on and stay on it. It's hard for me to scholarships because of my GPA but I always try.
College Senior,2,There are not a lot of options and they close too early.
College Junior,2,Its not a good situation
Recent Alumnus,2,The scho.ol is not in an safe part of town
College Freshman,2,Jackson states Wi-Fi in dorms availability is very bad you never have signal even on the W
College Freshman,2,I never really noticed the diversity on campus I basically see the same people every day all the time.
College Freshman,2,Trying to obtain financial aid is a complete headache. I'll try minutes I have to get financial aid but I can't have to walk back and forth to my room to confirm on my own computer it was a hard time when I first started.
College Sophomore,2,"Financial aid at JSU is a headache! You'll be in there forever and the staff aren't as helpful as they could be. I'll admit there were a few people who really helped me out, but overall JSU financial aid isn't good in my opinion."
College Sophomore,2,"The weather in Jackson, Mississippi is so bipolar its ridiculous. One moment you walking to class and it's extremely cold and then by the time you leave your class it's beyond hot. The weather affects my HBCU experience because can't be outside as much as I want enjoying activities due to the outrageous weather. My umbrella can't even withstand the weather sometimes."
College Sophomore,2,"I feel JSU is strict about the wrong things and they're always trying to ruin the fun. The strictness affects the ""HBCU Experience"" as I would say. Campus security sometimes turn their backs to certain things such as drinking and smoking, but when a visitor parks just for a few moments the security is quick to give them a ticket. As far as academics go, some professors are strict about promptness and some aren't. There are some teachers who are even late to class on a consistent basis. Theses are just a few reasons why i feel the strictness here is slightly below average."
College Sophomore,2,"Greeks have no special housing at JSU. They have different plots for each fraternity and sorority.  The Greeks here are involved in community service and they host events, but when you compare JSU Greeks to other school's Greeks ours fall short. Greek weeks and step shows are quite boring, Some people in the fraternities and sororities are initiated for the wrong reasons, and some members do not at all exemplify what their fraternity/sorority stands for. It's basically like a big popularity contest."
College Sophomore,2,What I am interested in they do not offer and that is Dance and or a General Studies Degree.
College Sophomore,2,When I entered the Interdisciplinary Studies Program I wanted to know just where I stood in reference to how many credits I had and what I needed. I couldn't get anyone to answer any questions. I lost enthusiasm and felt I would never get my degree so I gave up.  No one cared.
College Sophomore,2,Honestly our security officers think they are apart of the FEDS. They are the absolute worst when it comes to anything .
College Sophomore,2,Living off campus is dangerous . There are off campus apartments available but they are in a bad neighborhood and bad environment . Too much violence
College Freshman,2,The palisades ain't a good place to live and no they don't help out with finding a place off campus
College Freshman,2,"The drug scene at my school is kind of bad. The reason being is because sometimes students walk pass you and smell just like they have the full plant I their pocket with them. Also, it is bad because students go and buy liquor like water and they are only like 18-19 . The peer pressure trap a lot of students into the hands of others. The need to have so done notice you make some student start getting high with people just to have someone say they know them."
College Freshman,2,There freshman dorms need updating
College Freshman,2,Unfortunately financial aid did not cover my tuition so I had to look at other options to pay for school.
College Freshman,2,We don't have over night visitation.
College Junior,2,There aren't many places to park on-campus unless you arrive on campus early in the morning or late in the afternoon. If you aren't parked in a parking spot then you can easily get a ticket. Having a car on campus is great until you have to search for a parking spot. Parking off-campus is dangerous because you can become more prone to robberies.
College Freshman,2,"Trying to find a park on campus is unbearable, there are more faculty and staff parks than student."
College Sophomore,2,Drug usage is not allowed in the dorms or on campus but students still somehow manage to obtain drugs. If students are found in violation of the rules on campus then he/she will be fined and removed off campus. 
College Senior,2,Our campus is to open and anyone can come on it. We have a lot of security but none are usually around when things goes bad on campus. 
College Senior,2,Don't have many choices when it comes to dining. 
College Junior,2,Parking on campus is the only thing that I hate everyday. It is way too many students and not even parking ares on the campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Since I've been on campus, this is my first semester, I haven't really heard about the Greeks doing anything unless it deals with a party but I'm sure that once their weeks come up things will change."
Recent Alumnus,2,"JSU believes in putting their friends, sorority, and family first; not necessarily the individual that is capable of doing the job.  I have encountered this on several occasions."
College Senior,2,They need healthier food selection for reasonable prices
College Sophomore,2,The weather is so unpredictable at times so you really don't know what to expect. One day it'll nice outside the next day it's extremely cold.
College Sophomore,2,"Mississippi weather is very bipolar. One minute its hot and sunny and then next minute its raining cats and dogs. The day can start of good and then you look up and see a big dark cloud. So its not that difficult getting to class, as long as you have a umbrella and coat"
College Senior,2,Everything revolves around football and basketball.  But the volleyball girls are hot!
College Senior,2,Greek Life is near to non existent here at Jackson State.
College Freshman,2,"it's hard if your not that super, excellent child."
College Junior,2,"The labs on campus could definitely be larger. There are not many labs and if there is a class occupying labs you are forced to go to the library where you are not guaranteed a seat. I would consider the internet speed in the labs across campus the best when compared to connecting to JSUmobilenet in the residence halls. The internet in the dorms does not always work. When it does work you never know how well it will work. Having a personal computer is not a necessity but it will come in handy. Having a printer is questionable. I say that because JSU provides nowhere for students to print in color and there are also days that printers across campus are not working. However, when printers are not working many teachers extend deadlines of work to give students extra time to print."
College Junior,2,Tansporation at JSU isn't the  best because there are not schedules or signs posted at shuttle stops and the shuttle only runs in one direction. Transportation is also a problem for students that do not have cars because the city buses finish their routes fairly early and students working off campus struggle to finds ways back and forth to their places of employment.
College Sophomore,2,There is always security on campus.  There is also emergency polls located all over campus that you can reach if you are ever in danger.  But since the campus is open I sometimes feel unsafe especially at night time.
Graduate Student,1,"This review is regarding the purported School of Public Health, not the University.  If I could do it over again I would run in the opposite direction of the the School of Public Health from which I graduated.  The School has experienced at least 7 deans since I graduated in 2010. The current dean is obsessed with HIT, knows nothing about the socio-political dynamics affecting public health, and he barely speaks English.

Moreover, the professors are among the worse in the field, as most are not published, aren't involved in policy, or developing community health initiatives that are badly needed in the city of Jackson, which was considered the fattest city in the nation only a couple of years ago.  

The bottom line is: if you merely want a degree but without developing  crucial  public health skills, JSU is the place to go.  But, if you want to be an effective public health professional run in the opposite direction."

Sophomore,1,"I have had many negative experiences here. from not being housed for a week while: "" living"" on campus, to careless housing staff to poor teacher quality."
College Sophomore,1,"The resident hall for freshman girls are the worst. The space is small, it's the oldest dorm on campus, and we have very few dorms. We need to build more dorms that are on campus and convenient for out of state students and local students who doesn't have transportation."
College Senior,1,people get robbed at gunpoint very often!
College Junior,1,Our school campus security guards do nothing to protect the students.
College Freshman,1,"The football team sucks so no one really supports them, and that is the only sport I have been on campus to witness. I went to football games for the band not the football team."
College Sophomore,1,I don't stay on campus but for what I have seen and heard I know it can be better
College Freshman,1,This is one of the worst things about Jackson State it's housing students are scattered and safety is compromise what I think they're working on that right now
College Sophomore,1,I haven't had any internship
College Sophomore,1,I did not go to many college parties. I go to local clubs.
College Sophomore,1,We only have fast food options
College Freshman,1,They treat you like grown kids not grown adults.
College Sophomore,1,greek life is boring. all they do is host parties. 
College Freshman,1,"I would have to say, the only good things about living on campus would be the social atmosphere because most people get along and you're close to your classes, other than that it's horrible. Most rooms are small, you have to share a washroom with at least 20 people who may be disgusting and you can only have visitation when authorities say so. I feel as though I pay entirely too much money to upset and unsatisfied."
College Sophomore,1,"This is what I dislike most about this school. It took a month for them to receive my information and lost several pages of my information. In addition, when my financial aid was completed and I checked on the need based scholarship, I applied for the first day of school, they didn't have any money left and replied, ""since my balance was so high they couldn't awarded me anything"". i guess need based scholarships aren't for people who really need them here!"
College Senior,1,Financial aid is every unprofessional. It takes them forever to get documents entered in my account. I received VERY VERY little financial aid.
College Junior,1,"The campus police can be somewhat strict. Most of the time they are strict with situations that are not very important. For example, once a young man was walking around campus with his shirt off and like 4 police officers harassed him about it. Another time one of my friends was walking on side of one of the dorms and got robbed at gunpoint, but the police were nowhere to be found."
College Senior,1,"Campus police are poorly managed and paid. Very low morale.  Stop and talk to any of the officers and they will tell you. The police chief (Allbright) just got his college degree and he was previously an officer AND the Presidents driver. None of the Command Staff have any traditional law enforcement so we dont have the best police/security services. We have nothing compared to USM, OLE Miss, MSU.  Generally if you dont drink or smoke weed out in the open or in the dorm room campus police arent even a factor."
College Freshman,1,Parking really sucks. They're really strict on parking permits and WILL tow your car in a heartbeat if you don't have one.
College Sophomore,1,"its an HBCU , a college for blacks, but they have plenty of international students"
College Sophomore,1,Printing on Campus – Bring your own printer to school and lots of ink! The school charges for you to print papers in the library and it is a hassle to add money to your student account.
College Junior,1,Smoking Problem – inhaling smoke fumes of some  form second hand smoke is pratically second  to breathing air
College Junior,1,Want to Hold an Internship Soon – I hope to gain experience both from a finical and business perspective
College Sophomore,1,"Mainly Afrian-American – There are a few people of a different race, but mostly African-American students make up the schools population."
College Freshman,1,Jackson State University is an Historically Black College/ University. Therefore it is mostly African -American students on campus. There are many other races at the university but the majority are not. Religion is accepted here as almost event we do pray before it starts. Sexual orientation is also widely accepted only with economic background. Political belief is mostly democratic.
College Freshman,1,Police Don't Tolerate Nonsense – The campus police are beyond strict on students who get out of line. But at the same time they make us feel safe on and off campus.
Recent Alumnus,1,Campus security is very poor and needs major improvements.
College Sophomore,1,No Transportation. You either have a car or know someone w/ a car. However they do provide buses to the football game on Saturday.
College Sophomore,1,"Not All That – People seem to be very one-minded at this University. Of course you'll have the ""flamboyant"" men as well as the typical ""dramatic"" girls. Sometimes it reminds me of high school."
College Senior,1,"this school is known for financial aid smuggling money into their pockets, because people rarely get it and don't have a problem paying themselves."
College Senior,1,"jackson state has the worst parking. they continue to build buildings, but still don't make enough parks. I really hate their parking!"
College Freshman,1,Freshman Dorm – They really need to build a new freshman dorm it does matter about the history behind it.
College Sophomore,1,"Drugs are big at JSU, mostly everyone on campus either girls or guys smoke and drink."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Very Diverse at All – Its sad to say but the school is not very diverse at all, which isn't directly a fault on their part but they could do a better job at advertising their school to different races outside the African-American race."
College Sophomore,1,the parking on campus is horrible. there isn't enough parking spaces for students who live on and off campus. just recently this year there was an issue with where students could park and a lot of cars were towed due to an inconvenience of parking. students were either ticketed or towed. this resorted in a massive uproar amongst students and teachers.
College Junior,1,I Lose More Weight Than Ever Walking to and from My Car! The parking at JSU absolutely sucks. It is really ridiculous that I have to walk so far from my car to class.
College Senior,1,"Never Held Accountable – Most of the professors and faculty/staff at Jackson State University do not care about the students. They have bad attitudes, advise students poorly and forget that we are the customers. I enrolled there to be close to home, but it is a decision that I regret wholeheartedly."
College Freshman,1,"Parking Is Hideous – Sometimes it is hard to park in places on JSU campus. They pull innocent people's cars when its not their fault that there isnt much parking on campus. I think they should also find one tower and not multiple because sometimes, they don't even know themselves who pulled the students car."
College Sophomore,1,"The Food on Campus – The food in the heritage dining hall is a wreck. I do not agree with the workers and facutly and staff that we student should eat in a very unsanitary place called a cafeteria. The plates and cups still be dirty and the smell in there is just ridiculous. Then, they have the nerves to close at 7pm. Why when students will be getting out of class and practice. If they do not have food in there room nor a car nor money what will they eat? the food is crazy also. Why do we have CHICKEN EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK??  That is just a shame i have never been so tired of eating chicken. I feel that they need a new plan or system or something because the cafe need to get it together. And when we Tiger Pride folks have tours and they decide to stay and eat and they go into our cafe they be like what in the world? We cant put our school in a position like that. We are trying to recruit students not scare them off with the smell and uncleaness of our cafeteria."

Freshman,5,My online experience with the online class have been wonderful. All of my online professors have been very clear and they explain and answer every question thoughtfully with patience. Some of my class are hybrid and the professor said if we ever have to go fully online because of Covid-19 don't freak out or panic because we will get through this.
Freshman,5,I don’t have any experience with there online courses but i heard it’s good and very helpful. The courses were very helpful. Even tho I didn’t take online courses at eastern I heard that they will guide you in the best way they can
Freshman,5,That was a great school I enjoy it here. They are great at helping you and guiding you to your career
Freshman,5,I like that the faculty is very friendly and the students are very easy to get along with. The environment is very family like and comforting.
Graduate Student,5,"I was stuck in a hole after graduated with my bachelors degree. MY GPA was not great, but Eastern was accepting and understanding of my situation . They saw promise in me, and I was able to focus on school and get much better grades. The professors explain all the work well, and they offer chances of discussion with other students. The online format would've been difficult to adjust to, but Eastern has made it very easy with the quality of the coursework and the professors."
Junior,5,So far my experience at Eastern University has been great. I am in the Education program and everyone there is helpful and very friendly--I recommend Eastern to anyone who is looking for a college!
Sophomore,5,"Eastern does a good job with recruiting new students. I applied two days ago and visited the other day and was told that I was accepted! Everyone was really friendly including the students. You can feel the sense of community at this school and it is a perfect size to me. It is also very diverse and for those who say there’s nothing to do on campus, they have many student orgs on campus to get involved in and they’re not far from downtown wayne where you could do much more. College is what you make it and the fun isn’t going to just come to you."
Freshman,5,The campus is just BEAUTIFUL. The staff are so welcoming and eager to help. The university is very diverse and the students are caring and helpful as well. They make you feel at comfortable as soon as you step foot onto the campus. Becoming apart of the Eastern family is going to be an amazing experience.
Graduate Student,5,"I was interested in attending Eastern because my mother went there. Eastern is accepting of all students, but doesn’t not hide their mission to continue God’s work. How each major can bring Him glory and honor. Eastern has a great education program that I am so happy to be a part of."
Sophomore,5,I've just been accepted here.  The process so far has been seamless and the advisers wonderful. I'd recommend to anyone looking for an accelerated adult degree.
Junior,5,"The college really focuses on faith, reason and justice. They allow all students of various faith backgrounds to be open and dialogue with others throughout their studies. The professors are always open to meet one on one with students. The campus is very beautiful and provides great outdoor space for studying when the weather permits."
Alum,5,Beautiful campus. Professors are great. Classes are very interesting. The community and friendships made made it worthwhile. It is a great college.
Niche User,5,I recommend Eastern to everyone! I look forward to completing my degree. I find that students here are friendly and supportive.
Freshman,5,"I stayed there for only a weekend but i felt like i truly belonged there. The admissions team is super helpful, and the student life is amazing! I cannot wait to become an Eagle this coming Fall!!!"
Niche User,5,"I did a college visit to this school I loved the atmosphere, it was so calming and different. I grew up in the city so the atmosphere and everything was so different. The staff was so welcoming and nice. I found out so much about the school just from being there that one day. The class sizes are small. Professors are really nice and they care deeply about what they are teaching ."
Alum,5,"Eastern University is an amazing Christian school outside of Philadelphia. The professors are top notch and the community amongst the students is irreplaceable. If you are looking for a college based on a Biblical worldview this is the college for you, I will always cherish my time at Eastern University and the education and life long friends it's given me."
Sophomore,5,"The community is and forever will be the best part about Eastern University. Although I am just beginnning my journey here I have found that it is to be compared to that blank canvas or a fresh sheet of notebook paper. Where all of the things are possible and your imagination is never to far to reach for. I imagine that like car rides home from fun experiences always seem shorter on the way back, my time here will, because of the amount of fun I am having, seem cut to short. I am excited to experience life on campus, life in community, and life after Eastern."
Freshman,5,The experience I had made me want to go to school there to get my career it’s the most comfortable feeling I’ve ever got at a school
Graduate Student,5,I am a current graduate student at Eastern. The faculty are caring and I feel like I am getting an excellent education here.
Graduate Student,5,"I will be starting this spring 2018. My experience thus far has been great from the information sessions, financial aid sessions, to the application process and acceptance. Everyone that I have encountered has been extremely professional and helpful."
Graduate Student,5,"Eastern University is  a godly school, people are very loving, like dean, teachers/ professors, facility,and people that attend the University. What I like about how they teach is they accommodate their student with the education that is conducive to them. And I am excited about being a student at the University,etc."
Freshman,5,"Eastern University is a wonderful place to engage in important discussions in a Christian environment. The campus is clean, safe, and has a community atmosphere. Going to Eastern was the best decision I could have made - the professors and staff are dedicated, the people kind and welcoming, and the education engaging and bold."
Freshman,5,My experience has been really well at Eastern. The staff is amazing and the campus is beautiful.  However the food is not as good as it was during open house or the overnight they had. The walk to town is pretty great. There are not a lot of noises and there is a lot of animals on campus so you will always be surprise what you’ll find there.
Junior,5,"I love that this is an institution where my same  values, practices, and beliefs are welcomed and shared."
Freshman,5,"I liked this university the best, because as soon as I walked on campus I felt like I belonged there. Also it is really close to the King of Prussia Mall, but the campus is surrounded by woods."
Sophomore,5,"Eastern University is an excellent Christian school with great students and professors. I especially love the clubs and organizations. I was able to start my own club, The Eastern Conservative Club. Eastern is a very diverse university with students from as far away as El Salvador and Japan"
Freshman,5,"I love the people near and the atmosphere. They also offer a lot of scholarships too. The food is okay, but is a great place to meet up with friends."
Senior,5,I love the community at Eastern University and am glad that I decided to go there for college. The professors are dedicated to your success
Niche User,5,"My experience was wonderful. What I really like about Eastern University are academics, the campus was peaceful, and all the professors are nice. I don't want to change anything."
Sophomore,5,"Eastern University has far exceeded my expectations for what I thought college would be.  The professors here take every chance to get to know the students on a personal level, and truly care about the success of the students.  It is a Christian university, and thus the Christian worldview and fundamentals are integrated into the classroom and all throughout campus.  The quality that I cherish most about Eastern is the family-like atmosphere that surrounds the campus.  The students, faculty, and staff are all very close and supprotive of each other, which makes the college experience that more special."
Sophomore,5,"Eastern University has allowed for me to further my education and relationship with God through extensive studies and impassioned research. I appreciate every day I have at Eastern University and cherish each moment that I am blessed with. I like that the classes at Eastern University are rather small; this allows for more assistance and personal help with the material. If I ever have a question or do not understand the material, it is very easy to get the support I need. Something that Eastern could improve on are the housing buildings. The dorms could undergo some refurbishing to create a better housing environment.My time at Eastern University has been enjoyable and I look forward to what each day holds."
Freshman,5,I have had a great experience at Eastern University so far.  The other students are friendly and it creates a good family-like environment.
Junior,5,"I go to this school as an adult undergrad.I really like this program  because the classes are accelerated , 1 night a week, and fit my work schedule."
Freshman,5,"Eastern University is a top notch Christian university. It is a beautiful campus (although it is very hilly, which can be frustrating sometimes). The professors know your name and take the time to get to know you as a person. Professors are always there to help! Though it is expensive, the education is 100% worth it. The campus has a wonderful, friendly atmosphere. "
College Sophomore,5,I must pay for this experience ...It is just a wonderful spiritual place to be.
College Freshman,5,The campus is extremely safe. No alcohol is allowed either.
College Freshman,5,"I would say that this school is the best because so far I've visited 3 times and I loved it from the very first visit. The students there are very welcoming and friendly. When I visited and stayed for a weekend, I made a couple of great people. The campus is far beyond beautiful.  I just felt like I belonged."
College Junior,5,I love every person in the nursing department. The professors are knowledgeable and approachable. The students too are willing to work together to help everyone succeed. It is a great and safe place to learn more and to make lifelong relationships.
College Sophomore,5,"In my field, the school is known for its highly specialized program of an MBA in Economic Development. I believe I would be better prepared for my field after completing this course of study. I do not believe I would have difficulty finding work with my experience and with this degree."
College Freshman,5,"There are tons of options to choose from, and at all different levels too. Professors are awesome because not only are they down to earth, but they genuinely care about the students and their success. Registration for classes is easy. Workload is average, but yet still nice because professors understand we have lives outside of the classroom. I do not know of any ""special"" study options, but there area lot of study areas on campus. Most people like the library because it has two floors. The main floor has average noise, and the floor above is has relatively low noise levels to help study better if need be. There are also plenty of study rooms which also helps."
College Sophomore,5,Potential employers know the quality of an education this school gives their students.
College Sophomore,5,I have never felt unsafe on campus even when leaving class at 9:45pm.
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Eastern. My professors are really amazing, and I feel really at home here."
College Junior,5,My professors have become second parents to me.
College Junior,5,Eastern has taught me to love what is beautiful.
College Freshman,5,"I feel very safe on campus, you can witness security walking around and being visible on campus"
College Freshman,5,They have job opportunities where you can apply throughout the year as well as a staff member designed to help students with careers after graduation and resume building.
College Freshman,5,"The professors care about their students in and out of the classroom, and people are friendly and make you feel welcome or like home."
College Freshman,5,"I was very doubtful about attending a Christian college, but I took a chance and let myself take a chance, and it was beyond worth it. I have never felt like I belonged anywhere until I arrived here. From having a great admissions counselor who was very efficient with communication via email, to having phenomenal professors who genuinely care about each and every one of their students. The classes they offer are various and if you want to be in a specific class they do their best to accommodate. If you are having troubles or struggles you can always find guidance from someone whether it be other students, teachers, or even counselors. The faculty at this university truly care about your education and success, and they are some of the most wonderful, kind-hearted people that I have ever had the honor of meeting."
College Junior,5,Eastern Washington is a place that allows my to grow has a person without being judged.Also people who go to this school are really friendly and always willing to help you out.
College Freshman,5,"Wayne is filled with resturants. Eastern's favorites include Chipotle, Panera, Five Guys... 

There is also great pizza shops and Chinese that deliver to campus for around 2 bucks."
College Freshman,5,"I really enjoy the rules on campus. Yes, they tend to be more strict than other campuses; however, you know what you are signing up for when you commit. It is a dry campus and visitation is taken very seriously. I enjoy that because it makes for a positive school environment. And visitation hours are very tolerable"
College Freshman,5,"There is not a party scene like most colleges, however we do have a student activities board that hosts amazing events like trips to skyzone and ice staking ALL FOR FREE!!!"
College Freshman,5,It's not too strict but strict in areas that matter the most.
College Freshman,5,"Campus and the surrounding area is for the most part safe. It's a state university, so occasionally students may be targeted for robbery. However, this in not a very common occurrence and Normal PD, as well as campus PD keep a presence around campus. The only real harm that could happen to you is being too irresponsible on the weekends, especially when alcohol is involved."
College Freshman,5,The campus is pretty safe. There is security everywhere on campus and they are easy to reach. The campus also encourages you not to walk alone at night.
College Senior,5,"My experience with financial aid was good, the faster you fill out for aid the better."
College Senior,5,I think the food and convenience is overall good for me
College Senior,5,I learn something new every time I attend class in early development in a child.
College Senior,5,I like  going to school every week
Freshman,4,My experience in Eastern has been very good so far. Everyone here is so nice and helpful. The rooms are pretty good and the food is not bad at all. They plan so many fun activities around campus for you to do. The professors are all very understanding and keep you up to date about any changes going on with the class or the work. I feel like I would change some of the rules if not actually keep up with them.  I would also change upgrade the security because sometimes they take very long to get  to us or don't even pick up the phone on the first call.
Freshman,4,The administrators are very nice to speak to over email/call and their website is very handy to use!
Freshman,4,"I loved visiting here and staying over the weekend! The girl I roomed with was not much of help. She left me, forgot about me, and forgot to pick me up from events multiple times. I got lost even though it wasn't that big of a campus. The environment was very welcoming, exciting, and fun. I am glad that I had the opportunity to sit in on a few classes too!"
Junior,4,"I took classes online, took exams online, and submitted all work online. They were very understanding with things changing and gave us a grace period but I feel the education was not the same. There was a lot more busy work and just in my opinion useless assignments."
Junior,4,"I really love the culture, the small school where you can know more people. I really appreciate that they teach at a Chrisitan point of view but also give us other ideas so we can decide for ourselves. I think they could work on the facilities and update some things to make it a better experience for the students. I also wish they tried to encourage more spirit for the school and have more events that were geared to students and sports."
Freshman,4,My learning experience at eastern has helped me improve my skills in learning and real-life experiences
Freshman,4,"Eastern university is a great place for a Christian college the professors are very helpful and are very open-minded, also the campus is very beautiful and overall a great environment, however, the food needs improvement"
Junior,4,"Small college campus, much different than my first big city college experience.  Smaller classrooms allow for better interactions with professors and students."
Alum,4,I had a wonderful experience at Eastern. It is small but it was the right choice for me and the size helped me get close with both friends and faculty. Opportunities are boundless if you are willing to put in the effort and take advantage of all that comes your way.
Freshman,4,"Beautiful campus, knowledgeable and loving Christian professors, great academics, but disappointing food and housing"
Freshman,4,The teachers are very passionate about what they do and genuinely care about all of their students. The classes are smaller so students get a more personalized experience and can develop good relations with each of their teachers. There is a strong sense of community on the campus.
Senior,4,"I enjoy the small campus and overall feel of the school. The faculty is kind and interested in the success of each student. While there has been problems in the past with faculty and potential bias, the administration has made sure it does not have an impact on the students."
Sophomore,4,"I like Eastern University very much. It's a really good university for many reasons. One reason is the professors here are very caring and really want you to succeed. They would take time out of there day to help you if you are struggling. Another reason this university is a good university is the students here are so caring and kind. They actually want to know how you are and they are really intrigued about your life. Somethings I would change about the university is the food. I just believe that the food could be better and healthier. Another thing I would change is the dorms. Most of the dorms are nice, but it needs to be more spacious and renovated."
Freshman,4,I like  the welcoming atmosphere and how friendly everyone was. The professors were always very friendly and kind. The students were not upset if they had to stop for 4 seconds to give me directions somewhere. The entire campus was absolutely beautiful and very interactive and fun!
Junior,4,"I like that the staff and professors are warm and welcoming. The campus is beautiful and very well taken care of.

The food can be improved and there should be more scholarship opportunities from the school."
Freshman,4,"To start off, this is a very beautiful school. The campus is gorgeous and the location is perfect. The professors truly care about your studies here. Getting to be apart of this school has been transforming me into an intelligent and driven young lady. I look forward to graduating from here."
Freshman,4,I like how the teachers are passionate about teaching. They enjoy helping students succeed. The food is great. What can they change is the dining hall and add more food places. I like this university education wise. They have so many programs such as Fast pass to help you succeed. They accept everyone no matter race or what you did in your life.
Sophomore,4,"When I first came to this school, I did not like it at all. Coming from a massive high school I did not know what a small school would be like. However, now in my sophomore year, I can say that I really do like it here. I have met wonderful friends and have great professors. People really do care about you as an individual here and it shows."
Freshman,4,"Eastern is such a great environment, I feel like I’m home when I’m at eastern. The teachers and staff are so kind and the friendships you create are the best!"
Freshman,4,"Eastern University is the epitome of what a  Christian University should look and be like. With an emphasis on service to others, the close-knit community that is created by the students (who are quite literally— from all parts of the world) and faculty members was always something that stood out to me, even prior to starting my academic journey here.  As a Freshman, I can hands-down say that have never felt more at home elsewhere than I do at Eastern. The Professors and academic programs are phenomenal. Now, of course no College is perfect; Eastern has it’s flaws: From the sub-par food & dining services, lack of a Football team, to other minor inconveniences, strict drinking policies, etc. However, I can definitely tell you from a student’s perspective, that Eastern is a fantastic University for not only Christians, but for ALL students. The academics, professors, student life, campus and surrounding area are quite unique from other colleges in the greater Philadelphia region."
Niche User,4,Eastern has a very nice environment and a decent cafeteria. If you're looking at a small university with a friendly environment. Eastern is a good choice.
Sophomore,4,"They weren’t clear with one of the grants that they awarded me- later taking away. Other than that, the staff and everyone has Been so helpful."
Sophomore,4,"I love the close knit community Eastern University offers. I appreciate the fact that class sizes are small enough that teachers know students by their first names. This in turn builds class unity and overall campus closeness. Also, the academics are highly regarded, and Professors go out of their way to ensure students are grasping the concepts discussed in class. I am excited for the my future career in Physical Therapy, and I know that Eastern University is preparing me well to serve others with physical impairments."
Senior,4,The campus is beautiful especially during the spring and fall. The professors and faculty are wonderful and are willing to help you.
Junior,4,I enjoy the beauty of Eastern’s campus. I also enjoy how small their classes are. It brings a level of intimacy in the classroom that you could not get in a larger school.
Niche User,4,"I visited Eastern University for registering for school. While my visit was short it was enjoyable. The staff were very helpful and the students were all around welcoming. The atmosphere was set for learning, there were classrooms with up to date technology. The facilities were really clean and modern. There was nice lounge areas and encouragement throughout the hallways."
Junior,4,"I love the atmosphere of the campus and the environment that is attributed to the campus. The teachers a very accommodating and approachable, especially the psychology department. I would change the food and the way the campus spends money. Other than that, it has been a great experience."
Sophomore,4,Some of the rules are a little bit much considering how much the school has changed since it first opened up. In a safe neighborhood and very quiet which is great during the week. For weekend get always Philadelphia is only a 30 minuet Drive and there’s tons to do. Professors are generally caring and want you to do well. Athletics are growing quickly to be a main factor in this campus
Senior,4,I like that it's a Christian college and the core values of the school is faith justice and reasoning.
Graduate Student,4,I am in my second year of graduate study and so far I love it! The classes are tough but worth it. I am pursuing a master's in counseling and I truly believe that Eastern is preparing me for a successful and rewarding career.
Sophomore,4,"Eastern does a great job of caring for their students. If you come here, you will be known by your professors, by the resident life staff, and by so many others on campus. You will be challenged in your way of thinking but you will be supported the whole time. Eastern is not the perfect school in any way, but it could be the perfect school for you. I like to think it was the perfect fit for me."
Sophomore,4,"I like the friendly family environment. I like the small class sizes and how the professors are always willing to talk and help you with anything you need. The food is not the best. There are also quite a few rules but overall, a good college."
Junior,4,"I really love the nursing program here. I think it is a rare thing to be able to discuss the beautiful connection between God, nature, science, and caring for others."
Freshman,4,"I like the community. I like how you can always find someone to relate or to talk to about whatever you are going through. I love that you can find people with the same faith as you and who want to grow in the faith as you do too. There is some type of club for everyone to join. If you like to party I would not prefer this school because the party scene on campus is absent. However, they do have activities on the weekends.  Eastern is a good school."
Senior,4,"Eastern is an expensive school but it loves its students. We truly live by the ""Faith Reason Justice"" motto that we've adopted. Student concerns are listened to and they are making changes that is helping to improve the University. The classes are small and you learn a lot. "
College Sophomore,4,I love Eastern. I pray that I will be able to stay.
College Freshman,4,Security is very present without being overbearing
Recent Alumnus,4,"I begin school at Eastern in the fall, I've visited campus, met professors, and sat in on classes. Everyone on campus is so kind and welcoming, and the population seems quite diverse. I know that I will gain a rich and irreplaceable experience from their Masters program."
College Freshman,4,"I won't be living on campus but I've visited and stayed for a weekend and it was great. They have a nice set of rules, they're very clean, it's quiet. It's a nice area."
College Junior,4,"The nurses from Eastern are well liked and have created a name for themselves. Graduating amongst them, I am confident in finding a job in one of the nearby towns."
College Junior,4,"The only complaint I have was that one of my professors used participation as a large part of the grade. Not participating enough cost me a lot of points, even though I did very well in every other aspect of the class."
College Junior,4,I think I have learned the most from living on campus. It allows me to have a life beyond the schoolwork and become friends with the people I live near for most of the year.
College Sophomore,4,I'm an online student but I do know of the safety issues and condition of the campus...from hearsay mostly.
College Sophomore,4,This school had exactly what I was looking for in a graduate course of study. It is challenging as well as exciting. I believe after finishing this study I will be more prepared than the average person in my field.
College Senior,4,"Some professors I love and owe my whole career to. Other I am thankful I never have to study under again. Those rare few aside, all my teachers have had an extensive knowledge about their content area. From gen-eds to major coursework all my professors have had a love for what they are teaching. They genuinely aim for the students to simply pass but to find the value in the subject and take some of the information with them into the future. The best part of this school is that many of the teachers integrate the classwork with their faith. You learn in the natural, but also have the opportunity to be challenged and grow spiritually. All professors are encouraged to incorporate, faith, reason and justice, but some seem to effortlessly and seamlessly exude their walk with the Lord into their class work. It is not uncommon to get a beautiful nugget of wisdom simply for chatting with them after class. 

The professors here actually like their jobs and their students. Office hours can be used for anything from homework help to a faith crises. They are supportive and encouraging.  That is not to say schooling is a walk in to park, holding us to high standards and giving us a 'run for our money' is common. Hard work is a must."
College Senior,4,"I generally feel safe around campus. Except at around 1-2am that what the creepy people come out. Other then that I feel safe. Not due to security though, they always take forever to answer whenever you call and take a long to to arrive. Not that they aren't wonderful people, some of the nicest folks you'll meet. Also the paths are not well lit at night, and the ""call in case of emergency posts do not all work""."
College Senior,4,"I love my school! 

But some things about it are less then stellar. The housing is very expensive, and the majority of the dorms are really old and worn down. The community bathrooms in older bathers get really disgusting. Some buildings, like mine last year, had a bee problem that had me and several others out of their rooms for 2-3 days. 

The food options are rather limited and portable healthy options are a little hard to come by. But the dining commons has a great salad bar and sandwich bar. 

The community at this school is wonderful! At any given time you can find a group of students discussing deep life questions, social issues, and theology, and a few tables down you will see others deep belly laughing with each other just being silly. The campus is aesthetically beautiful. There are several ponds with paths around them, excellent for a mind clearing study break or a cute #ootd photo with friends. 

I love 98% of my professors. Granted, you will come across one or two you simply can not stand. But for the most part I LOVE my professors, especially ones in my major. They have become some of my dearest mentors in my career, in faith, and life in general. They genuinely love their work, God, and their students. Constantly giving of themselves, always striving to provide you with the very best education they can. 

My program is like one big family: loving, a little quirky, but all extraordinarily hard working and supportive.

 

Our administration on the other hand has consistently been less then stellar. In my 3 short years I have seen the administration make several senseless large decisions without consulting anyone. Always causing huge backlash, disgruntled students and professors all around. Eastern's latest and probably largest 'stunt' to-date was cutting a thriving major, without so much as a warning. 2 out of the 3 full time staff members and professors were fired. Although it was one of the fastest growing majors at the school."
College Senior,4,"Eastern has been instrumental in my Christian formation.  The professors care about the students both in and out of the classroom.  They pray for students and are understanding.  The community on campus is very strong - from open doors  to Wednesday night student-led worship, I always knew that I had a strong group of friends on campus who cared deeply for me."
College Freshman,4,"Everyone knows at least one person who drinks on campus. It's also easy to find out who can get it for you, which is unfortunate since this is a Christian University. The peer pressure isn't noticeable. No one treats you differently if you decide not to drink. Policy enforcement is strict, but I hear it's inconsistent. I know some people who have gotten caught and got off with a warning, and others who have had to pay a $200 fine. That is one aspect I don't like, and is why I didn't give it 5 stars."
College Sophomore,4,Class sizes are kept small and professors really love the subjects they are teaching.
College Sophomore,4,Very friendly staff and students. Staff is not trying to make students fail and is willing to work with the students.
Recent Alumnus,4,I used to love the basketball games when I was an on campus student.
College Freshman,4,"In regards to safety, I would say that it is a relatively safe campus. I usually feel very safe. At night, there are some paths which aren't as well lit as others, but other than that I think it's pretty good. Campus security is also helpful about providing transportation to students as well."
College Junior,4,I never feel unsafe. Eastern is great in that way
College Junior,4,Templeton Honors College is great at this.
College Junior,4,The buildings feel like home to me now.
College Senior,4,"Never had a problem, other than dealing with the student advisers"
College Freshman,4,I have never really felt unsafe on campus. I have also never really encountered to many situations in which I would feel unsafe.
College Freshman,4,I love the professors and courses that I have encountered so far. They have been very helpful and always there when there is a question.
College Freshman,4,"The courses I have taken are great. Since the restructuring, it has been difficult to ignore that some great professors are leaving our campus. I would rather see the adjunct professors be taken away than the ones who teach more than one class. Some professors can be stingy, but most are great. I prefer smaller class sizes, but I do appreciate the size of the college in respects that all my teachers can know me by name."
Senior,2,"They claim to be a Christian school, however, do not live it out day in a day out. The administration and school as a whole do not take stances on certain issues which leaves students wondering where the Christian faith of the school impacts their daily life. The general education classes that are required are not helpful and some should be removed from the required list of classes. Professors are not understanding of the demands of a student athlete and struggle to be accommodating."
Junior,2,"Eastern University is a college that requires a certain taste from its students. The college is very small which allows for the student and teachers to have relationships that would not be found elsewhere. This allows for students to bond and thrive in certain classes. The downside of eastern is that the food is subpar, and the facilities are just as bad. For students who are looking for state of the art facilities, Eastern is not the place to go. Christians may find Eastern disappointing because of its liberal stance on things, and students who are not Christian may not like it because some rules may not make sense. All in all, Eastern is a good school if a student is looking for great relationships with teachers, and students. These relationships help get opportunities that others may not find. However, If one is looking for a school with state of the art academics and equipment, Eastern is the last place to look into."
College Sophomore,2,"My first year at my college I randomly dormed in Kea residence hall. I had to pay a large amount for a very poor quality room. The building was very old and one of the first residence buildings at Eastern University. In addition, the residence hall appeared to be never remodeled from when it was first established. Also in my building, the laundry room included washers and dryers that each student had to pay for. Most of the washers took in my quarters, but did not count them and I never retrieved the money I put in it."
College Freshman,2,"It depends which building you are in. I definitely do not recommend Hainer, it is one of the oldest buildings on campus and has a lot of issues including plumbing and hot water problems. The newer buildings are nicer, however a key problems is a lack of community within the buildings. There is really no social atmosphere for most of the buildings. Overall, I do not think the campus housing is worth the cost."
College Freshman,2,"It's a good school for commuters. It provides a good education, however the campus life and spiritual life is extremely lacking. Academics-wise, the education is good, however it is not excellent."
College Freshman,2,"I live in Hainer, so it is one of the oldest buildings. I wish for the amount of money I paid that it would be more clean and livable."
College Sophomore,2,"As a private school, Eastern is very expensive. And because I am a middle class student, it is difficult to receive the appropriate aid"
Recent Alumnus,2,The soccer field is the best but the gym is incredibly small and we need more space! We need a football team! There isnt a student center but i guess theyre working on it. There could be way more activities for our pleasure but theyre arent.
College Junior,2,Theres not much to do here relevant to parties since is a christian church and when they let the parties happen they put too much restriction and stuff which makes them not worth going
College Junior,2,The thing that has messed people up here at Eastern is the financial aid office they always have problems with papers missing from students when they turned them in paymensts being charged again when you did them and similar things such as scholarships forgetting to be renued when it is supposed to be something automatic. Some professors are not teachers they love the topic of the class but they dont know how to teach students the right way for them to be successful in the class. they are not pro students and they will fail you with just a simple thing. some classes have a lot of workload which i think is point less you just need the right amount of homework not too much and not too little but some classes they just do alot.
College Junior,2,Theres not much to do on campus to distract your mind for a little bit or when you have nothing to do. The housing are horrable they put 2 people in a room that can really fit only one or 3 people when there only fits 2 everything is all together in the rooms and they arent really comfortable. I dont like feeling like in a prison or something when i need to go to sleep. I prefer commuting but its a bit difficult to achieve to. plus the people dont keep things clean students are nasty.
College Junior,2,It is not a good transportation they  just take you to the train stop and thats it or to a parking lot a lil far from school. Having a car is the best option here
College Freshman,2,Our health center is only open 9-5 m-F...is this a joke??
Recent Alumnus,2,"Small Christian college, so there's not a while lot of nightlife. There are other colleges very close to the school to find that and downtown Philly isn't that far away."
College Freshman,2,"The female to male ratio is 7:3. Not only are there very few guys, but they're mostly dumb. They have offensive and narrow-minded ideas about women."
College Freshman,2,"Not many computers to use, printing is expensive, the wifi network is really fickle and disconnects on you all the time; it didn't even work for the first week last semester."
College Freshman,2,The library ought to be a lot bigger and have a lot more study rooms...and they should be sound-proof.  And the activities can be kind of clique-ish.
College Freshman,2,"It's very very difficult to get permission for off-campus housing at Eastern, which is frustrating because living on campus is very expensive and the food sucks.  If you can manage to get off campus it is worth it."
College Student,2,"Most of the students are Christians and the school is far from ethnically diverse, there are a few students from Philly of different ethnic backgrounds and there are Chinese exchange students, but there is not very many different ethnics."
College Senior,2,a lot of young people i dont know i do not associate eith anybody on campus
College Senior,2,I dont know i live in ann arbor out side campus there is a lot of crime
College Senior,2,"i have no idea i do not attend any and you wont let me sjip the question
"
College Senior,2,"there as been a  olt of crime stbbings deaths and rapes murders
"
College Sophomore,2,"The gym is not that great. The work out room needs a lot of improvement, because it is very small and barely has any machines. "
College Junior,2,"Eastern's meals in the cafeteria tend to be a bit poor and not appealing sometimes, but they do have other options in getting meals and food like the Eagles nest and jim and java, where you can get a meal you want or you crave in a somewhat reasonable price."
College Junior,2,"On whole, the process was very frustrating. The people are not very flexible nor easy to work with. However, if you jump through some hoops, there are plenty of options as far as covering tuition goes."
College Sophomore,2,"Eastern needs to institute a no-car policy for freshman. When you leave your spot, people flock to it faster than seagulls to a dropped french fry."
College Sophomore,2,On campus there is really nothing to do on campus. Eastern does not have parties on campus. If you want something to do at night you have to be willing  to go somewhere. If you enjoy hanging out with people watching a movie then you can enjoy being at Eastern. Philly isn't too far so if you have the money that is an option.
College Sophomore,2,"Eastern is a Christian school, so you have to expect that they care a lot about the morals of their students. They have rules about most things. The school has a lot of things you can get a fine for, including, yelling out of windows. Most of the time they want to work with people to find the real issue behind their action."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not enough parking spaces for all the students to have a good spot,  although depending on what time you are returning to the university you may be able to get a good space. Parking permits are going up in price but compared to other universities they are about the same cost. Freshmen are required to park in the west lot which is a lot off campus and security will drive you to and from this location as well as other locations. There is always parking spaces available here."
College Junior,2,The parking for those that have permits are pretty much every man for them selves. It is rare to find parking during the week and during events held at Eastern. On  the weekends not so bad. If one has a permit they would be fortunate to find anything at all.
College Junior,2,"While Eastern has very strict rules about have a dry campus and whatnot students are allowed to drink as long as it is not on campus. Many students drink in their dorm rooms anyways, if caught though there is definite consequences from a fine to expulsion depending on the situation."
College Junior,2,"Students can find off site apartments and sometimes its alot cheaper than living on campus. However, most are expensive and it takes several students to pool resources to live in apartment. Of course there are ads through out campus for roommates to share living quarters or local residents advertizing for boarders in their homes. Its all a matter of where to look."
College Junior,2,"I mean even though Eastern is a strict no drugs/alcohol policy, I am sure some students partake in these destructive activities. Its all who you hang around. For the most part students at Eastern seem to be fine and do not put such a high prioty on partying. Only students joke about the students at Carbrini College right next door as being the partyers."
College Sophomore,2,I have encountered very little of said Greek life.
College Sophomore,2,Scenery Is Beautiful – I really enjoyed walking around campus and seeing the lakes and animals.
College Freshman,2,"The Gymnasiums at Eastern University are the size of most high school gymnasiums if not smaller. There is only one building with two gyms inside, but there are too many activities during the school year it's hard to get any gym time. Although the gyms suck the rest of the facilities on campus are really good which is why I give the facilities on my campus a C."
College Senior,2,Hipster culture is prevalent. Many guys are in committed relationships. The ones who are actually single tend to lean on the weird side.  Hipster dress and lifestyle is the norm. Social culture is very similar to high school. There is nothing to do unless you go off campus to bars.
College Senior,2,"Off Campus – Eastern makes it very difficult to live off campus. You have to petition it and it takes a lot of time. Those who do get off campus often lie and say they are commuting to school. With that said, there are a variety of apartment complexes in the area, with okay parking and access to restaurants etc."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking near the dorms is very limited, as is parking near the classrooms. I have had many friends get parking tickets."
Freshman,1,"What can I say? DO NOT GO HERE. I transferred after first year it was unbearable at Eastern and I even competed in a sport. The professors do care but that doesn’t stop them from spreading their political agenda in any way they can, not all but most. Dining commons and rest of dining hours make me feel like I’m in high school . Same with dorms rules and all the rules on campus I feel like I had a babysitter with me. Go somewhere cheaper you will get a better education and have a much More fun time. THEIR IS NOTHING TO DO ON CAMPUS!!! You need to go to other colleges or off campus to do anything relatively fun. Oh and their is no security cameras on campus and it is so easy for anybody to get into any building !"
Alum,1,They dropped my major 2 years into my degree. As a result I basically had to start over as most of the religious courses required at eastern didn't transfer over to other schools
Graduate Student,1,Its like buying a tool that doesn't work. The only thing it did was put me in debt. How do I make a return.
Sophomore,1,"I was excited to visit eastern cuz my bf lived across the street at cabrini but I hate cabrini so I was like ok let me try eastern. anyway, when I first got there I walked onto the campus and felt like I was trapped inside a little dollhouse with weird people who only talked about the lord and mary and joseph. they don’t seem to care about education only church. there’s weird rules about boys and girls being together. anyway my stupid mom made me commit so i’m now entering my 2nd year and couldn’t be more miserable. the ribs are good and the fries but sometimes food isn’t even enough to keep me happy & that’s saying a lot cuz I love food. eastern sucks don’t go there unless u wanna become a priest or the virgin mary."
College Sophomore,1,"Eastern's underage drinking policies are extremely strict, making it very difficult to drink on campus. On top of that, there are 'Visitation' rules so that you can't, for example close the door or turn off the lights when there is a member of the opposite gender in your room. There are small groups, like the boy's lacrosse team, that live off campus and occasionally have high school-esque parties. Other than that, there's pretty much no party scene whatsoever, which is great for some people because they use their time to build relationships and have meaningful conversations. Unfortunately, the majority of Eastern kids end up watching movies (with the door open and the light on) every weekend. Lame."
Recent Alumnus,1,After 4 years.... After 1 year.... You HATE IT!
Recent Alumnus,1,I could categorize Easterns strictness as its biggest downfall for me. It's too overbearing. It's understandable for freshmen only because its most of their first time away from parental guidance. But after that? We are grown and it feels like we are being babysat.
College Freshman,1,We've barely had classes this semester due to extreme winter snow/ice storms.
College Freshman,1,"No drugs and alcohol are tolerated. You're not even allowed to be drunk on campus. So it's pretty lame if you're looking for a party. But, if you're more interested in spending time in conversation/exploring nature/watching Netflix it can be a lot of fun!"
College Freshman,1,Sodexo is terrible quality and gives you diarrhea on the daily.
College Student,1,"There is no Greek Life permitted on campus, the school's argument is that it is a Christian school, however, I believe we could at least have social clubs like other Christian schools."
College Senior,1,"Hard to survive on aid and hard to get any help at the financial aid department at this school, nobody in the office seems to want to help the seem to just want to go home
"
College Senior,1,I havr no idead the survey you have set up should be able to let you skip you willnever get any accurate anwsers
College Senior,1,i dont really now i do not associate with anybody on campus a bunch of young kids in there own world stuck up for sure
College Senior,1,"I do not like the cold weather , I dont want to walk around campus when it is cold"
College Junior,1,The parking is very crowded and very limited. The Freshman are also not allowed to have cars on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have a student center, and it is generally dead on weekends unless a special event is going on. The campus scenery is beautiful with wildlife, ponds, tree and paths but not much to do if you are not involved in sports"
College Freshman,1,"There are no ""parties"" on the Eastern University campus. If you want to party, or be involved in ""nightlife,"" your best bet would be to walk across the street to Cabrini (public college) or go to a athlete-owned house or apartment. The best thing to do on campus would be to play basketball, hang out in your friends dorm, or go to a campus-sponsored event."
College Freshman,1,It is hard to fix problems with the financial aid office.
College Senior,1,There's nightlife here? The campus is in the middle of a residential suburb. Not much around....

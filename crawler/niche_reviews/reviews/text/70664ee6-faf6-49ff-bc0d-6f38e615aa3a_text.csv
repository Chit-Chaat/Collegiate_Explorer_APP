Graduate Student,5,"Amazing college, wouldn't trade my experience for anything. Dedicated, inspiring faculty and kind and caring administration. The student community is diverse, friendly, kind, and involved. We support each other and listen to each other. Granville is ideal -- everything we need is right there in our beautiful village, but we have Columbus 20-25 min away."
Graduate Student,5,"Faculty were amazing in the emergency move to virtual learning during the quarantine. My professors adapted the schedule and demands for the second half of the semester, some did synchronous and some did asynchronous. All stayed in close contact with us. The administration maintained clear communication throughout the changing conditions."
Freshman,5,"I am currently a first year at Denison University. Denison is a small private liberal arts college in Granville, Ohio. I personally love this college, the campus is diverse and there is a level of community that I feel like I could not have gotten anywhere else. The campus and town of Granville are beautiful. I would highly recommend visiting Denison to get to personally know the atmosphere."
Freshman,5,I love Denison. It is such a tight knit community and everyone is so sweet to others. The professors actually care about you here and understand if you are going through hard times.
Niche User,5,"I love everything about it!!! The location, the campus size, the academics, the existence of the Knowlton Center, the athletics. It is my first choice college!"
Freshman,5,The whole admissions process was so fast and smooth. Itâ€™s January and I already have my acceptance and scholarship information
Junior,5,Denison University has given me the opportunity to be part of the Swim and Dive team while challenging academically.
Niche User,5,I loved the campus and everything it had to offer from academic side and the sport side. Being a student-athlete I have fallen in love with this school as it has shown me that is really is the best of both worlds for other students like me. I couldn't be more elated to share my experience with other people as well as receiving so much positive feedback on my top choice. Denison will be able to offer me a top notch education along with giving me an experience of a lifetime that I will cherish. I hope to be able to attend this school for the opportunity to live out my athletic dream plus prepare for the future as a bright young mind entering the work force.
Freshman,5,"A very beautiful college on the hill. Food is great. We have a sushi bar this year. Classes are fun and most professors are reachable. Overall, culture is moderately progressive. Too much biodiversity if you hate insects."
Junior,5,"I have loved everything about my experience so far.  I have made friends from different countries, socioeconomic backgrounds, genders, sexual orientations and friends who have opposing and differing political opinions than me.  I am challenged by my workload, but the professors do care and will assist with whatever help is needed."
Junior,5,"Overall, I've had a positive experience thus far. The professors are friendly and helpful, classes are interesting, food is good. Also, there is inclusion for everyone in every way."
Junior,5,"Denison is truly a phenomenal place to be and to study. Denison has some of the best professors in the country. Most of the classes have considerably high standards and there is no grade inflation. There isn't a ""typical"" Denison student. We are all free thinkers and very much ourselves. Compared to other similar top liberal arts colleges, we have the best and most modern facilities. Granville is an idyllic college town and has great restaurants and shops. The campus is one of the most beautiful in the nation. 

Denison is incredibly difficult to get into; our projected admit rate for this cycle (2018, class of 2022) is just under 30%. 

The people at Denison are some of the most intelligent, welcoming, and supportive individuals that I have ever met. They have made Denison my home."
Niche User,5,"Denison is the best! I love the small and campus and its location is idyllic. If I could change one thing, I would make Whit's serve more than two flavors at one times and of course lower the price of tuition."
Junior,5,"I love how the professors are very passionate about what they are teaching us. They are very understanding and work with our schedule during finals. The culture of the campus is very friendly and inviting. The school provides us with so many different cultural events that help us learn about other cultures. Through food festivals, dance, and other traditional rituals. There are mentoring opportunities so that we can give back and grow as individuals at the same time."
Sophomore,5,Great school! I feel that I am going to be able to be extremely sucessful once I graduate. The networking and connections that I have been able to make since i've been on campus is unreal. If you want to be sucessful then I would reccomend going to Denison.
Freshman,5,"Denison University is a great campus for the academic and student life. The courses are challenging but the professors always have their doors open to help. There is also a great mix of students. The diversity on this campus can be seen from any corner. Everyone feels safe here because campus safety is just a button away. Denison is a safe, fun, and challenging university that helps students unlock their full potential."
Freshman,5,"The campus is probably the most beautiful I have ever seen. Mix that with top notch professors that not only teach but care about their students. Small class sizes are the norm and because of that allow you to know your fellow student and your professors more intimately. I can't forget about the sports! Being an athlete myself, I can tell you that don't let this 'smaller' school fool you...almost every sport is represented here with superior athletes playing them. Glad I made the decision to attend this great school."
Niche User,5,"So welcoming, creative and diverse! A wonderful community with wonderful relationship building. Faculty members engage with students and want students to flourish, and don't do their job ""for the money"", but rather for the success of their students."
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy Denison University for the relationships it fosters academically and socially and the knowledge Denison provides for the future. They teach us to become moral agents and to never forget about the unending difference in the world. We need to be able to make decisions that foster growth and a stronger sense of community. I am extremely happy with the school as Denison cares greatly about every individual student.
Freshman,5,"I love the professors. The campus is super gorgeous, especially in the fall. Most of the people are super nice. It is very hard to be bored. Almost everybody stays on campus over the weekends."
Freshman,5,"Denison is a phenomenal place.  Classes are challenging but the professors are accessible and want you to succeed.  The Fine Arts building is amazing, as is the Mitchell Center athletic center, and a new/expanded music and theater facility is in the works. There is no single type of Denison student, there are artists, musicians, social justice folks, sustainability folks, jocks, liberals, conservatives.  Greek life is there, but not a big part of campus life.  I appreciate that freshman are together in freshman-only dorms since that helps developing good friendships.  Granville has enough for when you want to get off the Hill, and Columbus is close enough that you can get to major concerts etc.  Denison is the kind of school that sneaks up on you -- after visiting about 15 small liberal arts colleges, I realized how special a place Denison is.  "
College Junior,5,"The alumni network is great, not too big and impersonal, but small enough to feel close-nit. Career explorations is trying a few new things to help the students better prepare for work."
College Sophomore,5,I get to be a part of a small program that loves me
College Sophomore,5,At Denison relationships run deep. We care and love
College Sophomore,5,I would have never rushed if I went somewhere else
College Sophomore,5,At Denison you're a student not a number. I matter
College Freshman,5,I Love my college. It is so diverse and very fun!
College Freshman,5,"A lot of conversations on campus involve preventing sexual assault, the administration works really hard to prevent it form happening."
College Sophomore,5,"Since we have such small classes, I find that professors really care about students and are interested in their lives and participation in class."
College Sophomore,5,"The best... The best.... 

I am a transfer, and compares to my former college. Denison is the best."
College Sophomore,5,"If you happen to be interested in religion major, Denison has the best faculty members. But tough living environment"
College Sophomore,5,"Just be honest, every professor here is amazing! And btw Dr. Woodyard is the best!"
College Freshman,5,"the best, but can always improve."
College Freshman,5,"Alumni network is great, and they are still working on improving."
College Freshman,5,"Professor are great, especially my African studies trough film, Introduction to theology, First AID/CPR/AED and Chemistry 131. Great and helpful educators."
College Sophomore,5,"The academics and social life at Denison are great. The professors give you a lot of attention and want you to succeed. There are also many opportunities for internships, during the summer and academic year. The social scene is a also pretty good and there are many clubs/sports and other activities you can join. I almost went to a different, somewhat larger liberal arts school and I am glad I didn't. I'm very happy at Denison."
College Junior,5,Safety and security are very important to Denison. This past semester many security cameras were installed due to the fact that they are needed and a good use.
College Junior,5,"Academics are extremely important to Denison University. The registration process is almost like the Hunger Games, and so is housing lottery. Popular study spots are the library, Slayter, and basically all the academic buildings."
College Junior,5,More than half of the student body at Denison gets some sort of scholarship.
College Sophomore,5,Denison is opening to anyone. All types of people call Denison home and feel completely comfortable with their own individual styles
College Sophomore,5,Many small town shops and eateries create a delicious community atmosphere.
College Sophomore,5,The professors here are wonderful. Hard course challenge the brightest of minds
College Sophomore,5,I am a chemistry major and I couldn't be happier! I have loved all my classes thus far. The chemistry faculty are extremely helpful and caring. Small class sizes contribute to the development of meaningful and beneficial relationships with professors. Research opportunities are very feasible.
College Sophomore,5,"Denison is the most aesthetically beautiful campus I visited during my college search. The campus has odd traditions and activities such as Naked Week, a week dedicated to promoting self-acceptance by running naked around campus in student lead groups. Besides having events like this, the administration encourages students to create a campus in which everyone is comfortable and proud of."
College Sophomore,5,"Denison is a unique school in my biased opinion. Although it is quite small and located in an oddly-small town, it has a great group of students and faculty unlike any other campus. Denisonians are expected to have a great balance between intellectuality and social skills. This makes most students at Denison a unique specimen to examine."
College Sophomore,5,"International Studies is an up-and-coming major at Denison University. In the past, students would have to double-major when pursuing this major. Whether it was the lack of credibility or faculty advisory, this major was not a significant aspect of Denison. Because of this, most students still don't take the required courses seriously and discard the major as a whole. The toughest aspect of this major is that most students study abroad for at least one semester. Although it has been my goal to study in either Argentina or Spain, my current scholarship would not cover abroad tuition."
College Sophomore,5,"Granville is a quaint, adorable town. In the fall there are weekly farmers market on the main road and the town becomes very festive around the holidays. It is a safe town and the people of Granville are always friendly."
College Freshman,5,The swim team is awesome and attracts the most people
College Freshman,5,I know you can call some people to drive you to your dorm if you do not feel safe about walking back to your dorm.
College Freshman,5,"You don't really need a laptop. For my first semester I did not have a laptop, I always went to the library and labs. It actually keeps you more focused when you have to use computers under a certain time. Even when the library is closed there are other buildings that are still open, and labs near housing buildings that you can use."
College Freshman,5,Its very nice and pleasant.
College Freshman,5,"Out of all the colleges I applied, Denison was the one that gave me the biggest aid package."
College Senior,5,"I work in IT for the campus, so I may be a little biased, but the computer labs and services here are top-notch. We have many computer labs on campus that are up-to date, and printing is easy to do and included as part of your tuition. I would advise to have your own laptop just for personal convenience but a printer is completely unnecessary."
College Junior,5,"We are totally a prep school type of dress. Once you arrive on campus, you ca easily see what the latest fashion is trending."
College Senior,5,Every academic department I've come in contact with whether by hearing about it or taking classes in it have been great. I have loved most of the professors I have had.
College Senior,5,"It is very easy to get involved on campus and meet friends.  The small campus allows for seeing people a lot which I think really fosters those good, close friendships."
College Senior,5,"I have rarely gotten sick on campus.  Anything I've gotten was due to my own fault and the facilities on campus have provided almost anything I've needed to get better.  Campus is very safe with hardly anything negative events occurring, but when something does happen security is quick to respond."
College Freshman,5,"Even though Denison is a small school, I can definitely feel a sense of team spirit where sports are concerned. The athletics center can accommodate many sports and activities for those who want to train for a sport and those who just want a good workout."
College Freshman,5,"Beyond the bar, there's not exactly much in town. That said, the campus makes up for it and then some. We go very very hard on the weekends and some wednesdays, and no one seems to mind that we don't have more bars."
College Freshman,5,"It's really difficult here. There are very few easy A's, and even those will require some legwork. That said, you would be hard pressed to find a school with professors who care more about their students than Denison. I've had dinner with three of my professors already, and I'm a rising sophomore. It's what learning should be."
Niche User,4,"Denison is the school where everyone tells you that you get out what you put in.  I put everything I had in that school and I still hated it quite a bit...I transferred after my first year, actually.  Most people like it alright, I had only met maybe a half a dozen people who really loved the school.  The location is really terrible, but the campus is one of the most beautiful I have ever been too.  The staff and professors are amazing, and they work incredibly hard to try and see each student succeed, they really care about their work and what they're teaching."
Sophomore,4,"Denison University prides itself on the relationships fostered on its campus between faculty, students, and staff. The classes and extracurricular activities emphasize the importance of connecting with others, especially with the community. Professors on campus genuinely care for their students, and they are often available when a student has questions or needs assistance with coursework. While the school is small in size and student numbers, the amount of resources Denison provides its students is not. The university's mission statement, stressing the importance of students becoming ""autonomous thinkers, discerning moral agents, and active citizens of a democratic society,"" is reflected on campus by the initiative of its students and by the engagement of its faculty and staff. Denison University, while flawed like every other school, is a great liberal arts college and has become my home on the hill."
Freshman,4,Professors did the best they could under the circumstances. They were thrown into a tough spot during the covid pandemic and made it tolerable.
Senior,4,Many opportunities but the administration is very whitewashed and does not have good communication with its students on important issues.
Junior,4,"Denison experience is what you make out of it-it has pros and cons, but this institution benefits me more.

Administration and Financial Aid are awesome! Tons of on-campus job opportunities and extracurriculars. Dorms and dining halls are average and you can cope with them. Party scene...urgh. Campus is cliquey; greek life+people stick with their racial groups in public spaces. Denison is trying to promote inclusion and it did bring some diversity on campus but still working on that integration part.

Academics are great! I got the most satisfaction out of classes when I chose professors who are demanding as hell but want the best for their students. Relationships do run deep with faculty members. I was not the most competitive student when I got accepted to Denison but professors I met here turned me into an A student. Coursework is challenging, but professors are accessible and will answer your questions, go over your essay, and give recommendations if you just go to office hours."
Sophomore,4,"I love the connections and opportunities you can have at a small school. Denison offers a unique experience to thrive in a tight knit community while pursuing academic, athletic, and extracurricular activities. The staff in all departments are very helpful for students to resolve any needs. It is very easy to take advantage of the chance to develop a meaningful relationship with multiple staff members."
Sophomore,4,There are many things about Denison that I love; the campus is beautiful and the students are very diverse and compassionate. I like how the classes are structured and how close-knit the students are. One I would change is having a wider range of things to do outside of academics.
Sophomore,4,"Besides being in the middle of nowhere, Denison is a university that I've come to like for its academics and easy access to opportunities and connections. Expect a rough transition at first, but an overall rewarding experience if you put in the work with flexible and caring professors along with student body help."
Junior,4,Denison has very good professors who always are willing to work with students. It needs to work on the mental health facilities to help students struggling with mental health problems.
Freshman,4,"I've made many memories and great friends at Denison, however like anything good there are things to fix. One would be the strange 11-1 period during which you can't use declining balances at Slayter. Another would be the way certain areas of campus are shrouded in darkness at night time."
Freshman,4,"My professors are cool for the mosf part, as are the people I've met here. The only problem is that it's not as recognizable a name and Financial Aid won't give me that $7k that would have me on a full ride."
Freshman,4,Beautiful college and many different things to do while in college.They have excellent recreation center.The college provides generous scholarship to international student and has diversity.
Sophomore,4,"I love this community. We are caring and our relationships run deep. I often times find it hard to see a strong connection between our administration and our student body. Our concerns are not always taken seriously enough which is bothersome. Although they mean well, some students are cared for more than others and some professors are not given the acknowledgement they deserve. We have our problems but for a small liberal arts college in the middle of Ohio we hold our own in ways that I constantly impressed by."
Sophomore,4,"Denison University has a small, beautiful campus in the quant town of Granville, Ohio. The community is very close-knit with only about 2,000 students. However, there are always new people to meet and new organizations to become involved with. One problem that the campus faces is that it is know to be segregating into cliques.  Most students are very academically driven and focused. Classes are small and often quite challenging but professors are always willing to help. Professors and students work very closely and often conduct research together over the summers and through out the school year. Overall, Denison fosters an amazing community environment and provides a great education in almost any field. However, there are not many major options, so look into their options before applying. The dorms are very average and so is the food. There are not many options for food on campus but the restaurants in the town are quite delicious."
Freshman,4,"I really like Denison because the staff are amazing. The campus is beautiful and always clean.  The education is very challenging, but I think that is great because we are learning more. "
Junior,4,"Denison University is a wholesome and endlessly giving environment, full of different niches and unique people from all around the world.   The moment I visited campus, I knew I would find myself loving and enjoying everything that Denison had to offer. The classes are interesting and full, and the professors are patient and helpful. They are always willing to lend a hand and an ear, and at times, a shoulder to cry on.  The community aspect at Denison is indescribable, and well worth the four year on-campus residency it enforces. I have met and exceeded my greatest challenges while there, at the same time as receiving and learning every single day. "
College Freshman,4,"Denison isn't perfect. It's a wealthy school that can be very stuck up. But if you're there for an education, there's no place better. The academics are amazing no matter what you're studying."
College Junior,4,"Walking alone at night can be a bit scary, but there are measures to take."
College Junior,4,"It's a great school and the professors are amazing, but the food could use some improvement."
College Sophomore,4,It's great if you make it. Housing lottery sucks
College Sophomore,4,We may not be D1 players but we have D1 hearts.
College Freshman,4,I'm not a good atheltic person but the teams are great.
College Freshman,4,"I feel like I've learned a lot academically at Denison, but I really value the social skills I have learnt as weel."
College Freshman,4,"There is a great alumni network at Denison, also the center for career exploration is ready and willing to  help everyone find their dream jobs."
College Freshman,4,"Denison is a campus you either love or hate, ironically either way you will have numerous opportunities to succeed thrown at you."
College Freshman,4,I'm having a great experience so far.
College Freshman,4,THe school is bing on preparing students for the future and connecting us to alumni when needed.
College Freshman,4,I live in a small house and thoroughly enjoy it.
College Freshman,4,I enjoy my professors and the people I interact with on the daily basis.
College Freshman,4,I heard some great things from alumni
College Freshman,4,Most of the professors are amazing! The class sizes make each class feel safe and comfortable.
College Freshman,4,Living on campus is great!
College Freshman,4,"Love the school, classes are interesting and engaging.  There are plenty of opportunities available to the students who want to take advantage of them!"
College Sophomore,4,Students really care about one another and how everyone's behavior affects the community.
College Sophomore,4,"As far as I know, Denison does really well with connecting students to alumni and internships to further their success."
College Sophomore,4,"While sports do not dictate the lives of everyone on campus, both varsity and intramural sports bring students together to form a tight knit community that I am proud to be a part of."
College Sophomore,4,"I love being able to study a variety of things outside of my major and the freedom to explore fields that I previously had never encountered or thought of, Queer studies for example!"
College Sophomore,4,Really helpful advisors and professors that can give you great references
College Sophomore,4,"Most of them are really postive people, but there is also no lack of douches"
College Sophomore,4,It is great compares to the size of this college.
College Junior,4,"I have great friends, and good relationships with professors."
College Junior,4,Greek life works very hard to be accepting of all.
College Junior,4,"As far as learning goes, Denison is wonderful.  However, our diversity is not great, and we need to strive to create a more accepting environment for diverse students."
College Freshman,4,The safety and security on campus is great.
College Freshman,4,"They do great things for the campus, and the community."
College Freshman,4,"Students are very supportive to other students involved in school sports. Educators, coaches including the president are very supportive to the students activities on campus."
College Freshman,4,"The only thing is that, the student account would be more understanding that in live people face  difficult times financially.Be more patient, and understanding the situation a student or family is facing that delay payment."
College Sophomore,4,I love the diversity of my school and the opportunities it offers. The extracurricular are variant and engaging and the programs that my school offers to help with career opportunities have been amazing.
College Freshman,4,Everything about this school is good.  Minus the girls.  If your looking for good looking girls they aren't here.
College Sophomore,4,"With Denison being a small school, the experience you gain is so much more meaningful. You're able to develop a stronger, more professional relationship with your advisors and professors because classes are small. Plus, the the spirit and energy each student carries for the school is seen everyday throughout campus. The friendships and memories are ones that remain with you even after you graduate."
College Junior,4,"So far my experience has been mixed; my freshman year of college I struggled and as a result my grades dropped dramatically and I didn't have a lot of friends. It was very rough but my sophomore year was very different! I had a lot of friends and I started enjoying my classes and reached out more. I am in a very different place now, but I'm glad I chose Denison."
College Sophomore,4,its my kind of scene
College Freshman,4,"One street away from Denison's main entrance you will find a variety of small bars and restaurants. Moe's BBQ has great food and a full bar upstairs with different entertainment on different nights such as performing bands, trivia nights, karaoke, open mic, and private parties. There is also a couple pubs, Mexican food, ice cream shop, Asian food and a CVS to stock up on necessities and snacks, all on one convenient street. For students that don't have a car on campus, these options are great and walking distance."
College Freshman,4,"Denison is a school of great academic rigor in classes but still understands that we are teenagers that do not always obey all rules and regulations. Rules are meant to be broken once in a while, as long as we still get our work done and aren't harming anyone, it's not a big deal. Administration is pretty lenient and attendance policies vary from professor to professor"
College Freshman,4,"It is an awesome party scene for such a small college. Of course, it doesn't compare to the party scene in major universities but I love that such intelligent groups of people can work hard all week on their academics and party just as hard on the weekends! When you go to the senior apartments on the weekends, there is almost always about 10 different parties going on. The best part is that even though these are frat/sorority parties, everyone is welcomed after 11 pm and if you get bored (which you won't) there are always other parties going on in very close proximity."
College Freshman,4,"The financial aid process went fairly smoothly for me being a mid-year transfer student. However, I had to make multiple phone calls to make sure everything was being processed since it was not being updated on the website and had to make more phone calls to make sure they processed my student loan quickly."
College Freshman,4,"Overall the cafeterias usually have pretty decent food, especially breakfast. On certain days, the cafeteria food isn't great but there is always the option to get good at Slayter and even better food at The Nest after 8pm. including flatbreads, melts, mac & cheese, etc. When you want to have a quick meal during the day in your room, Curtis Express offers great to go options but the downfall is that they run out early and is not an option on weekends."
College Freshman,4,"My freshman college dorm is very spacious compared to the usual small dorms that small universities have. It is also very clean and quiet when it needs to be. Staff maintain the building clean and functioning but sometimes the rooms get cold, especially during the winter (which is long)."
College Freshman,4,Faculty is very supportive and helpful.
College Freshman,4,I have not had an internship yet but I hear it is great.
Sophomore,2,"Professors are caring.  The administration does not want what is best for their students, rather they want to look appealing in the public news.  They will not act on anything until it goes public then they will expel you.  The food is the same thing every other day and feels like I'm eating sawdust.  The campus is pretty.  Social life is either good or bad.  Depending on who you associate yourself with, you will find fun or not but this is no Ohio State party scene.  The dorms suck and feel like you are on a cruise ship because it is so small."
College Freshman,2,There could be more to do off campus.
College Freshman,2,There are not many options when it comes to off- campus food in the area unless you have a car.
College Sophomore,2,"Denison is located in Granville, OH, which is a considerably small town. Granville does not allow chain stores or restaurants within the town for some reason. This makes small mom-and-pop joints as the only off-campus dining options within Granville. Along with having a small variety of restaurants, most close at an early time. This increases the importance of having a car or friends with cars."
College Freshman,2,"Personally I believe the Greek Life portrays such a bad image of Denison. It feeds the status quota of what it is usually associated with what it means to be an American. It is not like this for all sororities. They cost a lot to join, they do have scholarships but they are limited. If these frats and sororities need money they can raise it other ways, it separates classes (rich and poor). Hazing is a big problem. Drinking is a problem in Greek Life. Out sororities and frats are separate from our multicultural ones. Though these are problems they do not directly affect Denison as a whole, but they do affect the people in them and associated with them. It is a secret problem no one talks about. Is what I personally believe in. They do create great connections for when you graduate, but anyone can build that by joining clubs or volunteer work. But also I feel Greek Life has changed for the good in some ways, they have a little diversity in them. Still so not as much as I would like them to have."
College Freshman,2,"Parties are hectic and nasty. People get belligerently drunk and loud. There are many cases of sexual assault that go unnoticed. There are, though, many great events and activities outside of this factor. Such as musicals, plays, clubs, or NAKED WEEK. This is a week where people get naked and run through the campus to grow awareness for body image."
College Sophomore,2,The town is cute and there are many nice people but very conservative.  Not much will change.
College Sophomore,2,The parties at school are small and get shut down earlier and tend to be really rowdy.
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life kind of sucks.  The school is cracking down on hazing, the small parties get shut down very early, and no greek life people can live in their houses.  Seems like a waste of time and money.  They are good for charity work, but community service groups are much more efficient.  Good way to make friends though."
College Freshman,2,"There's no transportation unless you have a car or know a friend with a car. That doesn't matter anyway, though, because there aren't many places around. There are a lot of parties on campus, though. They're alright."
College Freshman,2,"There's pretty much no off-campus living. There's a chance that you might be able to get a place off-campus, but it's very slim because everything is residential. Everyone lives on campus because any place they usually would be able to find wouldn't be in Granville and would be too far to be worth it. However, if you are able to find a place, they're usually cheaper than living on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"There are very few places to go eat off-campus, unfortunately."
College Sophomore,2,It could be a lot better. Half the time you end up standing outside the party.
College Sophomore,2,We don't really have any sort of transportation at Denison because it's a small campus.
College Senior,2,"Denison touts that it a diverse school, however the student body is very very white and wealthy. I really hated that the students segregate themselves so that the students who are of similar backgrounds all group together, making it really hard to become friends with someone different from you. There are a good number of racial minority and international students, but not enough to make much of a difference."
College Sophomore,2,"It's central Ohio, so it's basically insane: snowing one day, in the 50's the next, raining for a week in May, spring-like weather in February, many inches of snow in the winter, hot and muggy in the summer. I'm from central Ohio, so I'm used to it, but it was a definite shock to a lot of people from other parts of the country/world."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm going to just lay it out: the majority of Denison is white, straight, Christian, rich, and conventionally attractive. There is diversity, and there are groups for just about every type of minority that you can think of, but it is still hard to realize that when you're in a completely homogeneous classroom. It's a very tolerant campus in many respects, but it can be very difficult to be a minority sometimes."
College Freshman,2,Whoever said that Denison was only 30% greek life completely LIED. the first semester as a freshman is great because all the parties are open. But once rush has happened after january the parties become exclusive and the majority of people that like to go out for that matter are in greek life. If you dont want to be a part of it here but still want to have fun on the weekends you might come across some issues. it can really put a damper in your social life.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The reason I rate housing so low is that there just aren't a whole lot of choices/flexibility. I am sure some/many of my classmates would grade housing even more poorly. You are essentially forced to live in dorms while you are in school here. Your first year it's awesome, because you have never lived there before, and a big part of the experience is about meeting new people, which is easy to do. Don't think it makes much difference where you live your first year. West Quad (Shorney, Smith, Curtis) is younger - all freshmen and sophomores. East Quad is bigger and you have a better chance of meeting older people if you live there. If you are a dead serious student (and especially if you play a sport), and have no intention of joining a fraternity/sorority I would consider living in one of the fraternity houses...Like SAE, Sigma Chi, or Chamberlain.  After your first year (years 2,3,4,beyond), it can be frustrating/maddening. You are attending a boarding school located on top of a hill. The housing lottery is horrible. The only reason it's not even worse than a C- is because I knew somewhere in my mind what I was signing on for. The best thing about Denison are the people there. You will meet a lot of smart/friendly/interesting people"
College Freshman,2,"There are lots of attractive guys and girls, and of course, a few unattractive ones. It's rare to see someone overweight, most people here seem to be active. There are a lot of wealthy people here that often come off as snobbish. Also, a more prevalent Greek life than I expected."
College Freshman,2,"Denison is trying to increase the diversity, but I feel like the overwhelming majority is white, upper/middle class, straight, and Christian or Jewlish."
College Freshman,2,No Greek housing. Greek life isn't really noticed.
College Freshman,2,"They claim to value diversity in admissions, but it really is an upper-middle class white dominated campus."
College Freshman,2,"Slowly degrading due to the general idiocy of the current freshmen and some choice sophomores. This will likely be in the D-range next semester when party registration kicks in. Granville PD has been brought on campus recently, and there is no sign that arrests will not continue. Be wary."
College Junior,2,"For the tuition price I think the food should definitely be better. Curtis dining hall typically has two hot meal options and then always a salad and sandwich bar, cereal, stir fry, pizza, desserts, fruit and soups. Huffman is very similar but this year I have noticed that they don't always have two hot meal options or any pizza and the lines for sandwiches are long. For the dining hall it can be a hit or a miss, sometimes there is really good food and sometimes I am simply not enthused by any of the food. On week nights there is an alternative option for dinner at our student union in Slayter called meal-x. It is just a regular dinner swipe and you can pick from a few different entrees and have 2 sides and a dessert I believe. Meal-x is a really popular option on campus and it is nice because you can take the food to-go to the library or just take a quick study break and go to dinner. The meal plans are pretty average, I like meal plans B and C because they come with flex dollars which is really nice to use in Slayter."
College Junior,2,"there are choices, but it is never very good and makes people feel sick after"
College Senior,2,If you are an upperclassman parking options are somewhat reasonable. On the whole I feel that there are not enough parking options around campus.
College Senior,2,Nightlife here isn't crazy. People definitely go hard but there isn't a ton to do because of the isolation of the campus and how Granville doesn't like college students. But most people came here for the academics anyway
College Junior,2,"There are only dorm room parties because it is a residential campus. They are sweaty, and there aren't many other options."
College Senior,2,The meal plans are expensive and the food isn't that great. Its edible but nothing that we brag about. I hear they are working on improving it soon though.
College Junior,2,"I'm from the south, so I wasn't used to the colder, longer winters that Ohio gets. But I just bought a big coat and dealt with it. The Fall and Spring are beautiful, but it tends to rain a decent amount in the Fall."
College Junior,2,"Party life at Denison is Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. Parties are usually hosted by fraternities in hot, sweaty dorm rooms. Expect dirty grinding and hooking up with random people. You may need to be intoxicated to attend a party, depending on your tolerance for drunk people. Some nights can be a blast if you are with a great group of friends, but some nights can be a total flop."
College Sophomore,2,Denison does not provide any regular shuttles to Newark or many trips to Easton. Luckily many people have cars on campus and are available to drive.
College Junior,2,"It rains every Monday in the Spring, which is depressing. The winters are cold and it snows a lot, but classes never get cancelled unless there's an ice storm and the professors can't get up the hill."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Turn 21 Fast â€“ Unless you are old enough to go to Brews II, then be prepare for hot, sweaty, cramped dorm parties.  They are a rite of passage for any freshman and most end up liking them. By Junior year, you will never want to go to another dorm party. (You will be at the bar though.)"
College Junior,2,"Whistler Is Okay. Whistler is okay, but they never really are good at diagnosing people with what they actually have. Also, they normally take an extremely long time to get you in and normally take awhile once you get there."
College Junior,2,"People Are Attractive, Yet Some Are Rude. I love Denison, but some of the people can be rude because they're from richer families and it can be annoying. The guys are not really dating material because all they want to do is hook up with girls and that's about it. It's rare to find someone to date at Denison."
College Junior,2,"Drugs Won't Bother You If You Do Not Use Them â€“ Drugs are definitely on campus, but as a non-drug user it doesn't effect me at all.  I have never been pressured or been encouraged to use drugs at all.  If you want to get some they are there, but it is easy to get away from it."
College Senior,2,"There aren't enough spots for the amount of students that drive.  Sometimes, it's easier to walk than to drive and spend time finding a parking spot."
College Junior,2,"It's Plain â€“ So here's the big thing about Denison food it's average for the most part but at times it can very bad.  The pizza will be like this odd mix that just looks so wrong, or the stir fry station will have nothing good to mix with. If you are looking for a school with amazing food and many options this is not the school for you, but the food is not too bad for the most part."
Freshman,1,"Elitist snobbery at its very finest. Very exclusionary and highly over-rated. Full of over-privileged spoiled brats who look down their noses at everyone else. Went looking for a rich college experience, found high school part 2 - cliques, gossip, favoritism, all of the stuff I was trying to get away from. And do not bother with the women's basketball program - the coaches are a pair of militant lesbians who chase away anyone who does not fall in line with their world view. A completely disappointing experience in every way."
Senior,1,Sorority and Fraternity life dominate campus social scene. Varsity athletes are favored on campus. The majority of the professors I have had have been knowledgable but not supportive and absolutely uninterested in getting to know me outside of the classroom.
Sophomore,1,"The only thing great about it is the class sizes. The school does very little for the students of color, the food is  terrible and sometimes isn't labeled which is important for those with dietary restrictions, and the school is not diverse at all.  Very disappointed when I started my freshmen year. Some students have no respect for others and greek life is a huge thing."
College Sophomore,1,if you live of campus you basically have to be a millionaire.
College Freshman,1,"It's cold all the time, but it looks beautiful during fall and sumer. The rest of the year is grey and cold."
College Sophomore,1,The food here sucks. It makes me sick just thinking of it.
College Sophomore,1,"The dorms suck, but the school cover's it up because we know nothing else.  The apartments are disgusting because they are forced to throw parties in them.  Nothing is spacious or clean."
College Freshman,1,"There are a few international students at Denison and the international office is great, but the campus is quite visibly white. The cliques seem to be quite racially divided and the admin is attempting to resolve these issues, but to no avail. The typical white jock rules the social scene and is the most viewed figure on campus."
College Senior,1,"Parking spaces are pretty crowded since there isn't a whole lot of room on the hill. Parking doesn't really get good until you are a junior, but even then, depending upon where you live it can still be bad. Parking permits are now up to $100 which I think is pretty egregious for how little parking spaces there are."
College Sophomore,1,"Like with Greek life, even though the majority of Denison students (claim that they) don't drink, alcohol is a huge influence on the party and social scene. You can get alcohol almost anywhere on campus, and most RAs are willing to overlook alcohol, even in a freshman dorm (i.e. as long as it's hidden they don't care). Most Saturdays and Sundays, depending on where you live, there will be physical evidence (bottles, beer cans) of parties that had happened the night before. The past year (2012-2013), we had more hospital transports in the first semester (something like 21 in the first few months) than in the 2011-2012 school year all together. There is also what is called a Medical Amnesty Policy where, as long as you call security for yourself, you can receive medical attention without academic consequences (although they write your parents and make you go through a class thing).  As far as drugs go, I've only ever heard of people smoking pot, but I'm sure that more goes on. I'm sure that the administration is trying to enforce policies more, but they could definitely do better. At least they've had enough motivation too lately."
College Sophomore,1,Parking is horrible for the simple fact that grade level can't park near their dorms. Freshman have to park way in the boondocks somewhere which is literally off campus. Sophomore have to part their cars on the opposite side of campus from where their dorms are. It's just really horrible
College Freshman,1,Administration is going to the extreme to enforce student safety
College Freshman,1,Most students have absolutely zero love for the crap Sodexo serves in the dining halls right now. Limited options and near constant repeats of recipes. For as much as we pay in tuition it's really inexcusable
College Senior,1,There is no off campus housing which completely sucks but is understandable. We're just not that kind of school.
College Junior,1,"Strictness for partying is pretty relaxed. As long as students don't carry around open containers, are clearly underage drinking, or are making too much noise after quiet hours, the security will not interfere. The security on campus is really helpful at keeping the students safe. Drug use however is taken with a much more seriously, but drug use is not uncommon on campus. The health center and security have a medical amnesty policy which is more centered on student health and safety rather than busting illegal substance use or underage substance use. This policy is really nice for students and is well respected on campus. The thing that stands out to me as the biggest offense that the school approaches strictly, is cheating and plagiarism."
College Senior,1,The food and dining options on campus are very poor and limited. There are only two dinning halls and the food options available in these dinning halls are not very good. I find many students not wanting to be on a meal plan because they are expensive. Especially the food in slayter is completely overpriced and the options are again limited. I feel that Denison should break there contract with sodexo and start working with local organic food companies.
College Junior,1,"Denison is a residential all four years, which results in a closer community, but many frustrations. Many of my friends that attend larger universities live in apartments their freshman or sophomore years. By the time you are a Senior at Denison you can live in Denison-owned apartments which is great! However, 3 years is a long time to wait to live there. 

Satellite housing is substance free and there are only 3."
College Sophomore,1,"Low Point â€“ This is definitely Denison's worst quality in my book. I'm not saying that I never had a good meal, but they were few and far between. Curtis and Huffman (the two dining halls) are fairly typical in that they have a Deli, pasta/pizza, salad bar, and grill daily and they will usually have one or two other options in addition to vegetarian/vegan options. I find myself spending way too much money eating out."
College Sophomore,1,"For a campus that prides itself in being so diverse, its incredibly hard to see it as such. I have never sensed any sort of racism from the general campus, but the cold hard truth is that there is a $*it ton of white kids. The school sort of lives up to its reputation as a preppy-white school."
College Freshman,1,"A Campus Divided â€“ I was hoping for Denison to be something really special. But after spending a year here, I can honestly say that it hasn't been worth traveling far from home and dealing with the terrible weather. There is not a united sense of community here. Yes, you will find the large majority of people here privileged Greeks, but there are hipsters, intellectuals, nerds and any other category you can think of. The issue is that groups don't interact. If you (like me) can't be categorized by these limiting categories, it's very difficult to find friends here. Honestly, the social scene here seems more stereotypical ""high school"" than my high school experience was. The classroom experience isn't much better because there is a competitiveness amount students that doesn't match up to the academic expectations here."

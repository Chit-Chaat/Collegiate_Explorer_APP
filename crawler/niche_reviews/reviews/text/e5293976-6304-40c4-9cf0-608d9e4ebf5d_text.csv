Sophomore,5,The switch to online classes this past semester was smooth sailing for PNCA. All of my teachers and the faculty accepted the change and made it possible to improve and grow along with it.
Sophomore,5,Attending Pacific Northwest College of Art has been an entirely positive experience in my life. The teachers have all been incredibly supportive and have helped me developed my talents far more than I thought possible.
Sophomore,5,So far I've really enjoyed this particular art school. It is a very small community but well connected. It is very diverse and inclusive as well as having many opportunities available. I have been able to travel since starting and joining clubs. The faculty and staff are there to guide you in the direction you need/want to go in the art world. Being based in Portland gives great opportunities to show your work and I have felt nothing but excitement being a part of this school.
Sophomore,5,"All the teachers I have has have been very kind and supportive, they are always willing to help if you ask. The classes are targeted for your success, but they are challenging. The only issue I have with PNCA is the non-art classes, in particular the math and science classes are far too easy and do not seem to be worth taking except that they are required."
Senior,5,"PNCA is a gorgeous, inclusive space for all different types of creatives. I really feel that I am free to be myself here and there are many different settings to hang out and do homework in - which is important to me. They have all of the special tools, and computer programs that you need for your degree right there in the school. There are also great job resources here."
Graduate Student,5,"Pacific Northwest College of Art is a world class art school with some of the best staff, studios and facilities I've ever seen. My only wish is that it was a bit cheaper!"
Niche User,5,I have applied to the school and so far they do reach out and offer help to all students throughout the whole application/acceptance process.
Junior,5,"I've been attending PNCA for four semesters and arrived as a transfer student. With my prior college experience, I can truly affirm that PNCA has a faculty and staff that are dedicated and committed to helping their students toward becoming better makers, designers, and artists. The culture here is strong and encourages us all to become better individuals by helping our fellow students. I haven't experienced comradery like this from faculty, staff or students from any college I've attended before.
The workload is very challenging at times. But I don't think that I'd become a better creative without doing the work and being pushed. 
There is plenty of resources and support available that I wouldn't normally have access to. Whether that be coding, alternative photographic development techniques, creating music, getting better at yoga or 3d printing, to name a few."
Freshman,5,"As a Freshman and a non-traditional student, I was extremely nervous. PNCA does an extremely wonderful job to ensure the safety and the well being of their students. There are so many people who are there willing to help you and wanting to see you succeed."
Niche User,5,"I really enjoy the school, great atmosphere everyone enjoys going to their classes and the teachers are just a great help to push us to do our own style.
One thing I would like to see there to be a change is to see a wide diverse community in PNCA, overall its an amazing school in my opinion."
Sophomore,5,"I love this college. As a non-traditional first year, I have felt very welcomed. The staff and faculty are friendly and inspirational.  They encourage every student and work with each to allow them to thrive."
College Sophomore,5,"Pacific Northwest College of Art has a great variety of classes. Depending on your major, you have a lot of classes to choose from and it's likely that you will have to take all of the classes that are provided for your major throughout your 4 years. The classes are very interesting too, and the professors know so much about their topics. They truly love what they teach, and that inspires me to learn so much more. All my classes that I've taken have been small. It's a small school, so there's only about 10 kids per class. I like the small classes because the students can really engage with each other better, and help one another out. The style of the classes is usually Socratic,where the students and the professors engages with one another and ask many questions and learn from one another. Most of my studio classes are mainly individual taught, and the professors help each student find their own unique style. It was very different from how I was taught in high school, but these teaching styles have really helped me succeed. I didn't do well in high school for the lack of teacher engagement, but now I feel so privledged to have professors that truly want to see you succeed."
College Sophomore,5,The admissions office is awesome and very helpful!
College Freshman,5,I love the size and the way the curriculum is all planned out.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I believe the campus is very safe. I have attended school at PNCA for 4 years and have never seen any problems except for a few thefts on campus. I think there are surveillance cameras everywhere and security staff. Also, the community at PNCA is pretty tight knit and anyone would step up to help if any issues were to arise. They get an A+."
College Sophomore,5,"The campus is very laid back, there isn't much that you can get in trouble for"
College Sophomore,5,There is a shuttle that runs from the apartment complex that the school rents out to students.  It's free and runs according to when classes start/ end.  Other than that it's not a bad walk or the street car and max are there which is also and so really convenient.  Portland has awesome public transit and its easy to bike everywhere.
College Sophomore,5,"The security guys are the best, and they get the job done."
College Freshman,5,"Starting This Fall, but So Far It's Awesome! PNCA is willing to work with you every step of the way, and the staff really seems to care about their students!  There's lots to see and do around campus as well!"
College Sophomore,5,"Fantastic Field – Illustration is such a broad term, and is excellent as a major. You explore all elements of design, whether it be through modern technology, or with traditional methods, such as graphite and ink. A variety of jobs lie at the end of the college pathway, and the degree is the key to acquiring them."
Sophomore,4,"The teachers are great and easy to communicate with. The school is in downtown so sometimes if you have a class late at night, it can be sketchy. The classrooms and school itself are beautiful with really big studios and plenty of light."
Sophomore,4,"PNCA is a great art school for motivated students. The teachers are all excellent, and the environment is very safe and accepting. If you're looking for an ""easy out"" in art school, don't come here. We don't mess around. My only complaint has to do with their grading system and online homeroom site. The grading system lacks accountability. Other than that I think there is a culture of respect and growth, and if you're looking for a place to learn to be a professional artist, this is a good place to do that."
Junior,4,Pacific Northwest College of Art Painting and Drawing. it is a concept-driven school with little technical teaching. I gave it four stars because the teachers are amazing and are happy to set down with students to make sure they are getting what they need and want. I can't speak for the other departments. tuition goes up every year
Senior,4,"PNCA is a great community for artists to learn and explore their own practice with the variety of art departments, helpful faculty, and students. Not to mention you can bring your pet to class."
College Sophomore,4,"I just completed my first year at Pacific Northwest College of Art, so I don't know very much about the alumni network. But I do know that the school is very vocal when it comes to job and internship prospects. They have many workshops at the school that teach you how to put your name out there in the art world, and how to get a really great job from that. I've even learned how to become my own entrepreneur through those workshops, and I'm so grateful that my school has them. There's a dedicated classroom in the school that announces internships, job applications, and has an attendant that works around the clock to help you. The school emails you whenever there's an alumni coming back to discuss jobs, or a lecture from an employer, or a lecture for your own enjoyment. I've been to many throughout my school year, and all of them have been helpful!"
College Sophomore,4,"The safety at my school is very important. PNCA rests in the heart of the city, so there are a lot of precautions when it comes to safety. There's security at the entrance of the school, and if it gets late at night the security will escort you back your place when needed. I definitely carry pepper spray with me everywhere when I go to school. The dorms are 5 blocks away from the school and it's situated on a park, so walking on the park at night alone is not the best idea. There's a lot of unpredictable homeless people around the area, so it's necessary to have help on speed dial. But the school takes safety as top priority."
College Sophomore,4,Some programs are more lenient and easier to handle than others.
College Freshman,4,We have several security guards on campus that work to keep the campus safe. We also have a psychiatrist and various staff members to go to for help.
College Freshman,4,The school and staff often advertise various internships and residencies for the students along with various side jobs for the students in their fields. Over all the professors do what they can to help students succeed.
College Freshman,4,All the professors are very excited about their topics and are willing to do anything they can to help their students succeed.
College Freshman,4,"The housing at PNCA is really great and spacious. We had our own kitchen and bathrooms and our own washers and dryers in each dorm room. Many dorm rooms were more like shared apartments. The only complaint I had was that the prices for the dorms are exceedingly high and impossible for one student to pay for. I shared a studio apartment with another roommate and still paid around $1,300 a month. I had to pull an extra loan to pay for it."
College Freshman,4,I feel that my school is unique because it allows it's students to explore and find themselves. I love how many classes I have been allowed to take and how much I have learned since attending. The only downside that I have encountered is that some times there isn't enough equipment available for our projects and it is difficult to find scholarships.
College Sophomore,4,We have security guards and staff that are there for anything you need!
College Freshman,4,There are security guards always on duty.
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy how my art skills are challenged and how my perspective is broadened! I also love how diverse the classes are.
College Freshman,4,"The apartments are spectacular, but it's very expensive. The wifi is also very poor which is unfortunate since we're paying so much to live in mandatory housing options."
College Freshman,4,"So far my experience has been very different from what I've previously experienced at my high school. Since this is an art school, I don't feel the pressure of studying for standardized tests. I also have a lot more freedom in my assignments and I appreciate that a lot. I believe that PNCA has a good start so far, but there are some nitpicky things that I'm uncertain about.

For one, there seems to be some miscommunications between the administration board and the students. I am not personally affected by this but I can feel the tension between the faculty and the board of trustees."
College Senior,4,Good environment to support discussion.
College Freshman,4,You get a different feel than other schools. I personally like how small it is would be overwhelming if it had more people.
College Freshman,4,Very high tech has all the programs an art student would need. Not fond of Macs though but that is personal.
Alum,2,"I studied video & sound at PNCA and I feel the program completely failed me in terms of getting any type of job in my field. The Video & Sound program is headed by white men with a curriculum about white men. It teaches you how to make video art and abstract noise, but in no way helps you to learn to apply video & sound skills to the job market. What about a basic how to record music class? A podcast class? A video color grading class? A VFX course? A documentary course? None of these exist at PNCA. Truly, you will not even learn how to properly use a camera, set up lighting, properly shoot a short film, or edit it. The positives include nice people, great study abroad program, and good teachers outside of my own program. Basically, if it's not contemporary video art, they don't think it's necessary to teach it. And that is just not practical in this world where making money off your own work is extremely difficult."
College Sophomore,2,way too expensive and not enough housing for students. Only enough housing for freshmen really. also one of the most expensive student housing in the country.
College Junior,2,Most Academic classes exist as a way for the school to be accredited. There are a few good ones though. I'd recommend getting most of this done at another school and then transfering.
College Junior,2,Most affordable housing is miles from campus. But it's out there...
College Sophomore,2,"The summers and fall here are really beautiful, but it rains A LOT from like October - May.  I would not recommend moving to Portland if you do not like the rain or the cold."
College Senior,2,Art School – There are no sports since it is a small private art school. They do however encourage student groups. Intermural teams could easily be started.
Sophomore,1,"The school advertises itself as radical, and to a certain extent it is. But it is not as radical as how it defines itself. People still get misgendered, SOME (not all) of the faculty is racist (liberal arts department), and microagressions from students are very likely. It is easy to see what the school is lacking when you are a student of color. Diversity is weak in the student body, and weak in the faculty. As a student of color there were many times where I had to face racial incidents on and off campus. The school knows they have problems keeping students of color but they don't do much to fix it. Being a student of color here means seeing a lot of your peers leave due to unfair treatment. Even I had to transfer due to how bad my mental health got from attending this school."
College Freshman,1,Too costly better off taking the street car or a bike or getting a ride.
College Junior,1,"There is one coffee stand. Other than that, vending machines. There are few affordable restaurants in the neighborhood."
College Freshman,1,"I didn't get enough financial aid to cover all my tuition.  Trying to get more has been a dreadful experience, resulting in having my ability to borrow equipment, take out books from the library, and print off the computers taken away.  It's been restored, but I might be forced to take a semester off because of it.  Karmin, in financial aid, has consistently given a bad attitude to students needing help.  very poor."
College Sophomore,1,"About half of the students at school are ridiculous with their drug activity, but I wouldn't expect it any different from any other college, especially an art school. None of them do it on campus, but it's pretty noticeable, and desperate."
College Junior,1,"hosing is a few miles away, you pay $85/month to park"

Junior,5,"In recent years, Mesa College has provided wonderful professors from all over the county.  Professors give great lectures, advice and intuition about their passions and their teaching. The students around, getting to know each other, helping each other and creating bonds to move forward to their  studies."
Junior,5,I love San Diego Mesa College. When I first got a tour of the campus it was very welcoming with friendly and helpful people showing me around. At first I had no idea what to expect of it but I was amazed by the beautiful campus. It is really clean and the bathrooms are something I will always brag about. The gym and the food are both very nice as well.
Freshman,5,Even though its Corona Virus times I applied and talked to a counselor who was very helpful. The campus looks very nice. Even though I had to do things and talk to people over the phone and through emails everyone I've talked to has been very helpful and nice.
Freshman,5,"Since there's a Virus at the moment I've had to do all my classes online and although its been difficult since the WiFi is slow because all my family and other siblings use it I have been trying my best to get my work on time. Its difficult to stay in zoom calls because the WiFi has been buggy but when I email the teachers I get very helpful answers to my questions. I'm having a very tough time navigating the site since I'm new to this school and new to this format of learning like everyone else I've actually been very on top of my work, I sometimes even go to my closet to work at times because my siblings can be loud so I put on headphones and go to my closet to so some work. I really try to get my work in; I don't want to fail which is why I'm trying as hard as I can. I might not be concentrating as well now that my whole family is here at home with me and I'm unable to work in the library or at my school and my family can be loud at times I am perceiving to try and pass my classes."
Graduate Student,5,"Great college overall! I did not have any bad experiences, whatsoever! The professors were kind and professional! If I ever needed help with a class or a homework assignment, I knew I could easily ask a professor or a counselor."
Freshman,5,It was my first semester of taking online classes and it went way smoother and better than I thought it would.
Freshman,5,I’m new to the school and so far it’s going well. All the teachers are very helpful and nice. They show their care for the students so far for the time I’ve been there. The teacher truly just want you to pass.
Junior,5,"Mesa really tried to make the online work feel less stressful. Under the circumstances that they had, I think they did the best they good. Overall i enjoyed it"
Junior,5,"I love it here, Great environment, professors and overall people! It has been redone lately which makes you feel like you are attending a fancy university."
Sophomore,5,I just started taking online courses at Mesa. I actually really love it. I’m able to work at my own pace without feeling like I need to rush to take my notes. And my professor is easy to get in contact with. I really enjoy my online courses.
Sophomore,5,I was really nervous all together about college. The advisers there help me get comfortable with the idea of going to college and picking a major. I’ve had some difficulties throughout my first year but I was very fortunate to be able to reach out to an advisor and get the help I needed. I’ve had an awesome experience.
Freshman,5,"I am an out of state student so i have been taking some online classes when there was on campus classes the online classes are really good, you have clear deadlines, instructions and the professors are available via email and even phone number"
Freshman,5,"Due to the pandemic, all of the classes had to be moved online. Taking online classes was not as stressful as I thought it would be. My professors did a great job transitioning the classes smoothly online. They were constantly emailing us if we had any questions about what was going on. When the zoom classes were going to start we got emails reminding us that the class is going to start in a couple of minutes. The assignments were displayed through canvas and so were the exams. Zoom classes are not any different from going to class on campus. The only difference is that you're just not there in person. If we had a question we were able to unmute ourselves on zoom or type our questions."
Freshman,5,"As an incoming freshman at San Diego Mesa college, I was very terrified about a whole new environment and style of learning. Fortunately, after speaking to some staff members and consulates I felt less nervous and a little bit more confident. San Diego Mesa College has wonderful grant programs that help with tuition and fees. These programs have caring counselors that are constantly reaching out to you. The campus is very big and clean. As for any changes, I think Mesa College is doing pretty well."
Freshman,5,Best campus ever. Friendly people. Great teachers. And the library is the best to go to when you need to study.
Freshman,5,"Online learning is the best! Work around your time. If teachers have set times, they are usually nice and fully involved in the class."
Senior,5,Mesa College made the transition to fully-online classes a smooth process. I couldn't be happier with the new online classes and how easy the web portals are to navigate.
Senior,5,"I have been attending SDCCD for a few years, and I have always had a great experience. I have been working full-time, so, unfortunately, I end up putting school on my back burner. The staff have always worked with me and did what they could to help convenience me and my hectic schedule."
Freshman,5,I loved the online class! I took nutrition online this past spring and it was really easy and efficient! My teacher was great and I ended up getting a B
Freshman,5,The campus was really nice and make sure to check rate your professor before picking a teacher! Also counseling center was kind of a hassle and always such a long line.
Senior,5,"Instructors are very helpful.
Tech assistance is provided.
Online platform is multi-fuctional and has many options, it can be easy to deviate, but overall great tool."
Senior,5,"Great College.
Beautiful facilities, administration is very helpful, counselors are awesome and go aboveand beyond to help you in your educational plan."
Freshman,5,"I did take online classes and honestly it was very easy as long as you’d check canvas everyday. The teachers would often have discussions which helped people engage with each other. I really enjoyed those. They also would have us watch videos/movies related to the topic of discussion which helped us see things in a new light as well as, just to see how things are done (I.e. a lab)."
Freshman,5,"I liked that the people and professors were really friendly and nice. It was a good environment always and although I felt nervous to ask for help at times, people/professors/staff always seemed happy to be of help."
Junior,5,"It's a very clean, enjoyable campus with good teachers which you are able to build a connection with. Good classes and easy to move around."
Junior,5,Some classes were easy and it's easy to do assignments. Sometimes it can be easy to forget that you have assignments due but just gotta work on it.
Sophomore,5,"Online learning with Mesa was well structured even through the transition from blackboard to canvas, and there are many resources on how to use the different mediums you can encounter with online learning. Most teachers are easily accessible through online learning and it makes for a very flexible experience, I would definitely recommend online classes through Mesa College."
Sophomore,5,I had a really great experience with Mesa College. The professors are passionate and they truly care about the success of their students. There is a very diverse demographic which makes class discussions very interesting and you learn something new every day. It is very easy to achieve your goals here as long as you put in the effort necessary. This is an establishment where you get as much as you put in. It has made my pursuit of a bachelor's degree much cheaper than it would have been if I had gone to the four year that I intended.
Sophomore,5,"Beautiful campus, very organized. I had classes in the new BT building the is very modern and made my college experience enjoyable. Good professors. Diverse community, very safe."
Junior,5,"San Diego Mesa College has amazing academics, positive environment, and all faculty and staff want students to succeed. I have attended San Diego Mesa College for three years and have taken very rigorous courses such as Organic Chemistry, Anatomy, Biochemistry, and Microbiology. After receiving A's and B's in these courses I can say with absolute confidence and certainty that all the professors are very good at teaching and know their topics really well."
Niche User,5,Part of the high school extension program. We have access to most campus services. Absolutely flexible.
Sophomore,5,"Mesa completely transformed my view on our education system. Throughout my 2 & a half years there I met some really dedicated professors & faculty. Students are friendly too & will help you if you're open to asking. Mesa saved me so much money, especially because I was involved in their Promise Program. This school has SO MANY RESOURCES for lower income students & 1st generation college students which I really really appreciate. I honestly don't know why this school has a C+ rating. If you don't use ratemyprofessor.com as you pick your classes, your experience may be very different from mine. Going to this school was such a privilege. No student debt, no food insecurity, no lack in resources. The classes were fairly easy too, especially with the giant tutoring center in the Learning Resource Center (basically our campus library). Seek out these resources, always ask questions, and you'll get the support you need. I really can't complain, Mesa was unforgettable."
Freshman,5,"This is just my first year in college and mesa college has helped me a lot into this transition. Mesa puts their students first; they give good financial aid, they have a lot of helpful programs for any student, my favorite thing they do is a monthly farmers market which is basically free food and you can grab whatever you want. This is a good school if your goal is to transfer to a 4 year university or if you decide to graduate here."
Alum,5,"San Diego Mesa college is by far the best college I have ever attended (I've been to Grossmont, UH Manoa,  Cuesta college, & UCSD)  I was an okay student before attending, but the professors and academic life here inspired me more than I could ever imagine. I became a tutor here, received my first 4.0 ever, and was accepted to transfer to UCB, UCLA, and UCSD, every single UC I applied to. I chose UCSD because I love San Diego so much. Great area, best professors ever. Not sure why the rating is a C+ on here, as it should be an A+. This school changed the trajectory of my life."
Freshman,5,"Excellent school, mass amounts of resources all around, emphasis on diversity and tolerance, professors are resourceful and helpful. Campus is modern and easily accessible and very safe as the school has its own campus police. Lots of opportunities. Would say the party scene is basically inexistent."
Junior,5,"My overall experience with Mesa has been great. The campus, professors, STEM counselor Patty, and all overall staff have been very helpful. I was guided in to the STEM program to accelerate my math course load to avoid taking classes I wouldn't need to. I've been given all of the attention I could ask for regarding my educational pathways and am confident in my overall progress because of the support the school offers."
Niche User,5,"I am an incoming freshman at San Diego Mesa College, and I was so scared about going into the great unknown after high school. But after speaking to some counselors and some of the wonderful students I was more confident in applying to colleges and my future. With the great people and awesome classes, I cant wait to attend next semester!"
Niche User,5,"for a community college it is a very nice, beautiful, and well taken care of. Everyone at the college had a very good attitude, everyone was so happy, and I feel like this would be a perfect fit for me."
Niche User,5,"Friends who attend have told me its great. They have told me that they highly recommend it. I have heard my friends who are attending the school say that there is a lot of diversity, and the academics are great."
Freshman,5,"The campus is very nice and the environment is great for studying and learning. You have a lot of freedom when it comes to choosing your classes and careers. The professors are very great and you have a choice on who you want to choose. They have a great simple system when it comes to making payments or registering for classes. Overall, You save a lot of money going to a community college, and I recommend that you choose this college."
Freshman,5,"San Diego Mesa College is extremely welcoming and inspirational. Mesa is always trying to help students with their futures and treat students with respect. The campus is beautiful and every student is unique, kind, and outgoing."
Sophomore,5,The teachers here are so excellent and break everything down so well. I have not had one bad teacher. Of course ratemy professor helps too
Sophomore,5,"The installations are modern and safe. The campus is equipped with many resources, making it easy to have self-study sessions or organize study groups between classes. Buildings are really big and it is extremely easy to locate your classroom. The staff is always friendly and the overall environment of the school is welcoming and warm. I prefer it over the City campus."
Freshman,5,I really enjoy coming to mesa college all the teachers are great professors that are passionate about their job
Sophomore,5,It is a great campus and provides all the resources I feel I need to be successful in my college career. The classes they offer are excellent for a community college. The staff and professors are very supportive and knowledgeable.
Sophomore,5,"I love the staff, so friendly. No matter what department one will go to, they will receive you with open arms."
Freshman,5,They have really nice teachers that have office hours where they can help you. The environment is very friendly and the campus is really nice and clean.
Sophomore,5,"There is never a disappointment when it comes to professors, classes, etc. I enjoy the opportunities they provide. The area of the campus is perfect as well !"
Sophomore,5,"San Diego Mesa college has helped me become a better person, student, and woman. They have tons of clubs and activities to keep you happy, healthy and thriving. The teachers are all supportive and experts in their fields. Ive really enjoyed my time at mesa community college."
Freshman,5,"It's a very nice, clean campus. It is especially better to go when there are not a lot of people there because the staff seems a little less stressed and more able to help the students. Just as a word of advice for the college kids, I guess. Things I would improve about the campus, there are a lot of stairs."
Freshman,5,"To those who look for a second chance or want to save money, this college is the choice to go to. The academics are marvelous and the diversity makes the campus widely unique. The transfers program is generally gifted and for athletics that occur here are mildly decent. Overall San Diego Mesa College is a great school for a 2 year."
Sophomore,5,I love the diversity of my college. Makes me feel in home. The campus is huge and with comfortable buildings. The professors are OK. Few are actually bad. Most are excellent.
Niche User,5,"the campus, teachers and the student life is amazing. the connection and vibe you feel right away is not the same as other schools, this school is very thoughtful, i have always love it for their beautiful campus and teachers."
Sophomore,5,"One of the best up-to-date campus in San Diego, the largest cc in San Diego. We got a new one business & technology building, in addition, a 4-floor building of Fine Art. One of the best things is the diversity of professor, in my case, my Business Law professor has a background in the field of banking, restaurant service, food, and beverage import."
Sophomore,5,San Diego Mesa College is a great school and offers many great programs for their students. The student population is also extremely diverse so you don't feel any different from anyone else!  The campus has also been recently renovated within the last few years so it has a very modern atmosphere!
Sophomore,5,Mesa a great segue from high school to university. Mesa has great professors that  truly care about the success of their students. They are always open to helping and have you prepared to transfer or whatever your end goal is.
Freshman,5,"Mesa College has a beautiful campus, centrally located within San Diego. The college offers a wide variety of associate degrees and now also offers a bachelors degree in Health Information Management. The student population is diverse and is compromised of people from all walks of life. Many of the buildings have recently been renovated and work still continues on the campus. The biggest shortcoming is parking and is especially bad the first few weeks of the semester."
Freshman,5,"I haven't been to a community college since the 60s and what a surprise. Mesa offers so many programs to help new and current students with study groups, assessments and on line tutorials. In addition they have programs for students who are in need of help with homelessness (a place to rest and clean up) offer free fresh vegetables once a month and medical help. 
My first semester has been quite a learning experience as to what to expect and what is expected from the students and professors. The library and the campus itself is state-of-the-art, with new buildings opening this spring. I am grateful to have this experience to achieve my dream of getting a degree after all these years."
Freshman,5,"In San Diego Mesa College I’ve enjoyed using all the high quality resources needed to help me gain skills, get tutoring, and as many others. The Staff and professors are great at their jobs, and are aware on what they know are they doing at all times. Joining different programs will help you stay engaged in campus and will most likely help you make friends."
Junior,5,"I love it is a very diverse community, offers great resources, i.e. counseling, mentoring, library, computers, laptops for check out, programs for aid."
Junior,4,"It's been easier to get more help, there is a flexible timing for extra help.  Takes more time to get the lesson through and understand what's goin on."
Junior,4,"Honestly, online learning is difficult for everyone everywhere. It has been tough especially because it can become very boring. Most of the people I know including me has grown up doing in-person schooling. I know most of my friends and I are not enjoying online schooling at all but it is what it is. We have learned during this whole covid process and will continue to learn as it is what we have to do. San Diego Mesa College has tried to make online learning as easy as possible and the use of canvas has been really helpful. The professors are also trying to learn to adapt to this but some have been giving a bit too much work."
Sophomore,4,The professors at Mesa were very quick to adapt the the online school experience. All of my professors are very comfortable with zoom and do their best to provide us students with a quality education.
Sophomore,4,"Mesa college offers high quality education and great professors. This is the start of my second year at Mesa and from my experiences so far, I can say this is a quality institution for a community college. The professors are patient and are sensitive to individual student needs. The school also has a variety of student resources to keep us on the right track. The only issue I have with Mesa is the lack of parking but thanks to Covid 19, thats not a problem right now :)"
Sophomore,4,What I liked about Mesa was that I felt very safe and there was many things to do on campus. Everyday there was something new happening on campus. I only wish they would announce what is happening everyday so students are aware what is happening on campus that day.
Junior,4,"I really believe coming to SD Mesa was the best choice for me! Lots of students will agree, the campus and resources are great and make the transition to a 4-year uni so much easier with the experience and more confidence as college students."
Freshman,4,"I have been attending San Diego Mesa College and I have been really comfortable, the staff on campus are helpful and nice the classes are perfect. The only thing i think that needs to improve is the communication of for example pay deadlines because they switch them u every semester with no further notice"
Freshman,4,"Great campus, professors are great, and programs provided are fun. Sports and party scene arent that lively."
Freshman,4,Very independent must really be on top of all tasks. Teachers are less understanding because that personal connection isnt there like in person classes.
Freshman,4,"Mesa college is nice compared to other two year institutions in the area, the campus is nice and it is near Kearney Mesa, a good place to visit for food. In my experience the professors have been understanding and knowledgeable. I've only had one councilor that I've fully connected with, but they have been really involved in my academic career. I recommend the school."
Freshman,4,Online classes were very independent with minimal teacher interaction. You must hold yourself accountable and really push yourself to complete the assignments on time.
Graduate Student,4,"Last semester I started taking classes at Mesa college after 4 years, I can tell everything has changed and is much better now the classrooms, the equipment that we use in the classroom has improved and also the professors are using better methods of teaching for students to learn the material and get better grades,"
Freshman,4,"I have encountered extremely good professors during my schooling semesters. However, I have encountered really bad counselors that were not able to help me out with school-related issues."
Freshman,4,San Diego Mesa College is a great Junior College that allows students to explore potential majors and makes it easy to transfer after the needed credits are accumulated.
Sophomore,4,Students or even teachers get stuck to find a parking. We should improve some public transportation to school.
Freshman,4,"I love how diverse San Diego Mesa college is, not just having people from all different races, but you see people who just got out of high school to someone who's been working for over 4 decades and is just trying to improve on some skills. Professors are usually pretty good but use I would recommend using rate my professor. There really is not that much school spirt in my opinion unless you are an athlete. Overall, I have been liking my experience so far."
Freshman,4,"Although it is a community college, it is still a great learning environment. They are very helpful with transfer and career plans as well. I do not regret my decision of coming to this college."
Sophomore,4,"San Diego Mesa is  a great school contained with lots of amazing people, and great professors. Most the classes I took had professors who genuinely cared for teaching the subject making the class a lot more enjoyable."
Alum,4,"During my time at San Diego Mesa College, I found the staff and school to be very helpful in preparing for a 4-year university. The school has made tremendous upgrades to keep up with the ever changing world."
Freshman,4,"The teachers are great and they are very welcoming to any students. I have had classes there since last year. Currently, I am enrolled in English 205 and the class itself is pretty good."
Freshman,4,"I have had some of the best professors I've ever had (shout out to Tara Maciel) and some of the worst professors I've ever had. 

Mesa has the nicest buildings and cleanest rooms out of the three CCs in SD. 


Rate My Professor has never been needed more, as some teachers here really do not care and others have a true passion for teaching. The same goes for counselors.


By far the worst part about Mesa is the Financial Aid dept. So many bitter people with no interest in helping, only wanting to stamp whatever paper you have and move you through. Also, the ""department"" is just a long kiosk with no rooms to talk about sensitive information such as loans or household income. 

Do not expect a huge social scene... or even a small one. The only parties I was invited to were at other SD 4-yr colleges.

If you buckle down and hustle, join a few of the well-organized clubs, and participate outside of campus, you have a great shot at transferring to your dream school."
Niche User,4,"Looks very nice, a very giant campus for a community college. A lot of student clubs and activities, along with many nice people to get along with."
Freshman,4,"I like the diversity of the school, professors are genuinely interested in helping students understand lectures. School is in a good location, multiple places to go to to eat when you have time."
Sophomore,4,"Caring professors that want to see you succeed. A beautiful, completely remodeled campus. It's a fantastic school with many options."
Alum,4,"Lots of great classes, lots of great professors. If you think it's going to be like High School, you're wrong."
Sophomore,4,"I love the welcoming atmosphere, as well as the friendly faculty. Someone is always around to offer you assistance."
Junior,4,"I liked attending San Diego Mesa College. I was able to meet many great professors and especially fellow students who made my experience even more fun. Also, I was part of the EOPS program, that made college a lot easier. I registered for all the classes I needed without any trouble, meet my counselor whenever I had questions or help with my academic plan."
Niche User,4,Professors here are always supportive of their students. I've had teachers who was willing to talk one on one when I was struggle and develop ways to help me. Our campus is also diverse culturally. There are many days where we host events for students and opportunities to petition for a cause we believe in.
Junior,4,"It a school that's a good starter and refuge for those not able to make it to a CSU or UC. They have good counseling and services and have clear transfer outline as well. Since the school is small, it provides good communication between students and staff members. There is however a problem regarding parking during certain times, but you can easily figure out when parking is easier and how to work it with your schedule."
Niche User,4,"What I LOVED about here is they have FREE DAY CARE for students who have kids and who qualify which makes it super easy to continue my education. I will enroll in 2019 so I am super exited to return to school. I will be doing Nutrition, not only will it benefit me at home, by  teaching my son healthy habits, it will also help me teach the world that being healthy is rewarding!"
Sophomore,4,What I liked about Mesa was the professors and classes offered on campus. We carry classes that not all San Diego community colleges carry. What I also liked was the BOG waiver that waives all your fees for your classes if you’re a San Diego resident. The overall campus is pretty large and easy to find your way around. What I would like to see change at Mesa is the parking. The parking to student population is way too small. I would like to see more parking structures being built on this campus.
Freshman,4,"This is a military friendly community college that also serves the surrounding communities of Kearny Mesa and Serra Mesa. This campus makes it clear that people are able to be themselves - and diversity is a strength with the signage that is all over.  The counselors are busy because of such a big student population; but they will get you on track for your goals. This campus is in the middle of re-vamping so there is a clear section of the new vs. the old. The library is a strong resource and there is always tutoring available for multiple subjects. There is a dedicated service area for veterans, and a lot of places are clustered to make it more of a one-stop building for the administration of your needs. College costs are reasonable for this campus with $46/unit being the standard across the board at all California Community Colleges. This campus also has 1 bachelor's degree program that is about to roll out it's first graduating class. Bachelor's of Health Management."
Sophomore,4,"Mesa is a pretty good school, wide variety of clubs and association on campus. Also several great professors who also teach at universities so you get the same education for a fraction of the price. The campus is constantly being remodeled and updated so there is alot of new tech and architecture. I would recommend Mesa as a good starting point for college."
Alum,4,"Great experience in the dance program, overall good academic teachers too. counselors are not the best."
Sophomore,4,San Diego Mesa College has passionate professors that really enjoy teaching about their field of study. Most professors I have encountered were very understanding and were willing to help in an way possible. There are many clubs and activities you can participate in at Mesa which makes it more than a typical community college.
Junior,4,"Mesa is a great college, I love walking through campus. I'd say the only downside is that parking isn't that great. There is one main large lot that fills up quick, otherwise you have to search for a spot or park in the parking garage about 5 minutes away from class buildings."
Freshman,4,"I thought a Community college was just a basic campus but when I first arrived here in San Diego Mesa College, I really thought this place was a University. This place is so nice and is still making additions to the campus whcih means it’s not even in it’s final stage and that alone makes me feel alive on campus."
Sophomore,4,"I liked the smaller class sizes.  The facilities weren't always up to University standards (a couple classes lacked labs due to excessive cost of equipment), but nearly all of my Math and Engineering professors previously or concurrently taught at SDSU, UCSD, or USD, and taught essentially the same courses at a fraction of the cost, which was excellent.  As with all colleges, you get out what you put in."
Sophomore,4,"I have been a student at Mesa for 2 years and it gave me, not only the knowledge I need but the experience and wisdom from their professors to really make it far in life and my career. Everything they have to offer is beneficial. The only thing I would change, is adding more parking space. Its way too easy to get a ticket."
Sophomore,4,"Mesa College is a great community college. The first time I came to the campus I remember being so impressed with how nice the buildings were and the entire layout. It is beautiful. I have had great experiences with most of my courses and teachers. At this school you find teachers who want you to learn and are passionate about their subjects. Very rarely have I had courses here where I felt like I was teaching myself more than being taught. Mesa also offers so many opportunities to be tutored and get help. One of the best experiences I have had is in the counseling department. My counselor has helped me in all aspects of my education and truly assisted me in declaring a major. I do wish the campus felt more safe, because of the current climate in our nation. I am hoping with time they put more thought into the campus being more ""closed"" and having more security. Overall I have had a great experience here."
Freshman,4,"What I like about Mesa College is that is very open and there are many services that are provided to help you in college and also to get you ready for the next steps. I like that many of the staff want to help you succeed and want to give you a push to help you improve. I like that many people are friendly and accept your kindness. I also really like how diverse it is and that is a smoke free campus. Even though I am a freshman in college, my experiences so far are really good and I like coming to school."
Sophomore,4,"SDMC has been undergoing renovating for the last few years. There are several coffee shops on campus. The only real gripe I have is the parking but, that seems to be with most colleges/Universities."
Graduate Student,4,"I have a lot of fun in my classes and get many great experiences to learn and make friends. My teachers are very compassionate and friendly, yet hold the students to high standards, pushing them to succeed and earn their success. I enjoy them as people, however they do hold some troubling Neo-marxist and post-modernist viewpoints that they state as fact occasionally, which makes me feel uncomfortable to speak up as a moderate conservative, but this is typical and normative in modern colleges and universities. I am outnumbered about 13:1 liberal to conservative so I have to just pick my battles and choose when it is appropriate to speak up. Fortunately they sprinkle less of their ideology into unrelated topics as have other professors, so I am able to tolerate it without feeling obligated to speak up and ostracize myself in front of the class."
Niche User,4,"Not only were the professors very kind and thoughtful, they were also straightforward, easy to understand, and reasonable. I had a very positive experience with my classes."
Niche User,4,The campus is nice and the vibe is very chill and calming. It's a perfect campus for working on schoolwork!
Niche User,4,"I began at San Diego Mesa College this Spring semester of 2018 as an ""early-grad"" student from Kearny High School. I finished all of my high school credits early, so I was able to start my general education courses at Mesa in my second semester of my senior year at Kearny. Mesa is the perfect place for transitioning from high school to a college environment because  local students can still live at home while attending the college as well as the fact that classes are much smaller than at four-year colleges and professors are more in tuned to each individual student. You save the cost of room and board that one would usually pay at a traditional university. Moreover, students and their family who are in the same financial situation as myself can get a high quality education without the proper means; my family didn't fit any financial aid requirements, but couldn't afford to pay for university classes out of pocket. Mesa is a good place to start."
Sophomore,4,Mesa College offers a wide variety of classes that can be transferred to many four year colleges. This makes it a great place to take affordable classes needed for your degree. The main problem I have found is that registering for classes can be tricky as many fill up quickly.
Freshman,4,"Mesa was my best choice for a community college. It has the diversity, culture, and size for any 4 year university. From my experience so far, this is the type of school where you have to find the things you're looking for in order to be successful."
Junior,4,"Coming back to school after leaving a 4 year previously was very difficult, but I am happy that I had the opportunity to restart my studies at Mesa. Out of all the San Diego community colleges available, this school really packs a punch and makes it very easy to get help and stay on top of it. The writer center and tutoring available rocks. They also have some of the best faculty out there!!! The number one worst thing is the parking, especially during the first few weeks of school. Even coming an hour early before class, there is a possibility that I won't find a spot. They do have valet for those few few weeks, but they leave at 5, so you have to get your car keys at the police station and it is honestly just a hassle. Great community college besides that and good vibes all the way through!"
Freshman,4,This school is a great place to develop[p ones personal skill and understand concepts. What can be improved are the parking spaces.
Junior,4,"Mesa is a community college with a wide variety of opportunities for those seeking to transfer to a four-year institution and for those looking to obtain certain job skills. They have courses that apply to all different subjects of learning, from mathematics to the culinary arts. Mesa has various clubs, as well as an Honors program for those who wish to stand apart from your average student. The courses are relatively affordable as well."
Junior,4,"Although just a community college, Mesa College possesses a welcoming atmosphere similar to that of a university. With a wide variety of programs and clubs, Mesa gives opportunity to any type of student. They have updated the campus in order to accommodate the student's needs and have new buildings and technology to prove it."
Junior,4,I really enjoy this community college. The campus is brand new and the professors are so passionate about teaching. Before here I attended Hawaii Pacific University and the professors there are nowhere near how incredible the professors are at Mesa!
Freshman,4,It actually looks like a college campus. I though it would be just a big building and that's it. When I first got there I was surprised by how updated it is.
Junior,4,"I really enjoy being on campus and seem to have good connections with people I meet there. The architecture and design of the campus make it easy to concentrate and learn. I have had great experiences with the teachers and they seem to really care about my success in the class and life. Almost all of them are willing to go the extra mile to make sure you're getting what you need. Also, the diversity is amazing. I have met so many awesome individuals that come from around the world and Mesa gives you a glimpse into the eyes of various cultures. Overall, I am glad I attend this school and receive all the things it has to offer."
Junior,4,Great professors who really care and who genuinely want you to succeed. Plenty of resources that are available to students.
Freshman,4,I LIKE THE THE PROFESSORS ARE VERY EDUCATED AND PROFESSIONAL. I DO NOT LIKE THAT IT TAKE A VERY LONG TIME TO COMPLETE THE ADMISSION AND FINANCIAL AID PROCESS. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.
Freshman,4,"I am new to San Diego Mesa College. I got a good tour of the campus so that on my first day of classes, I knew where things were. SDMesa College has great tutoring programs that are free, and plenty of sports, diversity, great associates degree programs and degree for transfer programs. After I graduate from here, I would love to come back and take more classes."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, San Diego Mesa College is a friendly learning environment with teachers who care about you and your education."
Sophomore,4,"Mesa is a two year junior college with the enrollment of a four year. The school is constantly updating the buildings to be larger and more modern. Class sizes are about 40 to 1 which is nice because you get to know the professor and they get to know you. Parking is a bit of an issue so get to school at least an hour early or take and 8 am and there wont be any problem. They have great resources for those looking to transfer and make sure you are prepared. Some classes are easy some are hard, it all depends on the professor. All in all i had a good experience at mesa."
Sophomore,2,The only thing I would have to complain about Mesa is the professors. Very few professors on campus are great professors. Most are distant and unapproachable making it hard for students to ask for help. Some teach their course like military drill sergeants and want to fail students
Freshman,2,"Every encounter I have had with any of the administration staff at this school has been terrible. They are not helpful in answering your questions or directing you were to find answers. The campus itself is nice, classes are fine, and the professors are hit or miss"
Sophomore,2,I have been attended San Diego Mesa College for approximately one year. I really like that the school is flexible and works with all the community colleges in the district so you are able to take classes available on the various campuses throughout the San Diego area. The biggest issue that I would like to see changed in the future is the Counseling Department. The school's guidance counsellors are understaffed and appointments are booked a week out.
College Freshman,2,I haven't had good experiences with my online classes. They were too difficult.
College Sophomore,2,I recently moved to California. And the difference between being a resident and being a non resident is ridiculous. I have to an almost extra $200 per credit hour because I'm not a resident.
College Freshman,2,Not enough financial aid bc too many students
College Senior,2,"Wireless access is very on and off, it does not cover the entire campus (including classrooms) and really only works in the library and student resource center. Printing is offered in the library printing center where you have to buy a printing card before being able to print your work. The network reliability is very poor."
College Senior,2,"Professors that teach online courses act as if they were assigned to do so and had no other choice but to accept. They do not communicate well and by the time you get ahold of them, the semester is almost if not already over."
College Freshman,2,ITS CLEAR THAT ACADEMICS ISN'T A TOP PRIORITY HERE
College Junior,2,"Financial aid center is the worse. No one wants to help, no one is kind, no one is encouraging. My dad lost his job, and one of the women said to not refile my FAFSA because it probably would not make a difference in giving my financial aid. In the end, I had to work as a full time student with a part time job that made me work 35 hours, in order to help pay bills for my parents. She was terrible, and should be fired."
College Student,2,"Scheduling appointments with councilors is a nightmare. Students need to line up outside of the Student Services building before the building opens and it's based on a first come first serve basis. You could wait in line for 2 hours, and you won't be guaranteed an appointment. "
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the student body is very young, fresh from high school and don't care about class or if they are disrupting others learning.  Some teachers are good with dealing with baby sitting these kids.  There are a few actual adults sprinkled into classes here and there, though it would be nice to see more, to set a better example for the teenagers."
College Sophomore,2,Several of the classes I would like to take are only offered in the daytime or are offered with rather odd schedules that prevent me from being able to take them. I'm a night student and my major options at MEsa have been limited because of this.
College Sophomore,2,Wifi is hit and miss. Even when you can connect the speed is slow.
College Senior,2,"I do not prefer online courses, but from a non bias point of view, the school tries hard to incorporate the significance of online work. The program they use is easy to maneuver around in and the teachers are very quick to respond to questions. If you simply do not understand something in the course you can always ask to meet with the teacher. The only unfortunate thing I would have to say about online courses is that you can tell they are still developing them."
College Junior,2,I have no idea what goes on with our student body. I'm sure there are clubs and activities put on by students at Mesa but I've never been a part of anything going on with the school.
College Sophomore,2,"The cost for printing out stuff is a little over priced in my opinion and compared to other schools, students start out with a specific sum of money in their account then if or once used up the student is responsible for paying themselves after the initial amount is used up. Wireless internet access is like a black hole, that is why you don't see hardly anyone around campus with laptops. No one can get on the internet or if they do it is so slow. However, in the computer labs everything is very reliable and if something is wrong it is promptly taken care of which is nice."
College Junior,2,They messed up on my financial aid award and they disburse funds late in February.  What do they expect you to do for money since school starts in January.
College Junior,2,"It's ok. Not easy for a returning student just picking up a few classes. Some teachers treat the students like they are still in high school while others are inspiring and amazing. It's 50/50,"
College Sophomore,2,"I don't like how difficult it is to register for a class that works with your schedule.
I don't like a lot of the teachers I've had. They are unorganized for the most part. 
I'm not being pushed or encouraged at this school."
College Sophomore,2,It is very difficult to find classes to fit my work schedule. All the classes fill up really quickly and sometimes I have to stand in the back of the classroom because no seats are available. A lot of my teachers have been less than passionate about their jobs and it shows.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Some class schedules are flexible, but others are not. It takes a while to make a good schedule to make sure one class doesn't overlap another."
College Junior,2,"Cheap but Complicated – Due to the fact Mesa is a community college, the tuition is not a ridiculous price, however, getting financial aid can often be quite difficult. The vast number of students attending college because they cannot afford a four year institution's prices, there is not a great deal of financial aid to be shared. Furthermore, because it is a community college and the tuition is substantially lower than other schools, it almost feels as though financial aid is less important to give out."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's Just a School. I've just started to attend this school and it's similar to another community college I attended in the past. They are doing quite a bit of construction around campus, so the students will greatly benefit from revamped student services buildings and additional parking..yay!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Unorganized Mess – I was told that I would be denied for aid due to my associates degree, but I could appeal. It is a huge waste of time to apply and then have to wait several weeks to be denied so I can begin an appeal process. By the time I receive any aid, I will be well into the semester. My financial need is TODAY and having to wait several months for assistance to cover books, supplies and living expenses is frustrating. I will compliment the customer service skills of the financial aid office. They were very informative and I did receive the BOGW which covered my tuition. This office COULD be great if they streamline the process. I never thought having a degree would hinder my ability to do anything."
College Senior,2,"What to Be Expected from a Community College – I'm currently enrolled at San Diego Mesa College, and although I find it to be an upgrade from the previous community college I attended I can't help but feel the career services here are no greater than the ones at my former school. This may be the case because of my field of study (engineering). I wouldn't imagine there would be many engineering companies looking to hire students at a community college. Nevertheless, the career fair at Mesa College feels small and uninspiring. It would be nice to see a wider range of job opportunities presented at the fair."
College Sophomore,2,"Planning to Switch Majors – Due to having to have an educational plan for the VA GI-Bill, my counselor put me in business admin and I absolutely have no interest in that.  I am trying to change to philosophy however you cannot schedule an appointment with the counselor, so you have to wait hours to meet with them.  Not cool."
College Sophomore,2,"Class Schedule Takes Time – To get an adequate schedule I had to shuffle my class choices many time, even then it is still a somewhat inconvenient schedule."
College Sophomore,2,"Limited Class Availability – I have declared myself a kinesiology major, sadly there are an extremely limited number of classes available in that field.  Sadder still is the times and dates offered are very inconvenient."
College Freshman,2,"Cinema as Art: the History and Evolution of Films – The professor Christensen was helpful, understanding and an overall nice guy. His class was interesting and very informative of important and influential directors, producers and actors in the film industry and how each had their own significance to the way films are now and how they reflected the times the films were created."
College Sophomore,2,"No Experience to Report – I don't use any of the facilities at Mesa, as I stated before, I try to stay away from campus when I don't have to be there, but I'm sure the facilities are acceptable, average at best, they always seem to be doing some sort of construction on campus so I'm sure there's a lot to be desired."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm Not That Well-Informed – I don't know much about the psychology department at Mesa, I try to stay away from the campus as much as possible and only go on campus during my class times. I'm assuming any internship or job opportunities will be non-competitive and ridiculously easy to get into as every student I've ever interacted with at Mesa has been ungifted in the brain department. All the psychology classes I've ever taken there I've gotten an A in, I honestly believe it's impossible to get below a B at Mesa, but I'm sure some of those students I mentioned manage to do so."
College Sophomore,2,"Not the Best Experience – I've had the privilege to attend private schools my entire life, the only reason I had to resort to attending Mesa was as a result of some personal problems that forced me to withdraw from the liberal arts college I attended my freshman year of college and return home. I've had very few qualified professors at Mesa, for the most part they are incompetent, boring, and incredibly narcissistic. I could teach classes better. I suppose I'm getting my money's worth....compared to the liberal arts college I attended before, the fees for Mesa are incredibly low. The administration, for the most part, is filled with unpleasant people who are clearly depressed about having to work in such a mundane environment and, as a result, are extremely unhelpful. I honestly cannot wait to transfer."
College Student,2,"Admissions and Getting Your Classes. Since the community college district has faced recent budget cuts, but is less expensive than a four year college, more students have been attending the college. This makes any attempts at getting any general education classes very difficult. In the process of applying for your classes, it is very hard to get the classes you want. A lot of the times you are put on the wait list and have to crash the course."
College Freshman,2,"They do not have a sociology major at this school, and there are very few sociology professors at the school so you keep repeating teachers, including the bad ones."
College Junior,2,I don't really know the students body. I have seen and heard little from them. I do know they try to make Mesa College better but haven't seen it myself.
College Freshman,2,"Alot of the stuff is assumed you already know it,and the test are almost impossible with out looking the book. Hw is hard, quizes are easier then the hw."
College Student,2,"Hassles With Taking the Right Courses – Even though I would meet the counselor several times within the year before the semester starts and afterwards, they tend to give me the wrong information. There was a semester in which I took a class that I didn't need to take and I was told by the counselor to enroll in that class because it is a common general education course. However, my AP scores had exempt me for that course. I feel cheated as if I had wasted my time taking that class."
College Student,2,"Sexual Feelings – There are many young girls that have their buns in the ovens. Unfortunately, they don't know who put the bun in their oven to begin with."
College Student,2,They're different due to the fact that I take my class on my laptop at home and not at campus.
Sophomore,1,I was taking 3 STEM classes at the beginning of the semester but had to drop 2 of them because the professors failed to transition the class time online. A 2 hour calculus 3 lecture twice a week became a 4 minute video a week. No one was there to moderate how professors transitioned to online
College Junior,1,Going to this school made me feel like nothing I ever wanted to pursue could happen. This school gave me nothing but bad memories and the worst years of my academic life.
College Freshman,1,awful don't do it enough
College Freshman,1,AVIATION IN NON EXISTENT AT MESA
College Freshman,1,DO NOT TAKE ONLINE CLASSES THEY WILL RUIN YOUR GPA
College Sophomore,1,"I'm out of state, so tuition was ridiculously expensive, without my veterans benefits, I would never be able to afford it.  Even now, I'll be swimming in debt for a while just over tuition costs.  Financial aid covered only 10% of my costs for the semester, and I'm unemployed. I didn't have any other options but to put it on my credit card and paying insane interest fees."
College Senior,1,I have not noticed or really been introduced to any of the post-grad services.
College Junior,1,"I had an appointment with a the center, had to wait forever (beyond apt time) and the counselor decided to bring in another student during that time. He did a ""two for one"". I never recieved important information that set me back almost 2 years."
Recent Alumnus,1,Veterans Are Discriminated Against When They Use the Post 9/11 GI Bill – At the SDCCD they require all veterans to pay for their classes first. Once the school is rembursed by the VA then after about 3 weeks the school will return the money to the veteran.  This is the only group of students that receive some form of finacal aid that is required to pay out of their pocket first.  If they are going to make one group pay first then all groups should have to pay first then get refunded.
College Junior,1,"Very poor counselling service, specially for int'l students. I would say that trying to transfer by myself is more efficient than going to ask help to a counsellor."
College Sophomore,1,Not Around Much – I have had hardly any direction upon arriving at Mesa.  It's almost impossible to get a couselors appointment and nobody really tries to help you figure out what you want to do.
Recent Alumnus,1,Mesa Financial Head-ACHE – I was denied eops because of an mistake that the financial aid lady did and by the time Eops caught on it was so far into the semester I didnt get anything.
College Freshman,1,"Last Resort – This school should be considered only as a last resort college.  The classes they offer are ok, but the caliber of teacher is very lacking, and the administration does not step in. I have had one teacher who missed more classes than me (She missed 8 out of 32) and she did not extend or change her syllabus at all."
College Freshman,1,There Are None? With no jobs to get they can't really afford to help I guess?
College Freshman,1,"In general the school is nice. The campas open, but the parking options suck, or rather the lack there of? Any how teachers, some good, some bad. Some how don't speak english clearly, and move to fast and don't understand what's being asked, other that are thorough and make sure you know your stuff. HOwever, that aside budget cuts are taking out it's summer session, and they are slicing some department 50% or more. So, yeah. Good luck getting a class?"
College Freshman,1,"San Mesa College could get alot of improvements, that I think they dont work towards. I am a student-athlete meaning i take pride in our gym and playing field. instead of budget cuts or taking away classes we need to upgrade."

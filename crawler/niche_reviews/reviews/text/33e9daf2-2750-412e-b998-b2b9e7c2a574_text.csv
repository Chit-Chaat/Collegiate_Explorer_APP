Freshman,5,"Very good school. Amazing teachers, fantastic classes, and a very good place to be if you're looking for a small school that truly invests in your future."
Freshman,5,"Due to covid, some of my classes are held online. Teachers are very flexible, because there are sometimes technology gliches. The teachers at Juniata still make sure you are learning the material you need in order to succeed in that class even though it is online."
Freshman,5,Juniata college is a campus that is comfortable and has very kind students and faculty! There is no judgement from anyone and you are 100% free to be your true self.
Senior,5,"Juniata has given me so many opportunities to personalize my education. I appreciate the ability to have a voice in making changes in my college community. Juniata is not perfect, but it strives to change and grow, just as it encourages that in its students."
Freshman,5,"During the coronavirus, professors were extremely accommodating and helpful to any student who was struggling to focus or make it through the online learning period. The Juniata administration has been extremely transparent during online learning."
Freshman,5,Unfortunately I had to leave campus to to COVID 19 but other than that I had a great experience. My professors we always available. Felt safe around compuss.
Freshman,5,"I grew up less than a mile away from Juniata College. Juniata always had a special place in my heart however, I never thought that it would be the college that I attended as I thought that I wanted to go to college somewhere else to experience something outside of Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. I even visited twelve schools all over the east coast trying to make my decision. However, when it was time to make my decision the choice was obvious. The choice was Juniata! I chose Juniata because it provided the best combination of unmatched academics and competitive athletics. Juniata has a very well-structured academic program with outstanding professors who follow your progress as a student. My experiences athletically have also been well worth it. While playing collegiate sports is not always easy it teaches you the value of hard work, time management and sacrifice. I am so happy that I decided to stay home and attend Juniata College."
Niche User,5,"It is a great, cozy college. Recommend if you like a calm place for your studies. The town Huntingdon is nice, but a bit old."
Senior,5,"I like how involved all of the professors and staff are in helping every student succeed, and the amount of financial aid they offer to students. Best college experience I have ever had."
Freshman,5,I thoroughly enjoyed my first semester at Juniata. It’s easy to make friends here and to establish great relationships with professors and staff members. The campus is small enough that you can walk to any building in five minutes just about. There are also a lot of clubs for everyone and anything.
Sophomore,5,"Juniata is a great school for academics and located in a safe area. A small community like Juniata gives great relationships between professors and students. The party scene is not overwhelming, but on a Saturday night students can always find somewhere to party."
Sophomore,5,"Juniata College is one of the most welcoming places I've ever been to. Everyone from the students, to the professors, and other staff are extremely kind and helpful. Anytime I had a question or just simply needed help with something, there were many students and professors who lended a helping hand. Academically, the material covers everything needed for your intended major. Not only that, but there are many opportunities to start working in the field upon the first year of arrival. This is an amazing college and it has definitely changed my life for the better!"
Senior,5,"The professors at Juniata college are dedicated to helping their students and show a strong passion for the subjects that they teach. The dorms on campus could use some improvement. The dorms are clean and comfortable, but it would be nice if there were more options of different layouts of rooms to live in."
Alum,5,"When I started my freshman year in 2010, I was an average, apathetic teen. When I graduated in 2014, I had been transformed into someone who cared about the world. Juniata taught me to approach life as a myriad of opportunities and abundance. It was a beautiful experience in a beautiful setting. I'm still very close with many of my friends from Juniata. They're all out there doing awesome things.
I earned my BA in history, spent a few years post-graduation taking odd jobs and internships and exploring different opportunities and places. Juniata taught me how to do that. Now, I am employed full-time in a career I love. I highly recommend Juniata to anyone who is ready to have their mind opened."
Sophomore,5,"I completely fell in love with Juniata the minute I stepped on campus. Academic and dorm buildings are gorgeous, old school brick. Everyone is so nice, students, professors, campus workers. I immediately felt at home here and continue to do so everyday. Students have more personal relationships with professors and workers; being a small campus, people get to know everyone and develop friendly relations. People look out for one another and get along very well. No college is perfect, but to me, Juniata comes pretty close.  I come all the way from California and sometimes I get homesick, but being here at Juniata I have an amazing second family that I am always eager to get back to after breaks."
Alum,5,"My experience here was excellent!  I was lucky to have fantastic professors and peers, and I had an excellent academic experience."
Sophomore,5,"Juniata college is extremely unique with its POE system and its large array of international students. Due to it's small size, professors know all of their students on a personal level and this makes learning easier."
Freshman,5,I have enjoyed everything about Juniata College. It feels like a huge family. The campus is  very safe.
Freshman,5,"I like how Juniata is a small, tight knit community and every one knows each other.  Also, you get to build close relationships with administration and professors."
Junior,5,"I am grateful to be attending a college with such excellence. As a potential student, one of the things that attracted me to Juniata College was its small classroom size. While attending, I have taken courses with as few as nine students. Because of this uniqueness, students are encouraged to create relationships with the professors. Students are not just a number here. Professors care about each and every one of us, and they put a lot of effort to help us succeed during our time here, and in our future. As a science major, the small class size is also a bonus because the lab courses give us hands on experience with instruments such as an NMR or GCMS machines. Although it can seem a little pricey, the school offers a generous amount of financial aid to its students. As far as campus life goes, there are plenty of opportunities if you're inclined to engage in them. Clubs aren't all that active, but there are usually events on campus every weekend."
Freshman,5,"Juniata College is an amazing Liberal Arts school. They offer great courses, and really set people on the right path to a successful future while turning students into more well-rounded people."
Senior,5,"The flexibility in designing my own major in environmental public health, research opportunities, and relationships I’ve built here at Juniata College among the students and faculty are some of the many things that will have an everlasting impact on the rest of my career in public health."
Junior,5,"Juniata College is a small liberal arts school that gives you the sense of community the minute you walk on campus. The college ensures one-on-one student attention with faculty and advisors, as well as providing amazing opportunities for all students. Juniata gives their students the chance to find their true selves and to succeed in the most genuine and affective way possible. You are not just a face or name on campus, you are part of the Juniata family."
Freshman,5,"At Juniata, there is no one left behind. All of the students, professors, and factuality, pay attention to others and help them out as much as possible. This community has a feeling of being close knit and helpful."
Niche User,5,Juniata takes a special interest in you and takes time to help you with whatever you need. They provide you with the tools needed to facilitate your transition to college. Whenever I had a question about something I just emailed my admission counselor and within ten minutes she replied.
Niche User,5,"It is a beautiful college with many outdoor and indoor activities, along with some of the best teachers in the surrounding area. Most will accommodate your needs and work with you to see where you can be."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are very accommodating, they want you to feel engaged and included. Its not hard to participate especially because the classes are so small and everyone is generally friendly. however, this could also depend on the professor, luckily, all my professors are engaging and allow students to get involved, but i do have friends who's professors just lecture for 3 hours then leave the room without opening the floor to anything students may want to say."
College Sophomore,5,campus police and faculty really want to keep everyone safe. as freshmen you receive a lot of advice on how to deal with prevention of sexual assault and what to do incase it happens. at first I was skeptical but now that I've lived here for a while i know its very safe on campus. most of the people here are good people and they will try to help in any way they can
College Junior,5,It is very easy to have campus security take you to your dorm. There are call buttons located all over campus to push in case of emergency or if you need help getting home.
College Sophomore,5,The alumni love the students
College Sophomore,5,No one can beat the campus rowdiness at Juniata
College Junior,5,"For the most part, I love Juniata; the academics are great, and the campus is gorgeous. The party scene isn't bad if you want a party you can find one on Saturday nights, but it's not going to be as great as Penn State. Side note: the school is chill about underage drinking. Although Huntingdon is a bit of a letdown, Altoona and State College are about 45 minutes away, and both have plenty to do. Juniata is also very good at getting presenters or concerts on campus, which surprised me since the school is unknown. One of my favorite parts is the tradition we have Madrigal, tenting, Lobsterfest, Storming the Arch, Pig Roast and Mountain Day. There isn't a lazy teacher at Juniata; they are very educated in their field, and I haven't had one that isn't compassionate about their subject. They are also very easy to talk to! The administration is the same way, a lot of people give them a lot of troubles, and they are a bit disorganized sometimes, but I honestly love them. President Troha is very approachable and knows most students by name; you can see him eating in the cafetiria with students and at sports events. Juniata College is a very safe area; I  have often left my computer laying around and don't even have to worry about it being taken. It's a small school, and you will see everyone you know, but overall the students are all very nice, they are all generally from the PA area, but I never felt left out being from a far away state. The worst part of Juniata is the food, which I hear is being upgraded as we speak. However, the people who serve the food are probably the nicest people you'll ever meet. Up until college, I was a vegetarian. However, I found that very difficult at Juniata. It's pretty hard to eat healthy, but you won't gain the freshman 15 since the food is so bad you'll probably find yourself skipping meals. The hours are weird too, and there are no late night options included in the meal plan. But, most of the dorms have kitchens!"
College Sophomore,5,I love Juniata! I have met some amazing people there and I cannot wait to go back!
College Sophomore,5,I love Juniata and I could not have picked a better school!
College Freshman,5,"The professors actually care about you as a person, and actually try to get to know you. They seem to love what they teach."
College Freshman,5,I've always felt safe walking outside at night-even in Huntingdon.
College Freshman,5,I have not had one professor I did not like. All the professors really care. They even invite classes over for dinner!
College Freshman,5,Juniata is my home away from home.
College Freshman,5,I loved most of my professors. They're tough but they want their students to succeed.
College Freshman,5,I was not a very social person before going to Juniata. I stayed at home and had a very small circle. Now I have made friends with almost everyone in my dorm building and have made some of the best memories I could ever ask for with those people. They have become my forever friends and I would have never have met them if I didn't go to this school. I was going. To go to a school I new yorkcity but juniata won my heart once I visited. I wanted big city but got small row and I wouldn't change it foranything.
College Sophomore,5,"Tons of students from Juniata get a job straight from Juniata and many go onto grad school. Overall, I feel very positive about being able to move on from this college into a new path."
College Sophomore,5,Professors are great and really do care about the students. I always feel like my concerns are valid and that they care about what each student needs.
College Freshman,5,Our campus is extremely safe. We are in the midst of the mountains with a healthy and supporting college community that cares immensely about the well being of our fellow students.
College Freshman,5,Career services helps with your career search process and helps you get involved with companies and internships.
College Sophomore,5,"My friends and I feel very safe on campus.  There is very little, if any crime on campus.  For the two years I've been attending Juniata, I haven't heard of any sexual assaults or crime on campus.  I feel very safe on campus, as well as in my dorm."
College Sophomore,5,My major is secondary education and the fact that I was student teaching my freshman year speaks volumes about our school.  The alumni that I've spoken to speaks very highly of our career center.  The summer between my freshman and sophomore year I got a paid internship teaching theatre which I really enjoyed.
College Sophomore,5,"My professors make me feel they really care about how well I do in there class.  The class sizes reminds me of high school, with the average class size of 20 students.  The fact that you can make up your major and our school encourages students to think outside the box says a lot about how unique it is.  I'm very happy that I made my choice to attend Juniata College."
College Sophomore,5,"The student body is great.  I was nervous that I would miss home and all my friends, but within a month I felt so comfortable and met so many nice people.  The dorms are clean and the rooms are larger than others that I have seen.  I truly feel that my professors really take a interest in me and care that I'm understanding what they are teaching.  I'm very glad that I made my choice to attend Juniata College."
College Freshman,5,"I could not feel safer walking across campus alone in the middle of the night than I would if I were at home in my own back yard.  There is virtually NO CRIME on campus.  I can leave my laptop & phone on a table in the library, go over to get lunch, come back & everything is right were I left it an hour later.... where else can you do that?"
College Freshman,5,"The POE program at Juniata is fantastic.  Structuring classes around  career interests to get the most out of my college courses & tailor everything to my future endeavors makes for such a fulfilling & enriching education as opposed to ""filling credits"" with mandatory preselected courses.  The professors & advisors make themselves so readily available & useful to the students at Juniata.  This is truly an extended family, not just a ""people factory"" as some other institutions have become."
College Freshman,5,"The family atmosphere between the faculty & alumni, along with the interrelations of the career services department & internship sponsors are so strong at Juniata, it is almost impossible to walk away without some type of job prospect before you leave campus."
College Freshman,5,"There is one word I have to express my feeling for Juniata..... LOVE.  Although no college is perfect, this has been the PERFECT choice for me.  It is my home away from home.  I have a diverse course schedule, the POE program is perfect for my career path & the safety of the campus is awesome.  No, the dorms are not the most up to date & yes, the campus is quite secluded in it's small town atmosphere, but truly, my Freshman year at Juniata could not have been better planned."
College Junior,5,Its a very safe campus with a lot of support.
College Junior,5,Profs are easy to talk to and get help from.
College Junior,5,"Great alum network, recognizable in central PA"
College Freshman,5,Never had nor heard about anything happening .
Recent Alumnus,5,Juniata College has allowed me to grown both socially and academically.  As a shy person
College Freshman,5,My experiences both in the classroom and out of the classroom have been geared towards teaching me good and bad life lessons.
College Freshman,5,I like the idea that Juniata does not offer Greek life.
College Freshman,5,"One of the aspects of Juniata that will always be unique, is their POE system. This allows students to create their focus of study to meet their specific needs. I would choose Juniata over and over again because of the overall atmosphere, the way they (faculty and students included) challenge you, and the life changing experiences it offers you."
Junior,4,"It was difficult at the time when we had to use remote learning for the second half of our spring semester, but the professors handled it well, as did the students. Now, due to Covid, we have a mix of remote and in person learning that makes it easier to manage. The professors are completely understanding and try to help us whenever they can if we feel stuck during the remote learning sessions and I feel comfortable going to them during their office hours over Zoom."
Junior,4,"Overall, I've had a good experience during my time here at Juniata. The atmosphere is amazing and the students and faculty are always very friendly, even if you're a perspective student for the day. The teachers always tend to know each student and they're always there to help with schoolwork or if you even just want to show up to their office to say hi. If I were to change one thing, it would be the block schedule that they have/had that way it was easier to get lunch before the next class."
Freshman,4,"While I did not expect to be learning online, Juniata College definitely pulled through for the students. They did as much as they could to make sure that it was a smooth transition and that we would still get as much out of it as we would in person."
Senior,4,"Juniata has been doing well with online education, but I am happy that they have not gone fully online due to the pandemic. Only 1 out of 6 classes I have this semester are online. Juniata has taken the necessary procedure so that campus-life is not drastically effected by COVID-19."
Junior,4,"I was taking classes aboard when COVID hit, so I did not take classes online with Juniata. From what I heard, professors were very accommodating about the new normal."
Freshman,4,"This is a college meant to gain critical thinking and analytical skills. This is a challenging college and is much more rigorous than anything brand name schools can offer! Many of our alumni claim that Juniata is a harder undergraduate college than any medical school. Our professors are top of the line and absolutely amazing! We have so many traditions and are one massive family at Juniata College. We celebrate together, mourn together, and advocate for one another to make the quality of life on campus the absolute best it can be. The only downfall to Juniata is in terms of being predominately white and centered in a very rural, conservative town. Some minorities find it a little difficult at times, but fight very hard with local chapters to make the surrounding Huntington area as accepting and inclusive as the campus attempts to be. There are instances of racism and minorities can feel excluded at times, but there are many efforts in place to fix this. Juniata is a true home to me!"
Freshman,4,The education side was great some professors I didn’t mesh with. Felt like the over all social atmosphere takes a certain kind of people.
Alum,4,"The professors at Juniata seem to care about each and every student and help them push themselves. The community the students are able to form really makes it feel like home. The living situation is bad, being forced to live in cramped dorms for four years. The administration also seemed to stop caring about students after the first couple years."
Sophomore,4,Juniata is a very welcoming community. I felt right at home after going for my first visit to the campus. I love how small the campus and beautiful the campus is. The dorms need some updating and the food is just like every other college cafeteria.
Senior,4,"Overall, I love Juniata. I wish that there were more options for off campus housing as seniors, and that meal plans were less expensive. The Juniata community is definitely like a family."
Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere at Juniata! It's very welcoming and sort of ""family-oriented"" feeling; people from all over the world attend Juniata and love the inclusion and acceptance that comes with being a Juniata student and that is definitely something that I love and look for. Also, Juniata is awesome academically and offers tons of great opportunities for students of any year."
Freshman,4,I like the town and the area around campus. everyone treats you like a family. You can either stay insider you can go out on the weekends. it's close to home but far enough away that my parents can't come to see me every single weekend.
Freshman,4,It is the most diverse community to experience .It is one of the most friendliest atmosphere and a college with good academics.
Junior,4,"Juniata is a beautiful, private, liberal arts college. You really have the opportunity to learn what you want to learn. For example I have individualized my degree for Environmental Chemistry. I am taking classes in both departments to get a customized degree tailored for what I want to do in life. However the small size comes with some drawbacks. No Greek life, which can be a pro or con depending on what you want in a college. At times, it feels like an upgraded high school, with most people knowing one another and word spreading quickly across campus. That being said, the short walks to anywhere on campus and the great community will give a great experience for anyone looking for a small college experience."
Sophomore,4,"Professors really care about your mental and academic growth. 
Caring and supportive environmental, a small community. 
Challenging classes.
Not a lot of things to do in the area."
Sophomore,4,"I really like the classes I have taken at Juniata, they are informative as well as engaging. They encourage me to think outside of societal norms and push my understanding to different levels. I would like to see better bathrooms and showers in the older dorms."
Senior,4,Juniata is an amazing school filled with many traditions that you will cheerish if you attend! I have found some of the greatest friends at this school and really get one on one time with my professors that truly care about me. The only negative thing I can say about Juniata is that they are very money driven and many of the people in power seem to care more about perspective students then the actual students
Junior,4,I am so glad I came to Juniata. The professors truly care about their students and there is a great support system for help when you need it. The classes are challenging but you learn a lot and it is very easy to stay engaged.
Sophomore,4,"I am finishing my sophmore year, and I have really enjoyed my time at this school.  I love all the opportunites it has given me like studying abroad and an immersion semester at Raystown Lake. They needed better food and replacing Sodexo, and need to update the pool."
Sophomore,4,"Overall Juniata College is a hidden gem in a small town, and is a great college if you are looking at studying environmental science or biology. Juniata also has a very high acceptance rate into medical school of higher than 90%. The people can be quirky and diverse in personality, and there is also a fairly high number of international students for the small class sizes. There are also a large amount of study abroad experiences and a large variety of classes offered from wheel throwing, to Viking Religion, to Modern Genomics. Juniata College may be in a small rural town, but you can always find something to do with friends, in classes, and with campus run activities."
Freshman,4,"Juniata College is a nice place for anyone really want to focus on study. The surrounding is really peaceful and people are really friendly. However, there are not many places for students to hang out. Huntingdon is a really small town."
Sophomore,4,"Juniata is a great school and the professors are always there to support you. They care about your success. The administration is the same way. Every school has its problems, nothing runs perfectly but they try their best."
Senior,4,"Juniata offers a great education, but often lacks in hands on opportunities. What you pay is not greatly seen in return when it comes to housing and food."
Senior,4,"I love the community feel at juniata. Everyone is always helpful...students, professors and other workers...they are always trying to find ways to help others. It is a small campus so it makes you feel at home since you know almost everyone. The friendships I formed the past couple years will be unforgettable."
Sophomore,4,Juniata is a good fit for anyone looking for a small school with rigorous academics and a small town feel. Classes are difficult but most faculty and staff are incredibly supportive and seek meaningful connections with their students.
Sophomore,4,"Entering Juniata as a first-year student was a bit scary at first, but once I was comfortable with the people I would be living with for the next two semesters, I was content with my decision of enrolling at Juniata College. Most of the students are hospitable, as well as the campus faculty and staff. As a small liberal arts college, the professors on campus are always willing to talk with you about any questions you have about class work. One of my most favorite things about Juniata however, is that the student body is very diverse and I have met several life-long friends. The only con about Juniata is that the food is sub-par, because sometimes there is not much of a variety, but then again, you can still get creative with your meals in the cafeteria. Overall, Juniata College was one of the best decisions I have made and even if I will only be there for 3 or 4 years, I believe it will be an unforgettable experience."
Junior,4,Juniata College is a very small knit community. It offers many opportunities for you to be hands on with your Program of Emphasis from your first semester freshman year in all programs.
Freshman,4,"I love the Juniata community, and how friendly and respectful everyone is toward one another. The professors are accommodating, and they always make time for meetings with students."
Sophomore,4,"The first time I came to Juniata was for a college visit. Right away, I knew this was the college for me, mainly because it felt like home.  Everyone here makes me feel so welcomed and comforted which are important feelings a college should be producing in my opinion.  With the classes being fairly small, I get a lot of individual attention and help with my work.  Every professor I have knows me and everyone else by name and genuinely cares about each of us.  There are many campus activities every day of the week that enable students to be more involved and expand on their college experience.  College is an important part of someone's life and should be a positive experience for everyone involved."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy studying at Juniata because I know that they are preparing me for the work force.  The school work isn't easy, but I know that it will be worth it.  The professors are approachable and want their students to succeed."
Niche User,4,"I visited Juniata College for an overnight visit for soccer.  The girls on the team were super nice and were very involved with student life at the school.  A lot of the girls had jobs around campus and participated in intermural activities.  All of the students that I talked to seemed to really enjoy their lives at Juniata College.  The campus was clean, safe, and beautiful; and the surrounding area was beautiful as well.  There was a lot to do around campus with the small town and mountains ranges nearby.  In addition to the campus life, I found that the classes and teachers at Juniata College were exceptional.  When I sat in on a class, the professor was very involved in making sure the students fully understood the materials being taught.  Overall, the college has a great feel and seems like the perfect place to get a quality degree. "
Sophomore,4,"Most students and staff there are really friendly. Juniata also offers a large amount and variety of clubs, making it easy to get to know some of them. So far, the most irritating thing has been doing laundry. There is a laundry alert function on the website; however, it is based on whether the machine is done, not whether it is empty. Besides that, I do not really have any complaints, or at least any that wouldn't apply to a multitude of other colleges, e.g. construction and loud hall mates. "
College Sophomore,4,"there are offices that will work with you to help with your future career,i haven't gone there yet but i know people who have and they describe their experience as effective and helpful."
College Sophomore,4,everyone is very friendly and the professors really want to help you succeed. Juniata also has a lot of really cool traditions.
College Sophomore,4,There is a wide variety of classes offered although not all topics are covered in great detail.  The professors are invested in the education of each student and are willing to do what they can to help struggling students.  Class sizes are comparatively small.  Thirty or less is average except for general classes in the lecture hall.  Students are treated with respect and are encouraged to question and engage in critical thinking.
College Sophomore,4,"I have not had the chance or need as of yet to explore these particular services and such, but I have heard excellent things from fellow students."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel safe on campus, it is a very trusting environment.  Campus security is approachable and easy to contact. We constantly leave our laptops, book bags, etc. unattended during meals and activities without fear of them not being there when we get back."
College Sophomore,4,"The only problem with the dorms is the lack of air conditioning, except in the newest and most expensive dorm Nathan.  There are social spaces in each dorm and activities set up by the RA's for floors and the whole building."
College Sophomore,4,"Juniata is a great College.  All of the faculty is concerned with the success and well being of the students.  Events and activities are constantly provided to give students a break and make them feel included.  With over fifty clubs, intramural sports, etc. it is extremely easy to find people that you identify with while doing something that you love."
College Junior,4,I was able to meet several people in my field of study and from that develop a relationship with them and later secure an internship.
College Junior,4,I was able to meet several people in my field of study and from that develop a relationship with them and later secure an internship.
College Junior,4,Parties are usually pretty tame during the week and weekend and it is easy to get noise to quiet down.
College Sophomore,4,There are great classes available and even better profs
College Sophomore,4,its fun being close to those you have a friend in
College Sophomore,4,My school has a many interesting people to know
College Junior,4,"I have not yet really looked into this, but we do have a major Career Fair on campus every winter."
College Junior,4,"I love the professors; they are always so passionate. However, sometimes it's hard as an underclassman to get a certain class because of senior priority."
College Junior,4,"As mentioned, its a very safe place and I feel comfortable walking alone, on a Saturday night, while drunk."
College Sophomore,4,Juniata is well-respected and there are a lot of alumni who want to help students.
College Sophomore,4,I always feel safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,I loved my dorm and everyone is very conscious of the people living around them.
College Freshman,4,"I'm only a freshman, and I'd prefer to rate the overall education and my confidence in getting a job after graduation once I'm a junior or senior. I don't feel as if I can properly judge yet, since I'm going to really start taking classes in my major in the fall.

There is not a lot to do on campus. I was so bored for the first month or so, but I then found a friend group. Once you find your group, things will improve significantly. If you have a car, make sure you bring it! Sometimes just going somewhere else for a day with your friends is what you need.

The professors are the best part of the school-they actually care about you, and will help you if you approach them. They actually get to know you, which I find really cool. 

It's a small campus in a small town that does not have a lot of things for college students, so be sure that a small campus in such a rural area is what you want before you come here."
College Freshman,4,Internship opportunities are always given to students.
College Freshman,4,The school I attend is unique. Everyone has their own views and personalities and it is easy to find others who you can befriend. The professors care about the students.
College Freshman,4,My professors are extremely supportive of me and have always tried to help me obtain my goals.
College Sophomore,4,"While I think the campus security could be a little better, IE ride bikes or just do a little more to keep students safe, I think it is mostly good. I feel typically safe on campus, around town...that needs some work."
College Sophomore,4,I just wish the dorms were more modern.
College Sophomore,4,Juniata really listens to the students!
College Freshman,4,The science courses are fairly rigorous but our school is known for Biology POEs so if you make it through them you'll be well off. I switched from a Biology POE to a Psychology POE and I would say my classes are still difficult with a lot of homework but much more manageable. Our professors are always willing to help and encourage taking advantage of office hours and tutors. Our classes are small so having close connections with your professor is common.
College Freshman,4,"As a freshmen, I haven't experienced living in all the dorms however I was very pleased with my living conditions. My dorm room was spacious and well lit."
Junior,2,"Juniata College is meant for those eclectic souls in search for a place to call home for four years. That is what drew me to it. However, since living here, I have realized that Juniata does not have its priorities straight at all, caring more about its image than it does its students. It preaches diversity and inclusion, yet most of the students are white. The dorms need to be improved. The mental health services need to be improved. The food needs to be improved. COVID has simply highlighted issues that have been present for years, and the college is still doing nothing to change it. I have made wonderful lifelong friends while at Juniata, but I honestly do not know that if I had to do it again, if I would chose Juniata once more."
College Sophomore,2,"I cannot say much about the sport teams because I am not in a sport. Sport teams tend to get really close, some people see this as them being clique and some are. This goes for intramual sports such as Rugby. 

The facilities suck and the hours are awful. This year they got rid of a wall that seperated the two rooms and now nothing makes sense. 

The machines are old and some are really worn out. 

The pool is almost never open so don't bother."
College Sophomore,2,"I am a Sophmore and I am going to transfer out of Juniata. Most of the Professors are amazing and the ones that are not you will know so you can aviod them. The Professors are litterally the only part of juniata I will really miss because they do care so much about you, not just academically but also personally. Most students have that one Professor they can go to. Another thing I will miss about Juniata is free laundry. 

The students that go here are miss lead and guided into believing that Juniata only accepts the best of the best. That is not true. They accept a lot of students because they know a lot of students will not go. The majority of the students that do attend Juniata is because of Financial Aid. Their financial aid package is very good in compared to some other schools.

The students that go to this school tend to be a mixture of indepedent, passive agressive, and fake. Everyone will be nice to you...to your face. People are very indepedent, I say this good and bad, they are driven, they know what they want to do, and they dont care about you. Because of the size of the school and I think the atmosphere of the place people tend to be passive agressive because looking good is so important. People only want to be around you if you offer them something, such as you have a car or in the same classes (to help with homework).

Even though the Professors are wonderful the Admissions is not. Everything is super confusing to do and no one in admissions will help you.

However, they did send my transcripts quickly.

The buildings do not have that lovely matching arcitecture like other schools. It's a bunch of mismatched buildings. Some buildings are a lot nicer (VLB) than others. Right now, I here the load annoying buzzy of the lights around me. 

Room and Board is a hit and miss. The school are getting rid of some off campus housing to try to demote drinking.

O and drinking is literally the only thing to do on campus. So...yup."
College Freshman,2,"Overall, this school is not worth the money for the education they provide. I feel like many of my high school classes went more in depth then many of the courses I have taken so far. The college also pushes far left political beliefs and it is not accepting of anyone who believes otherwise.  On a more positive note, professors do seem to have a good knowledge of their field."
College Sophomore,2,Very small parties and a lack of variety.
College Sophomore,2,"The quality of food on campus is poor, which leads to unhealthy eating."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus housing is very disappointing, especially when compared to that of nearby universities."
College Freshman,2,"You do not go to Juanita for its parties, which is nice."
College Sophomore,2,"It's hard to get permission to live off campus in non-college owned housing , juniata is very restrictive.  The same landlord has  a housing monopoly and is difficult.  This is a source of frustration for many students."
College Junior,2,"Huntingdon is a very small town. There is no bus nor train to go to a different city. Most students own a car and they drive to State College to hang out with friends. There is an Amtrak station if you want to go on a trip during break, but there's only one train per day. There are some bars in town and students go there to have fun. Underage cannot even enter those bars. There are also some nice coffee shop and restaurant, too, but the options are limited."
College Freshman,2,"There are a few places to go out to eat. There is not a lot of ethnic food but it's ok. We have a ""chinese"" restaurant, Mimi's is the only good place but it acts more fancy than it is and the food is over priced. Boxers is one of the better places to go to. Standing Stone is a nice little cafe with good food."
College Junior,2,"We have a small cafe that is close to campus that has good food and is really nice to study at. other than that there are two sheetz, OIP and normal chain resaurants that are all far enough that you can't really walk."
College Sophomore,2,There are not many minorities on campus at all.
College Sophomore,2,"Huntingdon is such a small town that public transportation really isn't necessary.  A lot of students on campus have their own cars, but it is not necessary.  A lot of attractions in town are within walking distance."
College Sophomore,2,"Students are not eligible to apply for off-campus housing until senior year.  Availability is very limited and the costs are still expensive.  While living on campus is more expensive, costs for rent and food may make up the difference."
College Freshman,2,we are not a diverse campus
College Freshman,2,The wifi here is the most annoying thing on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Huntingdon itself is sketchy, but the college is really nice not a lot of time is spent off campus by students."
College Freshman,2,"Central Pennsylvania winter weather can be pretty bad, but in the spring, summer, and fall campus is absolutely beautiful and everyone enjoys activities like volleyball on the quad."
College Student,2,I think it's not enough for student who owns a car.
College Freshman,2,"When it gets cold, it gets colddddd. They never cancel classes either."
College Freshman,2,There is no club/bar scene. East parties are gross. There is nowhere to go in town even if you do have a car.
College Freshman,2,There is just about nothing to do in town. If you're looking to go out the best places to head are State College and Altoona.
College Freshman,2,"My parents dealt with the financial aid mostly. It was complicated because of my situation. I received a lot of money through scholarships just based on my high school performance. However, only half of it was covered with that so my parents needed more aid. Because they are divorced and my mother remarried, it made things complicated. It took a while for me to get a financial aid letter, but that was mostly due to a problem with tax returns. Hopefully next year will go a lot more smoothly."
College Freshman,2,"There is not much to do in Huntingdon. There are a few local stores and restaurants and a movie theater. Huntingdon is about thirty minutes from state college, where there is a much wider variety of activities to do."
College Junior,2,"You need a car  or a friend with a car for the most part. There is a train station for longer trips in Pennsylvania, but it´s fairly expensive. There´s also a pretty cheap shuttle to PSU once a month, but it only goes for a few hours. "
College Junior,2,"There´s only 2 places to eat on campus, and none of them are entirely amazing. They are working on making improvements, though, and every year the food gets a little better and vegetarian and vegan options have become more prominent. "
College Junior,2,"We are all a bunch of nerds. I´d say we all have pretty outstanding personalities, though, and that´s what counts! The relationships are pretty solid, when they do happen, and a lot of couples end up getting married. "
College Senior,2,"Ugh.  Yeah, don't come here for the food.  The meal plan is weirdly designed and the food is decidedly sub-par."
College Freshman,2,Shuttles are rarely available -- it's hard to get out own the town unless you have a car or friends with cars.
College Freshman,2,"Huntingdon, PA is a very small town so eating establishments are limited."
College Sophomore,2,"The school is a bit in the middle of nowhere between two relatively larger cities in Penn. That being said, people flying in from across the country often enlist the help of local friends to carpool them to campus or take a costly taxi ride into town."
College Freshman,2,juniata is not very diverse however it is getting better. overall it is a good liberal arts.
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't a big variety of off campus dining available. There are some good local places to eat at, but most of it is fast food."
College Freshman,2,"Sodexo food is pretty low on my list of favorites. At the start of the year, they will surprise you with different cuisine from all over the globe. However, as the year progresses you will face a rather bland selection that repeats itself until the end."
College Freshman,2,"Huntingdon, PA is very small. There is not much to do outside of the campus. Into town are a few stores but not for ""shopping"" but mostly for ""necessities"" needed to live. There is a Dollar General, a Supermarket, and other small stores but nothing fancy. There is a small pizza restaurant nearby. Everything you want is within walking distance. There is no mall so if people want to shop, most people travel to Altoona, PA which is about an hour/hour and a half away."
College Junior,2,"There are no clubs here, the best thing to do is find a party that's happening in East dorms. Juniata also has plenty of performances in our theater and events to do around campus. Unless you are serious about your college career, then you can definitely find lots of places and people to study with."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It Exists. Most night life is found in the East dorms, most people party there. You can in the dorms without getting overly crazy. Over 21 people hit the local bars. Very little off campus parties are known of. East is where stuff goes down for the most part."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Basic Dorm Rooms. not much to say, it's a square room with 2 beds, 2 desks, closet and a door. they could be cleaner and renovated..but whatever, hopefully the future students get lucky"
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's PA, Are You Expecting 90 and No Snow/Rain – It's PA, you'll get the cold weather and the snow and the rain. Ton of snow. It does occasionally get very nice out during the spring around the area."
Senior,1,"High quality academics. Unorganized, terrible financial and student support services. Academics and some professors/staff members are the only positive things I have to say about Juniata College after four years of schooling at this establishment."
College Freshman,1,We do not have greek life.
College Junior,1,"Honestly food here is terrible and overpriced. They do not have many options. Salad is not fresh at all, and some soup tastes horrible. They don't know how to cook even rice and fish. Sometimes they have decent food too, but it happens only once in a while."
College Sophomore,1,"We do not have Greek Life at Juniata College, and I like it that way."
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek Life. The sport teams act very clique so they are kinda like greek life.
College Freshman,1,I come from a big city that is surrounded by bigger cities. If you come fro a city you will either love or hate it here. I hate it here. I do not have a car so I am stuck here. They might say they have shuttles to Altoona and State College but it is once a month and costs $10 for the round trip. It sucks. It really sucks.
College Freshman,1,No one lives off campus. If they do it is own by the campus.
College Junior,1,"The school tries to maintain and enforce its rules. However, they could use more enforcement."
College Student,1,We don't have Greek life so this question is inapplicable.
College Freshman,1,"The food service at Juniata, Sodexo, is likely to be one of the worst in the country."
College Senior,1,"Best to Have a Car – The college is in a rural area, so it's tough to get anywhere without a car. The college does provide shuttle services to the airport, but it's $30 round-trip."
Recent Alumnus,1,"short story...you don't have a car? don't have a friend that has a car? 
""oh well, screw you"" -Juniata College.
Need to go to walmart? oh well it's just a 40 minute walk, across a highway, river, streets, a mans backyard, and you're still not there. You'll need a car or someone with a car. They only offered bus trips to walmart at the beginning of the year and a few times to state college during the year. There is a Weis grocery store like 5 minutes from the campus, so that's good. but if you're looking for a bus to take to the nearest mall, LOL!"
College Junior,1,"Not Many Options at All – Fortunately, the students here are lucky where a lot of the things are in walking distance. But if you do not have a car there aren't many options. I know that the school arranges transportation to the airport and such when long school breaks are approaching, but other than that I see it as a struggle. State College is 40 minutes away. If you can get a ride there, their are a lot more options."
College Freshman,1,Sports are not much of a big thing here. They are all D-3 division. The football time is deplorable. The only sports team that is even a little relavent here is the women's volleyball team.
College Senior,1,Middle of Nowhere – Farms and Cows. No public transportation one train through the town a day.
College Senior,1,"I would rather sit in my room doing nothing than go to the on campus parties at this school. All you see are a bunch of ugly underclassmen girls dancing like they're trying to get pregnant in a sweaty college dorm room. It's always hot and smells in these parties and is not worth the trek over to east. Unfortunately the bar scene is no better, unless you like being hit on by some dude talking about his baby mama and not wanting to pay child support. You would think after listening to this for 20 min they would at least offer you a drink, but no. You will leave the conversation with no drink and a few IQ points shorter than when you first started."
College Senior,1,"Juniata College without a doubt has some of the ugliest human beings I have ever seen. You have a lot of girls who know they're unattractive and just accept it but then you have those girls who cake on the makeup wear slutty outfits and go out and grind all night at parties because they think that's somehow going to make them more attractive. Too bad it's not, and the only thing it results in is a ""hit it and quit it"" on the part of the equal unattractive male population."
College Sophomore,1,I have called the finacial aid office numerous times and they still don't seem to have a clue as to what they are doing. I dread dealing with these incompetant people.  I suggest talking to them in person..
College Sophomore,1,"If your looking for diversity, Juniata is not your school!  They like to pretend that they are diverse by having a panel of the five total black kids that go to this school and have them talk about how diverse they are.  Your not fooling anyone Juniata."
College Sophomore,1,Better Have Access to a Car! Unless you feel like walking a few miles to get decent food off-campas dining isn't happening.  There are a few okay restuarants in town like OIP but most of the dining consists of fast food joints.  Sheetz is where almost everyone goes to get nonsodexho food.

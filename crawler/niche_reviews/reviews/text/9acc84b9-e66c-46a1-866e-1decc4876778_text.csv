Freshman,5,"I took the Pandemic summer seminar this year and learned a ton about the current virus and how it affects all aspects of life.  Professors and staff were great, and my classmates all cooperated and had a good time as well."
Sophomore,5,"Although COVID-19 was not easy on anyone, my professors did a great job at trying to keep classes lively and interactive. All my classes were live and had discussions. It’s easy to get behind in online classes, my professors were always helpful with getting me back on track though."
Sophomore,5,"As a marine science major, Eckerd has given me many opportunities that I was scared I wouldn’t get at any other college. Marine Science is not an easy field to jump into, but with all the research experience and good education I’ve been given in the one year I’ve been there, even with COVID-19 involved, I already feel ahead of the game."
Freshman,5,"Eckerd college has amazing staff and opportunities, especially those interested in sciences! I love how I can really make connections with the students and faculty on campus! They truly care about if you succeed or not. The courses are challenging yet rewarding, and it helps that the campus has such a great spot on Florida's gulf coast!"
Freshman,5,"So far I am loving Eckerd, I especially adore all the professors I have experienced--they all seem to really care about each student individually and want to see you succeed. And of course, the campus is incredible with so many different opportunities to learn new skills and hobbies."
Niche User,5,"Eckerd College has been absolutely amazing. I am planning on committing in the next week but assistance from the faculty has been outstanding. The class I attended as a trial was so much fun and the students are more than welcoming. Of course, the sunny climate and warm weather dont hurt!"
Alum,5,"Eckerd is a college that will truly change your life for the better. The school encourages students to study abroad, participate in service work and beat to their own drum."
Freshman,5,"The campus is absolutely beautiful, and the professors are engaged in the classes and actually care about helping students grow. The party scene may not be for everyone, but its perfect for me, especially since greek life wasn't something I was interested in. One big downside for me is the cost, as I have to apply for tons of scholarships to take off some of the financial burden. However, I think it's well worth the high price to attend an academically rigorous college that allows me to grow under the tutelage of professors, all while studying and partying in paradise."
Alum,5,"Eckerd College really is one that changes lives. From the faculty, to the experience, everything about this college shaped me to be the person I am today. I was afforded numerous internships, jobs, and beyond because of Eckerd."
Freshman,5,Beautiful campus! The staff is very helpful and welcoming. They were very welcoming to new students. They also helped me defer and take a gap year. Very awesome school.
Junior,5,"If you’ve ever felt like you needed to grow out of your shell or take your life in your own hands Eckerd is for you! Besides the beautiful beachfront campus, you’ll learn what drives you. You’ll learn how to be a leader, how to make lasting relationships, and how to make your life outside of the box. It’s worth the investment!"
Niche User,5,"I will be a student at Eckerd in the fall of 2020. But, from what I have seen, Eckerd is a paradise. They provide numerous student aid grants to allow their student to focus on their studies and to enjoy the campus. Most importantly, I admire how Eckerd is an eco-friendly school, aiming to better our Earth."
Freshman,5,"Eckerd is a beautiful college with great academics. If you are looking to major in Marine Biology then this school is good for you. The ""barefoot"" campus allows you to bring pets and they have pet friendly dorms."
Niche User,5,The one thing I love the most about this school is the facility they have alone just for marine science students and the school is located on the beach.
Junior,5,"Eckerd has the best faculty of any school I have every attended. They are intelligent, hard-working, and down to Earth professionals."
Niche User,5,"My experience with Eckerd is that I think it has a beautiful environment. I have been to Eckerd for a few camps and activities, and the thing that I enjoyed the most was how the students and the staff were so helpful and kind.I would recommend this college to other people"
Niche User,5,"Eckerd College is my home. It is the greatest place I’ve ever been. From the Dorms to the professors, to the people, it is an unreal experience. There is nothing better than being there. I went to the beach, went fishing, went around the area of St. Petersburg, and played volleyball and football. There was nothing that was impossible and I’m so glad and grateful that I was able to spend time at that school. I loved every second of it."
Freshman,5,"This is my favorite place in the entire world. There is something for everyone here! If a beach and waterfront weren't enough for you, then add in an entire marine science and art building to sweeten the deal. People are always so friendly here and there is always someone to help you at every corner. The teachers are nice and personal and really do try to help you succeed."
Freshman,5,"Eckerd College is an excellent learning facility. All staff and faculty are completely and absolutely devoted to their students. The peer mentor program is unlike any other and an excellent resource for all freshman students, having a peer mentor available to ask advice and questions has really benefitted me and improved my overall academic success. The college is dedicated to the safety and security of each and every one of their students. Student mental and physical health as well as their feelings of self-confidence and safety to be who they are is the most important thing to the Eckerd Administration. To any student considering Eckerd College, you should know you will receive not just an excellent education, but the attention, dedication and care for all faculty and staff that each and every student deserves."
Freshman,5,I like the small class size and how helpful professors are. There are also lots of opportunities to do hands on work. The community is also very tight-knit.
Alum,5,I attended the PEL program starting with an A.S. and completed B.A. in 18 months...the Professors and staff are among the best you could ever ask for.
Freshman,5,"The campus is breathtaking, the education is unmatched, and the research opportunities are once in a lifetime."
Niche User,5,"Eckerd is everything I've ever asked for. The professors are passionate about what they're teaching and are very open-minded and understanding. I am the rare transgender students and I was welcomed with open arms even. I roomed where I felt comfortable. The campus is beautiful and the facilities are amazing. The students are great. The campus isn't very diverse, but I can tell that there are more people coming from different backgrounds. The advisors are amazing and want to help you succeed. I would recommend this college to anyone looking for rigorous coursework and an accepting community."
Alum,5,"A haven for anxiety, depression and societal pressure. Coming to Eckerd will ruin your mental health and social life. The campus is secluded in the middle of nowhere and smells like a dump 24/7 because they CHOSE to build the school next to a water treatment plant to save money. The school pretends to be liberal and activist types but are the actual people causing social injustice. This place lacks diversity in almost everyday you can think of. However, you may get lucky to meet one or two good professors and people but don’t bet on your luck :)"
Freshman,5,Great party school here! It’s it’s chill and classes are serious. And south beach is beautiful! #knowyourlimits
Alum,5,"Best decision to attend. Opened so many career doors for me! Loved being encouraged to travel and to ""think outside""!"
Sophomore,5,Eckerd College changed my life. The community is such a unique and positive place. I’ve never been happier with my life and I owe it all to this school. :)
Sophomore,5,"Whenever I contact Eckerd College (EC), the staff has a warm and welcoming spirit. This not only applies to the staff but the students as well. everyone on campus is friendly and connected. This college feels like a home away from home. the palm trees and lakes that cover the campus give a feeling of being one with nature while also being at school."
Sophomore,5,"It has a very welcoming atmosphere, pet friendly policy, and is an overall unique place. Professors are generally quite helpful and friendly. Academica are rigorous in the sciences."
Freshman,5,The campus is stunning. It is abundantly green and surrounded by water almost everywhere you look. The buildings are all relatively new and very well kept. There is even a student beach area where students can do homework in hammocks on the sand. The waterfront rents boats and gives wakebkarding lessons. It is truly incredible.
Sophomore,5,"Eckerd is a very small, but great liberal arts college in Saint Petersburg. Everything is great here like the small class sizes so you can really interact with your professors and are not just a number. Everyone here is so driven and hard working. Not to mention everyone is super nice and accepting. The small classes really give me a chance to excel while still living in paradise with my friends from all over the country. I could not picture myself being part of any other college community, this is where I belong."
Sophomore,5,Eckerd is a medium sized college located right on the waterfront in beautiful St. Petersburg Florida.  Their admissions counselors and professors are very supportive in creating a program that best suits your career goals. They assign you a mentor who works closely with you to fine tune your program. They have a strong international travel program. There a wide diversity of clubs to get involved with and activities  on campus every day.
Sophomore,5,"Choosing Eckerd was one of the best decisions I've ever made! Eckerd has changed my life tremendously, in a way I could never have imagined. I have made incredible friends and been exposed to amazing opportunities. Eckerd truly lives up to its reputation of one the top 40 colleges that change lives."
Freshman,5,"It's a great school. Everyone is very nice and welcoming, I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. It's right on the water, which means you always have a beautiful view. The campus is great, it's so nice to be able to hang out outside and study."
Niche User,5,Eckerd college has many opportunities that allows students to risk becoming their best and having multiple opportunities to succeed.
Freshman,5,"Everyone is very welcoming, the 'Eckerd bubble' encourages you to discover yourself and your passions, and equips you with the resources to do so."
Senior,5,"The atmosphere, socially and academically, is amazing at Eckerd. I wouldn't change a thing! Longboarding to class barefoot and spending the afternoon tanning on the field or jumping off the pier are some of the things that make Camp Eckerd truly amazing."
Junior,5,"Eckerd College has such a beautiful campus and the fact that the campus has its own beach puts the cherry on top. Not only that, the academics are rigorous and really challenge your intellect to learn as much as possible."
Sophomore,5,Eckerd is such a great environment. I have learned so much personally about myself and academically in my study field!
Freshman,5,"I like how engaged the professors are. Making use of their office times is very important and wise, and it helps a lot for one-on-one discussion with the professors."
Freshman,5,"Welcome to the best college in the entire country.  It's literally like living in paradise with classes. The professors are incredibly intelligent and understanding. The students are beond open minded and so much fun.  There's always really lit parties on campus that never get shut down by cops, it's crazy how relaxed Eckerd is. Coming to Eckerd was the best choice i've ever made. I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER."
Senior,5,"I attended the PEL program starting in the year of  2006.  I always wanted to complete my education and with The PEL program it  was in the setting of older adults seeking the same.  
I was very grateful the have that experience.  The PEL program will be ending May 2017 and I am attempting to complete the final two classes needed for my Bachelor's degree."
Freshman,5,"After my first semester at Eckerd College, I realized I chose the right institution to further my education. Not only does the school provide the courses I need to achieve my major, but the professors and student body offer dozens of internship and outreach opportunities that allow me to get involved in community. In addition, the campus and student life just fits perfectly to my lifestyle."
Freshman,5,Eckerd invites all persons to enjoy college while also challenging them on their academics and worldly views. Making them a more viable person for jobs in their future and readying them for the life ahead.
Sophomore,5,"Eckerd is an absolutely amazing place where dreams come true. Everyone is super friendly, and we have an amazing time. Academics are strong and all of the teachers want to see you succeed. Eckerd provides you with so many job and internship opportunities it is amazing."
Niche User,5,"It has a wonderful campus, I love the small school feel and being so close to the ocean is always warm and inviting."
Freshman,5,"Personally I love it here. I have never been so socially excepted before and have never have had so many opportunities be open to me. It is amazing to make so many friends that are so open to who you are. Many of the professors here are amazing people as well, some even doing their own projects and research projects. Not only does the smaller classes help with learning but it also creates a more interactive environment that it is especially beneficial to the students and professors. With Eckerd being so excepting and so wildly diverse, it creates the best atmosphere to anyone who truly wants to be here and excel in college. "
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love the college! It has such a diverse choice of clubs in which to get involved, there is always help when you need it, the courses are stimulating but not too difficult, and the people are great. The food however could be better."
College Junior,5,"There is no Greek life at Eckerd because it wants to include all students, and not create a sense of exclusivity and entitlement that a lot of the time comes with being in a sorority of fraternity."
College Sophomore,5,"The courses and professors alike are very diverse and fun in their own way. I've enjoyed every professor except for one so far in my college career. All of them care about their students, even putting our mental health before our class and home work. They believe that each student learns differently and I think that makes a huge difference in the success of the students. Each class averages around 20-30 students, meaning that it's very easy to have one-on-one with a professor, which furthers the learning experience for everyone."
College Sophomore,5,"This college is well known for it's students and their work ethic. It's incredibly easy to get a job after leaving this school because the employers know that each student was not just a number but was taught individually to their best potential. If you're not sure what you want to do, career services is very helpful in finding what suits you best without any trouble at all."
College Sophomore,5,"I have never felt afraid to walk around my campus, no matter what time of day it is. All faculty and staff members value the safety of students and help when they can. There's an orientation for all new students that describe what to do to avoid, what to do in, and what to do after all situations involving the safety of oneself or another person."
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love the college I go to! The professors are incredibly understanding and passionate about what they teach, and are willing to help students out whenever they are needed whether or not it's office hours or not. I also love how 98% of the students and staff and the college are 100% approachable and they are very kind and interesting to speak to. We also have a beach and swing sets to keep the child inside of us all alive, but my absolute favorite characteristic of this college is that they allow you to keep your pets on campus so you'll never have to be apart from your furry friend again! This college really caters to students' needs and if I had to do it all over again I would pick this college every time."
College Sophomore,5,"There is always something to do at Eckerd, but only if you want to."
College Sophomore,5,Almost all people at Eckerd are very accepting.
College Sophomore,5,the athletic facilities are well kept and the fan support is very good at athletic events and I would rank the support in the top 5 in the country.
College Sophomore,5,its very fun and the population size at Eckerd is just right for the student body.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I am not kidding when I say this school changes lives. We are listed in the book colleges that change lives, but it is something you can truly understand until you come here. Everyone comes with very different ideas on what college is supposed to be. This place kind of helps unify those ideas into one experience. I had friends that were ford scholars and led the improv troup. I had friends that were skaters and business majors. My roommate was a DJ and an environmental major. Eckerd allows you to broaden your horizons and give you a new perspective on the world. The one problem this school has is you will become some close with so many open minded people that it is hard to transition out of it. This is not your usual experience, you do not go to this school to just be another face in the crowd. You go to this school to stand out. Our motto is think outside and that seems very straightforward with an outdoor themed campus, but it is a deeper concept, this place teaches you to think outside of yourself."
College Freshman,5,No complaints. Seems safe. I've never had an issue.
College Freshman,5,"They have an entire office just for jobs, current and future. You run into great networking opportunities even just being around campus."
Freshman,4,"As an incoming freshman at Eckerd, I'm happy with how friendly and helpful the staff are.  I haven't experienced life on campus yet, but my time in the online summer seminar was great and I have a feeling the professors and students will be just as enthusiastic in person as they were over video calls."
Sophomore,4,"I think the online resources Eckerd College uses are very comprehensible and easy to navigate. When my classes went online because of COVID-19 my professors remained, if not increased, their communication despite our lack of in-person contact."
Sophomore,4,Many of the professors took advantage of this time loading on the work. The communication between the school and students was however helpful.
Junior,4,"Very good school, but very very expensive. Fantastic professors, classes, and faculty and programs. Met some amazing people so far and am excited to finish my final year, however even with scholarships and grants I am drowning in debt. I wish the school was better with financial aid for students who are struggling."
Niche User,4,I loved the atmosphere and overall feel of the college. I would have liked to see a little more talking with the professors though.
Junior,4,"The class sizes are extremely small and give you a chance to connect with each professor and learn on a different level. The campus itself is beautiful and the people, staff and students, are extremely welcoming."
Junior,4,"Eckerd College has an amazing study abroad program. Most students go abroad at least 1 semester, and some do 2! But don't worry, if you don't feel like leaving the sunny beaches of Florida which are right down the street from campus, you can go on a winter term trip abroad for 3 weeks, or take a spring break trip abroad. Eckerd is generally small compared to other campuses, so friendships are very easy to make. The only only downside of living on campus in the traditional dorms, is that you are required to be on the meal plan all 4 years, unless you have a medical exemption. If you live in  a suite or a community living style dorm however, you are not required to be on the meal plan. Eckerd friendships are not limited by which graduating class you are, which is one of the things I really like about the school."
Sophomore,4,I just finished my first year at Eckerd College and it was an amazing experience.  The class sizes are small so you can get help from the teacher a lot better than if the class sizes were bigger.  Eckerd College is a very friendly and great campus. The people you meet at Eckerd are so sweet and very friendly.  Would completely recommend for any high school senior looking at colleges.
Alum,4,It is a great college with great experiences. The only thing that might hinder your choice is the price to attend.
Freshman,4,I love Eckerd. It is a beautiful campus with amazing staff and students. It feels like a safe environment and there are so many opportunities offered to the students.
Sophomore,4,The college and education itself is amazing. With such a small school you are working very closely with professors and you gain opportunities you wouldn't elsewhere. Their administration needs to get it together though and work cohesively. They also need to stop over accepting students because theyare far beyond capacity.
Sophomore,4,"Great experiences, and great location! It is very expensive but definitely worth the money. You’ll meet great people and really get a chance to experience different kinds of people from all over the world."
Freshman,4,"Eckerd is truly pure magic. You will have amazing experiences and friends. Everyone at this school wants to save the world or have a dream that they are really pursuing. The professors will get to know you and administration is generally very nice. The biggest piece of advice I can give is that you will get from Eckerd what you put in. I know everyone says that, but that's because it's true. The one complaint I have is that Eckerd is definitely a bubble and you can lose sight of the real world (oh and the food... meh). Make sure Eckerd is for you, but if it is you won't even believe what's in store for you."
Freshman,4,"Eckerd College is a small, private university with a close-knit atmosphere. I like that the class sizes are small and each professor knows and cares about each student individually. Although the campus encourages an open-minded, liberal environment, I do feel that the school lacks representation and diversity of opinions at times. All in all though, the campus, academics, and student life are amazing."
Freshman,4,"I came and still go to Eckerd for two reasons. The academics are strong and personal with great professors, and the study abroad programs are well done and easily accessible. As a double major, the workload is very manageable. The mentoring program is excellent and I am very close with my professor mentor, but it is what you make of it. I also plan on studying abroad multiple times, which is only possible at Eckerd compared to regular institutions. Otherwise, the students who attend are self-proclaimed hippies with too much money and weed. There are gems within the community, I love my friends that I have, but the majority of the student population are as described above. The food and housing are mediocre at best, and the party scene is insane and not at all fun. St. Pete kinda sucks and is extremely segregated, and the downtown is just expensive. For the amount of money I am spending, I'm disappointed that the campus life is not up to par with the academics."
Alum,4,"Take full advantage of the waterfront activities - paddle boarding, wakeboarding, etc. Participate in the campus activities, however also remember to STUDY!!!!"
Niche User,4,"Visiting is like a vacation, gorgeous campus and amazing diverse food. Extremely expensive though. Although you get a lot of bang for your buck, it's still hard to fathom how much debt you'll have after you graduate."
Alum,4,"Eckerd College truly is a ""college that changes lives."" I was initially drawn to the warm climate and laid-back environment of Eckerd, but the professors, classes, and extracurricular activities are top-notch. Through my four years at Eckerd I was able to study abroad multiple times, participate in several different community service projects, and expand my horizons through meeting a diverse group of people."
Freshman,4,"Very fun and engaging. Eckerd University has a beautiful campus and a quite pleasant social scene. Beyond the sandy beaches and sunny faces the academic and club potential is quite sufficient. Also if you like to party, that does go on."
Junior,4,"Eckerd is a beautiful ""summer camp"". I love how small all of my classes are and I love the environment here. This is a very inclusive, liberal arts school where students are given a lot more freedom than most universities. Eckerd will change your life."
Senior,4,"I love Eckerd. It is a tight-knit community that has proven to able to cater to each individual student. While tuition and fees can be a steep financial burden, and the administration's sometimes lax attitude to actually helping you, the all around experience definitely makes up for it. My professors are great people, who really want to see me succeed. The community, though clique-ish at times because of Eckerd's size (<1800 students), is unique and fun-loving once you find your crowd."
Sophomore,4,"Eckerd College more amazing people working there than you'd ever expect when first looking at the school. Having professors who really want to work with you and see you succeed seriously does make all the difference. The rowdy party scene also doesn't hurt my rating of the school, though the amount of sexual assaults which occur on-campus and are covered up by the school heavily encouraging men and women to not report to the police is....heavily concerning. The food also has a tendency to roll the stomachs of anyone who doesn't have iron organs, and what's worse, there's no 24/7 place to eat on campus. There are very strict meal times in the cafeteria, and the meal plan is absolutely enforced (if you look in the handbook, it says the only way to get off it is a medical note from the Dr.!) which extremely cost-inefficient when there are free weekly shuttles to Wal-Mart.  Other than that, Eckerd's a great place, would highly recommend."
Freshman,4,"I love it here.  The student body is so diverse and accepting of everyone.  The professors truly care about each student and want them to succeed.  Anyone who wants a small, liberal arts school should look into Eckerd College."
Freshman,4,"As an incoming freshman, I was very terrified being so far from home. The people of Eckerd made me feel super comfortable right away. I made friends immediately and see them as life long friends. The professors are extremely helpful and the academics are very challenging. Although many of these classes are extremely challenging their are many things that Eckerd offers to help students improve their skills. I love this school an cannot see myself anywhere else."
Freshman,4,"Love it here. Beautiful school. Great academics. Very liberal student body. However, excessive partying and alcohol-drug abuse that is largely ignored by everyone."
College Junior,4,Volleyball team is really good.  Enjoy going to rugby games
College Junior,4,Eckerd is a beautiful campus with many ways to relax and release stress.  The classrooms are not big which is also a plus
College Sophomore,4,Party in Omega called around the world is great for everyone.
College Sophomore,4,I love my classes. Especially the smaller sized ones with up to 8 people. It's great. Discussions are things I look forward to doing because it gives me a chance to hear many angles and views on a particular subject. The professors are great. They will bend their backs to help in any way they can and will point you in the direction you want to go. Most of my first year teachers were very awesome and even concerned about my health! I was so suprised by such genuine care.
College Sophomore,4,"In Autumn Term we're givien lectures and guidelines about being safe on campus. I feel safe to the point I can walk away from my things and feel that no one would take something. I have never been in or around or involved in a situation where someone was sexually abused. I've encountered a classmate who bravely decided to tell her story, but other than that I have heard of or been around nothing of the sort."
College Sophomore,4,It's good to live on campus. I lived in an atmosphere where the whole house was really connected and spent a lot of time with each other. It was like living in a big house with the family. There were good and bad but the culture was very open and friendly.
College Sophomore,4,"I love Eckerd, but it would be even better if the tuition was lower. It's my dream school but it's stressful trying to find funds for what may be my last year. I have good scholarships don't get me wrong it's just I wish school was more affordable. I love the friends I've made and I really do have so much hope in store for this next year. I've come so far and I'm only entering my sophmore year! Professors are super helpful and understanding. Life is great and I get an even better experience of school when I press into the resources that are there and readily available just for me! It's great."
College Junior,4,"Especially for a science related degree, Eckerd's name will take you places. Though a much smaller school, Eckerd still has influence in the scientific community. For other majors, Eckerd is relatively unknown still. But in what the name itself lacks, professors usually try to compensate for. There are a lot of students that do individual projects with professors that give them the recognition needed for certain jobs or internships."
College Junior,4,"The class sizes are small and are great in catering to individual students when they need the help. Most professors are extremely engaged and accessible outside of class and in office hours.  The courses range in quality depending on the major. There are more amenities for a science major then there would be for a major in the creative arts or business, which is understandable being that a majority of students at Eckerd are science majors. Albeit, it's still unfair to the students studying other things."
College Junior,4,"I chose my school on a whim. At the time, it was about getting to college and graduating with the least debt possible and Eckerd made that a possibility. But in my time here I've grown to love it in a way I didn't think I would. My classes are engaging and fun, and the small class sizes allow professors to really cater to an individual students needs. Academically, I couldn't think of a better fit for me."
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus, once you go through the hell of the housing process (people), is quite lovely. The dorms aren't huge but they're always clean, people are generally friendly and quiet, dorms are priced well, both depending on the dorm you're in, and the beach is only a couple hundred feet away.  The only issue is the housing people themselves. My college usually does a room draw, but due to an emergency and timing, I wasn't able to attend. When I told the head of housing, she was incredibly rude and I still don't know what room I'm supposed to be in!"
College Freshman,4,Offered a wide range of classes.
College Sophomore,4,The academics are great! There are a lot of great programs available to students.
College Sophomore,4,If you don't do drugs you're not ostracized.
College Sophomore,4,my experience has been really good so far I get along with my professors and they teach some valuable things.
College Sophomore,4,I think the campus security does a very good job keeping unknown people off the campus at night time and they keep an eye on people during day time.
College Sophomore,4,its pretty fun living in the dorms and spending time with people in the dorms but sometimes it becomes frustrating when people break things and the cost is split between all the dorm attendees.
College Senior,4,The campus I was on had no issues
College Senior,4,Eckerd has a very respectable association with all their degrees
College Senior,4,"I have had a great experience with the PEL program at Eckerd College, I have learned a great deal and the professors are very interested in helping students succeed,"
College Junior,4,"I am very confident that I will receive employment after I graduate due to the various alumni networks (which are growing each year), and opportunities made possible by our career services here on campus."
College Junior,4,"The smallness of the classes provides for the most intimate relationships between professors, students, and their peers. Individual attention can be given to those in need, which provides for a true, communal atmosphere on the Eckerd campus."
College Junior,4,"Living on campus is what almost every Eckerd student does. The on campus housing that is provided by the school is quite stellar, the social atmosphere is great and the campus is stunning. The only issue is that sometimes people tend to get trapped on campus, which is not always a bad thing."
College Junior,4,"My experience thus far has been, as cliche as it sounds, absolutely life changing. I've had the chance to live in an adverse, yet open-minded, environment where I've encountered many mistakes but even more successes. As a double major in International Business and International Relations I've been personally and academically challenged to explore areas of academia that I had not even considered before. There have been many professors here at Eckerd who have inspired me to excel beyond my initial beliefs and who have mentored me to walk the right path to be the person I hope to be. Eckerd changes lives in the greatest ways that one could think of. I more than recommend a prospective student to at-least visit this campus so that they might have a similar opportunity to the one myself, and many other students have had before me."
College Student,4,"Professors know your name, accept your personality, and they're excited to teach you."
College Student,4,"Eckerd's sciences are very well-known regionally, especially marine and environmental sciences. With connections made from your professors and an internship and some study abroad experiences, you're golden as  science major. Other majors such as lit, women's studies, stuff like that is where prospects get choppy but that's like most colleges."
College Student,4,"I used to go to University of Tampa. Although Eckerd is only about 25 minutes away, it could not be more different. People here are relaxed, open-minded, and motivated. Great study abroad opportunities that about 60% of students partake in. University of Tampa was preppy, growing too fast, and professors were impersonal and out of reach. Here, professors literally call you on the phone at 10 pm if you email them with a problem or urgent question. I love it."
College Freshman,4,I don't feel unsafe on campus. We look out for each other. we do campaigns to spread awareness and how we can prevent things like this from happening. They have support for you if you need to talk to anyone.
College Freshman,4,Courses are engaging and fun. The professors have a lot of office hours witch are convenient. They are very approachable and want students to ask questions and visit them. I've had lunch with two of my professors so far and i hope to continue the tradition. They are so nice and they have a lot of knowledge. I learn a lot from them.
College Freshman,4,Alumni like to visit and even help participate in a class. one alumni spoke in my winter class about being a leaders and how she became a business women. The career center is great. They have a lot of opportunities around the bay areas and will find you an internship. They also have internship fair where employees around the area come to hire students.
College Freshman,4,Its great. We have our own beach! The dorms are near each other but need renovations. They are working on that. Like all colleges its expensive and the tuition is rising. the pub and cafe are in convent places. The Pub is the best place to get food and it has healthier options.
College Freshman,4,My schools location is the best. I love the warm weather. The professors are so encouraging. I've had lunch with two of my professor so far. They are so help and know what they are talking about. I love that my school has winter term where we can study abroad and not have to take a whole semester off if we don't want to do that. I am so excited for what my college abroad experience will take me. Eckerd has fantastic study abroad programs.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, I've been really happy here. I love my professors, the classes are great and the other students are pretty cool too."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't really do much with athletics, but we have a nice fitness center for everyone, a gym, an outdoor pool, a beach volleyball court, baseball/soccer fields, outdoor basketball court and tennis courts, and a 12 million dollar sailing center."
College Sophomore,4,"The school is awesome. The professors are amazing, they really care about their students and what they are teaching. It's like they're your friend. The kids are pretty nice too. While the school is generally very white and rich, there is no lack of open-mindedness. We are also very liberal. The campus is gorgeous, complete with our own beach and boathouse. Internet can be a little of a problem sometimes, but its manageable. Plus study abroad is very popular and good. My favorite thing about this school is that we don't have to wear shoes anywhere except the dinning halls. Food tho could be a lot better."
College Freshman,2,"This is a total party school where everyone gets wasted on the weekends and there isn't much else to do. Unless you have a car, there isn't any way to get off campus to go downtown, and there's nothing to do in the surrounding area. The classrooms are incredibly out of date and many professors still use over-head projectors. There are no smart boards or any use of electronic sources for teaching. The beach is nice, but if you don't drink and party, it's really difficult to make friends."
College Freshman,2,The gym is super small and out of date
College Freshman,2,Everyone is always drunk or high
College Freshman,2,"As a math major there are very few of us.  I thought having few kids to compete with would be nice, however it is not and the math department is lacking."
College Freshman,2,"This school is so small, and the kids here make it feel even smaller.  They think they are all ""free"" and ""open-minded"", however anyone with conservative beliefs is most likely resented or looked down upon by fellow students.  Kids who come from privileged backgrounds feel as if they need to hide that in fear of judgement."
College Freshman,2,"We have no football team which I like.  However, hardly anyone attends sporting events.  My high school had bigger student fan sections, and my high school had about 600 less students."
College Freshman,2,"I feel as if I am one of few students who has any idea what he wants to do.  Many kids come here thinking they are going to be ""Marine Scientists"".  However by the end of the first semester freshmen year half of those ""Marine Scientists"" have switched their majors and do not know what they want to do with their life.  Kids just seemed lost here.  If you have a good head on your shoulders and can take care of yourself, a lot of kids here you will find annoying."
College Freshman,2,"It's super small and if you do not fit in with the general population of the school you will not fit in, the variety of students is very low."
College Junior,2,"The food is bad.  On the best days, it's ok.  Dinner is 5-7 pm, which I think is early.  The pub is open for better hours, but the food options there get repetitive."
College Freshman,2,"Since it's such a touristy area and by the beach, there's not a lot of realistic off-campus options. It's okay though because most people would prefer to live on campus anyway."
College Freshman,2,Sometimes it can be pretty good but more often than not it's frustrating and disappointing. The salad bar in the caf is usually pretty on point though. Pub food doesn't usually disappoint either.
College Freshman,2,it's all chain restaurants except for one or two that you can get to that are close. But you can go to publix and pick up stuff to cook with.
College Freshman,2,"Caf - has many options. I can usually find something to eat there. The made to order grill is always good. I don't like the hours or how busy it is. It's also inconvenient for me since its on the opposite side of campus from where I have all my classes and live.

Pub - limited options and always crowded when its open for meal blocks. Food is always good though. I wish they had healthier sides however. Sometimes the portion of food is not enough to fill you up.

CEC - good quality food usually. Not very crowded most of the time. Limited options though. Not always able to find something to eat

Everything needs more salt and pepper, or general seasoning!"
College Freshman,2,We have a community bathroom.
College Freshman,2,I was living with my aunt in her tiny apartment but everywhere else I saw was in a very poor area and seemed difficult to obtain.
College Freshman,2,There's not much around campus except for a few beaches. The area isn't very safe or friendly except for downtown.
College Sophomore,2,Pub is at least consistent. Caf is inconsistent and often bad if you get there late or past the initial rush.
College Senior,2,Its expensive and unavailable. The school does not help with finding housing.
College Senior,2,"There's not much. Everything's either too expensive, in an unsafe area, or in a retirement community. The school does not help students find off campus at all, despite the fact that there's not enough housing on campus."
College Senior,2,"It seems like school picks and chooses who gets in trouble. Most people don't have a problem though, because on the weekends everyone is partying so unless you're doing something really bad and obvious you'll be fine. Eckerd is cracking down hard on kids who sell marijuana because they want to clean up the school's reputation even though its slowly becoming accepted in the rest of the country."
College Senior,2,"The health services are awful. You have to make appointments in advance and they cannot treat emergency issues, most people end up going to the emergency for minor injuries and such. Counseling is very easy to get however and the mental health sevices are good."
College Senior,2,"There dused to be a lot of pot-smoking hippies here, but now the main drugs are alcohol and cocaine. There's no peer pressure although if you choose not to partake you will find the campus is very boring and people are content with it because they are drugged up."
College Senior,2,Little opportunities in non-science programs.
College Senior,2,"Although not all people are wealthy and white here, it seems that way and is hard if you don't fit in."
College Sophomore,2,"This is definitely not an athletic school. The biggest sport on campus is Rugby, and its a club sport. Basketball and Soccer are also popular, but we don't even have a football team. Lots of people play intramural or club sports. There is very little school spirit."
College Sophomore,2,"Cocaine has recently become the party drug at Eckerd, but its reputation on campus is really more centered around a selection of notable people and most students do not partake. Marijuana is huge on campus and most students to partake. Alcohol is very easy to get your hands on at Eckerd. It is also a Wet Campus, meaning that if you are over 21 you are allowed to drink on campus. Campus Safety can be lenient and easy to avoid unless you are blatantly obvious about your drug or alcohol consumption. They crack down harder during Autumn Term with the freshmen though. The Community Standards Board will nail you with every violation under the sun, and then some if you get caught."
College Sophomore,2,"I have not had any good experiences with the administration. They tend to be very unfair and inconsistent in their punishments and will charge you with violations on very little evidence. You may have to fight for exemptions for violations if you need to get help from Campus Safety for a friend who has had too much to drink. Campus Safety officers here are very nice and easy to get along with. Their number one priority is student safety, whereas it appears to be making money through fines for the Community Standards Board and Administration."
College Freshman,2,Marine Science is very hard if you want to do it you need to work very very hard
College Freshman,2,"You need a car to comfortably get out of campus. There are some shuttles that take you to malls which are very convenient. Taking the public bus is convenient to those daring students who don't mind riding with interesting people, aka scary and creepy."
College Senior,2,You really really need a car or a friend with a car here. The public buses are very annoying and really not used by anyone on campus and taxis cost $20 each way to get downtown.
Recent Alumnus,2,"My response to this question is always ""what college population doesn't take part in drugs?"" Whether a college campus is large or small, every student has a good chance of being pressured into the social aspect of the drug scene. Although, campus enforcement became strict when drug usage was noticeable. At the same time, they didn't intrude on student privacy. "
College Sophomore,2,"There are a lot of computers in the library and lab, but they're old and slow."
College Freshman,2,Housing around the area seems expensive and unsafe.
College Freshman,2,The only form of transportation is a Uhaul car which is inconvenient because its too expensive. Secondly is the local bus but they are unsafe. In all transportation for freshmen at Eckerd should improve.
College Freshman,2,No diversity or flavor! Everything is salad or pizza.
College Freshman,2,I think administration turns their heads to be honest.
College Freshman,2,"Almost no one comes to games. We are D2, so sports are not a big part of campus life. I went to the first mens home basketball game and there was about 40 people there, including parents. No one was cheering and everyone was super distracted and not into the game.

Intramural and clubs are hard to find information on. For the most part, there are a few club and intramural teams that are big(Tennis, Lacrosse), but everything else ends up falling apart because people stop coming to practices.

The athletic facilities suck. There is one turf field and one gym, which is way too small to support everyone on campus. The pool is ok. "
College Freshman,2,There is no public transportation around the campus. It is easy to rent the car using the school's uhaul car share program that charges 5 dollars an hour. There are only three cars and the times are usually filled up on the weekends. 
College Freshman,2,There is no off-campus housing that is connected to the school. There are some apartments very close to the school that students can rent on their own. The surrounding area is not very safe and is not recommended for women to walk alone at night. 
College Freshman,2,The wifi on campus is really bad the internet crashes all the time.
College Freshman,2,The school is a big party school. I do not recommend going to this school is you are not plan on drinking. There is really nothing else to do on campus and if you dont have a car you cant get to anything off campus to do.
College Sophomore,2,"Drugs are available. The most easily available is marijuana. The school has systems set in place to discourage and punish the use and distribution of drugs, but it is easy to see how many of your peers enjoy the use of drugs. Once in a while we have ambulances come for students - mostly for alcohol consumption though. It's really bad on big party nights like kappa karnival."
College Sophomore,2,The food at the main caf is usually not so great. They make the same stuff and it gets pretty boring. Tritons Pub is pretty good. Mostly greasy stuff though they do make wraps as well. The CEC is really good but it is at the front of the campus in Sigma area far-ish away. Off campus has more options but it will add up if you only eat off campus.
College Junior,2,I am not sure if there is much off-campus housing at the Tampa campus. It is a very busy street so it might be somewhat expensive.
College Junior,2,"There is not a great financial aid system at Eckerd, unless there is a great effort made to get real help. They do tend to give out scholarships, but they are not enough for the cost of schooling."
College Junior,2,The food around St. Pete is fine. There's a fair amount of fast food by Eckerd.
College Junior,2,Eckerd sports just barely pass as sports. I can describe the scene in one word: pathetic.
College Sophomore,2,"There is very little racial diversity at Eckerd, and most students are pretty liberal and come from a relatively wealthy background. With that being said, there is a fairly large gay population that is widely accepted by the rest of the students. Acceptance of any difference in general is really easy to come by at Eckerd."
College Sophomore,2,"The most popular sports at Eckerd are Basketball, Soccer, and Rugby. The rugby games are the most gone to by the student population and can be a fun  time. There are also many club and intramural sports such as softball, volleyball, sailing, basketball, ect. Anyone can join club or intramural and it is a great time."
College Freshman,2,"The cafeteria becomes repetitive after awhile.  Bon Appetite varies in three sections, but the rest is always the same food.  The Pub has great food but if it's all you eat, it will become repetitive as well since the menu is always the same.  There are numerous fast food places nearby, but for those who are looking for a more healthy option could find it better to find a way off the meal plan.  The cafeteria and Pub have set eating times, so it is not ideal for getting food when late night cravings hit."
College Sophomore,2,"Quality and variety about like most campuses, some of the selection gets old. I wish there were more healthy options."
College Junior,2,"I do not take part in such activities, but I hear about a lot of kids using drugs. No one that I am friends with does drugs so I really try not to accociate with those that partake."
College Sophomore,2,"Eckerd definitely has a lot of alcohol mainly because it is a wet campus so anyone 21 and older can drink anywhere on campus. Marijuana is popular but it really just depends on who you hang out with. A lot of the freshman get too crazy when they first come to Eckerd and end up drinking too much and with added drugs in their system, they usually have to go to the hospital. Most of the upperclassmen have things figured out and don't go beyond their limits."
College Freshman,2,"Eckerd is kind of far from any city so if you dont have a car the best you'll get is Taco Bell. But if you take the time to go to St. Pete there are really delicious and diverse restaurants, especially in the arts district. The most popular place that everyone really likes to go is Taco Bus, its not authentic mexican but its alright."
College Freshman,2,Not very many people get excited about the sports teams besides the players themselves. The most popular sport would probably be the club rugby team who are pretty decent and are really cool people.
College Freshman,2,"If you want to find an off campus house, you probably can but on campus living is the best option for Eckerd lifestyle."
College Sophomore,2,"At Eckerd most people live on campus. This is mainly because if you leave off campus you really miss a lot of the campus activity. There is also a little bit of an issue with finding off campus housing because you do need a car, and most people did not bring their car down to Florida. This is because most  people are actually from out of state."
College Sophomore,2,"The food on campus is usually not very good. In my opinion the pub food is better than the ""caf's,"" however there is not a large variety. Since there are only three places to eat on campus the food gets blase very quickly. There are vegetarian options available which is a plus, and they claim to be fairly organic but I'm skeptical. It could be worse though."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is a Pub on campus where you can by beer (if your legal age, of course), but its not really a typical party scene although they try with concerts and events. Upperclassmen have parties in Nu & Omega on a regular basis."
College Sophomore,2,"Better Than Most Schools but They Seem to Be Toughening up – Smoking weed in your dorm room or drinking gets you a large fine but you won't get kicked out. The officer at the front gate is power hungry and likes to scare young girls and send undeserving kids to jail. Most of campus safety are relatively nice guys. Don't smoke in the dorms or anywhere too public, don't have drinking games openly and you will be fine."
Junior,1,"Please for my sake, as a current student, do not come here ! This college is chalk full of posers. If you are serious about both your personal well-being and scholastic development then this is not the place for you. I want whomever is reading this to recognize that under the adjectives that describe this school is the term ""pot-head"" which is an understatement. Not only do student smoke weed but they also consume cocaine, molly, shrooms, acid, and every other drug you can think of with the exception of only heroin ! Yes that's right people consume meth on campus ! If I were in your situation, reader, I would take a step back and religiously contemplate my words as they are real ! I have had family attend this god forsaken place.  am a current student that is looking out for you. I don't want you to make the same mistake I did, please do not come here. I beg you."
Alum,1,"The department I was in was gutted my senior year. The social scene is toxic, you're either in or out, that's it. Even your friends will probably ditch you at a Kappa party without a second thought. The dorms are ok. Professors blatantly play favorites. Career resources is worthless. I received no advice on what to do as graduation came closer and was told I would be good for a masters program... A month after applications closed and almost a year after I should have started. All of my current earnings are from self learning I did after graduation (a skill I possessed before college). A complete waste of time and money"
College Freshman,1,RA's don't care about anything
College Sophomore,1,rugby is the only good sport
College Sophomore,1,"Biggest mistake of my life.  Most students are stuck up and on drugs - the jocks, and there are more every year, are the biggest users of all, like the golf and baseball teams.  This place has really changed.  Dozens of students get kicked out each semester, particularly if you are on scholarship"
College Freshman,1,Eckerd does not display affection towards the varsity teams. No one supports them. Games a full of parents and old people
College Freshman,1,The main caf is disgusting and CEC offers limited options and hours
College Junior,1,Eckerd doesn't have greek life and we like it that way. It is really easy to make friends here and its such a small campus that we feel like a friendly community.
College Senior,1,"Housing is horrible, very limited choices."
College Senior,1,You NEED a car. Do not come here if you do not have a car. Just don't. You'll have to rely on people or anything and everything. Zip cars and expensive and unavailable.
College Senior,1,"You should see the condition of the Omega Parking lot, where the majority of students park. We have about 30+ pot holes that always are reopening up and quickly fixed. Who knows how long its been since the parking lot has been repaved. Everyone has a car here so its impossible to find spots much of the time. Freshmen have to park absurdly far away from most dorms, unless they live in Beta or Gamma."
College Senior,1,"Its always not working at the most inconvenient times, like registration."
College Senior,1,All rich white spoiled kids who think they're alternative and unique.
College Senior,1,"Freshman year was the best year of my life, most of friends didn't make it through the year because it was so fun. It was full of hippies, fire spinners, genuine, nice people, everyone drank and smoked together and security was relaxed. Things quickly took a turn after though. After being silent witnessed (Eckerd's form of anonymously telling on someone) for something small, I was kicked out for a year, worked my ass off to come back, and have seen the administration of the school steer it the wrong way since. The strictness has increased in order to improve the school's reputation, making it a miserable place compared to what it used to be. Five of my close friends just got expelled for smoking weed. The school spends all its money on landscaping that does not need to be done (ripping up perfectly healthy plants every year) and the students get nothing in return. One event they promised to be catered by Chipotle, but when hundreds of students showed up under the impression of free dinner, all they had to serve was chips and salsa. This type of thing happens a lot at Eckerd. The school puts on a great font to prospective students making it look like the best place ever, but when you actually come here the experience is nothing like promised. The meal plan, seriously makes me sick everyday. The chefs are high and not trained well and the school makes it impossible to get off the meal plan. People with legitimate medical concerns like celiac disease are denied requests off the meal plan because the school insists they only want to get off to save money. Although the school claims to have improved its food, all you have is pizza, a moldy salad bar, burnt burgers, cold food, and for vegetarians raw slabs of tofu and peppers (what they served today...) The one positive thing I have to say, is the professors I've had are all really smart and engaging. Unfortunately for them, they have to deal with an awfully run school, but they really care about their students."
College Senior,1,"Athletes are treated differently at this school. They all travel in packs, take the same classes and barely do any work but teachers pass them anyway. Most athletes transfer to be honest."
College Senior,1,"Housing is horrible. Eckerd has recently started admitting way more students than they can accommodate and not everyone ends up getting housing. Competition for upperclassman dorms nor any non-traditional housing is very stiff and some people are unlucky enough to get stuck in a traditional double for years. Room draw is based on the lottery system, and there are no incentives like high grades to get better housing. The dorms were meant to be temporary and were never renovated and students get sick from the vents that are only cleaned every 10 years. There is someone who cleans the dorms every day, but the bathrooms are always disgusting and you just see the cleaning people sitting around outside. Not to mention, the price is ridiculous for what you're getting.  The housing department is impossible and rude to deal with. Housing is definitely one of the worst things about this campus."
College Senior,1,"Its fun your freshman year and then everything is extremely repetitive. There are off-campus bars with decent prices, but Eckerd only provides transportation once a month for First Friday and many students end up driving drunk."
College Senior,1,"You need a car here. Even if you know people with cars, most people are not very generous with them and you have to grovel to get a ride somewhere. Eckerd has two priuses and a pick-up truck students can rent, however these are way too popular so they're never available, tend to get very expensive and sometimes the cars don't unlock and you have to spend hours on the phone with customer service."
College Freshman,1,The career services at school could be more well rounded infromed
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life at Eckerd.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,Athletics are terrible here. The club sports are not given nearly enough funding. Also no one really even goes to the games or is apart of the teams in the first place
College Freshman,1,"There is one club near campus that takes about 20 minutes to walk to or you can drive. It is a gay club which is fun but if you arnt gay you just go to dance and have fun. Other clubs in St.Petersburg are all 21 or up so not really a night scene for younger people. Tampa has a lot more options for 18 and up
"
College Junior,1,"Eckerd dining is subpar at best. There aren't many options, and the only options all suck."
College Junior,1,"Diversity? What's that? Someone once asked me where the diversity was and I told them, it's all on the sports teams."
College Freshman,1,Most of the kids on campus are white liberals. With a lot filling that hippie stereotype. This isn't a bad thing but the school isn't very diverse.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking is very rare. Freshmen have to park in a remote lot far from any dorms. When I was there it was a gravel lot, so your car was always dusty. I admit I received many $15-$25 parking tickets there for not parking in the right spot, they will get you in minutes for parking in the incorrect place! One good thing is I was I able to get out of fines by going to the office and explaining why I was parked in an incorrect location. Eckerd is a great school, but parking is not of of its strong points."
College Sophomore,1,Very Unhelpful – The financial aide office is very unhelpful. You ask them how to get ahead they tell you that you're already ahead. Then you go back and they tell you a million things you should have done. Apparently the Dean of Students is great though!
College Sophomore,1,"Drugs everywhere – There are sooo many kids that do drugs on our campus it's insane, particularly all the kappa kids. Its hard to avoid but I guess if you are away from those kids you can stay away from the drugs.I think the reason for all the drug use is because of the lax security, ive seen kids just drinking, smoking weed and dropping acid right in front of security guards and nothing happens.."
College Sophomore,1,"they take the parking way too seriously, Ive never had a car but I have got 3 tickets, the security rides around looking for people and if your freshman, your kinda f****ed you cant park any where, but far"
College Freshman,1,"Not Very Diverse – no black people, or asians hardly, just a bunch of hippie, pot-smoking, rich white kids. not very charitable to the poor :'( that's why i'm blowing this joint peace outttttt.
Oh, but there are foreign kids which is a plus, but like one on campus even knows about them."
College Freshman,1,"Terrible Freshman Experience – Although you could bring your car on campus as a freshman, As a freshman you had to park in the freshman lot that was located far from my dorm. As a student playing a sport, it was very difficult to run in and change from class to go to the field. I did get a lot of parking tickets over the year."
College Freshman,1,Living on Campus – If you don't have a car then it is pretty boring on campus if you are the type that don't like doing the same thing every weekend. St. Petersburg isn't very exciting. You have to drive to Tampa to usually find something to do.
College Sophomore,1,"Guys and Girls – Ladies, it is slim pickings. Do not come here expecting to find a dating scene because it does not exist. For someone used to dating, it was a huge shock, and it will probably be one of the strangest social scenes you have ever experienced. There are more girls then guys and some are pretty decent, but there is a high gay population. The only way you will ever find anyone is if you fit into the mold of a hippie and find another similar hippie to date you, if he isn't too busy smoking pot."
College Sophomore,1,"Don't Go Off Campus – Eckerd is like a little bubble in the city of St. Petersburg. If you go off campus, you will miss everything and be completely secluded. It is not ideal, and many wish there were more options and that Eckerd was more in the community. The dorms on campus are decent, however, especially the upperclassman dorm Omega."
College Junior,1,Cafe is repetitive and terrible.
College Junior,1,"Not Enough Singles on Campus – Many students want their own quiet space to themselves, especially when leading a busy college lifestyle with heavy course loads. The benefit to having a single on campus is obvious-you still get the social aspect of college life while having your own space to get work done/be alone. Eckerd needs more singles. Even Omega only has a few suites with single rooms, and they're mostly reserved for the select seniors who get lucky during room draw."
College Junior,1,"Crime on Campus – The crime on campus over the last 2.5 years has been through the roof. I have taken more measures to ensure that my things will be safe. This included my car staying home this past semester to avoid being vandalized. My car had previously been vandalized, and no one was ever found responsible for it. However, campus safety never really did much about finding the person/persons responsible for it. This is unacceptable."
College Senior,1,"Not everyone does drugs every day, but it's pretty common. Although you'll find that at almost any college these days."
College Sophomore,1,"You need a car to get around. Otherwise you have to take a cab, which costs a fortune. The bus system is too complicated for student use. Get some public transportation! Other than the First Friday buses, we have none."

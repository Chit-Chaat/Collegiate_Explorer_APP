Junior,5,I took online courses only. I was a little upset when I saw there was no exams but just tons of papers. I guess you can say I am a good testing and was looking forward to carrying my high grade average with exams and quizzes. My courses have not used this method. The max word count is high but that is to be excepted in higher level degrees. The professor communicates effectively. I can say I am happy with my choice to attend this university.
Junior,5,"I have always wanted to go to this school even when I was a little girl. I guess you can say I am bias but this school has been wonderful to me so far. The teachers are show passion for what they teach. Covid-19 put a lot of education on hold but Alaska Pacific University continues to provide education for the Anchorage, AK population without error. I am glad to say I will be completing my degree from this university. If you work for SCF or any IHS hospital you can get a discount in classes. You can also get grant from the school by being a full-time student."
Sophomore,5,"Alaska Pacific University is an amazing school. It has a small amount of students so class sizes are smaller, meaning students get more one on one time with professors. It also has a unique learning style with the active learning program. This university is unique and has an amazing community."
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy the on line collaborative learning available. Fits well working full time and going to school full time.
College Student,5,No one is peer pressured and it is not enlightened.
College Freshman,5,The safety of the students on campus is very well handled and there are very few incidents pertaining to student safety.
College Freshman,5,"The professors are dedicated to their students success and very willing and available to help. They are very enthusiastic about what they are teaching and will go out of their way to make what they are teaching fun and memorable. The classes are usually small so there is more time for one on one time with the student and professor. The course variety is enormous, from the generals, like writing and math to the specifics, like wilderness first aid and critical thinking."
College Freshman,5,This school sets its students up for success by giving them the best quality of training. On completion of their degree their students have the experience and knowledge to go straight into the work force. There are also many opportunities for their students to get internships with future employers while still in school.
College Freshman,5,"There are many different options. For freshman they have the south building where a total of 5 people can live in the same dorm. There is a large common room with a tv and pool table and they are connected to the gym, cafe, and laundry room. The dorms are spacious cleanly and a maid come in to clean once a week. The north building is just like the south building but is for upper class-men only. They then have the Row which is a neighborhood close to campus with little apartments. They are also very nice and only 2 minutes further from the classes than the rest of the dorms. Overall the on campus living is great!"
College Junior,5,"I don't drink or use, or hang out with those who do, so I really have no idea; our cohort goes to dinner, maybe half will have an alcoholic beverage."
College Sophomore,5,My Human Services professors are the BEST!!!!
College Freshman,5,"Parking is free, you just have to ask for a permit and there is no shortage of parking spots. A car isn't necessary, the student ID is also a bus pass and that's how I get around town."
College Senior,5,"I always feel safe on campus, and drugs are not an issue."
College Senior,5,"There is always something exciting or interesting happening on campus, close to campus, or within a reasonable vicinity to campus."
College Senior,5,"I live off campus, but I hear life on campus is affordable, fun, and always something to do."
College Sophomore,5,"Smart, well dressed, and almost everyone is into outdoor adventure in one form or another."
College Senior,5,The cafeteria does not make normal cafeteria food.  They use local product as often as possible.  They actually cook real food.  You can request menu items as well.  We have a few vegans on campus this semester so they have started making vegan options as well.
College Senior,5,"When I go there for supplies and books, everyone is very friendly."
College Sophomore,5,gives tips when scholarships are avalible for students
College Senior,5,Its free and awesome as such.  And they keep it plowed free of snow and ice.  And if you have a late class you can request and escort out to your vehicle
Senior,4,"I have had a great experience with being a student at Alaska Pacific University.  The classes are small, intimate, which gives you the opportunity to get to know your instructor as well as your classmates.  With the smaller class sizes, it gives me more comfort in knowing everyone in the class along with feeling comfortable to ask questions."
Sophomore,4,"I am so happy I chose to attend APU. I was a student at UAA before and didn't like it at all. The classes were too large and the teachers didn't make me feel cared about. UAA was expensive and had way too many fees for things that didn't even affect me like sports fees and arts fees. APU also offers more online classes than UAA and has a different class schedule that allows students to complete their classes faster (Modules, Blocks, and Sessions). I will continue my education through APU for my Bachelor’s degree and hope to earn my Associates in the spring of 2021."
Senior,4,"The availability of degrees is limited, with only a handful of majors available, but the variety of classes in those select programs are very good.  There are certain issues with the buildings, staff, and faculty that the student body aren't happy about as a whole, but you'll find things like that at every school."
College Sophomore,4,They provide internships which is a great way to find employment after graduating
College Sophomore,4,Staff is really nice. Interview was great. Very good experience so far.
College Freshman,4,"Classes are small and interesting. School offers excellent classes and majors in outdoor studies, sciences and psychology. Professors are intelligent and helpful. Academic advisors are helpful and interested in your success."
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus. I have no knowledge or experience with crime on campus.
College Freshman,4,Small and interactive classroom settings with dedicated and caring professors make the learning process interesting and motivated.
College Freshman,4,APU does not have traditional varsity sports teams but has a very successful Ski team and prominent community in various other outdoor sports.
College Student,4,"They offer environmental science, marine biology, psychology and more. The registration process went easy and the professors welcome the students."
College Student,4,The safety and security is great they always aware awareness to the students.
College Student,4,The value of a degree from this school is great they always offering jobs on campus in the area of specific career.
College Student,4,The courses were great and the professors helped out the students as much as they could. The class size was small
College Student,4,"The school is great because it's small and you get to connect to every student, teacher, and counselor around you."
College Freshman,4,"I love the small community and the friendly school counselors and student body. Everyone there is very close knit because of the small class sizes and how it arranged. They organize the classes so that the freshman class, regardless of degree program, are put them in many of the same core classes so that they get to know one another. At the beginning of freshman year they have a 3 week trip down the Yukon River so everyone can get to know each other and build relationships. I would totally go there again I had a blast!"
College Junior,4,"I have attended 3 schools so far. Alaska Pacfic is my favorite one. I have been here for over a month now. Alaska Pacific attracts certain kind of people. It can be a culture shock to some people, especially if they're from the other states. It was definatly a huge move for me; I love it. I love knowing I could outside and see a moose. I love knowing my professors as people. I love knowing all the staff members. I love knowing the food is cook with love. I love knowing almost everyone on campus. If I could do it all over again, I wish I would've gone to this school first."
College Freshman,4,You just have to know where to eat. They have most typical food places.
College Freshman,4,"Pretty lenient with the rules, but the ones that are enforced are pretty strongly enforced."
College Freshman,4,Great social atmosphere and the school is small and friendly.
College Junior,4,I have no idea what it's like to be an undergrad.  The doctoral students are on campus for a very limited time and purpose
College Junior,4,I love doctoral level training; some of the professors were not of this caliber
College Sophomore,4,APU is very diverse cumpus
College Sophomore,4,"Human Services Is Great!!!!!! Because of my learning disability I am qualifies for help however, Where is the service?

I can't get help from over the computer I need face to face and hands on help."
College Sophomore,4,"I can not expressed enough how much I enjoy the adult program in  human service. The  professors are very helpful, positive and wise. As old as I am I will be a finisher of this program and have the opportunity for an new job, turning point growth in my life."
College Sophomore,4,"I trust APU academics program for human services.  As an single mother of two I am a part-time student with a full-time job, and a caregiver for my 90 year old elderly parent. I have hope that my program would offer classes in the summer which would allow me to take more then two classes at a time and not lengthen the time of my education out to 2017."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't drink however, I am sure that all is well. I've heard no bad news"
College Freshman,4,Thry helped me alot with everything
College Senior,4,"My school offers experiential learning opportunities that provides hands on experience for students, growing professionals who enter the workforce with knowlege and the skills necessary to be successful."
College Senior,4,"First off, Alaska is BEAUTIFUL. If you've never been here, it should definitely be on your bucket list. APU is situated in a little forested nook of Anchorage, with trails close at hand for running, skiing, or biking. The mountains are also a few minutes drive away, so if you want to go for a quick hike or ski after class, go for it! The campus is small, and everyone is pretty much on a first-name basis. It's nice, but has its drawbacks sometimes. It has a ""small town"" feel in a large city."
College Freshman,4,"It depends on whether you like snow or not, I'd hope if you move to Alaska you'd like snow. The snow allows for great cross country ski trails all around campus/town. There's also always the opportunity to go sledding because the snow sticks around all winter. The summers are extremely nice. There is so much daylight and temperatures hover around the 60s and 70s."
College Freshman,4,"Everyone is always off on an adventure. The outdoor programs puts on amazing trips that go all over Alaska from ski trips to sea kayaking to ice climbing. There are always activities going on on campus as well: movies, trips around Anchorage, coffee trips, etc."
College Freshman,4,"The academic support center has lots of computers that are always open and its open fairly late. The WIFI connection isn't too bad, its slow at times, but no major complaints about it."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The guys and girls attending APU are very friendly and diverse. Students from all over the country travel to APU for their amazing outdoor science program. APU's students range from fresh out of high school to the working professional who has decided to go back to school. Regardless of age, all are accepted as APU emphasizes diversity and acceptance on their campus."
College Sophomore,4,"A wide variety of available computer and equipment at each student disposal, with free printing and both Mac and Windows options available."
College Freshman,4,"Parking on campus is not an issue at all. Parking on campus is free for APU staff, faculty, and students, which is a relief. There is always available parking on campus, there is never a need to have to park off campus because there was no parking. There is no use for a car on campus as the campus is pretty small and everything is walking distance. A car is needed to go off campus and do grocery shopping or to just explore the city. Though the bus system is pretty convenient because it runs everyday, it is free for students, and it stops in front of the school. The school also provides shuttles every now and then to take students where they need to go as in shopping for personal needs."
College Freshman,4,"My financial aid process experience wasn't too bad, even though I didn't get all the money I needed to pay for my tuition. APU was really good about helping me find scholarships and other funds in order to help me pay for college. If it wasn't for the help and the scholarships I received for my first year I don't think I would be attending this school. I do suggest that the financial aid adviser meet with the students, to make sure that the students are on the right track and make sure that all the documents are submitted properly and on time."
College Senior,4,Skiing is huge here.  There is equipment available for rent cheaply for students.  I love seeing everyone gathering together to go out skiing after a really good snow.  UAA is right next door and they have basketball and hockey games for anyone who likes to watch.
College Senior,4,Parking is free and there seems to be open spots most of the time
College Senior,4,"My school has an excellent outdoor studies program because it is placed in Alaska and offers things like ice climbing and snow camping.  It also has an Eco-League program that its involved with, which is a program connected to 4 other environmental schools around the country that exchange students for a semester. Since it's so cold there most of the campu life activities are indoors, like the RA's will have events to take us to movies or Pizza at Mooses tooth. APU has a great ski program and gym.  The pool at the sports center is salt water, heated, and of course indoors. My school offers a different experience because of being in Alaska."
College Sophomore,4,very hard finding a internship since i live in rural ak
Alum,2,"Stay away--go to a real university! In my first year, fundamental classes were often cancelled by the professor. Course offerings are very limited. In pursuit of a proper education, I took the courses I needed at UAA, and found them to be more rigorous. The (too) well funded FAST lab generates some good scientists, but many of the students in this lab present thesis work that one would more likely find at the end of a 300 level science course term project. Staff and administration (especially IT) is quirky, but generally effective. Campus is nice."
College Sophomore,2,There is limited sports at this university
College Sophomore,2,I am not into sports!  My first sight of the sport center is that they over charge for everything!
College Sophomore,2,"I met with tech support and it was totally unhelpful, nice guy, but..."
College Senior,2,"The campus could use some upgrading.  Most of the buildings are quite old.  They are maintained, so it's not like there are safety issues or anything.  The campus is very small, which can be nice when you have to get across campus for class and you can do so in less than five minutes."
College Senior,2,The computer lab has both mac and pc.  You can make free copies which is very convenient.
College Senior,2,"Buildings at APU vary in age from 20 years old to over 45 years old. The roads at APU are run down and many contain cracks, bumps, broken pavement or an occasional pot hole. Some of the older buildings have rooms that either are too hot or too cold that can't seem to be fixed. Also, there is little continuity of design to the campus; one building architecture is different from the next. A big plus, recently, has been the appearance of a new president of the university who is committed to improving the facilities and grounds of the university to bring it up to standard with similar colleges."
College Senior,2,"Only a couple of computer labs on the campus. Each appears to have only about a dozen computers each. They are equally split between Apple and PC's, which helps to satisfy most people's preferences. WiFi speed varies substantially throughout the  day. Mornings are good but after dinner, speeds slow to a crawl as many students start streaming NetFlix, online videos or other bandwidth intensive applications."
College Senior,2,"Regular cafeteria grade food on campus. Easy access to the dining hall from the student dorms, ample seating and comfortable atmosphere. Nearest off-campus food source is at a large hospital nearby (think; hospital food), another university with several private food businesses (Subway, China Express) then mini-malls with local vendors."
College Senior,2,Weekly schedules events for on-campus students keeps them from getting 'dorm fever' and helps to keep them connected with others on campus. Most of the activities don't revolve around drinking which is a plus by creating a safer environment for the fringe students to join.
College Senior,2,"Most students blend into a common 'look-and-feel' of casual Alaskans; infamous for being one of the worst-dressed places in the United States. Jeans, t-shirts, frumpy coats, occasional collared shirt or clean slacks, but pretty rare. No need to worry about bringing a suit or tie, none are found at APU."
College Freshman,2,"Its Ok – There are great instructors and that's the only thing that kept me here for this first year of college.  Carl Tobin and Roman Dial are excellent instructors, but the department lacks a lot and the work load is way too much considering how little we learn, facilities are ok, could be better. They say that there are job opportunities for every student, but they run out of positions within the first 100 students."
College Junior,2,"Alaska Pacific is a very small college that has students from all over the world. There is a variety of groups and sports and the staff and faculity are, usually, very friendly and helpful. I have not heard of any Greek students in attendance for a few years but there are a few from Italy, the UK, and Sweden. Having students from all over makes the campus really open to new people and their experiences."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Limited Dining on Campus – There is one cafeteria that is open to all students. They have a good variety of food although their healthy options are very limited and never really fresh. They do do a good job of providing fruits and veggies especially since they are expensive and hard to come by here in Alaska. The main issue with on campus dining is that the cafeteria is only open 3 times a day during the week and 2 times a day on the weekends. Also, when they are open they are only open for an hour and a half at a time.
The worst part of the on campus dining is that students who live in specific buildings have to pay a very expensive meal plan with no opportunity for a refund if they don't eat the food (Which is not uncommon). Students who are not forced to pay for the meal plan may still eat at the cafeteria, but the individual meals are expensive and not always very good."
College Sophomore,1,I  am not Greek and I don't have any information  about Greek students.
College Sophomore,1,"When I sighned up at APU I didnt expect the classes to be so hard that most students dont pass them and have to retake them a couple times just to get a passing grade in order to count for a credit. The teachers that teach the class are old and expect you to know everything that they do, I mean they are teaching you whatever subject the are teaching and you have no idea on the subject your not a genius. They do it on purpose becuase it is a prive college and their fundings are low, so they raise tuition prises and make the classes so hard to pass that you dont so you have to pay for the class again in order for it to count as credits when you finally pass it. Instead of a regular 4 month semester APU is only 3 months, the hard classes such as Calculus, Chemistry and writing classes are crammed into such a short amount of time that its another reason why so many students fail a class. I just dont understand APU ways and in my third year I regret signing up for the school because I am not going to graduate until another couple years. Its ridiculous."
College Senior,1,"Diversity at APU varies across many boundaries. Students in classrooms will vary in ages of 18 to 60 at times but will typically be treated equally. There are campus specialty groups such as the Spectrum Club that specializes in promoting activities and dominance on the campus of the gay community which can hinder any open dialog about other lifestyle choices. For those students who may be 'of faith', you will seldom hear or see them as they only play a very small, insignificant role on campus and are rarely mentioned. The racial diversity is mostly reflective of the community at large with mostly Caucasians/white peoples being the majority. Other races are represented and, as a student, none have been treated any different, which generally is typical of Alaska."
College Senior,1,"Would I major in Education at APU again - nope. The program has no exposure to educational technologies (SmartBoards, Web 2.0 apps, PLN's etc.), the teachers provide very little active feedback, there is an undercurrent of oppression against students who don't fit a particular gender, political belief or level of unquestioning attitude. For a personal cost of $50 per hour to pay for sitting in a classroom in the Master's program, you don't receive but a fraction in value."
College Senior,1,"Predictable responses to request for financial aid at APU; fill out FAFSA, apply for government or private loans or contact TMS (Tuition Management Services - an independent company) and pay them to finance your education. No scholarship assistance other than an occasional email of online scholarships someone found while surfing the web in their office at the college."
Recent Alumnus,1,Awful just awful – The girls are low quality in every way and the guys are d-bags.  Don't come to this school for any reason whatsoever.
College Student,1,"Breakfast is OK, but starts 30 mins before morning classes and only last for an hour.  Lunch is good quality but very repetitive and is only available for 2 hours.  Dinner is horrible, only available for an hour, and usually very untasty.  There is no viable other options for food, so the value you get is extremely low."
College Freshman,1,"POOR QUALITY – EVERYTHING IS OLD AND DETERIORATING!!!!! The dorms being the worst.  Mosley is way too small of an athletic center, I can stand up in the ""deep end"" of the pool.  The school shares a library with UAA, so its really nice, but requires a good amount of walking.  The school renovates things that do not need to be renovated and it ignores what needs to be renovated, it sucks!"
College Freshman,1,"Its Alaska – Its in Anchorage Alaska, EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE!!  Subway doesn't have $5 foot longs, instead its $7 foot longs, just to give you and idea.  There is a lot of wildlife, but it become boring after a while.  What gets everybody is the winter.  It snows A LOT and by mid-November, the sun come up at 10:00 am and sets at 1:00 pm, everybody gets seasonal depression and its sucks!  Anchorage has an unusually high rate of crime and gang activity and there are homeless people EVERYWHERE!  The only good time to be here is during summer, when school isn't in session, might I add.  Almost every review you will read about Anchorage is based on the summertime because nobody wants to be here during the winter."

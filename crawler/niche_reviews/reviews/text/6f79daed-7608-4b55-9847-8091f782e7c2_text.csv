Freshman,5,So far it has been awesome very quick to respond and super helpful. The staff is very efficient and very knowledgeable and willing to help!
Freshman,5,"So far Bluffton has been so very helpful, the staff the football coaches have shown a huge interest in my academic career. Everyone has been so positive and willing to help and made sure all questions have been answered!"
Niche User,5,"In the beginning, I was only looking towards Bluffton because of my soccer career. I didn't like the idea of it being a small campus and google basically stated that there was no diversity. As an African student attending the most diverse school in Columbus, Ohio , I didn't like the sound of that. I finally attended a tour of the school to meet my teammates, see the campus, and get to know my coach. I have to say that the tour changed my entire perspective of the school. There is a lot of diversity from what I saw. My teammates were very kind and that was a huge factor to why I committed to the team. The campus is gorgeous. When you are on it, it doesn't feel small. The nature within the campus makes you feel more comfortable in the environment. Most students on campus were friendly towards one another and the entire vibe of the place was so positive."
Junior,5,Don’t get the full party experience but get the education we need. The education is good here but if you want to go to school yo party then you don’t want choose this school but If u want to learn and get a good education then Bluffton University is the place to be!
Freshman,5,Bluffton has small class sizes and extra help and tutoring whenever you might need it.  Bluffton is a private school and it big on safety and education.
Niche User,5,Lovely small town with an engaging university. Best part is the cultural exchange requirement where you have to travel somewhere out of state or overseas to interact with those different from you.
Niche User,5,"Bluffton is an amazing school and I am excited to see how it grows and expands in the future. The introduction of the new science building should really be a big help for those in pre-med or other scientific fields of study. The study abroad programs are also a great opportunity for everyone to experience different cultures or even just what it is like to travel. Bluffton has a beautiful campus with many historical buildings, but is not behind in terms of academics or technology. It also has great programs for students to earn money toward their tuition. They also offer a multitude of clubs and other activities for students to participate in."
Freshman,5,It feels like home at Bluffton! I am part of a big family! The football staff here stays in constant contact and makes me feel like I am already part of the team.  I feel like the Academics and Faculty are in tune with what I am looking for and I know they care!
Alum,5,I loved my Bluffton experience! My time at Bluffton helped me become a more well-rounded individual while turning my passions into a purpose.
Niche User,5,"When I visited Bluffton University I absolutely loved the campus. It was clean, beautiful, and the students and staff were very welcoming. Their admissions advisor Kaitlin Kerr was amazing. She helped me decide on a major that matched my interests and she also told me everything that Bluffton had to offer me. There classrooms were very neat and their classes are small which is what I loved the most. They have tutors available all day if you need them and the professors are always willing to help their students."
Freshman,5,The sense of community is amazing. It is like my home away from home. The academics are also very good. There are lots of opportunities here.
Freshman,5,Bluffton is amazing. They make you feel at home as soon as you step on campus. I knew before evening stepping foot on campus that this was the place for me.
Niche User,5,"Super kind, they treated me like I was family there. Amazing staff, they really care about the students. Very helpful."
Sophomore,5,"Bluffton University is an excellent institution in the services it provides to its students and the atmosphere. It will not let you fail in academics; there are many resources and people that you can reach out to and people who will reach out to you when you are struggling and when you succeed. Additionally, we have a saying at Bluffton, and that is ""It's all about relationships."" This rings true in all aspects of our campus community. Everyone treats everyone like family. From greeting people on the sidewalk to sitting with someone new. We all do our part to make everyone feel like they belong. The only complaint I have about Bluffton is the food. I wish that we had more options. Dining with people in our commons is a big part to building relationships and I think we need more diverse options to help others feel more at home."
College Sophomore,5,This is a very inviting campus. Everyone is very friendly and the professors are very helpful and supportive and take an interest in everyone individually.
College Sophomore,5,"The professors at my school are what make it so amazing. They are incredibly friendly and approachable. I never feel nervous to meet with them to discuss difficult homework and they are very passionate about their work.  Another cool thing about them is that they invite class divisions to their homes for cookouts. The science division always has a cookout every year at the mathematics advisors house. Another cool thing about my school is how small the class sizes are. You really get a chance to get to know everyone around you. You become friends with many people of all ages and majors and it keeps your life interesting to become friends with people who come from different backgrounds. I definitely recommend students to attend Bluffton University because it is a small, quiet city where you can meet so many different people and have new, fun experiences."
College Sophomore,5,"Administrators are very concerned with student health and safety. There are 3 options for counselors on campus, and students can make appointments with these people at any time and at no cost. There is also a nurse on campus that students can go to with any health issues. There are also security officers who patrol the campus at night. Julie DeGraw is very involved with student issues and is an amazing person to talk to about any issue regarding student life on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"Bluffton has a very strong education program, which I am currently involved in. There is a very high rate of employment straight out of college for Bluffton education students. The campus is also very concerned with making sure that the students have jobs after leaving Bluffton University."
College Freshman,5,"We take this issue very seriously. However, we might not talk about it as much as we should. It's problem and it happens on any campus."
College Freshman,5,"I'm a gigantic fan of the coffee house in town. I love their Chai Tea, Frappes, and Hot Apple Cidar"
College Freshman,5,The alumni network here is very important to the school and this makes the networking great. There are a lot of career services provided too.
College Freshman,5,The athletic facilities are in top shape. The new Sommer Center is amazing even with a dance studio. And the addition of a turf field will be great.
College Freshman,5,I feel safe at all times on campus. we only lock our door at night to keep friends from waking us up.
College Freshman,5,"The professors are amazing and the classes are discussion based, which helps students learn and understand topics instead of just memorizing random facts."
College Freshman,5,We are a Division III university so we are not a big name school but as a university we are very passionate about our varsity games and our ultimate Frisbee games are just as important because it can become very intense to watch and everybody plays at least once.
College Sophomore,5,Most of the students who attend Bluffton chose it for it's quality of education and it's Christian environment.

College Freshman,5,The rooms are somewhat small and two person. There are some dorms which has triple rooms for three people. We have same sex dorms and mixed dorms on campus. They are pretty expensive..
College Freshman,5,The professors here at Bluffton are terrific. I think as a student we have a really great curriculum set up. The registration process is smooth and easy and there is always someone there to help if needed. The workload is do-able for sure. The professors often make time for students to have study groups or just individual time if needed. 
College Freshman,5,"I love being a Psychology major here at Bluffton University because I get to work with  great people, and the workload is right in the middle its challenging but it is able to be done!"
College Freshman,5,"I love Bluffton because of its all around quiet nature. The students and faculty members at Bluffton are all so nice. Another thing that sets us off from other colleges is that we are a dry campus, I think that gives up the responsibilities to be a great person and handle ourselves. "
College Freshman,5,Bluffton has tons of things to do the sporting events are always a favorite of the students but other than that Bluffton has tons of green space and we have Mayday which is a really fun activity.
College Freshman,5,Bluffton University is very strict on drug and alcohol on campus because we are a dry campus but other than that Bluffton is a great place to be!!

College Junior,5,"Great weather for the area...summers are nice, while the winters are cool"
College Junior,5,There are a lot of places within walking distance to the campus.
Senior,4,"I love the 4 university values of community, service, respect, and discovery. The school is very focused on student support and opportunites"
Sophomore,4,"Only being a sophomore I don't know it all but I know by now that Bluffton was the right decision for me. If you are looking for a small tight knit school where you can feel like a part of a family, this is the perfect place.  I have never met a subpar professor on this campus. They really work with you to make sure you are understanding the content and getting the most for your money."
Niche User,4,I liked how people were nice to each other and there were some activities to do on campus. When I stayed over night on campus there weren't any issues or problems on campus. Everything was fine when I stayed.
Freshman,4,"Just finished my first semester. Great people, small but feels like family not a number. Takes time to find a routine but once you find it and realize the purpose it is good. Food is decent. Professors are very personable and proud to be at Bluffton."
Sophomore,4,I love how close of a relationship you can form with your professors. Something that I'd like to see changed is to have more things to do around campus to make friends.
Sophomore,4,Bluffton has a lot of great opportunities for your education and overall growth as a young emerging adult. Unfortunately there are some issues with lack of communication all around campus.
Freshman,4,"Bluffton has 4 core values, one of them being community which was my biggest takeaway. The smaller school feel creates a significant community of teachers and students."
Freshman,4,"This school is not too bad, I would recommend this school to other students struggling in bigger University for it's size, people, and resources. The people at Bluffton here are friendly, obliging and which makes the campus great for it's sides. If you need help with anything all you do is ask. Teacher's are available through out the day."
College Sophomore,4,I have heard a lot of good things about the school getting people jobs and internships. My own sister graduated from here and got a job right after school. She never even had to apply to the job because the school had sent them her resume. They contacted her and asked her if she would work for them.
College Sophomore,4,I haven't heard of any sexual assaults happening on campus. The school talks about it a lot and take steps to prevent it from happening.
College Sophomore,4,The dorms are really great and a lot of them are getting new updates and renovations. The only thing that could be better is if all of the dorms had air conditioning. Most of them have it but there are a couple of buildings that don't. It isn't too bad but the first couple of weeks are really hot in the rooms.
College Sophomore,4,Bluffton is a small campus so it's really safe. I would walk around after dark and feel completely safe.
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the class I have taken have been very useful. I would say that all of the professors are passionate in what they teach and are very helpful. I have only had a handful of bad experiences, and they are not nearly as impactful as the good experiences that I have had."
College Sophomore,4,"The sports teams do very well, and I attend the games even though I am not an athlete. It seems like some people are only here to play sports rather than to learn, and that bothers me. I wish more people valued their degree and education more than their sports teams."
College Sophomore,4,"I really love Bluffton. The professors are very helpful, the classes are mostly engaging, and the students are great. I've made a lot of great friends. I do get annoyed with the school when regarding sports teams. We're a liberal arts school, but the focus seems to be sports rather than the arts."
College Sophomore,4,Besides a few instenses I have always felt very safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,I love the small classes and knowing the professors personally.
College Junior,4,"I really like it here. I feel a sense of community and it is really nice to have trustworthy people around.

College Freshman,4,The new gym is the best and it's beyond pretty
College Freshman,4,"The cost is gigantic amount and I will be in debt for a long time. The vast amount of positives that are at Bluffton make up for the cost. The social atmosphere is amazing! Everybody is open and will strike up a conversation with even if he/she doesn't know you very well. The very first step I made on this campus I felt as if I was at home. I wouldn't change my decision, at all."
College Freshman,4,Internship and job opportunities are great. the workload is alright.
College Freshman,4,Study sessions are normally always provided which is a plus.
College Freshman,4,I met the love of my life on this campus not thinking I would fall in love with him!
College Freshman,4,It is a great campus. Community is a great and valued thing here. I just wish sometimes it was a bit bigger and not a dry campus.
College Freshman,4,The small classes are very nice. And being able to be on a personal level with professors is really great. You know they are there for you if you need anything.
College Freshman,4,the health center could be placed at a better location on campus. but the safety at bluffton is great
College Freshman,4,It's great because there are the typical fast food options. But it sucks because they aren't open that late.
College Freshman,4,They do abide to the policies that were created but I never said I agree with those policies.
College Freshman,4,Bluffton does whatever they can I feel to get you to receive the financial aid that can get you to come here.
College Freshman,4,Not much going on. you make your own fun with other people
College Freshman,4,"Ring by Spring. It is everywhere. the people tend to be very different in taste of clothes and such, but they are mostly looking for serious relationships"

College Freshman,4,we have great career services and several job and grad school fairs
College Freshman,4,I love the Chinese place and Luke's has the best potato soup in the universe
College Freshman,4,"we have an honor code, so we take unproctored tests and leave laptops when we go to the bathroom. 

also a dry campus, so no alcohol... or no alcohol that the RA finds out about.

we do restorative justice, so instead of fines or suspension we have to make it better"
College Freshman,4,I have a special scholarship and I was personally helped through the process to make sure all paper work was filled
College Freshman,4,"I love my roommate, RA, and neighbors"
College Freshman,4,I can walk to Bob's at night and be okay to be by myself and its not that big of a deal. We had many meeting in the beginning of the year about sexual assault so I do know that it is a big thing on campus for everyone to be a were of it.
College Freshman,4,We do have a lot of restictions but you barely notice them because they are things that people usually don't complain about or anything. Every one plays by the rules here at Bluffton.
College Freshman,4,Bluffton has a great psychology major program that I feel will have me well prepared to find a good job after I graduate from here. I do enjoy my class because it is mostly lecture notes with writing assignments that we do during class. Also we have Launchpad work that we do outside of class which helps us with the exams that we have.
College Senior,4,"Bluffton is such a small and friendly town.  The local people are very kind especially to college students and show their kindness by having students over in groups for dinner or supporting our campus events.  Also, there are several shops on main street that provide discounts to college students.  Bluffton is a lively town which makes one feel safe even walking late at night because the town has lots of lights and you can always find someone taking a walk late at night with their family or pet.  Even though Bluffton is a small town, it is the perfect place to house a university!"
College Senior,4,"Living in the residence halls is great!  This is where students begin to meet people that end up being their lifelong friends.  Students seem to form a bond on each floor whether that is by doing different activities together throughout the year, or just popping into each other's rooms to say hello.  For the most part, students get to chose what residence hall they want to live in which is nice to get a say in where you want to live and what environment you want to be surrounded in.  The cost is not cheap, but also affordable because room and board is included in the cost.  I would strongly recommend for new students coming to Bluffton to live and experience life in the residence halls."
College Senior,4,"There are several rules and restrictions at Bluffton that students should be aware of and follow.  The nice part apart the restrictions on campus is that it provides a safer environment for the students and community.  The restrictions at times may affect one's social life, especially the certain hall hours, but it is important to have hall hours in order to promote the Christian University that Bluffton is.  Overall, if someone does not agree with the restrictions at Bluffton, then they should chose to go to a different university because Bluffton might not be the best fit for them."
College Sophomore,4,It is fairly easy to get into social work.
College Sophomore,4,Bluffton has the best sense of community. It just feels like a home.
College Sophomore,4,"Alumni services are great. The value of a degree is usually great if it is in teaching, dietetics, or social work."
College Sophomore,4,Bluffton University is located in a tiny rural town and there is rarely any violence or crime to be heard of. I almost always feel safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"The facilities are great, my profs are excellent, the workload is doable."
College Sophomore,4,I'm not in to sports and attend very few sporting events.  Therefore cannot describe sporting events.
College Sophomore,4,I feel it's great.  Most everyone accepts everyone just the way they are.
College Sophomore,4,Very down to earth with a hometown atmosphere.
College Sophomore,4,"As of right now I think it's great.  I have excellent Professors that stick to their curriculums, and the facilities are easily accessible."
College Sophomore,4,The staff have been very helpful. The size of the dorm rooms are quite large which makes it very nice. The cost is a little pricey but comparable to most private universities.
College Sophomore,2,Many employers don't focus on Bluffton because of its size.
College Sophomore,2,The dorms where I stayed were relatively old and were not cleaned as often as they should have been.
College Sophomore,2,Athletics aren't a focus at this school and are usually overshadowed by the arts.
College Freshman,2,"The campus food is the only bad quality about Bluffton. I feel like I am paying a lot for my meal plan when I don't even eat that much to begin with. Based on the fact, I don't want to eat at Marbeck because I feel like I eat the same thing over and over again. It's beyond repetitive. We need more options! We need to make sure the food is cooked all the way."
College Freshman,2,There aren't many places close for students to go get food. And everywhere but Luke's closes by like 11pm.
College Freshman,2,They take forever with things and once they finally make a decision you already had to pay out of pocket or own them a couple thousand dollars.
College Freshman,2,There isn't a lot of variety in what we are offered.
College Freshman,2,"repetitive. we frequently walk in and ask ""anything good to eat"" the answer is always no"
College Sophomore,2,"There is barely any diversity. They harp on it, but it's barely there."
College Sophomore,2,The winter of 2013/14 has been the pits.
College Freshman,2,not in sports so do not get free ride
College Sophomore,2,Nothing to do other then drive an hour to next school
College Junior,2,We are in Ohio so it snows quite a bit and the college never closes. I commute so that can get bad if there is ice on the road. We have plenty of rain in the spring that can not be good walking around campus. it is nice when there  are nice days!
College Junior,2,"There are very few restaurants in the small town we are in. There is a coupe pizza places and a Mexican place in town to walk to, other than that, all fast food is far enough away that you have to drive and many people on campus don't have cars."
College Sophomore,2,I prefer to go to the grocery store and cook myself.
College Junior,2,Bluffton is a very good school but they do not offer much financial aid. It is my junior year and i am struggling to get through. Although they are understanding they do not work with you to get you to stay here its a give them money or leave type of situation even if you fall behind on your payments
College Junior,2,Bluffton is a dry campus even if you are 21 there is no drinking or alcohol or even posters of it allowed. It turns many students away because they can legally drink but still not here. Another turn off is the Curfew because we are grown adults but we cant stay in a male dorm past 2 am or you will get written up.
College Sophomore,2,"Always Bored – Bluffton's campus offers different sports to play along with intermerals for students who don't play sports. When your not playing a sport or at a sports game than you are usually bored. There are a few activities among the campus like band, choir, and multicultural affairs. Other than these activities theres only like a handful. Most people aren't in the activities and if they are its only one. I don't think Bluffton is the college if your looking to be in a bunch of activities."
College Sophomore,2,"street lights, lights on sidewalks, locked dorms with key cards, police walk campus."
College Sophomore,2,It has been okay so far and I am still hoping to get some more scholarship money and I hope I will be able to stay at school and work something out payment wise.
Alum,1,"Bluffton University is one of the worst schools you can possibly think of. No party life, no diversity, no fun. The only thing that people go for is sports and they’re not very good at that. Especially the football, they are hot garbage. Please rethink going to this money hungry school. All they care about is getting their money. By the way you all see the salary they make once you graduate that’s because there’s no opportunities I can make more at McDonald’s than going to Bluffton. Please please please please please DONT EVER GO TO BLUFFTON.This is a sunken place and needs be done away with. They’re not even mennonites they’re moneynites. Their religion is taking all of your money.  Run the other way and make a better decision like ONU.Thank  you for reading."
College Sophomore,1,I hated the community and the lack of diversity and opportunities.
College Freshman,1,Bluffton does not do off-campus housing.
College Freshman,1,We aren't allowed to live off-campus unless we are: 1) married; 2) have children; 3) are from the surrounding area.
College Freshman,1,We don't have a party scene. Everyone goes home for the weekends and during the week everybody sits around doing homework or watching Netflix.
College Sophomore,1,It's non-existant.  Everyone is required to live on campus.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek Life
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,We have the same thing every day pretty much. Usually always chicken products. Other meat choices are rare. The food is very bland and gets old fast
College Freshman,1,"We don't have many options in town. There is a bowling alley and 1 bar/restaurant. Everything, including fast food restaurants, close before midnight even on the weekends! Lame!"
College Sophomore,1,"If you don't drive, then you really don't go anywhere. Most of my friends have cars so I can ride to Walmart which is 30minutes away."
College Junior,1,We do not have any form of public transportation here at Bluffton University other then student car pool if needed.
College Junior,1,Not Very Fun – Barely anything to do on weekends and the people here aren't as nice as they look to be the first time you meet them.
College Junior,1,Not Diverse – The only reason anyone but white people are here is because of the Football team.
College Senior,1,"Everything here is very strict. From after hours to alcohol. There are rules for everything and if you do not follow them and are obvious about it, you will get referred and suffer a punishment including fines or community service"

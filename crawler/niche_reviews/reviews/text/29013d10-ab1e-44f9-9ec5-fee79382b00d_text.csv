Junior,5,Well organized and easy to understand. The teachers I have had online are all very nice and understanding.
Niche User,5,"I did take United States History online. To be honest, I was afraid to be taking exams because the history textbook was long. Luckily, my professor provided us with Chapter Exam Preps for every unit. I made flashcards for every question on the exam prep. I also found the weekly discussions to be intriguing as everyone shared their perspective on each unit."
Senior,5,Even though it was a difficult adjustment for the professors and the students the professors did their best to help us. They made the learning easy for us and I think my learning experience online was great!
Freshman,5,my online classes are great I am taking 3 online classes and they are very easy to follow and are very beneficial if you have a busy life. they give you ample time to complete work and even let you resubmit if needed.
Freshman,5,My experience in college at this campus has been amazing.  Corona  has stopped me from touring the whole campus but so far from the classes I attend and the staff I have met they are amazing. They are very understanding and kind they help me when I am In need or just not catching on. My math teacher has been the best so far he is understanding when it comes to my morning sickness because of pregnancy. He allows me to adjust however needed to ensure I learn comfortably. I would definitely recommend the college to other people and students.
Sophomore,5,I have taken online classes at Florida Southwestern for about a year now an I really enjoy them. The professors are easy to get a hold of and very helpful when it comes to schoolwork.

The advisors, staff, and professors at FSW, were always available to meet and talk about grades or even if you needed help on a section you were learning in the class."
Senior,5,I attend the Charlotte campus and I love it! The atmosphere is great and all of the professors who I have had are willing to work with you and help you reach your goals.
Graduate Student,5,Overall a great experience to a community college. Everyone is really nice and willing to help out with any problem you may have.

FSW is also very diverse and encourages diversity.

Sophomore,5,I didn't plan if taking any classes online at FSW until COVID-19 hit the USA and it was mandatory for everyone to take the last couple of weeks online.  the couple of weeks that i was taking my classes online were okay. Personally i dont like taking classes online because i'm more of a hands on learner and also like to learn face to face. the professor through handled the situation to the best of their ability. I finished my classes with great grades because they made online classes just has informational as it would have been in class.
Junior,5,"Online classes are my favorite. I can do it from
the comfort of my own home and on my time. The teachers are incredibly helpful and reply within a good time frame"
Junior,5,I’ve been at Florida southwestern for two years. It’s the first college I’ve been too. I like the fact that they have blended courses.
Sophomore,5,"I love FSW! Just like most, I was reluctant to stay close to home to finding my first two years and earn my AA. I can honestly say, that going to FSW has been one of the best choices I could have made! It is a smaller school, which means you have a chance to actually connect with peers and professors! The professors and staff genuinely care and want you to succeed. There is also a decent amount of clubs and activities to be involved it if you seek them out. FSW is one of the places where if you don’t look for the good you won’t find it. After attending FSW I am not only leaving with a great education, life long friends, and connections but feel ready to succeed in my next two years at University and beyond. Thank you FSW. Go Bucs!"

Sophomore,5,"It's a good school, with cool professors that can relate to you. There are also cool facilities and things you can do on campus. I would like the campus to be more lively."
Senior,5,With the recent covid-19 outbreak I feel as if this school did an outstanding job regarding their transition to remote learning. I felt as if the teachers were significantly involved and were really there to assist with those struggling with the adjustment to online learning. I've taken classes online and on campus at the same time during a semester and I've always had a great experience with this school!
Senior,5,I really like how well the staff and advisors are engaged with the students that attend this school. I hadn't seen myself pursuing a four year degree here but after attending it for a few years I realized this school was pretty fun and a really engaged school for it being a community college. Every day they have events on campus that keeps everyone engaged. I love going to school here!
Freshman,5,I like the online class options.  The classes aren't too difficult but they are still challenging. The professors are helpful and nice.
Freshman,5,"All of my classes were online prior to Covid, so I did not have to worry about any major changes, but the professors are helpful.  They are always willing to schedule a phone call or find a way to help."
Sophomore,5,"I love the beautiful campus! The dorms are very nice, they may even be better than some universities. The dorms are set up apartment styled. So my roomate and I have complete privacy. Plus a living room and kitchen. The professors for the most part are great. And FSW staff really want to help students. Overall worth it and I love it here."
Freshman,5,"I have had a great first-year experience at FSW I would recommend this school to everyone, they offer so much and I have had nothing but great experiences with the staff here at FSW."

Sophomore,5,"I have had an amazing experience at this school. From the atmosphere, to the professors, to the student support, everything is top notch. Couldn't ask for more."
Sophomore,5,This college exceeds expectations when it comes to community colleges. It has a higher success rate than I've seen at many other community schools. The professors here are helpful and all want to see you succeed. I have enjoyed almost every class as they are more personal and one-on-one due to the smaller classes held at this college.
Sophomore,5,"They have been very supportive and informative during this difficult transition. We have encountered tough times moving to strictly online, but it has been a good transition. The teachers are very knowledgeable and also they offer many courses at a cheaper rate than a University."

They have so many activities going on around campus. They have puppy yoga and meditation going on. The professors are amazing, they teach greatly and help you learn in a way that's easier for you. Due to the midst of the coronavirus, my professors have been trying their best to help us learn without being in a classroom. Besides the professors, they have helpful advisors. I'm glad I chose FSW."

So now i want to be there and experience it first hand from my perspective."
Alum,5,"My experience at Florida South Western was overall wonderful and very beneficial for my future. I got the best education and had the most amazing professors. Every professor that I had the pleasure of taking, went out of their way to make sure that each of their students would succeed. All of the professors are so intelligent and really care about their students well beings. The campus over all is beautiful and green, it has a nice serene feel to it and is not overwhelming. It does not take long to get acclimated to the campus and to learn where your classes are. You will meet great people and even greater professors. I highly recommend attending this school."
Sophomore,5,FSW is a very good college to go to. I would recommend my friends to go and take it. I have no suggestions as to how to improve the college.
Freshman,5,"Awesome School with many classes to choose from. The campus directors are very attentive to the needs of the students and I would highly recommend this school to other students.
It was very easy to complete the registration process and the financial aid staff is top notch!
The entire structure of this school is geared toward assisting students to achieve their goals.

Sophomore,5,"I love all of the resources available to the students and the professors that I have had have been amazing. One big con, like all colleges, is books and supplies are expensive."
Freshman,5,You should at least choose the professors you want if you're going to try. There are many places like dunkin' donuts in the school and nearby and small classrooms for improvement.
Freshman,5,Great school. I love that they have sports. It’s a great community college and it will continue to grow
Niche User,5,Currently on campus where I had the honor of being introduced to some amazing faculty and staff. I was also greeted with the amazing scenery FSW has to offer. Overall  this school has shown me it's true potential as a candidate for creating and developing successful individuals.
Sophomore,5,"I wish the professors actually try and help the students, it is either their way or the highway even when they preach about how everyone needs help."

Freshman,5,"I love Florida Southwestern State College, because they're always there for me if I need help anything. Also there's diversities of students so we can learn about each countries culture while attending to school. It helps you socialize better."
Freshman,4,"Taking classes online was a big change, but the professors made it simple and easy. Worked mainly online as well, so the transition was smooth. Easy communication between staff and professors."
Freshman,4,"Extremely caring and helpful professors. The right amount of individuality and diverseness. School is not too big or small! Location is great, near the beach and sunny! Professors and administration is always available."
Junior,4,A good school with a lot of courses. They have a large range of courses that can be taken online or in person. They have handled covid well and taken the important safety precautions.
Niche User,4,"I really enjoy the Dual Enrollment program at FSW. Every time I go to register for courses, they have an extensive list of offerings from the Lee Campus and FSW online. Since COVID-19 happened, they have more options like 'Blended Classroom and Online,' and 'Live Online.'  I am excited to enroll as an Early Admissions (Full-Time DE) student for Spring 2021. If there is anything else I could suggest, It would be taking online courses for Philosophy, Humanities, and History."
Sophomore,4,"Florida SouthWestern State College is one of the best state colleges in the entire state. They offer many 4-year degree programs, along with being spread across 4 campuses in the area. It is easy to be accepted into this school and earn your associates degree. Upon earning your associates, you can continue your education at Florida SouthWestern or you can transfer easily to another school. The surrounding area is a good area to live in. There are plenty of opportunities to do things outside of school to have a good time. The only knock on the school would be that the student life or culture could be better but besides that everything else is great."
Sophomore,4,I have had a good experience with Florida Southwestern in general. However I am planning on transferring to the University of Florida because I want to experience a bigger college and see what it's like.
Freshman,4,i love this school the professors are amazing the only thing is the bathrooms are not that clean . but over all i love school its big but not too big that you will get loss
Freshman,4,"I have taken a couple of online classes, and I have to say that I like them a lot. I'm able to complete my assignment when I choose (as long as it's within the due date), and the teachers are very helpful with any academic questions you might have. They are also very forgiven when it comes to turning in assignment late, because of internet issues, or even because life got in the way like work. They are very understanding, and if you have a busy schedule I would really recommend taking some online classes."
Niche User,4,"I am a Senior at Golden Gate high school and thanks to the program that has FSW I can do dual enrollment in my school without the necessity of go to the main campus. Through this program I have experience in a college class which will help me in my future class, also, I have the benefits of being an FSW student like the library, discounts, etc.
From another perspective, as I am learning english FSW offers a grat program for students like me that help to delop our abilities with the new lenguage."
Niche User,4,"The course I am currently taking, as a dual enrollment student, is moving quite well. I am pleased with the experience that they have provided."
Sophomore,4,"My online learning experience with Florida SouthWestern State College was very good. I loved all of my professors as they were very flexible, had tons of resources and materials to help students succeed in the class, and were there when questions were needed. I learned so much on all of my online classes and never once experienced a bad professor."
Sophomore,4,"Florida SouthWestern State College is an affordable college with great academics as well as campus life for a student. I have never had a problem with any of the professors that I have taken classes with. The school also provides various different majors, clubs, and activities that students can partake of. The staff is extremely helpful and do their best to put you on the right track to succeed. The campus is somewhat nice and has good scenery, however I have not lived on campus as I was a commuter so I am not aware of party scenes, food, and housing. Overall, I would rate Florida SouthWestern State College 4 stars for the academic excellence and drive for success in students."
Freshman,4,"Fsw has a great set up for those looking to do any online course there. Their dashboard is easy to navigate and very user friendly. As with any online course the are problem with professor communication and lazy group partners from time to time, but other than that I recommended FSW online to anyone you needs a flexible school schedule to accommodate their life."
Freshman,4,"FSW is a great community college with a helpful board of directors to push you to achieve your future education goals. However, Because it is indeed a community college you run into quite a few student in class who don't take education seriously and in return a few impatient professors. Besides that I 100% recommend FSW for any dual enrollment Highchoolers or anyone else who is looking for scholarship opportunities to launch them into their dream school."
Niche User,4,I commuted to class and my classes were easy to find. I wish that there was more study rooms and places to do work on campus besides the library which tended to get very crowded.
Junior,4,"My online learning experience with Florida Southwestern State College was very good! Each class I have ever taken, I passed with flying colors. Most of the professors would publish the modules ahead so the students can go at their own pace, which is something i found very useful and helpful. I would keep taking online courses from FSW. Amazing."
Senior,4,The classes online are very good. They are well planned out and make it simple for the class. I have taken four classes online and this upcoming fall most of my classes are going to be online due to the pandemic. I am looking forward to starting my classes.
Freshman,4,I haven't started yet but their processes online are easy and they are explained well. My student portal has everything I need and it's all fairly easy to find.
Sophomore,4,"Due to COVID 19 my classes, just as everyone else’s switched to the online format which I am definitely not a fan of. I feel like online classes add on a bunch of unnecessary busywork and really takes away from the course itself. I have taken some really amazing classes online, but it is not my preferred method for classes like Stats, where I much rather be in person."
Freshman,4,What I liked about FSW was the overall atmosphere of the campus students and professors. a very welcoming environment at a reasonable cost for tuition and academics would highly recommend.
Sophomore,4,It is a good community college. Most of the teachers are good and is not super expensive. The school is very easy to navigate too.
Niche User,4,They are focused on their student's success and works closely to help them find their path towards an associates and find universities if they want to pursue a bachelor's degree.
Freshman,4,I was a dual enrollment student. My experience here was very different compared to high school. I would like for the school to incorporate students into participating.
Sophomore,4,They are very hands on with students. Academic advisors will contact the students to check in and offer advice. The only down side is some programs have more classes and funding than others.
Freshman,4,"My overall experience at Florida SouthWestern was rather good! Most of the staff is very friendly and helpful; I felt as if the teachers genuinely cared about their career and their impact on students. In addition, I think the campus is quite beautiful and easy to navigate. However, I do think the campus is located far. Overall, my experience has been enjoyable so far!"
Freshman,4,I love my school and would recommend it to anyone. The campus is beautiful and the staff really want their students to succeed. Some professors are better than others but if you take initiative you'll be fine. FSW provides so many different opportunities from a variety of clubs to studying abroad. If you want to meet people who will push you to do better FSW is the place for you.
Junior,4,"I took 3 years at FSW.  My overall experience was decent, considering I spent my time there as a Dual Enrollment student. Most of the professor are very nice and understanding. Just make sure you do all of the work given by each professor and read everything!"
Niche User,4,FSW is a great community college to attend. The online professors are very helpful and they are really dedicated to teaching you the material you need to excel in the course.
Sophomore,4,"The overall experience at FSW is outstanding. All classes prepare you quite well for your future endeavors, and most teachers provide a classroom as a home for each student. The big plus side to attending FSW is the small class size. Each class averages between 20-35 people, so you can ask questions and possibly get some individual work with the professor."
Senior,4,"Nice, clean, and friendly staff.  Collier Campus is small so it doesn't have as many amenities but the nursing building is amazing."
Sophomore,4,It was always a benefit for me to live close to the school. I never miss a class because of it. I do wish the school would expend more academically as well as just the way the school looks from the outside. The professor are very nice and professional. I never hear of anything bad happening at this school so that is a plus. Overall it’s a great school to start college.
Alum,4,I love how the school is growing and changing annually to fit the nneds of each student and staff member. Keep up the good work
Freshman,4,"Florida SouthWestern State College (FSW) is a very helpful and organized school. The professors are very nice and they really do care about their students succeeding academically. All professors make sure that every students knows about all the available resources available in the school. The amount of workshops and student engagement things that go on every week is a lot and you have many options to pick from. Something that I find very good about this school is that they are pretty affordable for people wanting to go to college. I would say I highly recommend this school to anyone out their trying to get their general courses out of the way. The only thing I would say is that they don't offer way too many programs for a Bachelors degree but they do have a variety of things for an associates degree. Overall, I would say this is a great school to invest your time in and you are also given the option to do everything online if you do not have time to physically go to the school."
Freshman,4,"i like the environment of the school and its located closed to my home, the students look  very happy and the professors are really nice."
Sophomore,4,It was good. The teachers are very nice and know how to engage with students. This is now my second year and the campus faculty are very helpful and engaging. I definitely would recommend this school to anyone.

Freshman,4,"When applying to FSW, I was able to use all the resources available to me. Every professional was very helpful and answered all questions I had."

Freshman,4,"I love attending the Lee campus, this wonderful local college provides an amazing student experience. The buildings are very well-kept and clean, the surrounding area is very peaceful and welcoming. They have amazing plant life around the campus that provides a comfortable and calming scenery with many great resting or study areas. The professors are great too, some come from the local university to teach and I have yet to have a single poor experience in the year and a half that I have been attending."
Niche User,4,Everyone was very helpful the whole time I was there and even though it is a small campus there is a sense of commuinty there.
Freshman,4,I loved how the professor always made sure you had everything down when you asked for help. Everyone is so helpful and will try to find an answer for you as soon as possible.
Freshman,4,Great  customer service and great at welcoming students making you feel like this is where you belong
Freshman,4,FSW is a great place to go after high school especially when you cannot figure out what you will do next. It is also great because you can do prerequisites for a major you have in mind.
Junior,4,"I liked the campus, but the teachers are not always the best. I enjoy the activities and events they have over the year on campus. I also like how clean the campus is, and how there are different lakes to sit by and relax or study by before taking a test. I like how they offer a wide range of class hours, but I feel like they could still work on their class scheduling better."
Freshman,4,"The staff is very friendly and helpful. The campus offer a lot of assistances with tutoring, financial aid and guidance involving enrolling."
Sophomore,4,"The most contributing factor that helped me throughout college was the financial aid counselor. She guided me step by step. She laid out the options I could choose in order to keep studying for my degree. She was wonderful and understanding. Overall the school is a nice learning environment. The teachers could step up their game on better teaching methods. The campus I attend is small so they should provide more activities for the students to make them feel included. However, it does feel safe attending school with an armed guard on campus with the many shootings that have taken place you can’t ever be to careful!"
Freshman,4,"My experience at Florida Southwestern State College is mazing, I would recommend getting involved for a good experience. I am in the nursing program and it is a really great opportunity. I hope to move on and receive my bachelor's degree, which will only be an additional year to my time at Florida Southwestern State College."
Niche User,4,"Florida southwestern state college is focused on learning, how it should be. Office hours are very helpful to the students they do not judge and are there to help. It is a very diverse scene and located in a mid-small town so one is sure to see a familiar face."
Niche User,4,Decent experience. Teacher's are nice but don't know subject as well as they should. Pretty campus as well.
Freshman,4,"The reason that I love FSW are their main goal is to help others to succeed in their campus. They started a class that you have to take for your first semester called Counterstone. This class really helped me to around the campus. For example, I got to know better the campus activities and where to get help in need."
Senior,4,"fsw is a good college overall wonderful. Great College to get your ""basic or staple"" courses out of the way. Cheaper to get these courses done here, then take your degree classes elsewhere. All in all, awesome place to start college life!!!!"
Sophomore,4,"Easy to make friends in the classes and the professors care/want you to succeed. Great dual enrollment program. Lots to do around the local area, and the party scene is ok. High amount of diversity."
Sophomore,4,"I've taken many classes at FSW so far and my professors and courses have been very good. The assignments are never too hard and never stray from the subject at hand. I would love if FSW added tennis. Their sports programs are quite limited and there's not too many to choose from. The academics, campus and clubs are fantastic. The only thing that has truly disappointed me is the financial aid office. I cannot explain just how many times I've been given false information that has lead to costing me a lot of money in tuition when it could have been paid for my financial aid. The employees who work in the financial aid office are very uneducated when it comes to the IRS's regulations on taxes. It's a shame that the financial aid office is so bad when the rest of the school has amazing potential. The college's prices for tuition are lower than the competitive schools like FGCU but it's still can be hard to pay if you don't have the help of financial aid that you are eligible for."
Niche User,4,"I am involved in dual enrollment, but still go on campus. It is your very simple and basic community college, nothing too special but a degree is a degree! I find the professors to be great, and I feel like I truly learn a lot. The college campus is outdoors and very pretty and the Florida weather never gets too cold, pretty humid sometimes though. I have never seen the student housing, had a return on investment, or seen the food. I do know that theres nice chains on campus, and the location is in a great area in Fort Myers with a lot to do in the area."
Junior,4,FSW is amazing and the people are ready to help you succeed. The staff will help you find your way through campus and your academics.
Sophomore,4,"I love this college I met some of my best friends there and now the person that is my husband. This college changed my life for the better the first year I was enrolled. After my first year I decided not to continue but a email from the dean changed my mind about going back to school, I want to better myself and see the change I can make int he world."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the small campus, independent studies, and helping about with college events. The professors are good if you do the proper research. You create your own schedule so you can either be a part time or full time student but that might be with every school."
Sophomore,4,"FSW makes it easy to proceed with a higher education, and get a degree. The process is easy and followed with advisors, from enrollment to picking classes and evaluating the progress. There are lots os tools in campus and online for the students in need. I am close to get my AA and also working on my AS in Nursing."
Sophomore,4,"My experience with Florida South Western state college so far has been really good. It’s a good college to start off with, the vibe it gives offf is calm and helpful. I was blessed with two free years and I honestly love it. I do admit I am not takin much advantage and I feel like I should try harder. But overall it’s a great school and would definitely recommend it!"
Freshman,4,My experience at FSW was pretty good! I was a little nervous when starting because I didn’t know what to fully expect. I met many new people and saw friends I had known years back which was amazing. I connected with many different people in such a short time because we all understood the “aspects” of college life. The teachers I had were great! They were caring and made learning the subject fun. It made me excited to come to class everyday. Overall my semester at FSW was everything better and more
Sophomore,2,I only had two classes online and neither of the teachers even taught. I know for some classes the online teacher's aren't bad but the ones I got were not good.
Alum,2,The first year of college they are somewhat helpful after that no faculty members want to help. They expect you to know what your doing based on class sign-ups. Everyone has a long face of not wanting to be there and it's not a good look at a college. 50/50 on professors.
Freshman,2,Confusing and not enough communication from staff to students or potential students which makes it intimating. No one is around to ask questions if needed. I wasn't fond of the staff...not much guidance.
College Senior,2,I dont know who dropped the ball on my application but I applied in fall 2015 and I'm still not registered for classes. I lost an opportunity to have financial aid full cover my tuition because of my low income or lack of in 2014. Unfortunately this year I would have to take loans to cover my tuition. I also lost a chance on child care scholarship because my daughter was 5 years old; I can no longer apply and receive this grant as my daughter is now 6. My transcript was in the school system but not cleared and still could not get in for spring 2016. l lost a year waiting and back and forth with email only to find out I need an AA degree before I can do the BA degree. Ms. Helen tried her best to get me where I need to be and  I'm crossing my fingers that all goes well and I can finally register for classes by Aug 25th.
College Junior,2,Online classes simply are not for me
College Senior,2,career wise there is much help to be found here other than the academic support center
College Sophomore,2,"The worst part is that I will really need to take a class, but the only classes available are night classes. I really wish that we had more times and days for class options. The Collier campus is really lacking"
College Sophomore,2,I would like if they didnt continuosly change the prerequisites for the nursing program and had more available slots.
College Sophomore,2,I am attempting to get into the nursing program for the second time. There are more applicants than available slots. So I am looking into other colleges now.
College Freshman,2,They do not have the major I would like.
College Junior,2,Since the school has change there name I think the price has change extremal  for a person like me because I pay for my tuition not in a good way either.
College Senior,2,It takes forever to do anything. I do not use financial aid.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The student body at my campus is really boring, and is mostly composed of fresh out-of-high school students, and continuing education students."
College Sophomore,2,They don't anything but a library really.
College Sophomore,2,It is very costly. I applied for two class which came out to be around $800.00 I honestly don't have that type of money but to pay bills only. That does not even include books.
College Junior,2,it's not as good as other schools I've been to.
College Junior,2,Hard to make a schedule that flows
College Freshman,2,"For me personally, I do better in a classroom setting because if I have any questions about whatever I am learning I would like my professor to be around me and explain to me what is going on or what I am doing wrong."
College Sophomore,2,I have been having problems with my financial aid. My finances have been an on going problem until now.
College Freshman,2,It is a pretty decent amount of work for me because I am only part time and work full-time.  
College Freshman,2,"I'm not on a specific path, just working on my general studies currently.  "
Recent Alumnus,2,"My school has been nothing special, it was just a state college to finish my general ed classes at and nothing more. I will not be continuing my education here. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"I am currently in the last semester for my AA, and the classes that I have had are nothing special. I have been challenged in very few of them, and some seemed unnecessary. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"I have taken many different online classes due to unavailability in a classroom. I have found that the workload tends to be doubled in an online class. My assignments tower over my classroom classes, and are much harder to complete. I often struggle to get all of my assignments completed due to the amount of work that is piled on me, as well as the other work from accompanying classes.  "
Recent Alumnus,2,"As far as athletic centers are concerned, my college does not offer any. I feel that a major part as to why our college lacks, is because it does not have any sports teams available for its students. We are the only state college that I know of locally, that does not have any type of sports team or club. "
College Senior,2,"The career center is good, I have worked with them a couple of times in the past and they are very helpful and knowledgeable! We have an alumni association at Edison but I am not sure what they do."
College Junior,2,"While I am currently employed full-time with a quality job I am obviously still open to better opportunities. I have attended some of the job fairs, and career service events hosted by my college, and they are fairly laughable. Sometimes disorganized, and many times lacking in actual participants, they were mostly a waste of time. For example, 5 of the approximately 20 individuals participating in one of the smaller job fairs were gas stations attempting to hire cashiers. The rest were a scattering of employers with jobs that would be on par with the gas station cashier job. This school is not a school for job placement, and is used either to receive your first two years of schooling, or to receive a degree as a full-time worker that has minimal aspirations or ability to go to a larger college."
College Sophomore,2,"Price wise you cannot beat them. They have very reasonable tuition. I do not think they help students navigate through the financial aid process very well though. If you are getting financial aid from the government they are great.If you are finding scholarships and privates loans, your on your own."
College Sophomore,2,"Online classes are very different than being in the classroom. Online classes are seemingly harder because you have to teach yourself in a way. When you don't understand a question, it is harder to seek your teacher for understanding because it is all online instead of face to face. I prefer being in an in class setting because I will meet the deadline, with online classes, I started thinking that I had plenty of time for my assignments and I would slack."
College Senior,2,"Taking an online class was something I was not very comfortable with. The lessons were very vague, and the motivation to do my work was not there. Teachers did not put much of an effort towards the work nor the students. I would not take an online class again, there is too much room for procrastination."
College Sophomore,2,It can be a real pain in the butt for all the papers to be transferred. I've been in school for 4 months and still haven't received my financial aid. There seems to be a miscommunication between the documents sent and received.
Recent Alumnus,2,"This is a wash. Edison State is a commuter college and as such people come to school to go to class and then go to work. The people don't stay because they want to hang out, school, work, that's it. Some of the people do like to socialize, but the commuter college attitude absorbs you. The students that I've met are extremely tolerant and have a lot of interesting ideas about all sorts of topics."
College Senior,2,Every time I call to get more information the financial aid staff does not know or has to find out which makes me lose trust in them. I have heard stories from other classmates stating they have lost their paperwork for financial aid and that scares me.
College Junior,2,The server crashes too often when too many people are on at once. My school email often gets errors and I can't access certain parts of my portal. You have to pay for printing and it's difficult to figure out on your own. Also sometimes the printers are even out of order. Computer labs are often full or students cannot access them. You can't save anything to the computer either.
College Freshman,2,Horrible. Im not learning anything new. Waste of my money. Registration is horrible the process is too long. teachers dont even give out homework.
College Freshman,2,"Well, I had to spend a lot of hours waiting in lines."
College Junior,2,"My college is an average school. I am currently doing the early admissions program there and just trying to get my general AA there to eventually go to a university. I never planned to permenantly stay in Edison because I never considered it sufficient enough. I am not going to sugar coat my situaton or anything, I have been working hard in school my entire life. I just need scholarships to get to UCF or FGCU."
College Junior,2,The network can be very buggy and there have been multiple occasions where the Internet was down completely. So many people bring personal computers that the Student Wifi gets bogged down which doesn't help either. They recently made changes to the printing system which are good but the network in general needs some attention.
College Freshman,2,"There are only a couple places you can have access to a computer, and in order to print anything you have to pay and have an ID card on you."
College Freshman,2,"although Edison is a small school, they do offer help with a lot of different things that students may be having a hard time with such as grades and transferring. There are no sports at Edison or any activities that a normal university would have. There is not much spirit, i don't even know what the school mascot is, or if we even have school colors."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is not enough staff and the staff simply doesn't have the capability to handle all the financial aid needs of the student body.  It takes several visits, and no one ever answers the phone.  You need to know how to apply for scholarships on your own and read everything very carefully to get the aid you need."
College Freshman,2,When I first got on online classes I did not unders
College Freshman,2,the computer labs at edison are always available but the speed isn't very fast and sometime the system does go down.
College Freshman,2,my school has great programs but overall not all students are eligible for them. I feel If I am paying my way through school why shouldn't I be able to get equal opportunity as a studsent who is on a scholarship.
College Junior,2,"Terrible unless you live near the Fort Myers Campus. Edison advertises all these degrees with convenient locations, but its a lie. Everything is in Fort Myers only. And whatever isn't, they have a partnership with FGCU."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The tuition is affordable, but there should be better classes that are for my major and for other majors."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I don't find that there is any help in students finding jobs here, post-graduation. Once a year there is a job-fair, but they don't help with job placement or anything relating."
College Sophomore,2,Nursing Program Struggle! The nursing program is a pain to get accepted to if you did not know what to expect from the beginning.
College Sophomore,2,Challenging to Enter the Nursing Program – The program that is most popular is also the hardest to get into because there is not enough staff to teach it and not enough places for internships therefore the is a limited number of people accepted every year which leaves everyone else in the dirt and sitting around for another year.
College Senior,2,I really haven't been able to find the right classes that would be accepted in a transfer to complete my business major. Almost none of these classes are available online which is an issue since I am unable to attend class in person since my work schedule is not consistant.
College Junior,2,"Worst School Ever – Possibly the worst school ever!  how many times do i need to write that the school is a waste of time and money and i wish i would have chosen a better outlet for spending my money for an ""education."""
College Junior,2,Worst School Ever – Possibly the biggest waste of my time so far was attending this school.  All i want now is a degree and find somewhere to get scholarships and grants so i can afford to go to a real school
College Junior,2,Worst School Ever – Edison state college is only good for people that want to waste money.  Currently i have been signed up for classes I did not need for my previous major and now i am required to fill appeals to further my education because they want me to somehow pay out of pocket?  If i had enough money or a family that was rich I would transfer without a care in the world... but for now I'm stuck wasting my time and money.
College Senior,2,"High School Students – What facilities we have aren't bad, but we lost some things since the high school students came.   The two main things were; the gym and the daycare center.   My personal opinion is the campus was better without the children.  I have found I am nervous to go anywhere on campus, because of them.  I have 5 children of my own, and I liked using the campus to get away from children and have fun with adults.  When I am working on a research paper in the library, I find the children to be a distraction.  Children should not be with adults at a college."
College Senior,2,Online Classes Are Available – They do have the majority of classes available at night or online so I didn't really experience too many scheduling problems.
College Sophomore,2,"They Will Throw You Threw Loops – Form after form, and three months later i get my finacial aid. very unhappy with Edison."
College Sophomore,2,"There are a good number of students that really care about getting good grades and showing up to class on time everyday. But there is also a number of students that could care less, show up late, joke around and try to cheat. It depends on the professor and what they are okay with the students doing."
College Sophomore,2,"Professor Was Not Even in Class – The professor was never in class.  When he was there he talk about absurd things not even dealing with class.  I was going to withdrawl and he told me no I was doing great.  Then handed in my final papers, which it was supposed to be the best 3 out of 4 and he only graded one."
College Senior,2,We Lack a Decent Career Center – Having such general and limited graduate programs offered at Edison it is extremely difficult to find a job after receiving a degree. I find the lack of programs available on the Charlotte campus compared to the Fort Myers Campus to be another challenge which causes most students to transfer to different schools because if you have to transfer to a different school why settle for less when there is more out there.
College Sophomore,2,"Well, They're There. While my school has a somewhat appropriate amount of computers in the library and available for classrooms at request, they are not always reliable. Often times, they do not have the latest versions of flash players & such, the network goes down on occasion, and the portable classroom laptops are usually more of a nuisance than helpful tools."
Freshman,1,School doesn't care about their students and just wants their money. Its becoming too expensive to go because they don't want to give the students who need more financial aid the funds they deserve. They don't want to help.
Freshman,1,"I really don't know how this school got rated a B- for the party scene, but this is the absolute worse school to go to if you're an outgoing person or like to have fun or invite people to the dorms. You have to let the housing department know 24 hours in advance if you are going to have someone spend the night and it can only be for three night. There is security 24/7, which is not a bad thing but they will not allow guest upstairs past 11pm and they will have RAs banging on your door to personally remove your guest. There is no partying in this school and every person I know living here doesn't stay for long. Please don't dorm here. I moved all the way from New Jersey because the campus looked so beautiful and the ratings we're amazing now I'm looking for ANY other school to go to because this is the strictest college I've ever seen before."
College Freshman,1,They are really unorganized sometimes. I didn't start yet because I was missing something they didn't tell me to have.
College Sophomore,1,"They don't have my major, so I have to transfer."
College Sophomore,1,"the financial aid department is a joke, honestly i have to have them sign every single paper i get just to make sure to hold them accountable for misinformation."
College Sophomore,1,Edison is typically just for Associates Degrees.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Campus life at my school is very boring. There is rarely anything exciting that students can be apart of, because there is no housing offered on campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,"At my school your ability to choose a professor is extremely limited. Most of the classes are only offered by one professor, and those professors only have certain times which makes it hard to schedule around. "
Recent Alumnus,1,"At my school, there is no career center really. There is also very little help given to students to move on in their education."
Recent Alumnus,1,"In the spring of 2013, our school aloud students to print directly form the printers in the computer labs. All that you needed to do was bring paper to print on, and now unfortunately, our school does not allow free printing. A student must go through setting up an account with a credit or debit card number, so that you can pay automatically if you print out of a machine in the computer lab. "
College Senior,1,I give this section only 2 stars because the WiFi on campus is not all that good. There are plenty of places to use computers so you do not necessarily need a personal computer however if you use it to take notes in class I would advise you to bring one. They have wireless printers across the school however I feel they over charge you to print things.
College Junior,1,"I'm a law major, Sadly most of the classes that they require me to take have  nothing to do with my major."
College Freshman,1,Its horrible. It feels like in in high school because i am basically learning everything all over again. Classes are so easy to me and not challenging at all. I'm paying out of pocket and i feel like i am wasting my money.
College Freshman,1,Everyone smokes on a non-smoking campus which sucks.
College Freshman,1,"There is no ""campus life"". no sports, or anything that involves school spirit."
College Freshman,1,Edison does not help you find a job after you recieve a degree from it's campus. it doesn't even guarantee that your AA will be accepted by other colleges/univerities.
College Freshman,1,I had trouble the first time I was applying for classes and nobody could successfully help me and everyone answered my questions differently.
College Junior,1,"I recently switched to zoology, my school does not offer courses for it.  Otherwise, I would love to stay at my college.  The faculty and administration are all very considerate. The campus is quiet and quaint, very serene. It is also in a convenient location for me."
Recent Alumnus,1,This campus only has a student center and a library.
College Junior,1,"I always file my paperwork as soon as I finish my taxes. I stay on top of financial aid because for me, its essential in order for me to attend college. Period. I cannot take classes without it. This semester I was told I would get an offer letter well before classes started. Now we are 3 weeks into the semester and I have not recieved anything except for my aid advisor's word that ""its coming"". I qualify for aid and have a 4.0. But I had to pay for my books out of pocket and all my other expenses for school such as gas and daycare, while my work hours are drastically reduced during fall semester. Everyone at Edison is assigned their own aid advisor, but mine was helpful at first but once things got complicated she hasnt returned a single email. The advisor on campus is hit or miss with regards to her presence in the office for walk-ins (only accepts walk-ins and doesnt answer the phone). I've emailed and called many people many times, with no response. I'm still in limbo with financial aid and hope I get my money soon, or I will have to consider dropping or calling a family member for a loan."

Freshman,5,"While I have only been at Utah Valley University for a semester now, I can honestly say that this has been one of the best experiences of my life. The online compensation courses provided for Covid have been challenging and rewarding. The professors are fantastic and the conselours truly try to help and plan your future. This is easily the best University in Utah, the giant amount of perks aside (free gym passes, the student wellness center, therapy and groups of like minded people, and a thousand etcs)."

Junior,5,"I love that Utah Valley University lives by their motto of all being welcome. They try hard to be inclusive and showcase diversity. They have lots of organizations for LGTBQ+, women and BLM. It's really cool to see how much a university cares that everyone feels welcome and committed to learning more about each other. Some people look down at Utah Valley University for having open enrollment but I feel like this is another way they excel at showing that everyone matters."
Junior,5,"Taking classes online was honestly really hard, no one was ready for covid and that's not anyone to blame. Professors did the best they could and most were very understanding."
Niche User,5,"With all the classes going online, I feel like UVU has done really well making it go online. All the classes are easy to join and follow along with. I feel like I'm learning as much as I would in an in school class."
Niche User,5,I've been taking concurrent enrollment classes from Utah Valley University since I was a freshman in High School and I've learned so much. They have a great school and such a great system to allow high school students to attend these classes. I've been able to get a lot of my college generals completed and I'd highly suggest this.
Freshman,5,I took two online classes and so far they've been going well. I personally dislike math but with online classes its been way easier to learn it and I can actually understand it.
Freshman,5,"It has so many resources for students, it's very welcoming and feels safe. The campus is huge and i hope i can attend next year."
Sophomore,5,"I think that Utah Valley University has transitioned into online learning better than most schools because it is a school that already offered many online courses and is prepared to educate its students whether it be in person or online. Most of my professors have been very accomodating to the needs of the students and the professors understand that online learning is meant to be different from in-person classes, and that is okay."
Sophomore,5,"I LOVE UTAH VALLEY UNIVERSITY. When first started college, I chose to attend UVU mostly because I didn't want to attend my other options, but now I can't imagine myself going to school anywhere else! I feel as though UVU is the perfect fit for me. I love the diversity among the students and the opportunity to learn from other students who have very different opinions and backgrounds than I do. I also love how UVU is entirely focused on bettering the students and preparing us to have a successful future. Everyone is welcome at UVU because everyone deserves to be successful and happy. I could not be happier with my school!"
Freshman,5,They have a high acceptance rate! that would usually mean that the curriculum is lower tier compared to another university. However the classes are well matched compared to other schools.
Freshman,5,This school is great! The online classes are really well done and not confusing. The people care about you and want you to succeed!
Freshman,5,The online experience was great! They made it very easy to learn. They had zoom meetings and online recordings for any help. Overall it was very easy to make time for.
Sophomore,5,Online classes are excellent at UVU. The transition during the COVID 19 pandemic was flawless. All of my professors adapted in order to still give me the help I needed to succeed.
Sophomore,5,I love UVU. The administration is always there for you. The professors are well qualified and great teachers. The University offers everything needed to exceed and then some.
Senior,5,"For the most part, online has been great. Most professors have set up their class to work well in an online environment. I like it when professors film videos of them talking about the subject. Sometimes you can only learn so much from reading. Hering someone talk about it really helps me."
Senior,5,"I have had an awesome experience so far. The school is growing so much, I would like to see more parking available."
Senior,5,"If you are able to discipline yourself to going online everyday and making sure you don't fall behind on assignments, you will be fine. However, if you struggle to check the simplest things online, for your class, or procrastinate, you better learn quick on how to get over that. There are online guides to help you navigate through your online courses. Get through those and you will be fine."
Senior,5,I really enjoy UVU. There is a lot to explore with UVU and they are expanding to accommodate their students more.
Alum,5,I took a few online and hybrid courses. They were well organized and encouraged the student to talk with the other students online.
Alum,5,"I transferred to Utah Valley University, and it was one of the best decisions of my life. I loved the culture. The professors were great!"
Junior,5,I really hate online classes but it definitely helps that the professors are prepared and give proper instructions. Online school is hard but the professors I've taken online classes help make them passable.
Junior,5,"I'm very happy at this school. I am a transfer student who came from a school I was very depressed at and struggled with a lot. UVU's environment is very welcoming, diverse, and you can tell students want to be there. There are so many things to get involved with and there's something for every student. You'd have to try really hard to not feel like you have a place here. The classes are engaging, fun, and the instructors care about their students. It's definitely the superior school in Utah county, no matter what anyone says. :)"
Sophomore,5,"Utah Valley is amazing! There are around 40,000 students going there (the most in Utah), but the student to teacher ratio is one of the lowest. The campus is beautiful and very clean. There are many apartments close by at an affordable price. The study labs are so helpful and they are also free! They have so many programs to choose from and they all are top of the class. Utah Valley is very involved with their students and there are so many fun things to participate in, as well as fun things to do on campus. It seems like there are always t-shirts or free food being handed out somewhere. I believe that UVU can help you graduate and have an amazing college experience."
Junior,5,It has such a good feeling on campus. All of the professors I've had so far are very helpful and kind. I feel like I truly belong there.
Niche User,5,"I had a great experience at UVU. The things I really enjoyed there were; the option to walk inside to every class if you choose, the small classes, the fun teachers, the on-campus work opportunities, the variety of classes and programs to choose from, the guidance counselors, the institute program right on campus, and the beauty of the campus. 
     The buildings of the campus are all connected with indoor halls that allow you to stay inside walking from class to class which makes it really nice when the weather is bad. The class sizes are around 10 to 20 people which makes it easier to concentrate and learn the material in a helpful environment. All of the teachers I had at UVU were really helpful and passionate about their topic, which made it more fun and engaging.  
     There are some good on-campus job options that are very helpful for a student. I had the opportunity to work at the PE locker desk where I could provide for myself and get some of my homework done."
Sophomore,5,I have taken classes online before and my teachers were very helpful.  They would answer questions quickly and I was felt like the lessons were very well prepared. Online is often were I was able to learn the most.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy Utah Valley University! The area is wonderful and it's a close nit school.  I feel that the teachers there are very helpful and make going to school fun!  As I have worked with staff and needed help over the years I have always been very pleased with how helpful and quick they were to helping me.  I like that all of the school is inside and  you can walk to all of it, makes it nice for the cold winters of Utah.  There are many activities and ways to stay involved if that's what you like to do."
Sophomore,5,"I really loved the small class sizes. I only took one class with over 100 people, but even in this class, my teacher knew my name and knew who I was. It was a very open and welcoming environment and the people we nice. I loved that I could get to every build indoors too. That is cool!"
Sophomore,5,I love UVU. Small classroom sizes makes learning a 1 on 1 experience with your teacher. I've always found help when I needed it as there are resources for everything. It is also LGBTQ+ friendly and is a safe place in general.
Sophomore,5,"I have not yet taken an online class at UVU, but I have only heard good things about it. I have, however, used their online resources and they have answers to any question on their website. Their website is always updated, and the student portal is very easy to use."
Niche User,5,Pretty good. My professor kept students in the loop. The curriculum was still very well planned out and engaging.
Junior,5,"My experience here has been nothing but amazing. The students I learn with are great people and fantastic friends. In my two years at this school so far, I have not had one bad professor. All have been very intelligent, kind, understanding, and amazing teachers. They truly care about your success and learning environment. Also the whole campus is connected, so during colder seasons you don't have to go outside to get from class to class if you don't want to! Safety is important, student life is LIT, AND we have a chik-fil-a and Panda... so you could say its pretty amazing here!"
Junior,5,"UVU has been such an amazing school! I have never had a professor that I didn't love and I have enjoyed having smaller class sizes where I am more able to meet new people. The campus is beautiful and everyone is so welcoming. 
With the cases of Covid-19 and the campus closing, UVU made sure to stay in touch with their students and made the transition to online as smooth as possible. I always feel well taken care of at UVU."
Junior,5,I love UVU! They take education a step further from book learning to hands-on experiential learning. All the professors that I have had take a personal interest in my education.
Freshman,5,Becoming an incoming freshman can be nerve-racking at times especially coming from out of state but UVU has made this upcoming experience so smooth and welcoming.
Freshman,5,"The online experience of UVU has been great, access to everything and the access to facility and professors is effecient."
Freshman,5,"UVU has done a great job at becoming more flexible by offering many different forms of online classes. Now, especially with the pandemic, online classes have become essential for safety and student success. UVU is offering livestream, online interactive, and online classes, three different types of ways for students to learn from home, as well as still having face to face classes available. These four methods of class delivery are a great tool for students to be able to learn the way they want, when they want."
Junior,5,"Utah Valley University is a place where everyone is there to do the same thing - learn and graduate. Because there is no football team and no on-campus housing, the school lacks in its pride department. However, I have never been someone who enjoys participating in those activities anyways, so I find it awesome to be in small classrooms with peers who are there to learn, grow, and find opportunities. The small classroom settings are ideal for learning, the facilities are amazing, and there are so many places to sit down, finish an essay, charge your phone, and take a little nap if you want to in between classes. Everyone is nice, inclusive, and easygoing and it's one of the best schools in Utah regarding inclusion and diversity, in my opinion, because it's so laidback and fun. It lacks the pretentiousness you can easily find in its neighboring colleges, which I have thoroughly enjoyed. I have also greatly benefitted from UVU's online learning options. I would recommend it to anyone."
Junior,5,"I've taken many courses online at UVU and I've loved having options to be able to continue my education while still navigating a demanding and busy schedule at home. Last year, I was planning a summer wedding throughout Spring semester, and it was a lifesaver to be able to work around an online schedule rather than be in class at all the times I needed to be doing wedding related things. It's also awesome for people who work full time and don't have a  consistent work schedule. Canvas is my favorite because it's so easy to navigate. The teachers are generally fair and the learning experience is similar to how it would be in class. I'd recommend their online classes to anyone."
Sophomore,5,Awesome school.  Amazing diversity and so many extra curricular activities and clubs.  They also provide so many amazing tools for students to help them succeed in their chosen fields.
Sophomore,5,I have taken several online courses from UVU and have found them very well delivered by the instructors.  I was especially impressed by my instructors this spring as many of them were forced to transition to online course with little to no time to plan the new course layout.
Sophomore,5,"I have not taken any online classes yet from UVU, but I look forward to it. My girlfriend has taken online classes this whole summer and she has absolutely loved it though."
Junior,5,It’s been great reaching out to my counselor online. She’s been helpful. The website is efficient in helping you know what to do!
Junior,5,I am so stoked to be a Wolverine! I love UVU so much! It’s been so good to me and I am so excited to continue my education in Aviation here!
Sophomore,5,"UVU has been the perfect school for me because it helps students apply what they're learning into the world around them and prepares students for the work force. Even as a transfer student, and a junior, I have had many incredible opportunities in my classes and extracurricular activities to build my resume and also grow as a person.

There are tons of exciting and fun clubs available for students to join (with an amazing student center), and resources for students that are struggling with food security or mental health services. Tuition is inexpensive, campus is very accessible and has amazing transportation via UTA services. The student body is super diverse and friendly, and everyone just wants to graduate :D 

If you ever want to go somewhere where it feels like your education matters and where you can make a difference, Utah Valley is definitely the place to go."
Junior,5,"I love coming here. I used to think that since it was open enrollment, that only people who couldn't get into better schools went here, but I love it. The teachers and student body are amazing."
Freshman,5,"It is small and quaint! It gives the best college experience! The class sizes are decent to small, so you always are able to get help from the professors."
Freshman,5,There were rarely any problems! Professors were very helpful and understanding! I was able to learn almost as well as if I was in the actual classroom!
Alum,5,"UVU is an excellent school. Despite being the largest in the state of Utah class sizes are usually quite small and personal and there is ample opportunity for one-on-one interaction with instructors. The councilors and teachers are very helpful and do all that they can to encourage each students success. Some programs are still somewhat limited in scope although most are rapidly growing. The facilities are largely new and there is an abundance of on-campus resources (gym, climbing wall, dining options, etc.). Because it is more of a commuter school there are fewer on-campus activities and less of a campus culture than at other schools. I would recommend UVU to anyone who thinks it might be a good fit for them; it certainly has been for me."
Junior,5,"I have only had one professor who did poorly but it was because of a miscommunication with him and the university. Overall, my teachers have been incredibly thorough and helpful online."
Alum,5,UVU offers some great online options.  I attended mainly on campus classes during my time there but appreciated the support offered to myself and other students.
Alum,5,They're a great University that is ever expanding and supports students from multiple backgrounds stemming from the recent high school graduate to the non-traditional student.  The campus is always improving and offers an incredible environment for those who commute as well as those who live near campus.
Junior,5,"The professors are super kind, and make sure you understand the online course.  I love that even when you're struggling you can email them and they respond right away. They are very helpful when you couldn't make the deadline they hear you out."
Junior,5,"I honestly love UVU it is such an amazing, accepting environment. They are very great at making you feel so welcomed."
Sophomore,5,"I have taken a few online classes with UVU. Although college classes in general are a bit challenging, the professors understand and work with you as much as possible.  They provide you with everything you need in order to succeed in their classes and are happy to help you with any questions you have!!!"
Sophomore,5,"I have absolutely loved being a student at Utah Valley University.  First of all, you get to go to school in one of the most beautiful places in the country.  The campus is surrounded by gorgeous mountains!  UVU also does a really great job at helping you succeed as a student.  They try to keep the number of students in the class, as small as possible so that you can get more one on one time with professors.  The campus is also really good at giving you all the resources you need to do well in all your classes.  I have loved my time at Utah Valley University!!! Go Wolverines!!!"
Sophomore,5,"I love that the class sizes are smaller and navigating the campus is really easy! I felt that I could easily talk to my professors with any questions, and I was supported with the help that I needed to be successful at school."
Alum,5,The professors are extremely helpful and the small classroom helped with being able to easily communicate with your professors.
Alum,5,"I took some classes online, but most in the classroom. The learning environment was great and the professors helped when I was not sure about an assignment. Friendly staff and the extracurricular activities are amazing."
Sophomore,4,The University is good school and I feel that with everything going on this year they've done a good job of accommodating everyone. But I also feel that with everything going on there should be a bit more compensation for the students and tuition.
Alum,4,My professors who taught me online were very helpful and I could tell that they were there for me if I needed them. They made lots of videos and other things to help us get the most out of the class.
Alum,4,"I loved attending UVU, I thought the professors that I had were really involved and actually cared about me learning the material. I had a biology teacher who got my to love biology (Mr. Mugleston). The feel of UVU was so caring towards other students, I will miss it!"
Freshman,4,I took two classes online. The only problem is they recorded all their lectures which made it difficult to talk to professors about what was going on in the lectures. It also made it hard to not have a teacher remind you of a midterm or final coming up.
Freshman,4,Great campus. The layout is a little confusing and is constantly under construction. There is not a lot of maps to help guide you through this. I was late to many classes because of this
Freshman,4,"From what I understand, the online classes are a little difficult in finding the help that you look for. however the option to have access to all of the information is really good."
Freshman,4,Some professors are very understanding whereas others I am not able to contact well which is very important when never meeting in person. Although very easy setup to communicate with other students
Freshman,4,Online classes here are great.  I'm probably going to continue most of my classes this way even after quarantine is over.  They use Canvas and otherwise just really simple and easy to use layout.
Freshman,4,"I've started college here during quarantine; UVU has adapted very well and the teachers are great.  They keep their classes small which is nice since the teachers can focus on each student.  Everything is easily accessible online and very easy to figure out.  They have plenty of resources available as well, and really hep you figure how how to attend college and succeed."
Sophomore,4,"I really loved taking classes online. I took a few just in the first year of being at UVU! I didn't know if it was for me but the courses that are online are very well constructed and formatted great so you can still learn everything that you would face to face. I even took anatomy online this past summer and was able to still get an amazing grade. The professors will make videos or live stream depending on the difficulty of the course. I really liked my online classes and I think that the professors work countless hours to give their students the success they need to get a good grade. They will cut back on things and format things differently so that it is a little easier, but that you also can learn the most important things!"
Junior,4,"I loved the layout and how easy it was to navigate. I had a wonderful experience overall, and I'm planning on transferring back. I spent two semesters at a different University, and it just wasn't the same."
Junior,4,All of the online classes I took were very easy to navigate through. It was simple to figure out what was required of me and where to turn in my assignments.
Junior,4,"I love UVU! It has a very inclusive atmosphere, and there are students from a lot of different backgrounds. There are also lots of opportunities to get involved in different leadership and club programs. This is the kind of school where you really get out of what you put into it. If you look for opportunities to engage you will find them, but if you just show up and leave you will miss out on a lot."
Junior,4,"The professors were as helpful as possible, making themselves available through video call whenever the students needed. I am not a fan of online schools as much, but it was a good experience."
Sophomore,4,"I was never expecting to actually take online courses however, with this COVID-19 pandemic it became necessary. Though there were miscommunications at the beginning of the transition to online classes mid-semester my summer online classes performed excellently. I was very comfortable with the online schedule that courses followed because it allowed for flexibility and variety in my learning experience."
Sophomore,4,"I believe that going to any college during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic served to be a challenge however, UVU managed to adapt to changing circumstances for students and maintained flexibility with those who were in higher need of educational services. They managed to shift to online platforms in a matter of days and though it was rocky towards the beginning they were able to work out the kinks between professors, student aids, and advisor availability."
Sophomore,4,"So far, I haven't taken classes online at UVU, but I know that they will do great, I've used Canvas a lot and the teachers are very able with it."
Niche User,4,"My teacher, Loss, was amazing. The school is pretty good but with a few tiny flaws. The students are very welcoming and campus is a very unhostile environment."
Junior,4,"it's been pretty ok! my Generals were easy to pass but i stilled learned a lot! i feel that professors were really good about creating assignments that helped us complete the course and learn, instead of creating ""Busy Work"" like many of my friends attending other colleges (like BYU) complained their professors were personally doing.  I did struggle a little being In the Musical Theatre BFA. It's hard to do acting / dancing / and singing classes online. BUT our professors did great job of being creative in still making fun ways for us to efficiently learn!"
Junior,4,UVU did a great job of adjusting to the online learning scene the pandemic has put us in. There are some things that could have been easier but I can't complain.
Freshman,4,"Utah valley University is a college made to help students. The campus is perfect, especially for bad weather because most of it is connected, so you don't have to walk outside much. They have great student services, and tools to help students succeed and get a good education. They offer many activities to help students stay active at an affordable price. UVU is a great school that cares about diversity, safety, and great education."
Alum,4,"The professors were excellent, they really put effort into making sure their students get a quality education. This school isn't a typical college campus, it's mostly for people who are trying to work through school and get back out in the workforce."
Sophomore,4,"It is very easy to access wolverine track and get online to their website to check grades, assignments, etc. They take pride in their online program."
Sophomore,4,"The campus life is fantastic there, people are friendly, and the staff is very willing to help at all times."
Sophomore,4,"The teachers are helpful, the classes are based on a personal level, there are many programs that they have to offer at a reasonable price. UVU is a great school to choose when you are looking for a quality education and friendly staff. The teachers care about your success!"
Sophomore,4,"UVU is the collage I've lived next to all my life, making it a convenient choice. The school is constantly growing with new buildings, programs, and accommodations allowing for constant growth and improvement. The most recent addition the construction of a bridge that crosses the freeway making it a short walk from the apartments on the other side."
Sophomore,4,"With the pandemic that started this year, everything was forced online after spring break. The transition was surprisingly smooth given the urgency of the situation. While each teacher had to come up with their own method for teaching online, it was located on the school's canvas website making all the different materials easy to access. In the end, things worked so well that I  finished the semester with no drop in my grades."
Sophomore,4,"My online learning experience at UVU has been pretty great so far! Professors have been generally clear about the requirements of their courses and have been very understanding and supportive when I have contacted them about course questions.

 It was easy to keep what assignments were due and what I need to do online- but you have to be motivated and on top of things if you really want to succeed!Paying attention to the tiniest of details on assignment requirements helped me complete my assignments with accuracy, and helped me work for a great score in my classes. I also was easily able to network with my classmates for support or study help, and it was a great experience."
Junior,4,This University is greatly underestimated for the quality you get. The campus is large and the resources to help students succeed is infinite. My favorite thing about going to UVU is that the environment really feels like a second home. There are so many places to study between classes and the fitness center is great. The professors are really great at helping their students succeed as long as the students reach out for help. Just wish there were more recreational classes or clubs available. Sometimes it can be hard to make friends here.
Junior,4,The online courses are fantastic! I always try to get my courses online when I can. Most face to face classes use an online platform anyway making the online and on campus classes very similar. The course is super easy to navigate and understand though their platform. Only thing that can be better is more available online classes and easier communication with the professor.
Junior,4,"I did not take online classes while at UVU, but I did take a few hybrid courses and my professors handled the online portions extremely well. The assignments were clearly outlined and they are always super accessible by email."
Junior,4,"UVU has so many resources for students! I have also had great experiences with my professors--they are very available to students outside of class and via email, and I have received tons of one-on-one help from many of mine. Small class sizes and a small department made my experience here great."
Junior,4,"I hate online classes, so I'm not fond of them. With that being said, the way that UVU has dealt with moving things online was good and made the classes bearable."
Alum,4,Online learning has many limitations in any setting. After everything went online because of COVID-19 teachers were very good about maintaining as much personalized education as possible and facilitation group learning even remotely.
Freshman,4,"My experience with Utah Valley University has been very informative and interactive. I am a transfer student and I can say I am very pleased with the help they have offered me since being accepted into the university. Due to COVID-19, a lot of face to face interactions have been limited but online they provide conselors who are free and willing to help students with any issue they have. The campus is very spacious and helps to control overcrowding in public places. Overall, I can say I am honored to be a student at this university and hope to continue to have positive experiences here."
Freshman,4,"As for my online learning experience, I have greatly appreciated their concern towards teaching under these current circumstances. Before releasing an official statement, UVU sent an email to all students wanting their opinions on how this upcoming semester should be treated. They are striving to provide in person teaching while swapping with online teaching to let students with different learning capabilities receive both forms of teaching. I am very pleased to know the university values the student's opinions while also striving to give them a sense of student life during this pandemic."
Sophomore,4,Utah Valley University is a commuter school which doesn't offer dorms which is fine but the school itself is really nice layout and great if you enjoy doing outdoor activities on you're free time.
Sophomore,4,Online learning at this school is easy with the professor willing to help as long as you stay on top of the work online leaning at UVU is a great alternative to the traditional classroom settings.
Sophomore,4,I took online classes because of COVID-19 and the professors worked really hard to ensure that the transition was as smooth as possible and was a learning experience for everyone.
Junior,4,"I have a few learning disabilities so I normally do have to work at getting consistently good grades, but for most of my time at UVU, the Accessibilities Services have been very accommodating and are so willing to work with me to help me perform my absolute best. I major in Illustration, and the professors in that department are all fantastic teachers, and are all professionals in that field so they know what they're talking about, I make it a point to learn as much as I can from all of them."
Sophomore,4,"Super fun school. Great building, very diverse despite being in Utah Valley. Great programs all the way around."
Sophomore,4,During COVID-19 the professors were super accommodating and did an excellent job of moving everything online.
Sophomore,4,"Very nice campus with good facilities and interesting events. Very large school so not a ton of personalization, but you definitely get quality education for one of the best prices In the state."
Sophomore,4,Depending on the online class you're taking there are great resources available. Course design is very initiative and professors give more attention to their online students.
Sophomore,4,"So far, my online learning experience has been good. As a single parent, it is hard to focus at times with it all being online. However, for the situation, I think things have gone well."
Sophomore,4,I love the classes and the teachers and the environment. Sometimes I feel like I don't have very much help with important things such as paying for school or with the advisors. I feel like me being at the school makes no difference to them.
Freshman,4,I really enjoy that most of the the assignments are online and that they broadcast it to my high school.
Graduate Student,4,"It's great at trying to help you get some practical experiences both in and out of classes. I majored in Marketing, and what made the most use of my time was being part of their AMA club. 
The school has a lot of full-time working students which provides some real, down-to-earth students, but also students that are entitled to thinking their work comes first. It can get really annoying in group projects."
Freshman,4,The thing I like best about Utah Valley University is how easy it is to connect with counselors and others to help you with your education. Just make a call and they have the answer for you. The campus inside makes you feel safe and part of a community. Lots of fun things to do around the campus and you can easily make friends. One problem about the university though is parking. Cant really drive up there without a parking pass and getting there really early. Other than that I give Utah Valley University a 4/5 starts or 9/10 stars.
Sophomore,4,"UVU has a great environment. there are small classes, great faculty, and an understanding student environment. The School works hard to be inclusive. They have great support systems, there is always an advisor or counselor to talk to."
Niche User,4,"I really enjoyed my two years of education I experienced at Utah Valley University. As far as education goes, I felt like I was getting great professors that cared about their students. For the price of school there, they have a great learning system. I also loved how many classes were offered online, as I was trying to work full time as a cook as well as going to school. For changes I would like to see a for diverse school. It also seemed as though the school will accept any application because the school grew tremendously in the two years I was there. Classes were getting big and there was never any parking to be found."
Sophomore,4,"I love Utah Valley University! It has so many options and they are always willing to help with anything you need. The possibilities open to me at this school are incredible. It is a large school with a lot of students, but I still feel welcome and that they care about me as an individual student and are there to help me succeed."
Niche User,4,"It is very good and easy to work with, but it is in dire need of a new website, as well as a new answering machine"
Junior,4,There are many great resources for students and most of the instructors are helpful and care. My particular major needs more upper division class options.
Freshman,4,"UVU is absolutely amazing! I have really enjoyed going to this college. Overall the professors are great and most of them seem to care about their jobs and what you are learning. The reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I am never aware of what is going on at the school! For example with voting for student positions, games, plays and other activities. I wish they were better at keeping me in the loop."
Freshman,4,"I haven't had much experience at the school yet since I start in the Summer, but the experience that I've had so far has been really nice. The people are nice, they have a lot of events and activities to participate in and there are so many resources around campus."
Niche User,4,"the campus is big and you can get lost there. but there are so many friendly people at Utah Valley, you'll be able to make a lot of friends. At Utah Valley, there are so many great food choices right inside of the school!!"
Freshman,4,What I loved about Utah Valley University is that I always felt that I was in a safe place. I didn't feel like I had to worry about my saftey. I love the friendly people you meet there too. I love the variaty of jobs that you can get and everything you can do around the school. They have many options of things you can do both outdoors and indoors. Over all I would say that it is a very good school and it is very enjoyable for everyone.
Sophomore,4,"I love that’s it’s an all indoor campus. That may not see like a big deal, but avoiding the cold Utah weather is great no matter how you can do it. I also love the small classroom size! We have the biggest amount of students going to school but still have the smallest classes. This makes it so nice because you can develop a closer relationship with your peers and professors. The smalles class I have been in as an honors class with seven people. So crazy! 

If I could changed anything, I would change how much parking passes cost."
Junior,4,I've enjoyed going to Utah Valley University because the class sizes are smaller than other large schools and the professors are knowledgable! It's also easy to commute to and has plenty of resources to help students do what they want and need to!
Sophomore,2,Online learning has been interesting. I feel that the teachers who used to teach in a classroom are having a hard time adjusting to the online environment. There is a lot of busy work being handed out which does nothing for us students.
Niche User,2,"The professors and classes were excellent, others terrible. English class is insane. Computer science program is the best. BLEW MY MIND! SO GOOD! So HELPFUL! Cafeteria is pretty good. fellow students are depressed, cranky, irritable, carless, narcissistic and pretty much a-holes. people would slam other peoples comments in discussions. the main attitude about school is that nobody cared. accommodations department doesn't work. I wish accommodations was more supported by the school. For the most part, it was just all a waste of time. If you are very brainy and smart, this school isn't for you. Most of the kids I met were idiots. I found very few peers and teachers that were positive, smart, helpful, and had good attitudes. It was a very discouraging and depressive experience. the school counselors are rude."
Junior,2,"The school is nice as far as the buildings are concerned.  There are a few good academic counselors here and there, but when dealing with the financial aid office, and a large number of the faculty, they are there to collect a pay check and that's about it, sure they , the teachers like what they teach, but they don't care about the students, they don't understand that most students are taking more than just their class, and trying to hold a job to pay for school, to say nothing of a social life.  I understand that the school while there to teach, needs to make money to be open, this school however sees the students not as people with lives, but as cows on the way to market, its sad, lots of good students don't learn as much or as well as they want to because they are trying to keep up with a thing called real life."
Junior,2,"Since this school has such a high acceptance rate, it's very impersonal. Trying to contact any member of the administration or a school counselor has been nearly impossible to do. Events aren't posted as much as they should be so I typically don't hear about cool school events until after they've happened. Parking is an absolute nightmare. And the administration really doesn't seem like they truly care about their students. They don't do much to work with you. Overall, my experience at this school has not been great."
College Junior,2,"The only transfer credit I had was from concurrent enrollment in high school, and those transferred fine.  However, others I know had problems with credit transfers.

I wish they offered more class options.  There are so many students here, and at times it is difficult to get the classes one needs.  I have had to wait at my computer, classes all scheduled out, for midnight on the day I can register so that I can get into the classes I need.  The farther you get into your major, the less class options are available.  I've had to rearrange my whole schedule for a class that was only offered at one day and at one time."
College Junior,2,"The only credits I needed to transfer were from concurrent enrollment in High School, and those were fine.  However, others I know have had some problems meeting transfer requirements.

I wish there were more classes available.  I feel I have to sit on my computer with my schedule all figured out, waiting for midnight on the day I can register in order to get my classes.  There are so many students that it can be difficult to find what you need to graduate on track.

Additionally, the farther you get into your major, the less class options there are.  I've really had to rearrange my schedule to fit with the ONLY time a class was offered."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I didn't like it because if was not very good, you know?"
College Junior,2,The core classes have been very hard to take because  of the time  of day they are offered. I have left the work field so I can take those  core classes to pursue my education.
College Junior,2,"I took only one online course, and forgot about it until about a month before classes ended. I work better when I am in class."
College Senior,2,I only tried one online course at UVU and I had to drop it. It was terrible. Very little support.
College Senior,2,For dance majors there is little flexibility in schedule especially ballroom majors.
College Senior,2,"The unwillingness of financial aid to work with me has left a bitterness in me toward UVU. The care more about strict adherence to irrational ""policy"" than a students education and well being."
College Senior,2,I love the Ballroom Dance program unfortunately it is one of the few in the country. The campus is great with nice facilities. However if you have an issue like I do with financial aid you will get no help at all.
College Senior,2,"Im online, so I get nothing in the way of career opportunities."
College Senior,2,"I don't feel like the school really thinks about its students, at least in terms of how to help them be successful. They're more concerned with the way the campus looks or that they're getting students to file through the school. There are so many issues that they won't address, it's getting ridiculous."
College Senior,2,"Software Engineering. When I spoke to my adviser about it, she was excited and said it's a great program. Found out recently (3 semesters into the core program after my Associate degree) that it's not accredited. Internships are hard to come by unless you know someone - they typically require at least a year of experience or Bachelor's degree (does that really make any sense to anyone else?) otherwise. Workload isn't too bad; I work 40+ hours per week and am currently taking 13 credit hours. It's rough, but doable"
College Senior,2,"I've had multiple issues with the finance department dropping the ball on financial aid forms and my scholarship. Definitely not much of a fan there. The majority of the professors don't really teach you a lot either; it's more of a ""here's what the book says, Google any questions you have because I don't have time to answer questions and get through the lecture"""
Recent Alumnus,2,"It cost too much; and I had to take out enough loans that I could have went to a real college and gotten a real college degree.   Everest ""College"" credits do not transfer to any of the accredited colleges in Colorado Springs."
Recent Alumnus,2,It is the same as the other schools; it just costs twice as much.  Disappointing.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I could have gotten the same certification from Intellitec of Colorado Springs for 1/2 of the cost; or at the Colorado Institute of Massage Therapy for 1/3.

I did not know this until after I had graduated.  

Not dissatisfied; but I do feel like I got ripped off paying for a fancy building (that is actually rented by the school).  :/

Choose another school; Everest is too, too expensive for the same thing the rest of the schools sell."
College Senior,2,"A bunch of the teachers I have had are adjuncts and really don't care, it's been bad..."
College Senior,2,"The online courses that I have taken have given me some of my worst grades. Not only is it due to my personal learning skills, but we were offered no extra help or tutoring. We were required to read a book, take quizzes online, and write papers on certain specific subjects. Basically, we were doing the class completely on our own because the ""professor"" for these online courses was absentee most of the time. It would take days at a time to get a question answered, and then he would be upset because we turned in our assignment late. He expected us to just know everything because it was in the book, but most people (like me) cannot learn something by reading a book. We have to take notes on it and be told and shown what it is and means."
College Student,2,"The work load was huge, I wasn't able to keep up and since I struggle in math it was especially hard. I wasn't let known there were options for tutoring until almost the last day of the class."
College Sophomore,2,"online courses are terrible if your computer sucks, if your stuff isn't up to date your grades suffer. I got docked significant points because I used office 2007 instead of office 2013. some projects are inaccessible, I ask the teacher a question and I don't get an answer or I get a message from the support line with a response to a question I did not ask."
College Sophomore,2,My school does not have a very high value in comparison to other universities in the state.
College Sophomore,2,"They are very limited in space, meaning only a few students are accepted into specialty programs."
College Freshman,2,"As previously stated, it's been a nightmare trying to get my scholarship figured out; most of the financial aid advisers don't seem to know half of what their job title requires them (or at least should) to know"
College Freshman,2,"It took me three weeks to get my current scholarship figured out. I was sent to three different departments, all of which gave me conflicting information. Now, after fulfilling ALL requirements, I have to figure out why it's been denied. No one seems to have any answers and I'm constantly getting the run-around."
College Freshman,2,It is a pretty new university so the post grad choices are slim.
College Sophomore,2,"I took a career exploration class from here, it was terrible and a waste of my time/money. Ended up damaging my gpa for a worthless class."
College Sophomore,2,My advisor told me I wasn't good enough for an RN.
College Junior,2,There aren't quite enough degree options. There range is limited.
College Junior,2,"I really, honestly hate having to pay for school. I think it is absolutely ridiculous how much I have to pay to attend. I was in Germany for a year being an au pair and I almost stayed there to go to school because they only have to pay around 200Euros a year for school. That's about $300. I just think it is crazy the difference to go to school in America and other countries. We are all getting the same level of education so I don't understand why we, in America, have to pay more than those outside. Although in England they have to pay way more than we do. 

But as a school, UVU is pretty average for how much you have to pay. Getting financial aid was pretty easy. I would definitely recommend everyone applying for FAFSA. I wouldn't be able to attend school without it. I was selected for verification one year and that was about a joke. It didn't go through and so I wasn't able to attend school for a year and a half because I didn't have a way to pay for it. But if your financial aid does go through then it is wonderful. Loans are great until you have to pay them off. But I have just accepted that that is how it will be."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is some diversity in terms of race, but not in religion. Most are Mormon but that is not the school's fault--the school is in Utah. And I don't mind that, I actually like that aspect of the student body. Academically, the student body is poor. The classes are easy and most are not good students."
Recent Alumnus,2,The red tape you have to go through to take a class outside your major is a big hassle. You have to met with you adviser to get any overrides to take a class--and there are a lot of restrictions. I can't count how many times I have had to email or meet with an adviser to get anything done.
College Senior,2,"UVU is dominantly Mormon students where there are not much minorities. Although it is not a religious school, BYU is the city down so most students are Mormon. It is a commuter school so most people do not want to make friends. Most students are married or even have a family so it is a different dynamic than most college campuses. If you are Mormon this school is great for you, if you are not than avoid this school at all costs! "
College Senior,2,"Honestly, if I could do it all over again I would not choose to go to this school. They have plenty of classes available, fairly inexpensive tuition, and want to help their students as much as possible. Although they do have some perks I did not enjoy my time at UVU. They do not have many social organizations where students can create bonds, I mean they do have plenty of academic organizations but not many clubs where students could find strong friendships. The area is dominantly of Mormon religion which makes most students want to go on dates on the weekends. The town is very small and there is not much to do there.  "
College Student,2,As I said before at Utah Valley University some of the teachers can be very hard to work with and inflexible.  Many of the teachers are there to see if they can make students fail.  It can be very frustrating and very difficult to deal with.  On the other hand there are also many very good teachers that help you understand everything that they are teaching.
College Senior,2,"The library is very small, not physically, there is not a lot of material accessible to the students. "
College Senior,2,I am still waiting for financial aid and the semester has already ended. Due to the schools failure to process my paperwork I can not register for classes and I am a senior. The semester starts in two weeks and I still do not know what I am taking. 
College Senior,2,Financial Aid and Scholarships are nearly impossible to get. It is also impossible to register for the classes that you need to graduate. It seems that the school is purposely overlapping required degree courses so that students have to stay in their school longer. 
College Junior,2,The school is old and needs to be brought up to todays standards. 
College Junior,2,Tuition is extremely high for this school. Other prestige schools in the state are lower than this one. Financial aid is hard to get unless it is through federal.
College Junior,2,There is no social scene as the campus isn't built for that. Facilities are old and dated. 
College Junior,2,"General Education courses are OK but the Aviation Major at this University is terrible. They take too much money and don't care about the students well being. Having not only attended as a student, but as being a full time employee, I've seen how students get mistreated and lied to."
College Sophomore,2,The student body in my school needs to be more active with the school.
College Junior,2,Trying to reach them by phone is awful
College Junior,2,I have not received ANY financial aid. Stressful!
College Junior,2,I dont have a chosen major yet
College Sophomore,2,"I haven't gotten into my major yet, but the business class I have taken was not that great. I liked the professors, but the class didn't focus on small business like I wanted it to, and they discussed the same topics every time I went to class."
College Sophomore,2,"The workload is a lot, but I feel like it is necessary. We need to make sure that we know how to do what we are doing, and work helps us do that."
College Sophomore,2,My overall experience has been good. I am learning a lot that I will need for the future. 
College Sophomore,2,The student body is very nice and fun. They are always trying to get people involved. 
College Sophomore,2,"The education program, all the green area, wonderful tutors. "
College Junior,2,"I haven't been to the career center, or the alumni network at my school.   "
College Junior,2,"They always have something going on, like some kind if activity from some club sponsoring it!"
College Student,2,They didn't transfer a credit from another school because I had a previous grade with the school in the same subject that was a low grade. The grade from the other school was higher and would allow me to move onto the next class. They told me I had to retake the class and take the student placement test as well. I also have a class that was restructured before we started and now they are restructuring it again and I have to spend most of my time monitoring this class so I don't miss anything and hurt my grade. Also proctoring has to be from a certified approved proctor. This does not include other college testing centers which I find a little ridiculous.
College Student,2,"The registration process was a nightmare for me. For two weeks I was in and out of pretty much everyone's offices, running around trying to get papers signed, and just trying to get in with my advisor who never seemed to be in his office when he said he would be. The actual class registration was better though, but definitely tricky to get into much needed classes before they fill up."
College Senior,2,"I cannot accurately comment on the student body, because I exclusively took online classes."
College Senior,2,The college of business is very average and does not stand out in any way. The university as a growing demand from non-traditional students for online classes yet the Accounting department refuses to make online courses available.
Niche User,1,Overall this school is terrible. They only want your money and prove it through the continuous changing of required classes for your major. You spend money on a required class only to have them tell you in the next semester it’s no longer required but a different class is.
Sophomore,1,The class I took online had clearly not been updated in 10+ years and the instructor was not help and did not listen.
Sophomore,1,"I would not waste your time. They're advisors aren't helpful, the financial aid office is a joke, the one class I took had clearly not been updated since at least 2007, and the payment plans they offer are an absolute joke. They just care about the money, not their students."
Graduate Student,1,I had the worst experience from the very beginning!! I regret applying for this school. Starting from admission's to financial aid to trying to pay for my tuition! Everytime I came in I got a new story. It was a run around and so frustrating!!! I got a late fee because financial aid too their sweet time. They don't except credit card or charge you an outrageous fee online. This school is pathetic in there communication skills and they DON'T work with you or make it easy for the student. I had nothing but the worst experience so far! I can't wait to get my bachelor's program over with and get the heck out!! Not a school I would recommend to anyone.
College Senior,1,"The online courses I've taken were terrible - the professors were very disorganized, difficult to understand (the way they type up assignment descriptions for example), and fairly unavailable."
College Junior,1,"I was highly disappointed when I learned my program would be transferred to online exclusively.  Lots of busy work assignments.  Communication response time from professors is usually 10-15 days.  I organized study groups and arranged for private tutors to teach us.  In doing so, I incurred additional costs."
College Sophomore,1,My school is in Utah which means there is a very limited amount of diversity.
College Sophomore,1,This is very limited and does not serves the benefits other schools would.
College Junior,1,"I am a music major, but I am probably changing it. It's a four year program starting now, and I've been in school for three years."
College Senior,1,The classes are not interesting and the education level is terrible. I feel like I am in high school.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The tuition is cheap, but you get what you pay for as my Dad always said; meaning that what you get in return is what you get back. UVU's Financial Aid office is terrible. There are always 45 to 1 hour waits during peak times---much longer on the ""last day"" days. The staff is extremely unfriendly and very curt. I feel demeaned whenever I go. I feel that way based on their saying, ""Well, you can't..."" as a response to my questions. It makes me what to go to a different school."
College Junior,1,Not one person I know of has received help finding a career after graduating. This is one of the most complained about topics on campus.
College Junior,1,"You don't learn much at all. You are given a book at told to read it. There is no structure to help students learn, it's 100% on your own without any guidelines. Grading is sporadic and most professors are hard to get a hold of."
College Junior,1,"Workload is way too much for what you get out of it. Curriculum is always changing so no one is on the same page. Internship opportunities are hard to get but not impossible. Job placement after is very, very low."
College Sophomore,1,"I have a problem with the tuition. I do not apply for it because of my parents, however I do end up paying for school my self so it makes things very difficult for me. "
College Sophomore,1,It gets hard sometimes because not every class is offered at reasonable times. 
College Student,1,"Student login to the university network is fickle. They have a password protected student/teacher login and an open guest network, but most of the time people have to access the guest network because the system can't/won't recognize their individual login. However, the connection is usually pretty good but during the afternoon it has a tendency to slow down drastically."
College Junior,1,"Due to my major and that I'm an out-of-state student, I can't not get any financial aid at this school."
College Freshman,1,"I have scheduled time to see an adviser to help me choose my major and my career several times. After a fairly long wait she called me in and asked me what I would like to major in. I responded, that is the reason I was there to see her. I told her my interests in the medical field and she told me that she wasn't able to help me but gave me a number from someone else who might be able to help me. I then told her I would like to be a radiologist and she gave me the website for a radiology tech. school which is not at all what I was wanting to do. If anything she just confused me more about my future and signed me up for classes I didn't need to take. She also mentioned that I don't necessarily have to get a degree so when I asked what I should major in she told me ""you don't understand, if you're a radiologist you don't need a degree."" It was a terrible experience and my other few visits were just as bad."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is not great. Even with buying a $50 parking pass you are still not guaranteed to get a spot. The financial aid is terrible. I have been many times to the financial aid office begging for help financially, any scholarships, or grants that I would apply to. They weren't able to help me at all after waiting for one hour just to see someone."

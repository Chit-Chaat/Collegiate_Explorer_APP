Freshman,5,My experience at Florida Memorial University is great.I like that the university feels homely and everyone is so warm and welcoming. One thing I would like to change is the Cafeteria food.
Alum,5,"I am an active member of the Florida Memorial National Alumni Association  (FMUNAA) and the local South Dade Chapter. I have very fond memories of my alma mater. I find the current FMU students to be very progressive and determined. They have done a remarkable job during the COVID-19 pandemic by forging ahead during online learning. The administration had the vision to allow students to remain on campus for those who could not access housing when other universities kicked students off campus leaving them without options.  Also, the alumni successfully represents the university in a variety of industries and leadership positions globally.  Indeed, FMU is an incredible collaboration of old school and new school."
Alum,5,I personally have not had to experience any of my Florida Memorial classes online as an alumni. I would believe the professors would put in effort to make that adjustment seamless for their students.
Sophomore,5,"I personally like face to face action but the online learning was actually very good. The professors were on time with their assignments, tests or exams and they were fast when it came to responding to any emails I had sent to them."
Sophomore,5,"My experience so far at Florida Memorial University has exceeded my expectations, the staff make you feel at home, the students there welcome you as soon as you step foot on the campus. The food is amazing there is always something different to try and that is something I love. The campus life is to die for there is that sense of fun but discipline when needed ensuring that everyone is safe and protected, the housing makes you feel as if your right in your own little room the restrooms are always cleaned and ready to use at anytime. Florida Memorial University is an amazing university I love it and I am so glad God had blessed me to attend this Historically Black University, I am without a doubt a PROUD LION!!!."
Senior,5,Florida Memorial is an amazing HBCU. I love the environment and the way the students interact with each other.
Freshman,5,It’s very small and comforting.  It’s in a pretty area and the staff and students are very nice. I learn a lot of new stuff

Niche User,5,The visit to this campus was epic and the food was outstanding. The staff was very pleasant and polite
Freshman,5,"school is great, very diverse i also enjoy he campus views, just wish i wouldn't have to pay so much. Overall since i been on campus i haven't had any major issues other than financially, but i also had wonderful experiences with my previous professors, hey were very helpful. Most of all i enjoyed the diversity, there are students from all over the united states and also different countries and it is very culture based."
Freshman,5,Overall it’s really nice I like the atmosphere very professional and productive there is so many resources the deans and aids are always available and easy to access the people are kind and friendly and Miami is a hot spot where you get to meet a lot of resources that can be resourceful with many things.
Freshman,5,I like that it’s something new for me and it has more opportunities. This college has nice dorms and the people are very understanding.
Niche User,5,Florida Memorial University is a GREAT campus! When I visited the campus for a college visit I immediately knew I wanted to attend this school.
Freshman,5,Spring 2019 was my first semester here at Florida Memorial University and the experience was like no other. The professors are really down to earth and go the extra mile to help students obtain the grades they are aiming for.
Freshman,5,"This Is my first year attending Florida Memorial University. I was recruited by the women's basketball team at Florida Memorial University to play as a guard. the experience I had for It to be my first year at college was different, Interesting, and adventurous. what made It different because It's a HBCU, It's a very diverse school, and coming from Chicago to Miami was a huge change for me as In the culture. The Interesting part about my college life was the transition I had from basketball In high school to college. It was a struggle to maintain my time management but after a while I started coping and using different strategies to help me succeed throughout the year. Overall the college experience I had went very well with all the obstacles I went through and still manage to maintain great grades and a successful basketball season."
Niche User,5,"Experience with Florida memorial university was excellent and very life changing having my majors and classes provided for me. Also, they've told me that if they don't have the specific classes that I need for major then I can go and take classes to receive the concept what I'm learning, Since I want to be a zoologist in the near future they work with Miami zoo and it can help me get a job interview and become a Zookeeper. I even enjoy the diversity even though its"
Freshman,5,"My experince at Florida Memorial University is great. The professors here actually explain, and break down materials enough for you to understand the lesson or assignment. Most of the work is easy. The campus is clean, the food tatse great, and there many activies that take place. As a freshman, I was afraid of being lost, or confused about the different material that are used in college, but the people here are very hands on, and will patiently help you until you fully understand."
Freshman,5,I liked it was a small university and a private school. Class sizes are at a good number for me. its also near my family and offer my major. It allow me to build a career with piloting. I like that fact that there is multiple scholarships available to upcoming freshmen students. There is housing on campus. This is my dream college to attend. There is a nearby airport for me to obtain my flight training and hours. Tuition isn't too expensive. with scholarships coming I will definitely be able to afford it. Florida Memorial University is known to be a historical Black school. I look forward to seeing what more they have for me to offer.
Sophomore,5,It is a very good school where the curricular is amazing and the teachers put the students first. A lot of graduated students has been successful and this school guarantees a future of excellence.
Freshman,5,"Florida memorial university is a very welcoming place, they take everyone in making them feel like family. The school can improve communications such as getting the information out to the kids in a timely matter."
Freshman,5,"There are many things that I like about Florida Memorial University , the one thing I dislike about it is the work study part only certain students that do their financial aid first get to do work study on a struggling freshman and have no chance to do it . I like everything else about Florida Memorial University wouldn’t change a thing ."
Sophomore,5,"Florida Memorial University is a very small university. Being a small university is something positive because all the student has the opportunity to know each other. I am an athlete from the university, my sport is volleyball. Being a student-athlete is not easy. We have a heavy schedule of practices and classes. Sometimes we have to miss class because we have games away. One thing that I like about Florida Memorial professor is that they understand and do not penalize you, they support the athletes. Inclusive some of them when is a home game they went to the game to support. Florida Memorial University is a university that not a lot of people know that exists but is great. The only bad thing is the food but any university is perfect."
Sophomore,5,"My school Florida Memorial University the Home of the Lions this University is a small University but we are big in heart and character. Our school always makes sure that the students safety is #1. Our quote ""A Promise. A Future"" As you sign up to be a student for this university we give you a promise to your future. WE promise that you will have a future. Even if you are struggling at times there are students and professors who are willing to help you get through it all.  And the best thing about a small university compare to the big universities staff members and facilities will always have time for our students if their in need for help."
Sophomore,5,Good university. But too much partying. The professors there know their information and some of them are good at guidance.
Freshman,5,I loved the teacher to student ratio and the diversity of students that attend. The  one to one with your counselors is one like no other ! I am excited to be apart of an environment where growth is manifesting.
Sophomore,5,"Before I decided to come to Florida Memorial University, I was planning on going to Monroe College in New York. There are three reasons why I really wanted to go to Monroe. One, Monroe is a school well known for it's computer engineering studies. Two I'm from the Bahamas so living in New York would allow me to meet new people in a environment that is one of the most diveresed and widely visited places in the world. Three, I've never seen or felt snow before, so that was also a reason for me.
However, I later found out about Florida Memorial's excellent academic reputation and that when you graduate, because you came from an HBCU the drive you have to be more successful is uncomparable. Because Florida Memorial does not have a big campus or classes, its easier to have one on one conversations with your professors that can relate to you and actually know your name and this helps grow your self-esteem and communication skills. On this campus, there is never really a dull moment."
Freshman,5,Florida Memorial University has excellent professors and has a very diverse culture due to the diversity of the students and staff.
Graduate Student,5,"I have been at Florida Memorial University for 2 years. This school engage students in learning for personal achievement, for a sustainable livelihood and an enduring contribution to society."

Junior,5,"Florida Memorial University is a great l school with excellent faculty and staff member from the professors to the grounds men. The campus is small in size but a great atmosphere to grow up in. The classes are small and that one on one time with professors for extra guidance is excellent to have.
The University has grown since my Freshman year, rather than practicing traditions they are creating them. The campus is very diverse so you can meet different people and there is something for everyone to come together and do at all times from sports, Greek life to musicals.
Overall my experience at FMU has been awesome for me and going into my Junior year still and honor student and starting basketball player has been and will continue to be great. I rate FMU an AMAZING 5!"

College Freshman,5,The Greeks on campus are overall really cool. They are average students just like the rest of us.
College Freshman,5,I love my school. The campus is just the right size and the staff do an overall good job working here. I feel that I would not want to be at any other place.
College Freshman,5,Florida Memorial University has great Greeks and they all represent the school well.

I play baseball and all of the Coaches and Teammates there are all very nice and they all work hard at what they love most."
College Sophomore,5,it is awesome here i love it so much. everyone should love it
College Junior,5,The teaching staff and professors really care about your education.  The university is unique in that is the only historically black university in South Florida.  The sun is always shining and is conducive to higher learning.  The choir is second to none and there is a family atmosphere.  The teaching staff are very approachable and always willing to pass on knowledge to assist with your education and career goals.
College Senior,5,"my over all experience at my school Florida memorial university has been wonderful . I have made new friends and have learned so much from my professor . I have just became Miss senior for my university , and I also join zeta phi beta sorority . I can honestly say my experience over all has been great ."
College Sophomore,5,my school is a family friendly environment
College Freshman,5,"The party scene at my school is pretty nice. I love the diversity of the different cultures, because I am not used to it. They have different varieties of music and attire. But some of the best parties take place off campus because it is spacious. This has a great impact on the student experience of ""college life."""
College Freshman,5,Because I am a Bahamian I am more knowledgeable of the Bahamas Alumni Association of FMU. Bahamian alumni's are very active on campus & in the lives of current students.
College Junior,5,"Sometimes it may take a while depending on the situation. However, the financial aid workers are very diligent in their profession."
College Junior,5,"Dormitory style living is very convenient, it also depends on your personality if you are not known to be a very friendly or outgoing person then community style living may not be the best option for you. However, College is all about expanding your knowledge and culture at the same time in a comfortable environment."
College Freshman,5,My school is located in Miami near the Miami Dolphins football stadium. It is not far from a mall and there are beaches near.
College Sophomore,5,Criminal justice is one of the best majors. Professors are great
College Freshman,5,I love my major! My major is social work and there aren't a lot of us on campus but we are very close. There are various activities on campus that help us communicate with each other.
College Sophomore,5,"Great weather very sunny , you can go to the beach everyday"
College Sophomore,5,The bonds of the sisters and brothers seems like a great experience
College Sophomore,5,Mostly sunny all the time.
College Student,5,Not much people are doing a BA in chemistry and therefore I am able to get the individual attention I need. The workload is fairly easy so far and I am a very hardworking person so I give myself credit for getting through so far.
Freshman,4,When taking class online. My experience was great my professors were really understanding and patient.
Junior,4,"I love my HBCU, it's a truly amazing experience. College resources can be better. Food can be better but I understand the reason behind caterng. The tuition has went up in the past few years, which it was already a problem beforehand."
Freshman,4,"Flomo is often underestimated as an HBCU, but it's a great university. Class sizes are small so all your professors know you. There's also lots of clubs and organizations to get involved in."
Freshman,4,Professors adapted to the pandemic to very well. They were lenient to the students and the circumstances. Most did Zoom or Microsoft Teams lessons so it felt like we were still in person!
Alum,4,I liked the small class sizes and the fact that the professors cared.  They also try to assist students with scholarship opportunities.
Sophomore,4,"I think that,  The university professors are very kind and will teach the students. However, I lost money in my room at the dormitory. A person who left the camera and entered the room was also shown. I want you to strengthen safety. I want to live in a dormitory with peace of mind."
Freshman,4,"FMU is a great college! The classes are small, many of the teachers are very helpful, and the students are very much active on campus. Also the tuition very reasonable."
Junior,4,I love Florida memorial university in many ways but most over is the staff and the people. It’s a lot of love and professors that will love to see you strive. They work with day in and day out with anything. When I first join FMU I was pretty nervous because I was just starting college but it didn’t last long. Because the warmth I felt from the workers and my fellow students. FMU education staff is great if your someone that need one on one tutoring. They specialize in helping their student in there weakness and turning it into strengths. So now i’m a junior my experience still had been positive. The one thing I’ll change is living conditions of the dormancy with bed and air but overall it’s and excellent school. I’m glad to be part of .
Freshman,4,For me an international student i enjoyed all the different cultures and differnt kinds of people at this fine HBCU
Sophomore,4,Its a good start off college I'm happy to be apart of it and i will love to watch it grow to its full potential.
Freshman,4,its a very good school with good rates and high in graduation rates. its very helpful with information and touring is very helpful as well. classes are small and realible. living on campus is safe and very comfortable. payments and bills are easy to pay .
Freshman,4,Florida Memorial is a small university. I would like to see more sports added to the school and better living conditions. It's a nice HBCU being that it is the only HBCU in south Florida. The Professors are willing to go the extra mile to help their students succeed. Many
Freshman,4,"i love the events, frats, sorors, and the teachers. we just need better students and staff. the campus is pretty for it to be a small private college."
Niche User,4,"Overall great teachers and students, just to much of partying then learning students. My grandma went here an I use to go to school with her to witness these things."
Sophomore,4,I like the events. The students are always doing something. I think the students' voice should be heard more. That is the one aspect that can be improved.
Freshman,4,"The University is trying its best to achieve a better reputation. However, the reputation is not as important once you are in the university. They have provided me with the tools necessary to advance in my student life. I have been awarded with scholarships and I can say that this was the right choice for me. The Aviation Department is fantastic and truly cares about the students."
Sophomore,4,I would like to see that they help more people at home with lack of money and that give them more opportunities and that they are much more organized.
Freshman,4,"Florida Memorial University is a historical school. The National Negro Athem was performed and written here. 
Love atmosphere and teachers really care For there students."
Senior,4,"I love my HBCU. It is the only Historically Black University in South Florida. The classrooms are not too big which makes learning and grasping most subjects easier. The campus isn't too big therefore you are able to know your schoolmates, faculty and staff more. While every school has it's flaws, it still is a good school!"
Sophomore,4,My experience so far at FMU has been mixed.  I like the atmosphere and the professors are really accommodating.  The only drawback is there is no FOOTBALL!  This would make for more social activities on the campus.  It gets boring!
Senior,4,My experience here at Florida Memorial was a typical college experience that I pictured in mind. This school is very diverse and caters to a lot of international students. One thing that I love about this university is that there are small classroom sizes and that the campus is small enough for you to know practically everyone. Which can be a good and a bad thing. This university can benefit from some changes especially when it comes to campus life and student opportunities.
Senior,4,"My experience as a college senior at Florida Memorial University is bittersweet. The staff really treat you like you're at home, easy to adjust! By it's a diversity school, you get to meet other people and become accustomed to their beliefs. If I could change anything it would be  to make the dorms co-ed."
College Freshman,4,ANYONE CAN EXPRESS THEIRSELVES AND WILL NOT BE JUDGED.
College Freshman,4,WE ARE ALL ADULTS. IF YOU DONT WANT TO DO SOMETHING THEN YOU DONT HAVE TOO
College Freshman,4,"THERE SHOULD BE MORE VAREITY OF COURSES. THE PROFESSORS ARE AWESOME, THEY MADE MY FRESHMAN YEAR A GOOD ONE. THE CLASS STYLES ARE GOOD FOR ME. I CAN FOCUS MORE THAN I DID IN HIGH SCHOOL. THE CLASS SIZES ARE HUGE BUT ITS UNDER CONTROL AND I CAN LEARN MORE."
College Freshman,4,THE SERCUITY MAKES ME FEEL SAFE. I CAN WALK ON CAMPUS ALONE AND STILL FEEL SAFE.
College Freshman,4,"FUN ATMOSPHERE, GREAT PARTIES AND GREAT SHOWS!"
College Freshman,4,"BASKETBALL, VOLLEYBALL GAMES ARE ALWAYS PACKED!"

College Sophomore,4,They never gave up on winning.
College Sophomore,4,I'm very grateful for this school. It has taught me a lot.
College Senior,4,"Professors are very helpful, students are helpful as well. However, the workload can be overbearing."

College Freshman,4,I've visited the campus and it's amazing. I've met a few counselors and teachers and are amazing.

College Sophomore,4,"Overall my two years so far has been what I expected for me, challenging but progressive."
Junior,2,"Lots of drama, nothing is organized except for anything that has to do with athletics. Housing isn’t good especially for the prices. Food isn’t good nor are there many options. Anyone can qualify as a teacher here. WiFi is horrible."
Freshman,2,"My experience at Florida Memorial University has not been a great one. During my fall semester, there were about two shootings inside the campus and 2 people resulted dead. Ever since I’ve been worrying about my safety on this campus and wish to move out next year."
Sophomore,2,"It is an HBCU where it just does not feel like a college environment, most students do not care about school, not enough athletic facilities to accommodate their sports programs, old building with no regular maintenance, and old dorms. However, there is a beautiful lake, some very good professors and others not."
Sophomore,2,"It is a small school and the teachers help you if help is needed. The accountant program is horrible, they only have one teacher and she is not good at explaining."
College Freshman,2,NOT THAT MANY PARTIES. IF SO THEY ONLY LAST UNTIL ABOUT 12 AM AND THEN ITS OVER.
College Senior,2,"There's always a hassle trying to get into a good dorm. If you don't get into  good dorm you are forced to stay in the old outdated dorms, which have mold and horrible living conditions because the school does not offer off campus housing."
College Freshman,2,some buildings need to been done over and improved to make it more healthy and suitable to live in
College Sophomore,2,The new dorms are small but the old dorms have mold.
College Sophomore,2,I wouldn't choose this school again because the school rips people off and takes your money.
College Sophomore,2,"Staff not friendly or helpful

School functions don't last due to hostility

everything is always canceled or rescheduled"
College Sophomore,2,Need to have more options and longer hours.
College Sophomore,2,Men's soccer is the best but they don't have a field for them.
College Freshman,2,"I wish at least some financial aid was given to me. My income at home is okay but just because my parents have some what of a nice job does not determine if I may need help paying for college or not. I had to take out 2 loans during the fall 2014-spring 2015 school year, and one loan for the summer time. It's a hassle and needs to be taken care of because I know that I am not the only one complaining about this issue."
College Freshman,2,Not clean very old mold in building
College Sophomore,2,I believe there should be Greek housing and all Greeks are not available on campus
College Freshman,2,There are mold in the buildings alin the walls. The maintence in the bathrooms aren't at its best and the building is always extremely cold. When it's really hot you can smell the mildew and mold and the overall building has an odd smell.
College Freshman,2,Off-campus housing needs to be improved.
College Sophomore,2,campus is far away from other places
College Sophomore,2,school is old and bad looking
College Sophomore,2,this campus is in bad shape
College Sophomore,2,You have to make multiple trips to the financial aid office to get everything you need in order for you to receive the aid that you need
College Sophomore,2,"It depends on what housing you are inn. The new housing ok, however the old housing bad"
College Student,2,"The university does not offer any Associate Degree's. This is challenging for me because if I cannot afford to go to school for the entire 4 years, I can go to school for 2 years and have some type of degree."
College Student,2,The security  is very friendly and they are very willing to assist any student in need. The usually do safety checks around the school every 15 mins.The school nurse is barely there and it takes time to actually get the assistance you need because there is only one nurse.
College Student,2,I only got money to pay for my classes and my parents do not live in the U.S so I am on my own and I have to move from place to place because I do not have anywhere stable to stay and I have to eat every other day because I do not have enough money
College Senior,2,It is very clear at my university that anyone that applies receives an acceptance letter! There is so effect but into the process from the point of view of the university. It is very unfair to the individuals that are actual serious about their degree because the most of the individuals in the classes do not really care to be there.
College Senior,2,At Florida Memorial University the overall drug scene is very noticeable due to the fact that it appears that the staff acts as if nothing is going on. If the rules became stricter I believe that the view of the university would change.  Most of the individuals do as they please because there are no consequences.
College Freshman,2,on campus the best options would be the new dorms though they are pricey they are cleaner and better than the old dorms. in the old dorms there is a lot of mold and mildew because they are old the bathrooms are rarely clean. if you stay in the new dorms you get your own bathroom inside of your dorm room instead of having to use a public restroom and shower.
College Sophomore,2,"There are no co-ed dorms, and this is very enforced."
College Sophomore,2,"It's the same stuff every day which can get very boring, and unhealthy."
College Sophomore,2,There is pretty much no variety.
College Sophomore,2,The Miami weather is okay but sometimes it rains too much. The weather is often unpredictable even when predicted by weather reports. My campus experience has not changed because of the weather every location had its own climate and this climate is okay for me. Its a tropical weather and that's what Miami is known for.
College Sophomore,2,I DONT LIKE THE SURROUNDINGS REALLY BAD NOT GOOD AT ALL
College Sophomore,2,Its almost nonexistent on our campus.
College Sophomore,2,We aren't able to do a lot of activities on campus because we are so restricted. We can not have visitors on campus nor visitors of the opposite sex in our rooms just to hang out.
College Sophomore,2,Student life on campus is poor but you make it what it is for the most part.
College Sophomore,2,We have rules but not many are enforced or follwed
Recent Alumnus,2,"I give. My university a c because the school is fairly old 
And the registration process is a hassle. You have go on a scavenger hunt just to get signatures from several different departments, the student aids that assist is vey unprofessional and the financial aid office employed is very rude they pick and choose they are going to smile with."
College Senior,2,"Florida Memorial University does not provide much information about off campus housing, most students especially international students are somewhat on their own in finding housing. While some off campus housing are cheaper than living on campus for international students this however can cause a problem. When students migrate to the US they don't have any knowledge about the area mist tend to look housing location that has a safety issue."
College Junior,2,The variety of food suck. The café closes at 6. There is a pizza hut on campus however it is the only restaurant so you get tired of it pretty fast. They do have a little sub shop in the pizza hut however they tend to run out of food often. If you are in need of a late night snack there are 2 vending machines and only one works sometimes. Pretty much you have to go off campus a lot in order to eat well.
College Sophomore,2,"Basketball is our schools Football compared to other Universities. We once years ago had one but yet I guess we don't have enough funding for one now. Wouldn't expect one until 10 years from now. But basketball games get good turn outs. The gym looks as if it is a high school gym though, there are rumors of an upgrade. There's school spirit mostly during homecoming, which is during basketball season. But during the rest of the year it sucks, that's part of the college experience and FMU is lacking that. Intramural Sports, which consist of flag football, is fun. Anyone can sign up a team and compete until 2 teams are left for the championship. This is when all the students who use to play football in high school come out in full force. It's great but could be improved a bit. Sports overall could improve. Only the soccer team seems to get all it's funding (98% of them are from Argentina, live off campus, with full ride scholarships), not many students really go to the games since they are mainly off campus. We have a pool, rarely open. but no swim team, wish that could change."
College Sophomore,2,"It depends on where you are attending to stay. If you are staying in the older dorms (Goode. Robinson, Brown, Coleman) expect to possibly deal with mold, weird smells, spiders. Which usually comes with older buildings but the school fails to fix a lot of the issues. The old dorms have communal bathrooms which is a downside when it comes to privacy and convenience. If you are to stay in the new buildings they are good quality, a small kitchenette (no appliances, just cabinets, sink and mini fridge hook ups) and enough space for you to live in. Plus your own bathroom, that you will share with your roommate, in your room unlike the community dorms. The main difference between the two is the price though, so that's something to consider."
College Sophomore,2,"Florida Memorial University is a very diverse campus once you get to know the people. Many people will say ""oh it's just an hbcu, it's all black people"", but that's not neccessarily true. There are so many students from the islands and international countries. Also there are many students from up north. Personally some of my closest friends are from Chicago. I will say that the student body fails to recognize certain cultures or fully embrace the school in it at times, especially black history month. One challenge I see all the time is freshmen falling into the ""trying to fit in"" catagory. Many girls get caught up in all the biys and drama, and guys become very egotistical. But with time people begin to mature. Word of advice, just go into college knowing what you want, who you are, and stick to values/morals... and have fun!"
College Sophomore,2,You have different type of girls and guys here at Florida Memorial University. The friendly ones and the not so friendly ones. As a total I give them a C because the campus scene is not so friendly due to half of them being shy or scared to make new friends. But those who are gregarious and fun do not hesitate to make new friends and that is the crowd I fit in because I love to make new friends and people feel comfortable in new environments.
Recent Alumnus,2,I lived off campus and didn't make contact with security outside of showing my id each morning.
Recent Alumnus,2,"the drug scene is not visible. FMU is a no tolerance for drugs campus. Not saying its not there but if found, there is a stiff penalty."
College Sophomore,2,I do not really feel safe on my campus. I don't want to sound like I'm bashing but the school safety is terrible so many people who do not attend the school are always on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Public transportation for local commuting is reliable but limited at times. However, unlike other public transportation systems, bus transfers passes are not available and this has made the cost of transportation very expensive. To counteract this, commuter students living in Dade County are provided with a monthly pass at a cost of $50. These passes are made available through the Student Services division of the institution. Public transportation to students who live in cities outside Miami Dade is very limited and in some cases unavailable. Therefore, many are forced to drive to and from the school every day or forced to find alternative housing in the Miami-Dade area."
College Freshman,2,The food on campus isn't bad but it isn't all that good either.
College Freshman,2,There aren't many restaurants in the area that are walking distance. You may have to drive or catch a bus to get to a restaurant.
College Senior,2,The weather at Florida Memorial is unpredictable you don't know if its going to rain or not.
College Sophomore,2,its terrible...omg very law in quality.Needs serious improvements
College Junior,2,"if you ever decide to eat at FMU you want regret it everything is presentable, clean, and the food is pretty good, It's just you can't eat outside the cafeteia if you purchased your food from there."
College Junior,2,The security can be pretty strict about drugs and alcohol usage on campus. they have zero tolerance drugs poilcy. students found guilty of the possession or use of drugs and/or alcohol on campus will be suspended. a second offense carries a sanction of two semester suspension; and if anyone found guilty a third time will be expelled and not permitted to returns to the university. you have to be very discreet  on what you do on school ground.
College Junior,2,The school does provide transportation to big events like when Obama came to UM in FL and trips to the local walmart and movies but it is first come first serve with only two shuttle buses that's if your lucky.
College Sophomore,2,it was a big hassle trying to receive money and giving it to my school
Recent Alumnus,2,The drug safety on campus is ok but it could use major improvements. Some students smoke in the open without fearing any consequences by the authority figures. Stricter consequences and reinforcement need to be put into place to limit the amount of openly smoking of illegal drugs such as marijuana.
College Junior,2,"The best lab sure will have to be the Lehman building but since it has a insect problem it makes the best place the least place to go to. The library computers are either incredibly slow or not working making it difficult for students. Last but not least the printer, it picks the perfect time to either give out of paper, give out of ink or it is just screwed up."
College Sophomore,2,"Freshman Hall Dorms – Last Semester I was in one of the older Freshman Halls and it was not a pleasant experience.  We had a number of issues with the bathrooms, laundry rooms and several rooms had issues with mold. Experience was generally unpleasant."
College Sophomore,2,"The athletic center for students at Florida Memorial University could be much better and cleaner, it's an older school but it's about that time to build up a new gym. The student center is a bit compact but it's comfortable."
Sophomore,1,This university sucks there’s people hanging outside the dorms a 12:00 at night. The baseball team sucks and the basketball team sucks so no one goes to the games.
Senior,1,"Over the years of attending this university, my experiences were not satisfying for the most part. I majored in Biology and to think you'd have more hands on experiences, it is not like that at all. The class room sizes are small so you get to interact with professors but besides, all they do is read off Power Points the labs do not have equipment's to prepare you for your field. The students at time do not know what is going on especially when it impacts them. Overall I expected to have a better experience at this HBCU. I would not recommend this university."
College Freshman,1,Theres none offered by FMU but if you find some on your own you have to be sure to try and make sure you are in proximaty to campus.
College Freshman,1,theres nothing but fast food restaurants to choose from
College Sophomore,1,There are nothing but bad houses around and very few places for college students to stay that is near the school
College Sophomore,1,The worst food EVER . Our silver ware is always dirty
College Sophomore,1,"The school is placed in a very corrupt area , not really safe to go places on your own as a college student.  The nicer places are atleast an hour or 30 minutes away"
College Sophomore,1,Everyone one moves slow about getting things done for students
College Sophomore,1,no food places near by
College Freshman,1,I say our off-campus housing selection is worst because we don't have that opportunity. I wish we had the chance to pursue that as an option but we don't.
College Sophomore,1,If you want something that isn't fast food you have to take at least a 30 minute drive
College Sophomore,1,The computers are terribly slow and the labs are always to full for anyone to be able to function.
College Sophomore,1,There is no off-campus housing available. Of you want to live off campus you have to find your own house or apartment. And its miami so its not necessarily cheap. And if it is then its not necessarily safe.
College Sophomore,1,"Visitation in Dorms:

There are girl dorms and there are boy dorms. We are not allowed to visit different sexes rooms at all. If a boy/girl is caught in your room during a room-check tou will be fined $250. Honestly they need to fix this rule. I understand we are a Baptist University, but we are grown, treat us as so. Or another proposal is to have one dorm for specific upper classmen who can live in a co-ed environment responsibly."
College Student,1,"The wifi almost never works and the computers operate slow, and are for some strange reason always crowded. The printers give trouble now and then."
College Student,1,"I believe this is not the security's fault. Based on my observations, the students are pretty sneaky and they get their drugs in and out of campus really well."
College Student,1,"Honestly, I am from the Caribbean and I'm all alone in the U.S. it costs a lot of money to rent somewhere and due to the fact that I do not have sufficient funds, I have to move from place to place unexpectedly."
College Sophomore,1,i be having to owe the school too much money
College Sophomore,1,Off campus housing is very poor because of the area we are located in. It is very costly and not worth the money at all. 
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid process is such a headache at my school. Its almost like they don't want to help you get money instead they rather take!

Niche User,5,most of all the love the coach ! he is a great man and they are offering me the best deal right now thats why i like them.
Junior,5,"Being a off campus student, CCU is a good school. Comparing CCU to other colleges, you might not choose CCU if you're looking at the party life and social life. But academics is really a main focuses point at the school and how Christianity is very huge as well. I will be walking out of CCU with a better relationship with the lord as well as becoming a man. CCU has saved my life"
Niche User,5,"I loved when I went for a visit, everyone there was great. The coaches treated me like I was apart of their family."
Sophomore,5,"I like the community and the commitment to providing students with a solid christian education. I would like to see them find more ways to invest and save money, as well as a big overhaul of their dining services department."
Sophomore,5,It's a great school. Love the people and love little community the university is. Professors are very helpful during and after classes. You will have many opportunities to work on figuring you education with classes and with God. You are very warm welcomed right away and really easy to get to know people. I would suggest this college to everyone I come across.
Freshman,5,"I love CCU and the people there are enjoyable to be around, if I were to change one thing it would be the litter situation, but that's really it."
College Senior,5,"Cincinnati Christian University offers as good an education as any other Bible college within the Restoration Movement tradition.  We are blessed with great professors who are very personable and interested in the student's development beyond the classroom.  Although there may be occasional frustrations with administration, these issues are often resolved in a matter of days.  The current president is dedicated to improving the student experience, and there are exciting changes on the horizon as new athletic programs are being added and current degree programs are being expanded.  This school has a long history of producing some of the most influential Christian leaders in the world.  But what really sets CCU apart from other Bible colleges is its passion for the city of Cincinnati itself.  It ministers to a struggling community in Price Hill.  Many of the faculty are actively invested in the city, and students are encouraged to serve the community.  I am proud of this school because it takes advantage of the urban environment, something that many other schools cannot or do not do."
College Junior,5,"flex dollars can be used (off campus) at the closest skyline, chipotle, bloc head pizza, and a coffee shop! coffee shop on campus always has good drinks and a selection of sandwiches, wraps, salads, or frozen foods to eat any time of the day. Up to a certain $ amount can be considered a ""meal"" during lunch and dinner times but otherwise purchases just come off of flex dollars. dining hall (now called Student Union) has a lot of variety during lunch and dinner and is open longer than just meal times if you want to just hang out or play wii (located along a whole wall of the dining area)!"
College Junior,5,"off campus dining is pretty great now because we can use our student funds at the closet skyline, chipotle, a pizza place, and a coffee shop. not a huge variety right now but it just started so it's a great start! There is a coffee shop on campus so that is nice too if you don't want to go to the dining hall and have a whole meal. Campus is close to a main road that is several miles long and has a lot of options for types of food (in and out of chain restaurants)."
College Junior,5,The staff is very helpful and friendly. I had virtually no idea what I was doing and they were very happy to help explain processes and make sure I knew what I was doing/needed to do.
College Junior,5,I LOVE THIS SCHOOL!! The people make our school unique.
College Junior,5,The community! The community is the reason I love this school as much as I do and the reason I'm going to be happy to call CCU the school I finally graduate from in a couple years.
College Junior,5,"For a small private school, I really think they do a good job with student life on campus. They offer lots of activities and ways to get involved even though there are not many campus groups. The library is great!"
College Junior,5,Faculty is wonderful. Job opportunities come and go but are great!
College Freshman,5,This is a school where the people care about you and where the professors want the best for you.
College Freshman,5,"it is a big city, so you can find anything that you might be hungry for."
College Freshman,5,"There are a lot of different options, and the food is really good.  There is always something different and there is something for everyone."
College Freshman,5,"defiantly a great option, the dorms are one of the best places to make friends.  Everyone is really close."
College Freshman,5,The library and the computer lab have computers available for use and each undergrad student gets 400 prints a semester.
College Freshman,5,"The people who work in the financial aid office are the greatest, they want to help you."
College Freshman,5,We sign a contract when we choose to attend here that we will not drink or do any drugs including tobacco products. It is taken very seriously and we don't have hardly any issues with that on campus.
College Junior,5,It's a small campus. Students living in dorms don't need transportation because everything is very close together.
College Senior,5,The location. the location is absolutely breath taking. The school andthe School dorms over look the Beautiful Cincinnati area. Also the schools restaurant/cafe is a big success. I enjoy shopping and eating inside. the experience is always fulfilling
College Senior,5,"Whatever questions I have when I call the financial team, they're always kind, ready to answer my question to the best of their abilities, and extremely informative in all matters"
College Senior,5,"Cincinnati Christian College is a beautiful site. Everything about the school, from it's dorm to its facilities are excellent. I often say to myself that I 
would have loved to have come to this school following high school graduation."
College Sophomore,5,They have strict rules there is to be no drinking and drugs and they enforce it.
College Sophomore,5,"There is so much to do in Cincinnati museums, zoo, Cincinnati reds games."
College Sophomore,5,"It's an A+ for majors, as long as you intend to go into ministry (or related fields)."
College Sophomore,5,The classes are geared towards grading each individual student on his/her abilities.
Recent Alumnus,5,There are no drugs on campus. to my knowledge.  I am a non tradionational student  I do not live on campus.
Recent Alumnus,5,I enjoyed the CALL Program that the have for non traditional students. This program worked very well for me. My goal was to receive a Bachelor degree in order to go to Seminary. I would recommend this program for any non traditional student who wants to further their education.
College Sophomore,5,"No Drugs. at All. There is a very strict drug-and-alcohol policy here at the school. Upon registration, each student is required to sign a contract stating that he/she will not participate in such activities (at the risk of expulsion)."
College Sophomore,5,"Well-Maintained Safety – This is a very small campus atop a large hill, set away from the surrounding city. The campus police take their role very seriously, making frequent rounds and even getting to know the students personally."
College Sophomore,5,"Security is always at hand, and keep your door locked. Its a beautiful campus."
College Junior,5,Biblical Studies – The biblical studies major is the most useful at CCU. With this you can get a variety of jobs in churches and you really get a better feel of the Bible instead of just focusing on your future job.
College Junior,5,Our Professors are incredibly knowledgeable on the subjects that they teach. They obviously have had amazing schooling as well as plenty of research. We have some of the best theological minds in the world!
Freshman,4,"When I first walked on campus everyone was very welcoming. I really like the professors there, they're always willing to help. I have met some of the coaches fro different sports and they are really helpful when it came to needing to know where to go for certain things, campus visit. The food isn't always the best but there's always at least one option for you to eat if you can't find anything to eat. The school kind of reminds of a high school because it's not a big or medium sized college but small is good sometimes for everyone. I did learn that most students are apart of sports that attend the university and almost everyone never pays full price to go to school here. The dorms are kind of small but ideal. I love the diversity of the school and programs they put on to bring groups of people together. I wasn't a huge ""go to church person"" but their church is different and makes it more fun and interesting to go to."
Freshman,4,"I love how we are all willing to come together on one campus with different backgrounds but not letting that interfere in the journey we have before us as far as God, school, and maybe sports. Small campus means more fellowship and that just rocks"
Freshman,4,"I Like the fact that Cincinnatti Christian University really cares about their student, it's in a very clean and quiet area. The dorms are nice and the faculity is great. I feel that with the mentorship their that is  provided will help me in exceeding my goals."
Junior,4,"My experience with Cincinnati Christian University has been a pleasant one overall. The education that you will receive is a quality education and the professors are nothing but caring and supportive. Campus life creates many different opportunities for the student body to be engaged with each other and have a fun time on campus. Worship services are always an enjoyable experience to be filled with God and listen to his words. The one down side to campus is the dorms and food. The dorms themselves are normal dorms and have nothing wrong with them, but being a christian university prevents students from being able to openly listen to music or watch movies that have profanity. There is also the food which is below average tasting and there are some variety that can be had, but there are only so many options that one dining hall can provide. It is easy to predict what you will be eating from week to week which can become unfortunate."
Senior,4,"CCU is a great University for people of any faith. In addition to the core theology/bible classes, CCU is an accredited University and they offer multiple programs for students to major in such as Psychology, Organizational Leadership and Business Management to name a few.
The school has been historically conservative and was founded during the Restoration Movement however, they are taking steps and have made strides in becoming less conservative and more open to the idea of people from different backgrounds. 
Most notable for me, the professors and the faculty are more than willing to extend grace if you ask."
College Freshman,4,My professors are cool and they are down to earth people who try to help me grow in and out the classroom.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of opportunities available for students who are looking for a job on campus and for everything else a student may need .
College Freshman,4,I feel pretty safe on campus I don't feel threatened by the neighborhood were in at all.
College Freshman,4,Life here at CCU is great. There is nothing better than the view of the city available to us.
College Freshman,4,Athletics here at CCU are good and get better as the days go by!
College Freshman,4,I love the atmosphere at CCU I wouldn't want to be anywhere else !
College Freshman,4,It is a very welcoming school that will help you grow in your faith.
College Freshman,4,I would evaluate the classes as appropriate student to professor ratio because it has a personal atmosphere. The quality of each course is additionally outstanding including the varietype of courses offered.
College Freshman,4,Career prospects look outstanding from graduation at CCU. I know several CCU alumni who are all in the career of their choice after graduation. CCU also does a remarkable job at placing students in internships and giving students opportunitit's to get hands on experience in the field of their choice.
College Freshman,4,"The health and safety on campus is outstanding. CCU is located in a rough area, therefore, security is always in easy access and communication. Their patrols also make me feel safe and secure, especially with their regularity and frequency of patrols. I would rate CCU's private security and involvement with the police as on eof the best."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, my experience at school has been outstanding. I can clearly see that all the staff and many of the students are eager to serve and assist you in any way they can. The teaching church program, a clinical internship with ministers partnered with CCU sets this school apparently from others. Some issues however would be the recent changes in the schools values and sevice curriculum, as I am afraid of the doctrine becoming watered down or trying to be tailored to one's pleasure. This does not reflect that Christ is absent from CCU however. Christ is at work here to bring glory in our fallen world today."
College Sophomore,4,"Great small school, like all schools there could be some things that are done better, but students, professors and faculty are friendly."
College Freshman,4,The choices on what to eat off campus is really good because of the way you can use your school ID for paying off campus. Flex dollars are really cool
College Freshman,4,Everyone in the school comes to the parties in the gymnasium to win prizes and to play games that be quite interesting. Plus the peers their are quite interesting when they began to show good sportsmanship while playing sports
College Freshman,4,The dining hall has great food due to person who makes it  and the quality that makes the food even rich.
College Freshman,4,The best part of living on campus is having new friends around and to see the views of people that enjoy seeing you around. The dorms are really nice and the activities that people do as a floor to build a lot of bond between others.
College Sophomore,4,"I like it a lot. There are a lot of online classes I have to take, which is fine by me since it helps me maintain my crazy life a little better. The classes are small enough that I start to know everyone by the first couple of weeks, and then I continue to have the same people in the rest of my classes. The professors themselves are interested in making sure that the students understand the importance of integrating Christian values into the workplace, which is unique and exciting."
College Sophomore,4,"They don't want us going out and getting drunk or high, which is a great thing about this school. They also provide ways for the students to do things on-campus with each other. They are very strict about curfew, substance abuse, and getting stricter about dress code."
College Junior,4,There are a lot of places to go off-campus since we are in Cincinnati. Many options.
College Junior,4,I enjoy the psychology program at CCU. The work load can get pretty heavy especially when you add in your bible and theology classes but it's manageable.
College Junior,4,I enjoy the classes and the professors in my degree program. They make it easy to see that this is the right program for me.
College Junior,4,I have been to three other universities and I have to say that this school ranks number one out of the four. The professors work with you and they are very good at what they do. I'm happy with CCU academically.
College Junior,4,"Very diverse, but very accepting"
College Freshman,4,Campus security are there and they know everybody and are willing to help when needed.
College Freshman,4,"Snow in the winter, rain in the spring. There are all four seasons here."
College Freshman,4,"There is baseball, football, aquariums, and museums to go to- there is something for everyone."
College Freshman,4,"Campus life is fun and friendly.  Everyone knows everyone, and care about everyone."
College Sophomore,4,Everyone gets along with everyone. 
College Sophomore,4,There are no drugs or drinking on campus.
College Sophomore,4,The Education program was very good. 
College Freshman,4,I love the education program at my school. The professors are great and genuinely interested in you.
College Freshman,4,There aren't many majors offered here but the ones we have are very well done.
College Freshman,4,"I love the education program here, the professors are great and make class interesting and exciting."
College Freshman,4,"No off campus parking. One lot for girls, one for boys, and one extra lot for professors and other people on campus."
College Junior,4,"I get tired of the food sometimes, but it's no better or worse than other Christian schools this size. I'm a commuter anyway, so I buy my own food."
Niche User,2,"I attende CCU as a bridges (dual-enrollment) student. My mother is an alumni of CCU and worked there as a piano professor. Three generations of my family have been through CCU, but recently things have changed. Its not as challenging (academically) as it once was and it has taken focus off of Christianity."
Junior,2,So far Cincinnati Christian is a decent college I like the campus & the students & professors are nice. Overall I wish it was bigger and more people. I think with the size it shouldn't be that expensive. I also dislike the food which I think should be better considering the amount they charge on it
College Freshman,2,We don't have the required sports facilities for all the sports offered.
College Junior,2,one extreme to the next
College Sophomore,2,There is not much to do on campus. 
College Sophomore,2,"The food is not very good, cold and no options. "
College Sophomore,2,Not very many degree options. 
College Freshman,2,"We are in Cincinnati which has plenty to do, but we aren't allowed to do much. "
College Freshman,2,Nobody really goes to many games and we don't have any intramural sports.
College Freshman,2,"There is a computer lab that is almost always open and always has open computers, plus the computers in the library when it is open. Wifi is really bad on campus and you have to buy a router for your dorm."
College Freshman,2,"Going to a christian school, we are not permitted to go to any clubs or anywhere that their main source of income is alcohol. So that limits what we can do for nightlife."
College Freshman,2,Good education but very small and not much to do.
College Junior,2,"CCU is a private christian college so there are strict rules and will get you kicked out if they catch you. There is no open drinking or drug use on campus and no smoking anywhere on campus. The dorms are strictly men's dorm and women's dorm and no one of the opposite sex can just visit. You can not live off campus unless you live with your parents, are a senior, or older than 23. If they find out that that a girl is living with her boyfriend even if she meets one of these, she will get kicked out."
College Junior,2,"There really isn't that many sports here at CCU. We do have basketball for men, volleyball for woman, and soccer for both. The teams do okay but many people don't follow the sports. There is a lot of resentment towards the athletes because they get scholarships to go to a christian school and a lot of them do not care to be at a christian school."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus itself is beautiful and private, sitting atop a very large hill away from the surrounding neighborhood. The neighborhood itself, however, isn't the best place to roam (especially at night)."
College Junior,2,"The restaurants are mostly fast food options, and generally give us no student discount. However it's not bad food and the cost is not too bad either"
College Junior,2,Cincinnati Christian University's campus is not very large. It is a small campus located in Price Hill. There are two things though that separate the campus from many other. First is the amazing view of Cincinnati. This is a great city that many of us from the school are privileged to work of volunteer in. The second thing would be the community on campus. With it being such a small campus and Christ-centered you really gain a lot of unity and friendships.
Freshman,1,"Although i have met interesting people the school was poorly taken care of, the staff was extremely rude and they did not handle money professionally."
Freshman,1,"This is not the place to be. The school is very neat, but the people are not. The staff and faculty who run the school have problems they need to overcome very soon. There needs to be more things for kids to do . Its college !"
College Freshman,1,really don't talk about Greek.
College Sophomore,1,"We Don't Exactly Have a Greek Community – Being a Christian school, there are no sadly no Greek communities allowed on campus."
College Junior,1,"Computer Issues – Many of the computers on campus don't work, and some aren't hooked up to printers, and on some the internet doesn't work, but this isn't specified at all until you log on and realize that it doesn't work, wasting a lot of time when you are trying to print something.  Also, the internet and school website periodically go down and aren't usable, including Moodle, on which there are time quizzes/test/assignments."

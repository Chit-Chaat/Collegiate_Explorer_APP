Freshman,5,"Online learning is usually hard for me as I tend to focus better with someone directly in front of me, but this has gone surprisingly easy and almost fun for me."
Freshman,5,I adore this school. The environment is always lively and people are incredibly friendly here. Whenever I need help or feel unsure of myself there is always someone to talk to. The campus overall is very clean and does everything possible to keep it that way. There are many programs to join or just activities to join and spend time with other people.
Junior,5,I love my school. It is very diverse and promotes positive values overall. There are many opportunities to get involved and stay connected.
Freshman,5,"Very good college. Professors reach out to students in these harsh times, which is very appreciated and shows they truly do care. The apps to turn work in work just perfect, and works can be completed on mobile as well except for tests and quizzes, which is understandable due to the apps not being the best for those. Variety of clubs and sports as well."
Freshman,5,"The professors are very nice and flexible as well. They reach out to congratulate on good grades as well as to check up on fellow students, it really shows they are devoted and caring. The apps are simple and easy to use as well."
Freshman,5,"SO far my college experience has been great. Half classes in person, half online. Professors have been great!"
Freshman,5,Technology has been very good. No issues and easy to use. Professors have been working hard to keep the classes interesting and engaging.
Junior,5,"The online learning is great because it is flexible with my schedule. It is challenging but doable. The professors constantly try to stay in touch and are always there if you need them, however the online canvas is very easy to use!"
Junior,5,"I am a full online student. I feel that although I don't see my professors in person, they still find a way to make a personal connection with me and are always open to tending to all my needs. The classes are challenging but enjoyable! I love UNT! Go mean green!"
Freshman,5,"I’m a music major at UNT, and the experience of a music major is very different from the usual UNT student. Facilities on campus definitely need some work (the art buildings and business buildings are more updated than music/practice buildings). Still, my experience in the college of music has been wonderful! Though it is not perfect, the students and faculty are constantly working hard to make it so. The music academic classes are challenging, but worth it in the end. UNT’s College of Music is known as one of the top music schools in the nation for a reason."
Freshman,5,"Yes, but I suspect they would be great. I am currently enrolled to take online classes in the fall due to COVID-19. So far, my experience as a student that is trying to chose the proper classes for my major has been very easy. Even though the school closing down was a sudden unfortunate decision, the staff and administrators have done an excellent job at helping student feel supported and comfortable during the transition to online classes. If my classes are going to be anything like the transition to online classes, I’m certain that this semester will go by just as smooth as the rest."
Sophomore,5,"I love how inclusive the campus is. From different ethnic backgrounds to a broad range of majors and student clubs/organizations, anyone can find a place at UNT. The campus is very beautiful with over 2,000 trees."
Sophomore,5,"During the second half of my second semester, UNT switched to all online classes. UNT handled the transition quickly and smoothly. As off fall of 2020, most classes are still online with assignment and classes going through canvas and zoom."
Junior,5,"I have yet to take online, will be my first semester and I am beyond exited. Already had professors contact me informing us of their plans and goals fur us."

If my classes are going to be anything like the transition to online classes, I’m certain that this semester will go by just as smooth as the rest."
Sophomore,5,"Just from simply touring the campus, I feel in love with the college. I loved how broad their majors are, making it an all inclusive school. Something that was very important to me was the fact that they had over 100 clubs, teams, and sororities that I could chose from. The fact that the school celebrates the different cultures and backgrounds was something that I value very much ."
Sophomore,5,I had one class online before the switch to all online learning spring semester 2020. Each professor made the transition so seamless and helped everyone through it.
Junior,5,"I am a first year transfer student at this school and am loving it. I never thought I would have the opportunity to go to UNT, but the time has now come. I am very excited to be where I am."

Senior,5,I just completed my transfer student virtual orientation and it was amazing! The UNT resources were so informative and helpful! I am looking forward to attending UNT in the fall to complete my degree!

Sophomore,5,So far after two semesters at UNT I have really enjoyed my experience. I love the diverse student life and the wonderful hidden spots scattered throughout campus. I even love catching glimpses of Lucky the unofficial UNT mascot and albino squirrel that you can sometimes find in a tree somewhere. I would definitely recommend looking at rate my professor before choosing classes. Some professors are much better than others and can make or break a class.
Junior,5,The classes were very easy online. The professors were helpful if you had any doubts and understanding if there was technical issues.
Junior,5,Overall it has a very inclusive environment and the students and staff there are very helpful. The campus is very nice and the classes have good professors.
Freshman,5,I enjoy the kind of communication I've gotten from the staff. When I'm confused about something I can always contact someone and get a good and quick response.
Junior,5,"Overall, my experience at University of North Texas has been outstanding. In all honestly, UNT was not my first choice when applying for colleges, but the distance wasn't too far from my hometown and I didn't have to start all over in a new city trying to find a job, meet a new crowd of people, and I was still able to see my family whenever I wanted. After moving to Denton and being on campus all the time, I realized there were a bunch of extracurricular activities and events  that happened almost everyday. On top of that, I have met some really great people who I am glad to call my friends, and it wouldn't be possible to have these people in my life if it wasn't for going to University of north Texas."
Sophomore,5,"I have taken four online courses and each was very accommodating and easy to handle. The professors encourage you to reach out if there are problems and are easy to work with. They respond quickly to questions as well. As for the course material, It's not very different from in class courses so it doesn't feel like your missing out on important learning material. I'd say you actually get more from it since it usually requires more reading. Overall a good experience."
Sophomore,5,"Really good school! Everyone was very polite and helpful. There were constant activities and programs for students. Great teachers and courses. Transportation, food, and housing options were abundant."
Sophomore,5,"The few classes I've taken online all went by smoothly and provided a lot of help away from in person courses. Coming from a person like myself who is a visual learner, i find it very helpful when the professors and the website provide very detailed and specific instructions to help me learn better."
Sophomore,5,"The University offers a variety of opportunities to every student. On everyday, North Texas provides dozens of events for all students to enjoy and get an experience of what college life feels like. The University makes everyone feel at home while away from home and that's important."
Junior,5,"I recently transferred, so the scope of my possible criticisms is as limited as my possible adulations. That being said, their approach to advising, and transferring has been seamless. I might be new to the school, but in no way have they failed in making me feel, like I made the right decision choosing to continue my education there."

Graduate Student,5,North Texas is an open minded community with amazing professors! This University fully prepares you to go into the workforce.
Freshman,5,Amazing  people and there is a great amount of resources available. No matter what major you are there is going to be great opportunities for you whether that be internships or networking with people.
Freshman,5,"Before the pandemic, for my second semester of my freshman year, I was already taking online classes. For me, online classes are way easier, and the professors there really help you and make sure you understand what’s going on."
Freshman,5,I'm sure it's great but I haven't been able to experience it myself yet. Mostlikey will have to because of Covid-19. But cannot wait to see how it goes!
Junior,5,I really enjoy the atmosphere that the University of North Texas has to offer.  It is a very diverse college which I really like.  Everyone is welcoming and very friendly.  Wouldn't want to be at any other college. Go Mean Green!!
Junior,5,I personally did not take any online courses at UNT but I have quite a few friends that did and they absolutely loved it.  Professors were pretty good about grading assignments in a timely manner.  The lectures were pretty straight forward and if you didn't understand something they would help you get a better understanding by elaborating on the topic or by explaining it differently.
Freshman,5,The professors did their best to accommodate the online learning experience. It was something new due to COVID-19 that presented a learning curve for everyone.
Freshman,5,"The professors are extremely willing to take on undergraduate and TAMS (Texas Academy of Math and Science) students. The research conducted is ground breaking and leads to innovation everyday; not surprising, seeing that UNT is a tier 1 research school."
Alum,5,"I loved the campus, the diversity, the town! Most of my courses and work encouraged and challenged growth."
Junior,5,"Online was great and very user friendly.
They recently changed software which made it easier to navigate through the site."
Junior,5,Great school and still growing with additional buildings and studies. The school is in a great location and great walking distance for those who live close.
Sophomore,5,My Experience at UNT has been amazing to be honest with you all its very diversity the atmosphere on campus is amazing. The teachers really care about use being successful in there class but also outside of school as well.
Niche User,5,"Just a few classes online. Luckily, my professors this semester were very flexible and my grades skyrocketed since I could spend much more time working diligently on classwork."
Alum,5,"It was wonderful. I love Denton. The new football stadium is great, the business building is state of the art. wonderful experience"
Alum,5,I loved the campus experience. Very safe and comfortable feeling. all buildings easy to walk too. Were in the process of upgrading everything when I was graduating.
Sophomore,5,The University of North Texas adapted to the online venue very well. The professors were very understanding of the transition and the process went smoothly.
Senior,5,I’ve loved my time at UNT. All my professors have pushed me and helped me find what I want to do and how to achieve them.
Sophomore,5,"It’s amazing to see the amount of diversity on campus, as well as the numerous organizations that allow for inclusivity while promoting personal growth/educational growth/etc. The sense of community on campus really creates a feeling of belonging, and being able to participate in so many school spirit activities is incredible. Personally, being a part of the art department is a large reason of why I chose UNT, there are so many options for different careers in art and I feel as if the academics are adequately preparing me not just for my future career, but with building various skills that can be applied in numerous aspects of life going forward."
Sophomore,5,"Such a good university. Beautiful and diverse campus, and very nice and accepting people. Everyone I know who transferred here agrees that this University is better than their previous. Best decision ever."
Freshman,5,Very nice social atmosphere and plenty of opportunities for me to pay for college without having any loans.
Graduate Student,5,"I have completed my Bachelor degree and chose to pursue an MBA at UNT. My experience has been tremendous. I would do it all over again if given the opportunity. The staff and faculty truly care about their students, and the community of the campus is felt even now as we interact remotely. There has never been a question that I could not get answered. When asking someone who did not know they did not defer my question to someone else, rather they took the time to do the research and provide me answers and solutions. During the time of COVID-19 UNT has truly stepped up their resources online and chose to keep their residence halls open. They did this while other schools closed because they recognized some students have no other options if forced to move out during the semester. I feel UNT truly cares and goes above and behind for their community!"
Junior,5,"I was surprised by the acceptance and encouragement of diversity on campus. I love the many opportunities to get involved and make a difference in the community surrounding campus, and issues at large. My professors have been, on average, understanding, and informative. Topics of interests are taught and feedback outlets are widely available. There are sources for mental health care as well as general health and counseling. The gym facilities are vast and a variety of classes are offered. I appreciate the ""Mean Green"" nature of facilities on campus to reduce environmental impact and most importantly to me, a fully vegan cafeteria on campus. I spend a lot of my time there in the calming atmosphere and love nutritious options to fuel my studying efforts. I've made amazing friends and found comfort in the Denton community. Thankful for all the time I've spent with friends who love and accept me and support social justice as I do. I cannot imagine getting an education from anywhere else!"
Junior,5,The University of North Texas gave me the chance to pursue my career even when I felt like I wasn't deserving of a second chance
Graduate Student,5,The master of science in counseling program is holistic and very well taught. Faculty as well as services offered exceed CACREP standards and will adequately prepare most student to become well informed counselors.
Freshman,5,"I loved the campus when I first saw it. When I first visited the campus, I saw so much diversity and a variety of different people. I felt comfortable and safe being here. Many others will love it here too!"
Sophomore,5,I am a transfer and all of the faculty are all very welcoming. The school is very modern and has great technology and opportunity!
Sophomore,4,I love the community of people that it brings together. It's a great place to further my education as well as making memories and new friends along the way.
Sophomore,4,The instructors I had were very patient with us during zoom calls. They answered any question as best they could. They also gave lots of resources to help us learn the material at our own pace.
Junior,4,"Online classes have been overall achievable for me. My professors have been understanding about deadlines and give clear instructions regarding due dates and expectations. I like that most of my classes allow me to access the material at any time, rather than requiring me to log in at a specific time each day. I think that I am lucky to be succeeding at school during such a difficult season for many people. This is likely due to the fact that I'm already an independent learner who is very self-motivated and organized. I have been able to schedule my time accordingly also offers a lot of resources to help with online learning, like the tutoring center. My school has done a great job of helping students stay focused. I like that we have a lot of non-academic events available online to take a break from studying and remain connected to other students while we are away from campus. I know not everyone feels the same as I do and other professors have been less accomdiating."
Junior,4,Most professors have done a great job moving to zoom and online work.  They're overall very understanding and flexible with a few exceptions or moments where professors had difficulty figuring out canvas.
Junior,4,I'm happy to be going to UNT and overall enjoy it.  I gave it 4 stars because like any other university it has its flaws.  Filling this out I'm considering ratings before 2020 pandemic times more than the current state we're in.
Sophomore,4,North Texas is a large school but still focuses on individuals. It is also one of the most diverse campuses in Texas.
Sophomore,4,I like the school because they are very vocal about wanting to make sure their students succeed. There are also so many organizations and flyers all around campus so it is impossible to not get involved if you live on campus. I did not like the area outside of the campus but I felt safer being on campus. The food is also one of the best things about this school.
Junior,4,I love how open they are with their students. Never make you feel dumb or incompetent. I love the diversity
Sophomore,4,"Most teachers used an online platform and didnt do lectures, even through zoom. Some teachers were not flexible with makeup work because of it being online."
Sophomore,4,"Nice teachers and caring staff, the financial aid office lags on giving out information however and on letting you know the status of your financial aid."
Freshman,4,"Its been a really positive experience at campus and my dorm, everyone is really nice and the food is great!"
Sophomore,4,"Transferring to this school was the best decision. They are so welcoming and made the process quick and easy. The students and campus atmosphere make this school such a positive place, not to mention the professors truly care about their students."
Sophomore,4,"It is a very relaxed environment, the scenery is nice, and the faculty are generally very nice. I like the spacious campus and the various places you can go on and near the campus."
Sophomore,4,"I have taken online classes with North Texas and it has always been very straight-forward and easy to keep up with. The professors generally don't overwhelm the students but in some cases, the assignments can feel stacked one on top of the other depending on the professor. Overall, it is a good experience and I will be doing online classes this coming Fall."
Freshman,4,I have not taken any online courses so I am personally not sure what the experience is like to take online.
Junior,4,"As a music major, I can't speak well to the quality of the rest of the school, but so far I'm happy with my experience. Sure, there's a lot of stuff I can complain about (a dire need for updating the facilities, a big communication gap between admin and students due to the ridiculously large number of music students, etc), but overall I'm very happy with my experience. I've learned a ton and I've had a lot of great professors. I especially love the culture, it's such a dynamic environment to become my professional self. There's just something special about UNT's college of music that's hard to pin down; I feel very lucky to attend this school."
Junior,4,"Due to COVID-19 and having to create all classes to become virtual last semester, I have to give it up for my professors because before Spring Break, we were all going to our classes and doing hands on activities for our lessons, and just like that, we were forced to go all online for classes. My professors made the transitioning much more comforting and welcoming by sending emails every week checking in on all there students, letting us know how their home life is going with the whole transition create a bond with us, and just overall understanding that life happens and letting us know that we're not alone in this pandemic. My professors were able to quickly switch around their whole lesson plans for the rest of the semester to make it more accessible online and explained to us that as upcoming teachers, you need to be ready for any curve balls the world throws at us and have alternative modifications for your lessons because our focus is to make students successful no matter what."
Senior,4,I enjoyed my online classes overall. I only had one during the covid transition in the spring where my professor tried his absolute hardest to make the class hard.
Sophomore,4,"I like the campus and environment so far. However, in my first year at the university, the President hasn't supported minority communities when they faced hatred from on of UNT's organizations."
Freshman,4,"So far with my experience of the school is very nice. The staff is helpful to you and the things you need to get done. They aren't good on timing though, like knowing the prices that need to be paid for housing, classes and etc because we like to need to save up the money for it. But other than that, they have a good detailed orientation to get a good outlook on the school and the campus is very big and has a lot of programs for you to participate in, along with clubs, sports, events, and etc."
Senior,4,"Online classes vary based on the teacher and if they are comfortable teaching online. Some classes are better in person than online, mostly math-based business courses."
Senior,4,UNT is continuously updating their buildings & degrees. Parking is better now with multiple garages and more on-campus parking to help the commuters. Great campus to walk around any time of day.
Graduate Student,4,My online experience went really well. The professors are always willing to help and answer emails promptly.
Niche User,4,I did not take any classes online but I heard they are easy and not hard to follow instructions on. I am a transfer student I will be attending in the spring of 2021 and I will probably be taking a couple of online classes there and I am excited.
Niche User,4,I liked how diverse the university is everyone is very nice and welcoming and just a good vibe. The campus is very nice and also their are so many restaurants and stores around the campus finding a job or a place to get food is easy.
Freshman,4,With the Covid-19 crisis among us I will be taking online classes this upcoming year. So I have no experience as of yet with online courses.
Senior,4,"It’s a pretty good school. Economical, great instructions, fun activity... etc My only issue is the Transportation office. Parking sucks and they are in it to make money off students. Price of parking passes is outrageous and they ticket like crazy..."
Freshman,4,"Seems like a beautiful campus from a far, I haven't been able to actually go see for myself due to covid-19. But I'm very excited for my time to come at this university!"
Senior,4,The online teaching was handled well. The professors were very accommodating with online homework   .
Junior,4,"Online learning is usually very easy when the class was made to be online. I do take mostly music courses at UNT, though. I think at any university, students will find it naturally hard to adjust to classes held on video chatting platforms. I have this problem, but I do not think it’s the fault of UNT."
Junior,4,"I’m a music major at UNT, and the experience of a music major is very different from the usual UNT student. Facilities on campus definitely need some work (the art buildings and business buildings are more updated than music/practice buildings). Still, my experience in the college of music has been wonderful! Though it is not perfect, the students and faculty are constantly working hard to make it so. The music academic classes are challenging, but worth it in the end. UNT’s College of Music is known as one of the top music schools in the nation for a reason."
Junior,4,"I love the inclusion and support you can find from almost everyone on campus. They allow you to have your own opinions without ""shoving it down your throat"". This is only my first year here after transferring from a private religious college, and I enjoy how I don't have to be pressured into following a certain religion or beliefs to be considered a part of the community."
Junior,4,"I only took one online course, and aside from the laziness I experience at the beginning, the professor and the assistant made it very easy to follow along. I suggest online classes, especially if you need a more open work schedule or more time to do other things"
Alum,4,"I didn't take any online classes, but many of my classes used the online platform, Blackboard was it?, that was usually easy to navigate."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is fairly small and compact which is easy to get around. Because the campus is mainly a computer campus, the weekends are very quiet."
Sophomore,4,"When my classes switched online, some of my professors continued to have virtual lectures, while some chose to only assign work and not have a lecture."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, the University of North Texas is a pretty good campus for students who desire to pursue their goals. UNT provides tutors off and online tutors and group lectures for students who need help. If you don't have a dedication to study at UNT, you will most likely waste your time and money. Just personal thoughts."
Niche User,4,"I very much enjoyed my visit and I am very excited to attend in the fall! One thing I wish was it would be kept a little bit cleaner! I understand there are a lot of students and it is by no means repulsing, but a good amount of litter is present throughout the campus. I would love to organize a group or club  to assist with cleanup!"
Freshman,4,"I had to take online classes due to coronavirus.  Although this was a difficult process, the professors and school make it possible.  Their dedication to their students allowed for us to continue our classes using zoom meetings and online web assignments.  Additionally, the professors made sure that they were able to accommodate their students based on their situation.  If you email a professor with an issue or a predicament, they will do the best they can to help you, not only educationally, but in every other way with the resources that they have.  The zoom meetings were helpful and if you missed it, most professors posted the recording of the lecture on canvas.  Overall, it was a great experience."
Freshman,4,"The University of North Texas is a high-quality school.  They ensure your success by providing a plethora of resources on various things any college student would have a question about.  Moreover, they include many clubs and student organizations that can interest a student.  This makes them welcomed to the Mean Green community and provides them with life-long friendships.  The build of the school is well-constructed because everything is within a reasonable range to everything else.  It is easy to walk around campus and make it where you need to go.  However, although the cafeterias are not terrible, they could use some improvement in that sometimes they serve the same foods over and over again.  Once again, it's not terrible but can be annoying.  Also, they are constantly working to make the university better whether it be through the education system, the aesthetic of the buildings, or providing entertainment for the students.  They truly do make sure that everyone is welcome."
Freshman,4,"The University of North Texas does a great job of welcoming new students into the school.  They excel at making the college experience feel exciting and rich with the opportunity of learning. It was fun to participate in all the events they held for incoming freshmen such as movie nights and silent disco parties before the semester started. What I loved the most about UNT is the excellent learning core that each start must participate in before starting their degree-specific studies. I was very impressed with the level of education presented in political science, history, and English. I remember thinking to myself that I was getting a great return on my investment in college and especially and UNT. On top of that, UNT offers a great environment for social interaction at the many dining halls and libraries. My personal favorite is the Syndicate located in the Union where you can grab a taco from Fuzzy's and play some video games on the second level with friends."
Sophomore,4,"The faculty at the University of North Texas is amazing. I love working with my professors to help further my education. However, some of the construction does get annoying."
Senior,4,"Being a foreign language major, it was difficult To make the switch and keep practicing in the target language but I think my professors handled it as best they could"
Sophomore,4,"My experience at UNT has been great, I completed my first year just the other day and definitely recommend attending this college to all of my friends. It is a green campus, and the people here are amazing. I will be completing my bachelor's degree in the next 3 years in Criminal Justice."
Sophomore,4,UNT is a very fun diverse school. I am a BA Biology major and the professors for STEM classes are excellent. UNT is known for having some of the best campus food in the U.S..
Sophomore,4,"UNT provides a well rounded college experience! From extracurriculars, local eats, research opportunities UNT has a lot to offer."
Sophomore,4,"The staff is very friendly and informative. The professor is knowledgeable and are there when you need them, or they will point you in the direction of someone who can."
Junior,4,"The school itself is nice. Some programs are small so you can get that one-on-one education that you can't get at any other big public university. The administration needs some work done, they are more money hungry than compared to other schools. The academics are nice and the athletic community is nice."
Sophomore,4,Great school so far. Transfer program was very helpful and sweet. Everyone is so nice and welcoming and the clubs are amazing and very open to new faces. Everyone is so inclusive here and it is an absolute dream.
Freshman,4,"I love UNT so much, and it has truly become my home. The campus is amazing, as are the amenities and staff. The only reason I cannot give UNT 5 stars is because of the difficultly I've had with the financial aid department. Other than that my experience has been amazing and I can't wait to continue my education with the University of North Texas."
Sophomore,4,"I like how the campus is very bike friendly, the professors are there to help and there are many opportunities to go to tutoring and office hours and such, the food it alright, the union provides many fast food places to go to as well as a school funded cafeteria for students to buy food at. I haven't been to school games but I've heard it is fun. Overall, the school is nice. It is also diverse."
Freshman,4,"The people at the University of North Texas have been very welcoming and helpful to first-year students. The transition from home to living on campus was very smooth. There are always fun events happening on campus and there is always somewhere on campus where free snacks are being given. UNT has a variety of programs from which students can choose to participate in and no one ever has to feel left out. Additionally, the academic advisors are always there when students need them and if they don't have the answer to a question then they direct us to someone who ca help us."
Freshman,4,"The university provides a lot of opportunities to give out free food, whether that be in the dorm halls or at the Union. The food there is really good and each of the dorm cafeterias make different meals and have a variety of choices to pick from. The university also holds a lot of events ranging from helping students with managing their money and how to get a job on campus to small musical concerts which typically take place near the union or in the dorm cafeterias. The university provides many opportunities for tutoring, however, they can be difficult to attend when being a full-time student and a part-time worker."
Niche User,4,It really seems like a school that would be good for people that want to go into STEM majors like someone such as myself. I do believe that its engineering campus is something that is good for those who like to be in engineering and that whole business. Pretty cool.
Freshman,4,"The environment is great, there's a lot of diversity and there is always something to do on campus. There are great cafeterias and restaurants to choose from when you're feeling hungry after a class. The UNT Union always hosts events for students all around campus to participate in, and sometimes there's even free food! There are great study places all through out campus including the famous Willis library."
Freshman,4,"it's a very accepting environment and has a real sense of community. Also, it is very easy to get in they accept most people. the schools know for their music programs so that's where most of the money goes to."
Junior,4,"The application process was well explained, meeting with advisors is a hit or miss. I've had both good and bad advising sessions on what next steps I need to take in the upcoming years."
Niche User,4,"University of North Texas is a great party school, but if you really study for your academics then you'll do just fine!"
Freshman,4,I love the student life and living on campus it is pretty quiet. Filled with very friendly people who are outgoing and helpful. Amazing professors who want to see you succeed and have great variety of class sizes. I would like to see a change in cafe experience I would like more food options and different daily menus with better quality of food.
Senior,4,I really have enjoyed my time at the University of North Texas! My time here has been rather enjoyable and I encourage those interested to apply!
Senior,2,"Particularly within the College of Visual Arts and Sciences, the program leans heavily on traditional thoughts about art. The programs are outdated, given the current trend toward Digital Art methods. I would like to see more investment in the Digital Fabrication Lab, a resource which could be the center for a Major in and of itself."
Alum,2,Professors don't care about whether or not you learned something from them but only the student's only.
Sophomore,2,"For the first like 3 months of registration, though I was enrolled and all of my required paperwork was submitted, I was unable to enroll online. I contacted many administrators and IT to help me resolve the issue and no one could help. I lost a lot of registration time. At some point the issue resolved itself."
Senior,2,I’m a stem major so my experience doesn’t reflect the whole school but learning stem online sucks no matter how good the professor is
Sophomore,2,i took a few classes on online and that was my first time taking online classes so it was different for me because im use to face to face classes so it was totally different for me.
Junior,2,Some my online professor take forever to responded email. The psychology professor I had never responded my email and she was ignore my email or whenever I have questions.
Junior,2,"The majority of the Professors are great, however, being it a large school,  the student to professor ratio 200/1. The class itself is good obviously you have to put in the work to get your grade. What I don't like about it is there are over 100 students in a class and professors really don't have time to answer everyone's questions or emails so sometimes it's hard to get ahold of your professor. The number one bad thing is that registering for courses is extremely hard they fill up fast even if you register on the days you are assigned to.  also, another big issue is Seeing an academic counselor. trying to make an appointment or seeing academic counselor is nearly impossible. sometimes you have to wait over 30 days to even book an appointment."
Junior,2,More opportunities for college of science. More financial aid. less consteuction. For the dorms to be cheaper. needs improvement for physics department. Campus food needs to be more diverse and more authentic
Alum,2,"There are some really amazing people who make this place bearable, otherwise it's sort of a construction zone that offers classes and is run by a corrupt administration that shuts-down critics with retaliatory abuses of power. They also control the SGA like puppets, which is rather convenient. 

I'd give this place -3 / 5 stars (yes, that's NEGATIVE THREE out of five), but some of the people who work here really help them earn 5 stars, for a total of 2/5 stars."
Niche User,2,"i say this to help others: i was sexually assaulted within my first month of being a freshman in the dorms by another UNT student.  because i pressed charges through Denton PD, title IX says UNT has to do their own investigation. After three years of extreme emotional turmoil all relating back to my first month of attending UNT, I couldn’t take it anymore and withdrew. During the process, i was asked why i was leaving. i told them what happened/ how it made me feel to be attending a college with posters outlining what consent was (a sober, excited yes) in my dorm and then not hear from them after there was no such consent given during my sexual assault. they immediately prompted a (3 year late) internal investigation. it seems like they care more about their image than the students paying to go there. it’s not UNT’s fault i was raped, it was my rapists fault. I enjoyed a good number of my classes and wish i had a better experience so i could continue with their art classes."
Junior,2,"My experience has been poor due to my financial struggle. However, if you have enough money to attend UNT comfortably, you will enjoy your time there."
Junior,2,"The University of North Texas has a strong appeal to liberalism and arts with a closely brought community.  Though, studying as a mechanical engineer, I have found their program to fail in sciences and engineering. Many times I've had professors who can't provide adequate content , while some couldn't even pass their own tests. Also, my own program has dropped out some curriculum courses, which make it different from other schools, and made me take courses which were a complete waste of time. The physics and engineering departments seem very disorganized and I am displeased to be attending this school after my second year in the major 's courses."
Senior,2,"I transferred here from Baylor University, and my advisor made a mistake in terms of planning my last year of college, and as a result I had to push my graduation date back a year. Many science classes are offered on an irregular basis, and since many courses require multiple prerequisites, you have to be VERY CAREFUL when building your schedule. The schools’ financial aid department is horrible and if you attempt to pull out a private loan Financial Aid will make it as hard as possible for you to use it. They hold the loan for up to a month before they process it, so you might be dropped from you classes. They do this to encourage students to do a payment plan because there are added fees which bring in more $$ for the school. There’s a huge bureaucratic system that controls most of what happens at UNT, and for that reason I wouldn’t advise coming to this school."
Freshman,2,"Very very different from where I came from - a highly academically competitive high school in Katy.  My overall experience is completely different than what I expected. Denton has awful roads and there is nothing to do there besides eat, and drink if you're 21. I did not realize before attending this school that the grad rate for UNT is only 50% whereas in most other large universities it's 75%+. My ""moderate"" dorm's electricity cuts out all the time and a few weeks ago the toilets and showers backed up with sewer water in to everyones rooms and it wasn't until 4 days later when they finally brought a cleaning crew in. It is VERY liberal here but you pretty much find that with most college towns you visit. Lot of music and art majors, theres no hype for football here. My professors were good and I got a 4.0 my first semester."
College Senior,2,Football used to be good. No one pays attention to anything else
College Sophomore,2,The athletics here at UNT are some of the worst in the country but the students spirit keeps the games alive.
College Sophomore,2,It could be much better! I've been in a couple of inappropriate situations catching the bus at night time. UNT's night time security/surveillance could truly improve
College Junior,2,Victory hall is really far from the main campus and the dorm rooms look like a jail but iv'e been to the other dorms their nice.
College Junior,2,"I'm not into ""Greek life"" on campus"
College Junior,2,"The only team that the school really supports is Women's Volleyball and Women's Soccer. The only reason anyone goes to football games is because they want to tailgate and they never even go inside to watch the game. Our basketball teams are good, just no one really goes to any games like ever. The football team is just not good at all, we need to do some better recruiting."
College Junior,2,"The team's performance, mainly football, has been beyond terrible. No one should bother going to games. It great to go and support the players and follow classmates but it just isnt fun"
College Freshman,2,"Not the best, but not too important as North Texas is not known for its sports teams. Intramural sports run the athletic life for the most part."
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't a whole lot of crime but security measures could be way better. There needs to be a nighttime escort service, more emergency poles, and a carpool for weekend evenings."
College Sophomore,2,"Some of the dorms are nice, some are pretty bad. West and College Inn are the worst, with Honors, Victory and Traditions being the best. Most of them have decent amenities and only some have a good social atmosphere. West, Traditions and Victory are pretty far from the center of campus, so that is inconvenient. Applying for housing was easy."
College Junior,2,Its a small school so there arent many sports. The school is working towards creating more activites.
Recent Alumnus,2,Our football team lost almost every game last season!
College Freshman,2,"I can't wait to get out of the dorms. It's expensive, old, loud, and no matter how many times i clean my room it feels dirty. I'm not close with anyone in my hall or dorm. It's nice being on campus and close to everything though."
College Freshman,2,"Almost everyone smokes or drinks, but there isn't really any pressure to participate if you don't want to. I know a lot of people who do hard drugs, but I'm not sure how prominent hard drugs are with overall. It might just be my friend group."
College Junior,2,I wouldn't choose this school if I could do all over again because honestly most of your professors just care about getting paid and not about your education. In certain fields you are very limited to certain career options.
College Sophomore,2,"I've had two really, really awful professors. One even changed all the grades at the end of the semester depending on whether or not he liked you. Thanks for the C! Not! Another cussed at me because I told him I was having a hard time with my health but didn't feel like I needed to be given accommodations for his class. Thanks! Not!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"They are all pretty much the same. There are a few cool, unique places but they are expensive and hard to get in to."
College Sophomore,2,"Some cafeterias like Bruce are okay, but most are terrible."
College Sophomore,2,I went to one frat party and it was extremely boring...it kind of made me not want want to go to parties anymore but next semester may be better.
College Junior,2,It was somewhat confusing and I am still waiting to hear about how much aid I will be receiving.
College Freshman,2,"I live in Kerr Hall. I do not like it at all. My hall is very loud and you can hear everyone's conversations. I also have the smallest room on my floor, which made the room seem very cramped. At least once a week the hot water doesn't work, resulting in a freezing cold shower. The elevators on A tower are very finicky; one moment both are working, the next moment one is shut down. My hall also has the worst cafeteria in it. The best thing about my hall is how convenient it is when going to and from class. I would say the best dorm is Bruce Hall, which has a good cafeteria and a fun social atmosphere."
College Junior,2,The buses are often too full to stop at all the stops and nearly always late.
College Junior,2,The Wifi is very weak and sometimes inhibits ability to complete work at school apart from being in a lab
College Freshman,2,"I live in dorms and had to pay a considerable amount of money for my permit, and finding on a parking spot on weekdays that's in the lot where I live is extremely difficult and I waste a lot of gas driving around looking for a parking spot. It's especially inconvenient when it's cold or raining :("
College Freshman,2,I only enjoy eating at Bruce. Kerr does not have an appetizing menu for me.
College Sophomore,2,Every scholarship you need to be financially in trouble. My family needs help but we don't qualify it is not fair AT ALL.
College Freshman,2,The football team is awful. Volleyball and basketball are great but they're not paid any attention to.
College Freshman,2,"The campus police are literal trash, they are a huge problem among sexual assault victims."
College Freshman,2,The struggle to get financial aid made me want to quit school no exaggeration. It's the biggest hassle I've ever dealt with.
College Freshman,2,I do have to complain constantly about noise in my residence hall and typically nothing is done about it. It would be nice to come home to a quiet room for once.
College Junior,2,I don't like how the students party. I do not partake in that.
College Sophomore,2,"There's not much to do unless you travel to Dallas or Fort Worth, which are very fun cities."
College Sophomore,2,I have yet to receive any financial aid and I've applied every year.
College Senior,2,"Nightlife sucks. Like I said before, DENTON IS BORING. Most of the exciting stuff is in Lewisville, and other surrounding cities. It's always a good 15+ miles to go to parties, etc. There are some things on campus to do but during the weekends, it's like a ghost town."
College Senior,2,"Most students have a hard time with financial aid process, partially due to the amount of people in the college."
College Junior,2,"During my sophomore year there was a vote to build a new football stadium. The vote passed because it was not made public to the students, only the athletics associations. The stadium was approved to be paid for by all future students, who are now paying an extra $150 per class to cover the cost of the stadium. Our football team is not particularly good. We lose most games and attendance has always been low. Massive waste of funds that could be put toward academic programs and improving facilities with actual value."
College Sophomore,2,I tried to get into student housing and there were waitlists all around. Very frustrating.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Just like with any college campus you will have people who think it's okay to mess with others or hurt them. UNT has had quite a few issues with that. They have security, and have recently put these call the police things up, but that can only help so much."
College Senior,2,"UNT financial aid is very difficult and time consuming. I do understand the campus is not a small campus and there are thousands of students and only hundreds of staff, but it takes a great amount of time for financial aid to process paperwork to respond and to provide status. Within this wait time deadlines may pass, money may have been due and books are required but you can not do anything until your financial aid has been accepted, reviewed processed and then rewarded. :/"
College Freshman,2,"In the past few months I have gone through an ice storm and a tornado/hail catastrophe, weather up in north areas is usually very changing and sometimes can be extreme."
College Freshman,2,It is hard for an underage student to reject an invitation to a drinking game or to try a new drug. Peer pressure is very noticeable and sometimes endangering.
College Freshman,2,I've applied and didn't receive any scholarships.
College Freshman,2,I feel like I haven't learned anything in the year that I've been here besides that all of the core classes are a joke.
College Sophomore,2,"Though Denton is a city, and growing, there simply is not alot of entertainment. If you want entertainment, you have to travel to Dallas. There is not much area attractions, and I'm not sure about activities or cultural events. The Golden Triangle Mall is okay but Pohl rec center is pretty amazing. Don't walk at night by yourself (doesn't matter if you're a guy either); the police are active though, but it's better safe than sorry. I don't know much about the locals, but the locals I talked to were friendly and sociable."
College Freshman,2,"So much alcohol. I guarantee that more students got involved with drinking just because of that alcohol edu course that we had to take. I am self-disciplined, so I don't have that problem."
College Junior,2,I know many students who use drugs.
Senior,1,"Online Learning doesn't work well with Studio Art Majors. The best Studio majors were afforded were highly restricted times in the workspaces, with no priority to Juniors or Seniors."
Alum,1,"Recently the college has decided to kick currently enrolled Chinese exchange scholars out from the school by issuing a forcing them to leave the state within a month. Hello, it is a pretty rude and anti-humanism decision to over 100 Chinese scholars studying at UNT. How a college can do inhuman things like that??? As a former Chinese international student who graduated from UNT, I am SOOOOOOdisappoint about my ala mater on this consideration. If you are an upcoming international student, DONT GO THERE!!!!!!!"
Senior,1,The department of science advising does not work with you at all. They are rude and do not care for your future plan. I really needed to take a class in the summer for medical school but I needed to go to an online orientation that was 4 weeks away. And the class was filling up fast and I emailed them saying can I just register and go to the orientation later before there is no seats left. But they pretty much reply back that they don't care and it my problem. Go to orientation even that mean by the time I go its no point because the class would be full. I'm applying for medical this summer I need the class now.
Junior,1,"UNT is a terrible school that has ripped my major from me just two years in. They claim to not have enough space for us, even though they are building multiple new buildings for sports facilities, dorms, etc. Im a fober arts major, and instead of building a classroom we desperately need to keep the major alive at least until the students still in the major can graduate, they’re building a massive einstines bagels. They are aggressively monopolizing on all things, including forcing students to buy textbooks from the on campus barns and noble. Campus parking passes are $200-$500 and don’t guarantee you can find a parking spot at all. If you need to see the school doctors office, forget it, because you can only go if you have UNT health insurance. Frats and other groups of men face no repercussion for sexual assault, no investigations even takes place. I’m going to graduate with 25000 in debt and no community."
Junior,1,"I really do not recommend this school for any student especially international student. I went through a very traumatizing experience that almost saw my visa status revoked out of benign neglect and misinformation by the international office and the college to which I had applied for a degree. For what you will be paying it is not worth the trouble, I am glad my case was settled albeit out of court. I had to call in lawyers, that's how bad my situation came."
Alum,1,"I attended University of North Texas for a year. During freshman orientation, we were treated like prisoners and had to abide by a strict 12 hour routine. Our parents were segregated except during meal times. Most of the professors there don’t care about what they are teaching or the students. I had classes where the professor sat on stage in a chair and read what is written in a $500 text book. The professors offered no other musings, or experience, or anecdotes. Absolutely boring and a waste of time and money. One psychology professor requested an essay of 25 pages; I did the essay. Then he announced that too many students found it difficult so it was no longer necessary. I had a professor of Native American Literature who was so painfully boring that I went from feeling sorry for myself for having to be in her class, to feeling sorry for her that she had to be herself."
College Sophomore,1,"The athletics at UNT are essentially nonexistent. Most of the student body does not care about the sports culture and although the stadium and facilities used by athletes are well maintained and used for a lot of events, the school spirit is virtually nonexistent."
College Senior,1,"UNT is the quintessential intolerant progressive/socialist school.  If you have a different opinion, good luck.  Those few of us who aren't so open-minded that our brains have fallen out are not in any way discriminatory to minorities, whether they be racial, economic, or sexual.  However, that is what most people think of conservatives and independents on campus and its really frustrating to say the least.  Its mostly disagreements over social services and individual liberties such as free speech where differences are expressed, but students act like everyone not a feminist is a sexist or isn't a part of the BLM movement is a racist.  The student body regularly freaks out at the one time in 100 years someone who isn't nearly a communist get invited to speak in campus.  You would think a KKK rally was being held by their reaction.  Its really depressing.  Just try to avoid social/political issues if you're the minority opinion."
College Sophomore,1,The greek life non factor
College Freshman,1,"Our football team SUCKS, but I don't really care since I don't like football. The rec is nice though!"
College Junior,1,"It's supported, but the teams are not that good."
College Sophomore,1,What can I say? College has been rough....
College Sophomore,1,"I'm here to learn, not party"
College Junior,1,Either it's fairly nice and overly priced or it is a dump and it it still cost a lot.
College Junior,1,Watch out for the parking... I've gotten a ticket before because the meter broke and UNT basically told me oh well and I was responsible for paying it. I didn't break the meter... -_-
College Freshman,1,i still havent recieved a financial aid refund and i have 7 weeks left in my second semester on campus.
College Junior,1,Parking sucks at UNT. Parking passes are expensive and you can never find a parking spot. Parking at nearby apartments is the way to go.
College Freshman,1,I live in Kerr and the parking lot has too few space than there are residents with cars.
College Freshman,1,Its kind of trash. It's a pain and most people just want off campus.
College Freshman,1,"It is much like living in a small town. There is a limited selection of places to go eat, shopping, and for night life. You have to drive more than thirty minutes to get anywhere good."
College Sophomore,1,Financial aid does not care about students in needs
College Sophomore,1,The cost is outrageous even on and off campus. The space is too limited for such a large campus with so many students.
College Sophomore,1,Sometimes I wish that there was more shelter to be covered for times when it rains on our way to class. Especially if it's across campus. It just makes it difficult for students to have the motivation to go.
College Student,1,"Since the day I got accepted into the University of North Texas, my financial aid has been under review. I have things that need to be paid for and I have no financial aid to help."
College Freshman,1,Parking police are the worst and there is never parking.
College Junior,1,That snow day... finals were postponed for the following week. Everyone was grouchy and just wanted to go home. Most students preferred to have finals online. 
College Junior,1,there are so many students from around this area that it is impossibe to fin a close parking spot and if you do find one you are either late to class or your parked far away from the general area you wanted to park
Recent Alumnus,1,The parking is very bad at UNT. 
Recent Alumnus,1,Financial aid at The University of North Texas was such a hassle.
College Junior,1,Super hard to find a spot
College Freshman,1,Parking is my least favorite thing about UNT. They sell a lot more permits than there are spots. I pay way too much to have to park blocks away from my dorm.
College Freshman,1,I hate every single thing about it. I should have dropped
College Junior,1,"I'm rating poorly specifically for the student center, which is currently under construction and has blocked of a huge portion in the middle of campus. I've been late for classes, trying to get from one side of campus to the next because of construction."
College Junior,1,"This is an issue that I have with any college experience, not just my college, but if your family struggles financially, even when you're not poverty level, you have little-to-no help with financial aid. After do the FAFSA, I only got offers for loans, which I refused to remain debt-free. I live paycheck to paycheck and sometimes go without eating."
College Sophomore,1,My mom made too much money last year and i received little aid in the form  of loans. She doesn't have the funds to help me out but still got a loan for me anyway. next semester I'll be a full time student and employee because I have to pay my own way now. it's a huge hassle and I hate the financial aid process. Tips? Do it early.
College Junior,1,It was a terrible experience for me being a transfer student 
College Junior,1,I have never seen campus security except in the rec center when there are phone thefts happening
College Sophomore,1,The union is under construction :/
College Senior,1,I feel safe walking during the day around campus but at night i would not feel safe by myself or even with another girlfriend.
College Senior,1,The apartments around campus are expensive and usually hard to get.
College Senior,1,I HATE THE PARKING ON CAMPUS. The permits themselves are close to 200$ and there seems to be limited spots available. I choose to take the bus from my apartment to campus and I don't mind it. The officials writing tickets are ALWAYS out so it's not wise to park without a permit. This is the one thing I hate about this school!
College Junior,1,"Based on the classes that I am taking now, I'm kind  of reconsidering on which path I would like to take, but I think I may just stick it out with the program I am majoring in."
College Junior,1,"There are not enough campus security for students to feel safe. Crime alerts are sent out and we see police officers on campus for awhile but after a week or two they disappear and then another crime occurs. It's just one big cycle. I think there should be police officers on campus at night at least. I don't feel safe walking around campus or to the bus at night. I feel so unsafe, that recently I've had friends drive me to and from campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking anywhere on campus is extremely expensive! If you do find a spot it takes another 10-15 minutes to walk to class, since the buildings are very far away from the parking lots. Worst parking on a campus ever!"
College Senior,1,"UNT is a commuter school and so parking is usually horrible. They have tried to fix this problem and have built a new parking lot but I have heard that a permit to park in the new garage is very expensive. When I was a freshman at the university, it was sometimes difficult to find a spot available for my permit type."
College Senior,1,"I gave my school this grade because I am not a drug user nor do I really know those on campus who are. However, I'm quite sure there are many people who use on campus. Walking around campus you hear bits of conversations that mention about how much alcohol or weed was at a particular party the night before. Another reason I scored this school low was because all around campus they have signs saying smoke free campus however right next to the sign there is someone firing up a cigarette."
College Junior,1,There are no parties at school. I go to the Dallas campus and we do not have dorms.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The police are very strict with road violations and the tickets are really hefty fines. It is difficult to get used to the flow of traffic at the campus immediately because there are so many one-ways, stop signs, and speed limit changes. The officers have no regard for people as human beings because they deal with so many people that take advantage of the system, and kids that don't appreciate their education."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There are many buildings that are old, not enough Work-Study student jobs, there's never anyone on weekends to clean toilets so by the time Monday rolls around they are extremely nasty, dirty, smelly and so very gross, there needs to be a better system ""to offer"" meals to students who don't reside at the dorms (as in CHEAPER 'cause restaurants near-by take ADVANTAGE of students--too expensive),  and so far, the ""nicest/richest"" facility that i've seen is the Recreation Center. What?! WHY is that always so?!"
College Sophomore,1,"UNT is strict with violations of the student code of conduct, but handles violations very poorly and unfairly. The University is very one sided and does not listen to students they feel have done something wrong. It reflects very negatively on the school."
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is very hard because most of the spots are taken when your going to a school of 36,000 students. If you accidently park in the wrong spot the tickets are outrageous."
College Senior,1,Almost all of the programs are of poor quality and the student body rarely attends the games
College Junior,1,"there is no diversity on campus that i have seen. everyone gets along with everyone. people are very friendly here. every time I leave a class, I walk to my next class with a new person."
College Freshman,1,There is a greek life?  Fraternities and sororities are not a large part of campus culture.  Most people ignore them and never even know they there.
College Junior,1,"Students already ready pay $4,000 for classes and about $400 for books. It's not fare to charge students to park at their own school. Parking should be free for students sense we are paying to keep the university open. This is why many students take the bus or walk to school. Even my friends who are employees at unt have to pay for parking. This needs to change fast. If you don't pay $400 - $1000 for parking they will tow your car. It doesnt matter if your a student."
College Freshman,1,"AWFUL if you commute and get there past 10 it'll take you 30 minutes to park, and if you pay for a better parking spot it still is far away from campus... just bad"
College Junior,1,Financial aid tells the wrong information. Scholarships are hard to get unless you are wanted to diversify the school because you are foreign born or of an ethnicity other than white.
College Sophomore,1,Parking is very terrible on campus. The school sold more permits than it had parking spots making it incredibly hard to find a spot. The parking lots are huge and scattered throughout campus but if they are not for students then they are filled up.
College Freshman,1,"Although it is not outward, it is evident that many partake in drug and alcohol consumption.  My friend told me that his former roommate crashed into their room with two other friends, drank a large bottle of vodka, and passed out.  Only to awaken and vomit in the toilet.  Weed is also rampant; one of my friends admitted to me that she'd tried it with friends who pressured her to."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is my biggest frustration. For residents, permits are around $250, which seems a bit ridiculous considering how difficult it is to find a parking spot. Only certain permits can be used in certain places and don't even think about trying to get a closer spot by parking in a different section, there are patrol officers whose sole job is to walk around the parking lots handing out citations. These citations can range from $35 to $125 to getting your car towed; this isn't an exaggeration, it's happened to me and nearly all of my friends. If you commute, arrive atleast 30 minutes before class, to account for circling the parking lot and having to walk to class."

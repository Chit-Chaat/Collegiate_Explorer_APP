Sophomore,5,"The professors do an amazing job whether teaching in person or online, you're still able to be connected to them, they try very hard to ensure you have the best learning experience."
Sophomore,5,Overall I would say I'm extremely happy that I chose to attend Rollins College. Everyone at the school is very helpful and I feel included.
Senior,5,My online experience is super easy. All the professor at Rollins College is super chill. They do the best for you to learn no matter the situation.
Senior,5,Awesome college to grow and to expand !! I'm glad that my thoughts come from this wonderful college.
Freshman,5,Rollins College has been so helpful so far with all of my questions about my academics. I have yet to think of a complaint. I have been only been treated with respect and kindness.
Junior,5,The communication between students and teachers was excellent. My grades did not suffer when I transferred to online courses. I was very impressed by the academics and course curriculum.
Junior,5,I am having a great time at this College. It has given me so much experience beyond academia. The professors are very knowledgeable and helpful. Every professor has a background in the field they teach and were very successful in their profession.
Freshman,5,best private education school in florida. i love how kind the staff and teachers are. everyone who works here truly cares about all of the students.
Freshman,5,"the staff really connects and try’s their best to reach out to each individual student. i like how not only professors, but other students and staff members have reached out to me. they go beyond and always get the job done right away."
Freshman,5,Rollins College has been the only school i've actually been excited to attend. The staff are amazing and I wouldn't trade it for the world. They have so many resources they offer to students and care about you. This is the ONLY school that requires you to take a community engagement course. INT200 is the best eye opener on life and the beauty of art.
Freshman,5,"I started the year out with one online class, then Covid came around and all of my classed ended up being online. The experience was definitely different. Even though I prefer in person classes, my teachers made it fun. Though remembering everything online along with working full-time was a little tough, but the teachers really helped me through it."
Freshman,5,"Rollins College is an amazing college. Rollins makes me feel like home, the classrooms, the teacher, especially the advisors that they have been helping me during all my enrollment process, being part of their community as a new student makes me feel proud of myself to have the honor to study there for the next four years. Rollins College is going to give me all the preparation in my professional life as a person or in any job that I will have."
Freshman,5,"I have not taken any classes online at Rollins College. Rollins, until the pandemic, did not offer any online classes through them directly. You could take online classes through local colleges such as Valencia and UCF, but Rollins did not offer them directly."
Sophomore,5,The expert faculty are really interested in your success. Rollins provides several avenues for you to connect to something much larger than yourself.
Sophomore,5,"I love rollins campus, and also its academic and social environment. In terms of education level, it is high and you are expected to be always working hard. Also, rollins college is an amazing place for networking - nice and educated people. Definitely, a great college!"
Freshman,5,Rollins college is one of the best one on one colleges I know of. The classes are at max 30 people and the professors are always ready for one on one help.
Freshman,5,"Rollins was the best decision I ever made. It's my second semester and I can safely say I've met my best friends. I've had so many experiences beyond what I imagined in high school. The small class sizes really make a difference as I have had opportunities for research - already as a freshman! I am in the honors program too and it brings greater value to Rollins. Social life is actually pretty good- I would go out with friends Thurs-Sat and also Universal and Disney are close which is a plus! Overall, Rollins has provided me with opportunities and the ability to interact with the community- something I KNOW a larger school would not provide!"
Niche User,5,Rollins is a good clean school. This school provides good things to students and the teachers. I go to Rollins every other Saturday and I enjoy riding up here seeing the great landscape and all the beautiful buildings they have. I attend the Rollins Upward Bound so I have a pretty good experience with the campus and the life there.
Freshman,5,"Rollins is generous with its scholarships and provides a very inclusive learning environment. Located at center Winter Park, you can walk 5 minutes to Park Ave. (btw great restaurants there) The new building open in 2020 is very modern and aesthetic. The only thing that’s not perfect is the living on campus requirement which ask students to stay on campus dorm for three years."
Junior,5,Great school. I really enjoy the small class sizes. The thing I like the most about Rollins is that it's a liberal arts college. Classes you would never expect to find at a normal four-year university are extremely common. Courses about what it's like to grow up as a man in the United States and classes covering the industrial food chain and its impact on the environment or even a class about philosophy at the gym. Professors at Rollins have been great and profoundly knowledgeable.
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman about to start my second semester and I love the school so far.  I felt that my professors, peer mentors, and classmates were all extremely helpful with any questions I had. The campus is beautiful and walking around feels like I am in a movie. I had a mix of people in my classes which I found very helpful because I was able to socialize with upperclassmen in a classroom setting where I could learn from them! Dorm life has been exciting and when there were any issues like someone not obeying quiet hours the RA's resolve the situation immediately. The RA's are also super fun and genuinely want to get to know you and help you in any way they can. Overall out of all my friends from high school I have had the best and most involved first semester. I believe that's due to the community that Rollins provides."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Rollins College. I came into college very nervous and immediately felt welcomed by the community. I took four classes during my first, fall semester and felt comfortable in all of them. I enjoyed all of my professors and the small classroom environment. Every professor knows your name and cares."
Senior,5,"I transferred to Rollins College after my sophomore year of college and it was the best decision I've ever made!  Rollins College has incredible professors that genuinely want you to succeed.  I instantly felt accepted and cared for when I transferred in.  I would recommend Rollins to anyone looking for a college with nurturing learning environments, incredible professors and staff, and an gorgeous campus!"
Sophomore,5,"The campus is beautiful. They really care about the student experience. They will work with you to be able to pay for your tuition. They give out a lot of scholarships and will make sure if you are interested in something, they will attempt to provide it for you."
Freshman,5,"I have had an amazing experience at Rollins College. I have met so many nice and friendly people, and the campus is beautiful."
Junior,5,"During my time at Rollins College, I have been able to develop myself Immensely on both a professional and personal level! As a Business Management Major, I have found courses offered through the Department of Business to be great! The class sizes are small (just around 20-30 students) and from my experience, the faculty members are very interested in ensuring that their students are able to learn and apply concepts to real-life applications! So many opportunities have come my way from a liberal-arts education and it wouldn't be possible without the incredible faculty members and community as a whole! 

Now (on a side note), if you are an individual who is sensitive to air quality and living conditions, you may want to put lots of consideration into living conditions and look at potentially feasible dorm options. This may involve planning in advance for the long-term. At the moment, Rollins is investing in capital improvements on campus for new and improved dorms and living conditions"
Junior,5,"Rollins was the campus where I finally felt that ""aha"" moment and knew it was where I belonged. Being only 30 minutes from the Orlando International Airport (MCO), my family and I knew Rollins would be easily accessible because I am from Connecticut and would by flying a lot. 
Campus is also right next to Park Avenue, which is a central location for restaurants, cafés, and boutiques. Students frequently walk on Park Ave for lunch, dinner, or on the weekends. We are also right on Lake Virginia! I run on the path that borders the lake during the weekend. 
Class-wise, I knew I performed best in a small setting, so the average class size of 17 students was perfect for me. Also, I have had lots of time to explore exactly what I wanted to major in. Coming out of high school, I was undecided but now I have fine-tuned my studies to fit my interests."
Sophomore,5,"I am a current sophomore at Rollins and I cannot speak highly enough about Rollins. The opportunities I have earned at Rollins are unparalleled and incredible. I have close relationships with all of my faculty and professors, I have traveled across the world on field studies and service trips, and I live on one of the most beautiful campuses in all of Florida. If you're considering coming to Rollins, I would highly recommend it. You will love it here. I know I do!"
Niche User,5,I'm not enrolled into Rollins yet but I went to visit last month and the campus and atmosphere was just amazing. The people were really warm and welcoming. I look forward to Rollins perhaps being my future school.
Graduate Student,5,"Rollins has great professors and academic programs! I think it would be cool to have better sports programs at the college to have a better student athlete population, however academics are more important. I think the campus is beautiful and the surrounding area is fantastic!"
Freshman,5,"It is a great college, in which you can both party and study. You apply tour knowledge every single day, and improve along the courses. Great teachers and staff. I highly recommend it! The only negative part is the high tuition, which I personally think is extremely expensive, however, there is quality..."
Niche User,5,Beautiful campus with very nice staff who are willing to help at a moments notice on whatever you need.
Niche User,5,I loved the atmosphere of the campus. Everyone is friendly and helpful. I also love the college campus. The facilities are amazing and everything is walking distance.
Graduate Student,5,"An amazing college. The quality of the professors is my favorite thing. Truly learned a lot at Rollins. 

I had a great experience. I’m very thankful for Rollins."
Senior,5,"Rollins is such a personal experience in more ways than just academically. You form close relationships with those in and out of your major, there is always someone there to help when things go awry, the opportunities- even in travel- are endless and you walk away from each semester feeling accomplished, excited and better equipped for the road ahead. I have loved Rollins and only wish it would stop going by so quickly!"
Senior,5,"My experience at the Holt School at Rollins College has been very rewarding. As a father of two, I find that it is an excellent school for young and older students with families."
Senior,5,"Rollins is a fantastic community to be a part of, from the sports teams to the academic endeavors, the entire school and surrounding area are designed to help you succeed. Professors are knowledgeable, patient and willing to work with students. The campus is located in stunning Winter Park, FL and is truly a wonderful place to attend."
Sophomore,5,"Rollins is the best college for international students. Teachers are the best, their main interest is to help the student. I enjoy the small classes and all the people I've met at this university."
Alum,5,"Rollins College is unique in that it offers a EAMBA (Early Advantage MBA) program for students coming from all backgrounds and straight from undergrad. The program was rigorous, set me up for success to build up to a managerial position, and has a great reputation for employers in the Central Florida area."
Senior,5,"Rollins is a small liberal arts school known for their excellent academics and athletics. As a student-athlete and rising senior, I can say that athletics has been a huge part of my Rollins experience.  However, there are so many other ways students can get involved on campus whether its through Greek life or other clubs and organizations – there is something for everyone! The community at a school like Rollins was definitely something I was looking for. Lastly, when deciding between schools, Rollins’ campus was one of the biggest draws. I could not imagine a better place to spend my college years anywhere other than Winter Park!"
Freshman,5,"Rollins College is the perfect college for me. I have never seen myself doing research for a living but I do see myself being a lifelong learner. I like to learn, and in this school they have the best professors that only want to help you learn and aren’t all day focused only on their own research. I love it."
Junior,5,"I cannot say enough great things about my Rollins College experience.  The academics are fantastic, my classmates are lifelong friends, Winter Park and the Orlando area are super fun and I have never bored.  My Rollins experience is more that I could have ever anticipated, simply fantastic.  I am a Business Major learning so much with great professors and even better friends.  Go Tars!"
Niche User,5,"Rollins is an absolutely beautiful school with amazing teachers and great academics. When I visited for the Experience Rollins day, the staff was so welcoming and very helpful."
Junior,5,Rollins is an awesome school with a lot of resources and staff that actually care about furthering the students education and preparing them for the future.
Freshman,5,Rollins College is a completely diverse and unique community to be a part of. Both students and professors are able to build complex and interesting relationships to better themselves in the future. I strongly feel that I will be able to strive forward after graduation due to the education I will be receiving here at Rollins.
Niche User,5,I enjoyed the campus and how safe it feels at all times even at night. The staff are very friendly and helpful.
Senior,5,I love the small class sizes and super professional & approachable professors. The syllabus are clear and the work is in a timely fashion.
Niche User,5,"Rollins is such a beautiful school in a perfect location. The classrooms are good and also not too big so you can get to know your professors, there's a lake on campus for water sports, it's not so big that you'll get lost, and the dorms are really nice. It's located within walking distance of Winter Park so you don't need a car to get around. You're also really close to downtown Orlando."
Sophomore,5,"Rollins College provides a unique academic experience, and it encourages students to engage in social projects. Also, the college offers numerous opportunities to participate in academic research, study abroad, and volunteering opportunities. The essence of working in community is very strong on-campus, and all students try to collaborate with each other as a true close-knit community."
Junior,5,"Simply the best! Rollins College is the most amazing place.  The small classes,  excellent academic, the gorgeous campus, downtown Winter Park downtown make it the perfect school.  I love it!"
Freshman,5,"What I like about Rollins College is the beautiful campus, friendly students and staff, and the small class sizes!"
Alum,5,"Rollins College was one of the most memorable times of my life. I came to the school not knowing a single person and left with friends that will last a life time. Rollins is full of unexpected things. For starters, I never thought I would join Greek life, but Lambda Chi Alpha changed that. Moreover, the college gives you the tools to succeed but be sure to take advantage of them. Develop relationships with professors because they want to work with students and 13 student average class size makes that possible."
Sophomore,5,"I love my school and would recommend to any student who seeks a balanced life including the academic and social aspect of it.
Rollins College is a small private school where you know everyone. This is bad because many times the same faces get boring, however, the small size keeps your social life a bit interesting. Expect gossip, parties, and rich people. 
You have to find your group of friends and once you do, this will be the best experience of your life."
Junior,5,"Being in my 3rd year as a student of Rollins College, I have been blessed to be a part of such an amazing environment. Not only is the campus beautiful, but the staff, faculty, and students are beautiful as well. I have never been in a place that is so accepting, supporting, and encouraging. Rollins College and everyone in it has really made me feel like I'm home and is always pushing me to do my best and really make me a better student, and person. It is such an amazing place that after I graduate from my undergrads, I would like to stay and enroll in one of the graduate programs that Rollins offers."
Freshman,5,"Rollins College is like in its own little bubble. It has great academics and ridiculously small classes, which means learning material comes a lot easier. Besides that, it is in Florida, and I basically get to go to the heated outdoor pool year round to chill. The party scene is LIT, and the frats are generally small and chill enough to let freshman guys into parties sometimes. Its basically a big smart country club filled with students who want to enjoy life and get lit a lot."
Junior,5,"I love Rollins College. I mean the professors and the classes are amazing. I think the staff members are super helpful. Rollins gives you amazing opportunities and everyone who wants to take advantage of it can do it. The campus is beautiful and extremely safe. I think some of the student culture can be detrimental to some, but you can stay away from it if you want."
Freshman,5,Rollins College provides students with both the ability to delve into what they love while exploring new and unknown interests.
Niche User,5,"Incredibly beautiful campus and prideful students. Rollins is in an amazing area too, sorrounded with very well review restaurant and stores."
Freshman,5,Pretty good school. In regards of housing as long as your not in McKean it's good. Large divide in wealth as there are many kids on scholarships and others that pay upwards of 60k a year. Campus is beautiful and there are many options for food.
Niche User,5,"Rollins College is an amazing school! I recently took a tour of the campus and everything was absolutely lovely, from the great scenery to the way everyone treated me. Rollins is definitely at the top of my list!"
Freshman,4,I have not taken any classes online but I am sure that the experience will be equal to being on campus.
Sophomore,4,"Rollins transitioned online during the COVID-19 outbreak. My professors tried their best to make us feel like we were still in class, but the experience wasn't just the same."
Junior,4,It was quick to adapt but that doesn't mean I want to keep doing online learning  because I'm taking theater classes and I prefer physical learning
Freshman,4,"An amazing Liberal Arts education. If you don't know you're intended major, advisors are at the ready to help and assist you with everything. Most majors allow you to jump in starting junior year. Meaning they don't have a crazy high credit amount to complete them."
Freshman,4,"The campus is absolutely beautiful and there are so many different options to study and to go like the library, watch tower, the cathedral. There are also notable professors with very good reputations so you know you are getting a great education. The school itself is amazing as there are so many events to be able to socialize and they want you to explore your major rather than forcing you to determine it right away. 

There is also a beautiful lake where you can enjoy a walk or swim or canoe or do anything. You always see people swimming and jumping off of the dock. My favorite part about this college is the library and seeing the archives as the Rollins library has so many great findings."
Sophomore,4,"Rollins is a great school. The professors are incredible, the campus is beautiful, the people are friendly, and the location is awesome. I wish I could give it five stars for the faculty alone. However, while going here has given me a lot of opportunities, it is also incredibly expensive. I struggle to afford going here, especially since I don't want to take out any student loans."
Freshman,4,Rollins College has great political science and economics departments with professors who are always engaged with their students and connect with them on multiple real-world issues. Rollins College academics prepares you to apply your education and become a well-rounded individual with endless knowledge.
Alum,4,"Rollins' campus is absolutely beautiful. The faculty and staff are extremely welcoming. The courses are challenging, however they lack a variety of classes. It's predominantly white people teaching white people and therefore the course materials and knowledge being taught is strictly from that perspective. People of color and other minorities are not represented in both the classroom materials and in the student demographics."
Junior,4,The campus is beautiful with great scenery. The small class size allows you to connect with your professors and peers.
Sophomore,4,I absolutely love Rollins. The one major flaw that Rollins has is the numerous construction projects going on all at once.
Senior,4,"Rollins College is a small liberal arts college that provides so many activities and events for students. Although it is filled with a ton of pretentious and privileged students, it’s amazing professors and programs provide an extensive learning experience."
Sophomore,4,"There are lots of ways to be involved at this school, allowing for a smooth transition to college. Small school size allows for relationships between students and teachers that aid in the college experiences."
Niche User,4,"An institution I was able to easily adapt to, a small beautiful campus where I can explore without getting lost. The lessons taught in classes are very useful and allowed me to prepare better for the future. I made close friends and hung out near places like Park Ave. where Rollins students can also get discounts for things. There are occasionally fun events that appear, where one can get free shirts, food, sometimes games and more."
Freshman,4,"I really like that Rollins is a small campus and you get to see relatively the same faces . Its very diverse so you get to meet people from all over the world and learn so much about so many different things . Its been a little difficult since I live off campus and I need to drive 45 minutes every day to come to school. Sometimes I need to wait four or five hours for a class or soccer practice, also haven't really experienced the student lifestyle . It would be great to live on campus . However it has been a great first year and I enjoyed it a lot ."
Senior,4,I like the education received at Rollins. I would like the school to have more scholarships for deserving students. That would make it less stressful to go to school.
Niche User,4,"The tour was very organized and informational. In a good location with many job, and intern opportunities. Lots of study abroad programs with a wide-ranged course schedules to give you a well rounded education."
Junior,4,Rollins College has a very hands on learning approach which allows students to find their true passions. The professors at Rollins really care about their students in and outside of the classroom.
Freshman,4,"Rollins is very strong academically, resourcefully, and in regards to the community aspect within the college. My only complaint is that I have only been here for a year and they're changing the entire housing/meal plan system to single out (almost shame) the lower socioeconomic classes. I myself am here on scholarship so this is very disheartening for me, it's almost like they're trying to force me out by making things more expensive for me. Additionally, living in the dorms kinda sucks. The washers and driers break daily, the walls are paper thin, and when one person gets sick we all do. These are just the things I can think of off the top of my head. The students here are VERY liberal, so just be prepared if you identify as conservative (I am also liberal so it doesn't affect me). However most students are understanding of different views. Also the professors are AWESOME! Well most anyway, you'll have a few unorganized and annoying ones to deal with."
Alum,4,"As an African American alumnus who is local to the Orlando area near Rollins College, I grew in a typical suburb where parent expected the traditional life for their child: Go to school, get a degree, get a job, start your own family. 

Going to Rollins has not only completely altered my concept on what ""traditional"" means, but it has shaped me to be a more well-rounded individual, growing to accept change-and more importantly- become the change I'd like to see in the world by developing the mantra of Global Citizen."
Freshman,4,Rollins College is a very focused university due to the small class sizes that offer a more personal learning environment. The faculty and students are very nice and welcoming.
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love the faculty and staff here at Rollins. The music department is the best. We have opportunities to perform all the time and the facilities are great. The the dorms on campus are really nice and nothing is ever too far away from anything. There are many opportunities to get involved with clubs on campus, and you meet a lot of people in those clubs that have the same interests as you. The class sizes are not too big, and not too small. One of the best things here is that you can study abroad, and its included in your tuition. Overall, Rollins is a great fit for anyone who wants a small school with small class sizes with excellent learning opportunities."
Sophomore,4,"The classes are top quality as is the exchange program. In fact, I'm currently writing this review from my host family's house in Oviedo, Spain. The campus, dorms and food are all top notch. The only things I would like to see changed is the enthusiasm for sports (could be a lot more!) and the diversity."
Sophomore,4,"Professors are very caring and knowledgeable on their subject, they are more than willing to assist, the community here is very accepting and friendly. This school offers ample services to receive help."
Sophomore,4,Rollins College has a great student to professor ratio. The class sizes are small which allows students to get the information they need in order to succeed.
Sophomore,4,"Rollins is a small school with small classes.  I like the small classes because my professors know who I am,"
Junior,4,"Rollins needs more diversity, but they're working on it. The academics are good as long as you know what field you're going into and you're confident about where you're going in life. Rollins doesn't really give you the time to explore things because it's so expensive."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, I have already been able to establish a relationship with several of my professors due to the small size of the classes at Rollins. My professors are able to get to know me as a person and as a student which will benefit me later in  my undergraduate career."
Niche User,4,What I  liked most about Rollins is the student to teacher ratio as well as it's location. It will give you a personal one on one with the teachers so you can get your questions answered. The location is full with stores and restaurants where you can get a job to earn a little extra cash. One thing i would like to see change is the residential life. I love everything but the sizes of the rooms. They feel very crowded and don't give enough personal space.
Alum,4,Great professors who care about your education. Beautiful campus location in the middle of downtown Winter Park and amazing swimming pool on Lake Virginia!
Freshman,4,Rollins College is a great institution focused on providing education that forces individuals to look outside the box. It brings another definition to Liberal Arts by allowing students to explore their individual talents and aspirations.
Freshman,4,"So far I've had a really pleasant experience with Rollins, I really like the professors and the academics that the school puts out. The study spaces are great for when I have to study and they're all over the campus. But being an off campus student it makes it harder for me to be here financially because the food here is amazing but it is really expensive. There is also a struggle for me to be at a few events that are required for freshmen because not only do I have work but the times where I would be at home and get a message about an event and I would not be able to go because it would be a half an hour to an hour drive (and I would miss the event entirely) and I would have to waste more gas going back to the school."
College Freshman,4,"I am an off-campus student, but I have seen a variety of the dorms. They are relatively nicer than other schools."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is not huge at Rollins, since it is a small school. But, they are still relevant at the school."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, this school is awesome. It has everything you'd ever need in a college, however, that is only because you do get what you pay for. So, it is quite expensive to attend but definitely worthwhile."
College Sophomore,4,My overall experience at Rollins College has been great.  I really enjoy the classes I have taken and think that I have learned a lot about myself and the diverse world around me.
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't gone to many games, but others love them"
College Sophomore,4,"Nice school, needs work on diversity and acceptance."
College Freshman,4,They are very competitive and fun.
College Freshman,4,It gives great help. Like tutoring.
College Freshman,4,Greek life is definitely popular and joining a fraternity or sorority is a great way to make friends and enjoy an eventful social life. Spring rush allows for freshmen to experience a semester outside of a greek organization so that they can experience the school before deciding to rush.
College Freshman,4,"Men's lacrosse is probably the most observed sport (rolltars) but a lot of people like to go to basketball, baseball, and soccer games, too. Probably the coolest aspect of Rollins Athletics is the abundance of water athletes who go here due to the proximity of Lake Virginia. Boating and wakeboarding is pretty popular."
College Student,4,"Rollins has a good Tennis and Golf team, but other sports are not taken into account."
College Freshman,4,After you find your group rollins becomes home.
College Freshman,4,"Join a team, its an easy way to make friends!"
College Freshman,4,I personally have not considered joining any fraternities or sororities this year due to being more focused on academics
College Freshman,4,Never had a problem with my safety on campus
College Freshman,4,My school is very good because it is very small so the class sizes are smaller than normal universities therefore better learning experience.  I would choose this school again if I can do it over because a smaller class size provides a better relationship with my professors.
College Freshman,4,"It's a lot of work, but challenging and interesting"
College Freshman,4,"I've heard such great things about getting jobs immediately after graduation and in your field, however as a first semester freshman I don't know much."
College Freshman,4,"Being such a small school it's pretty common to find students in Greek life all over campus but they're all friendly and don't seem to care if you're not in greek life, or in an organization that their not in, they'll treat you all the same. (:"
Recent Alumnus,4,Everything was great and up to standards
Recent Alumnus,4,"All courses were challenging in their own way

Great Professors, very respectable and approachable"
Recent Alumnus,4,There are always recruitment all over whether it be in person or by email
Recent Alumnus,4,I am glad that Security is constantly patroling
Recent Alumnus,4,I couldn't choose a greater school than Rollins College. I have highly enjoyed my time being a Rollins Student working to achieve my undergraduate degree.
College Junior,4,"I love my college experience, because I got to meet a lot of new people and I have really enjoyed the campus life."
College Freshman,4,There is much one on one with the students and professors.
College Junior,4,Never had a meal plan
College Junior,4,They are always keeping students aware
College Junior,4,I would like for more scholarships to be available through the financial aid website
Junior,2,"Most of the other ratings are outdated. Recently Rollins gas taken a turn towards appealing to their appearance to trustees rather than the happiness of students. The academics and professors are wonderful and honestly the only reason why I am still here. The campus has taken on 3 large scale building projects that have diminished the beauty of the campus and have made living on campus incredibly difficult. There is constant noise from the construction and frequent utility outages that disrupt student life. All of the construction is awfully behind as well. This has left students with diminished dining options (especially for students with dietary restrictions), over crowded dorms, and the feeling that the administration doesn’t care about them. The quality of life at Rollins is not reflected in the ratings above."
Freshman,2,Rollins make look appealing due to the fantastic combination of academics and inclusive campus structure but don't be fooled. It may be top school in both of these areas but this school is not for everyone. Tuition cost is substantial meaning your paying for a Ivy league type education and can only be reduced by scholarship. As a smaller school that is Division you won't get the same outgoing experience that most big public schools have. If you demanding attention from those around you and want a close high school like experience than Rollins might be the closest thing to that for better or worse.
Junior,2,Overall Rollins is a great place to get an extremely unaffordable education. The class sizes are great and the professors are awesome. It has a gorgeous campus. However Rollins is unbelievably expensive. I know too many students that have transferred. It's also hard to find your place at Rollins because it's so small.
College Junior,2,not the best school if you are interested in a sports schoool
College Freshman,2,"Campo is always around, but they are never there when you need them. Campo is only good and writing up under-aged drinkers. Whenever there is a creep following a girl home, there is no Campo in sight. I think that Campo are rude and pathetic."
College Freshman,2,"I did not make All A's in high school, and my wallet is paying for it now. Tuition is still around 60k, even with financial aid and scholarships. That is why I am doing this survey, because I need more financial help."
College Sophomore,2,All of the food is terribly processed and frozen and not fresh. Sodexo destroys the stomachs of students
College Freshman,2,"I absolutely hate downtown orlando and the house parties are limited. When you do go to a house party all they play is oldies. At downtown orlando its just EDM. Honestly, can't i just have some upbeat music that I can dance to?"
College Freshman,2,You hear a lot of rumors about bad things happening during rush week. Several houses were closed for misconduct in 2013.
College Sophomore,2,"Mainly preppy, rich, white kids. Typical country club attendees."
College Senior,2,"I received a small scholarship from my school, after paying for 3 years worth of classes myself.  My Stafford loans have played out and now I am scrambling for assistance.  Oh, did I forget to mention my 3.19 GPA and my President's List award from last semester?"
College Freshman,2,There is alot of partying that goes on around campus with students. On campus activity is usually chill but there is alot of night action.
College Sophomore,2,"Some of my fellow classmates do live comfortable, but far away. too much gas money. and if they live close, it's not comfortable"
College Sophomore,2,"So unless you're an RA (which won't happen at least until you're a sophomore) you probably won't receive a free parking pass. With that in mind, to get your parking pass/permit its 75$ I recall. But make sure you have the right decal, someone could give you the wrong one and if you're parked in a spot that is TECHNICALLY allowed for you, because you have the wrong decal they'll just charge you for a new decal and the ticket. Campus security is very anal about parking and have no problem giving out tickets. When in doubt just park in the garage and walk the 3-5 mins. Its better than getting a ticket and trying to argue it because regardless you're probably going to still have to pay for it. After 3 tickets you're supposed to get booted. So essentially either don't have a car or just go to the garage. The ticketing really really sucks and is over 100$."
College Junior,2,"While we have a great international ratio of the student body, many of the students are caucasian and the school could have more tolerance of different vantage points."
College Senior,2,"Parking is the downfall of the school. While all else seems close to perfect, this nightmare can really stress students out or cause them to be late to class. From my understanding, they are expanding parking and building an additional garage next summer. Hopefully that will help!"
College Junior,2,"Rollins is pretty strict about anything alcohol or drug related. Drugs are automatically referred to the police and alcohol is dealt with internally. Punishments aren't very harsh for alcohol, but the frequency of punishment is high."
College Freshman,2,"As a freshman you want to live in Ward. Ward is new and clean, with sturdy furniture, and thick walls. Living in Ward is often compared to as living in a hotel. McKean is known as the Freshman party dorm. McKean is filthy-- covered in food, piss, and throw up, infested with bugs and cockroaches, and the bathrooms are so gross you can practically see bacteria growing on the walls. The hallways echo and the walls in McKean are so paper thin that you can hear people talking from room to room, or worse having sex at 2 AM in the morning the night before you have a big exam. McKean is an experience to say the least. Rex Beach has great facilities very similar to Ward, but it isn't a very social dorm. It can be loud at times because its full of music majors playing their guitars and singing, but for the most part it is a clean, quiet, safe place to live."
College Freshman,2,"As a science major, the classes are very difficult. In fact, some say that the degree of difficulty of science classes is much higher than that of the public state schools in Florida. The pre-med track is a joke and no one in the college boasts about their alumni getting into prestigious medical schools because they usually don't. Classroom sizes usually don't get larger than 32, so there is a lot of individualized attention, if you seek it. You usually can't go to class unprepared without worrying about being called on, like in high school. Outside of science majors, the classes appear to be easy and the entire college seems to baby its students entirely too much. I would not feel as though I was truly preparing myself for an excellent future at this school."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a free shuttle Friday nights from 6 p.m.-midnight. But it is so slow and really inconvenient. It picks you up in one spot and drops you off at the Movie Theater, no where else. The school has no bus service so if you want that you have to use the public bus. Have a car without one you are stuck on campus of in the immediate surrounding area."
College Senior,2,"I know Rollins College promotes diversity and cultural integration, but I'm not too familiar with the Greek life at Rollins."
College Freshman,2,"Drinking is the most popular activity, but a lot of people smoke marijuana."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Drug Usage – Drugs are definitely used and distributed in some crowds, however it is all about who you are surrounding your self with."
College Freshman,2,"Loves to Give Out Tickets – I received a ticket the second week of school for parking on the wrong floor of the parking garage, not even a warning."
College Freshman,2,"Pretty Strict – The campus is a dry campus and so that means anyone caught with alcohol or drugs gets into a lot of trouble, especially in the freshman dorms. In fact most orientation's someone gets arrested..scary stuff. But if there's someone in danger security will help you out & won't punish those who called for help, which is pretty good."
College Freshman,2,Expensive but Good – The food in the area of Winter Park tends to be very expensive. Its better to just eat in the campus center and use your R Card.
College Sophomore,2,"Parking Sucks. Don't even think about parking on campus unless you're a junior. Tickets are $60 and they give them out like candy. You don't need a car to get around campus, you can walk all the way across campus in under 10 minutes. If you want to leave campus, you'll need a car because the lynx buses are sketchy. Rollins has a bus that goes to and from the Winter Park Village where you can see a movie, go to a restaurant, shop, etc. in the evenings on weekends only."
College Freshman,2,parking is easy to find except it is extremely far away and off campus
College Freshman,2,"Everyone is very similar. This is one thing that Rollins really does lack. Most kids are very wealthy and well off, or at least, act like they are. Most kids do wear expensive clothing and have the rich kid vibe even if they are not one. Rollins does give out a lot of scholarships, but still, most kids are the same. Diversity isn't the best here"
College Junior,2,"Very Limited and Strict – There are not many close available spots on campus. The closest, and always available, parking option is the parking garage which is right next to campus but could be a 5-10 minute walk to and from classes. The parking security is very strict so don't expect to get away with trying to park somewhere for 2 minutes if you are in a hurry."
College Senior,2,"Average Housing at Premium Prices – Although I currently live off campus, I have seen the residence halls when visiting friends on campus. While Rollins has refurbished some of the dorms, and the common areas are redone to be very state-of-the-art and comfortable, the dorm rooms aren't anything exceptional. Not only are rooms small, but in recent years, the College started putting more students in dorm rooms (a single being occupied by two students, etc.) Even so, the cost of living on campus is exceptionally high. Students scrunched into a single ill find they pay for a ""standard double,"" and those fortunate to get a single - as a single- will pay a hefty bill for rooms that look like prison cells. This is probably why the majority of students move off campus as soon as they can."
College Senior,2,"Fairly Strict Campus – Rollins is a very small school so there's no room for on campus partying. Yes you can drink quietly in your room with a friend, but if there are more than 5 people in a room, campus security will probably catch you. It really depends on which officer you get whether or not you'll get into trouble."
College Senior,2,"Roll Coll Boys and Girls – Higher financial bracket, but a serious lack of class. Beautiful people, ugly behavior. This is a high school, not a college."
College Senior,2,"Talented Athletes but Not Much Support – Rollins has very talented athletes in many different sports, from water skiing to soccer. Although we do not have a football team, soccer is the substitution. The soccer team has won many victories and the games are supported but by a small crowd. The other sports are barely attended at all."
College Junior,2,Over Priced but Nice – The off campus housing surrounding Rollins College is too over priced in comparison to living on campus as well as the areas that are being offered. Although some places offered are very nice and updated for their price.
College Sophomore,2,"30% of Rollins is part of greek life, it doesn't determine who you are at school though. Everyone associates with everyone, whether apart of it or not."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Computers are slow, printing in lab Is inconvenient especially if theres a class in the lab"
College Junior,2,Diversity at Rollins? Where? There is no such thing. The school is predominantly white however it boasts being accepting to all races and ethnic backgrounds.
College Sophomore,2,A Lot of Parking Tickets – There are not very many parking options and they give very expensive tickets.
College Sophomore,2,there are not very many parking options and they ticket like noneother..and very expensive tickets.
Senior,1,"Mandatory attendance; if you’re sick or injured you fail. Completely unethical, you should be ashamed of yourselves Rollins college."
Senior,1,"Unethical Organization Full of Corruption; they extort their students. The corrupt president pays his wife six figures per year to assist him with his job (of which he does a terrible job on). This is a horrible place, do not even attend if you receive a full ride."
Niche User,1,"Tone deaf response to problems & organizational irrationality. Not only is there a culture of cheating, its a party school divided by class & race. Students from lower income backgrounds are belittled & often bullied. While there are great students & staff that are great at their job, the layoffs have drained the life out of  what was once a small college with great personal relationships. Rollins College is alot like Supreme, Apple, & any other brand name that is more style than substance."
Freshman,1,"Can’t wait to transfer from Rollins. It’s been a disappointment in many ways. The reputation of a country club school is very close to the reality. The school is full of wealthy, white, average students. Some of my professors have been amazing, but the student body leaves a lot to be desired. I miss being part of a diverse community of intelligent students who work hard and strive for excellence. Rollins has mostly average students who strive for mediocre accomplishments. On the positive, the campus is very pretty."
Sophomore,1,"On tours we were shown beautiful new and clean residence halls. Instead, we were forced to live in old dormitories with black mold for the same room and board cost two years in a row (McKean, Elizabeth Hall, Sutton). Now, in order to lock in a new freshman class they are tearing down Mckean and building a new residence hall. Instead of renting space for students with nowhere to go, they are forced to lived with four other people in a triple in moldy Sutton. Might I mention, I had to go to the hospital twice for breathing issues due to mold there. The college would refuse to acknowledge the issue. This year, the college gave priority to freshman for course selection over sophomores. As a result many sophomores are now forced to graduate later. Also, the food will give you diarrhea every time you eat it. Don’t attend this school. They don’t care about you, they just want to receive money from you, as long as possible. Avoid this school at all costs. Credits don’t transfer."
College Sophomore,1,"The Bursar does NOT care about her students!!! All she cares about is money and does not work with families at all. Almost the entire financial office is rude, disrespectful and NOT helpful."
College Freshman,1,The financial aid process at Rollins College is the absolute worst I would say! They give mostly American citizens and barely give anything to International students! I am personally thinking of transferring as I know for a fact that if I do transfer I will receive financial aid as I currently have a 3.75 GPA in college and had a 3.9 GPA in high school.
College Junior,1,What I have eaten has been poor.
College Freshman,1,"They offer none except the entry scholarship. Which pays for 1/4 of the tuition. It is literally a joke. They just want there money, it seems like they have no thought for the well being or the success of the actual students. All about $$$$$"
College Freshman,1,"Very unhelpful. If you aren't in the same class as the other students (money wise), they could care less about helping you out. I actually got told that they don't offer things regular universities do because then just anybody could come to Rollins.Professors get paid A LOT and take vacations out of the country all the time."
College Freshman,1,"This school is nothing but parties. People write dates and times of parties in chalk on the sidewalks. House parties are literally every other night. Even freshmen host parties in their dorm halls. The first night of orientation my peer mentors said quite a few things about partying. 

""Call us if you're drunk. We will com get you or call a cab""

""As long as you are 18 with an ID and your R-card you can get into the house parties. Friends welcome.""

""Students go clubbing in downtown Orlando every friday and saturday""

They also gave the phone numbers of cab drivers who will bring you back to campus if you're drunk. 

They said if they saw us drinking they would just walk up and say be safe. Even if underage."
College Sophomore,1,The guys and girls at this school are generally pretty snobby because the come from upper class families.
College Junior,1,"I can't complain enough about the dining at Rollins. If you live on campus, its obligatory to have the outrageously overpriced meal plan. The food is horrible quality and I wish I didn't have to eat there. I could easily save 3,000 dollars a year by not eating there."
College Junior,1,"Parking is one thing that Rollins has not figured out. The permit is very inexpensive, but you are lucky to find a spot on campus. The parking garage is not far, but it fills up quickly too and that leaves on the top floor open. Sophomores can only park in the parking garage and freshmen aren't allowed to park on campus. A car is needed for Orlando because there is no public transportation. Parking spaces on campus are frequently closed or blocked off due to events or construction."
College Freshman,1,"This comment on Greek life is going to be very brutally honest... My advice based on personal experience is to be careful of the Kappa's and Phi Delts. You could get really hurt by them. Kappa just lost their house because of bad reports about their behavior from many sources. The way Kappa's and Phi Delt's act is indecent and aloof. As a group their personalities are like knock off Louis Vuitton's. They try to be like the ""popular"" group on campus... talking at people not to them, avoiding people who aren't like them, saying hi to people in a condescending way, giving off mean glares, playing with people's emotions and feelings, creating unnecessary drama, caring only about their appearance, money, and intimidating other people. They think they are better than everyone else but they absolutely are not. In my opinion, they are inferior to others because other people are way more genuine. It is very immature how they act. Honestly, they are the main reason Rollins has such a bad reputation for stuck up rich people. They try so hard to act superior but they aren't fooling anyone and nobody actually wants to be like them. As a group, Kappa's and Phi Delts have a bad reputation. They are bitchy, exclusive, tasteless, drug abusing, stuck up, ass holes, that need a reality check. They need to learn how to be respectful, inclusive, friendly, and courteous of their peers. I sincerely hope they turn a corner. They need it, and Rollins needs it. They knock down and step on others so carelessly and it needs to stop. Where are the hearts of the Kappa's and Phi Delt's??? It makes me sad."
College Freshman,1,"The school spirit at Rollins is not there. Very few students attend games or wear school colors. I have never been to a game where more than 10 students showed up unless it was a required event. If you are looking for school tradition/spirit Rollins is not the place for you. And if you think you can change this, think again. Look for a big division 1 school."
College Sophomore,1,"I've had 4 friends have to leave this school and go to rehab. It makes me sick, I hate this place."
College Sophomore,1,Horrible.  Everybody's BMWs and Ferraris are in the way.  And Campus Security is anal about any sort of violation and gets happy whenever you mess up in the slightest.  They love giving out tickets.
College Freshman,1,The weather in the area changes every five minutes.
College Freshman,1,"Small Selection – There are some good majors here but there is not a large variety to choose from. If you are undecided and you are not sure if you want a liberal arts education, it would probably be better to go to a larger school."

Graduate Student,5,Online classes delivered through ZOOM have been awesome. I've taken online classes with a different University before where there was no video platform and that made me consider other programs. The ZOOM sessions have been great and the instructors do an awesome job preparing for the class. The presentations are the same as you would receive in a classroom. Instructors also stay after the ZOOM class until all students leave the virtual classroom to make sure all questions or concerns are answered. The online platform using ZOOM provides the same level of quality education as attending the class in person.... all from the comfort of your own home and pajamas!
Graduate Student,5,"An excellent university with dedicated and caring staff members. The school is very accommodating to all students and makes everyone feel like a valuable part of the greater community.  I have had the pleasure of dealing with Jacqueline Cruz throughout my enrollment and now educational experience at CCSJ. She is a tremendous asset to CCSJ who goes above and beyond for students in criminal justice programs. All of the staff members I've spoken to at CCSJ have been helpful and prompt in answering questions or resolving any issues. 

Instructors are knowledgeable and experienced in their respective fields. The instructors have also been very accommodating with adult learners and all grading has been completely fair.

I chose CCSJ because of the option to attend classes in person or through Zoom sessions and I've taken advantage of both. Both platforms have unique benefits but CCSJ and the instructors do an excellent job of delivering on both platforms. I'm happy to be a student of CCSJ!"
Alum,5,"I earned a Master's Degree from this institution. The college offered classes on the main campus, downtown Chicago, Chicago Heights, and also via Zoom. They bend over backwards to make classes available to people who are in the workforce and who must balance work, school, and life. 

The instructors are top notch and many are active in the fields in which they teach. The institution also works with the student to obtain financial aid be it scholarships, grants, etc. 

They want you to succeed. I am proud to be an alumnus of Calumet College of St. Joseph."
Niche User,5,"The Public Safety Program is great and I recommend it, everyone from Public Safety Program (Coordinator Jacqueline Cruz & Professors) number one priority is you. Their enthusiasm and care for your success shows."
Niche User,5,Online courses are done with Zoom and blackboard and it’s easy to learn and understand. I’m not a computer savvy but I’m able to do the course online  and they also provide an IPad that you can use to facilitate your Courses assignment.
Alum,5,"Public Safety Program This college allows first responders an opportunity to go to class day or evening. The program has staff , that are mainly active and retired first responders and military. It gives the students an education that includes policy and procedure and actual experience."
Alum,5,Public Safety program . This program was really prepared as morning classes were already on Zoom. It was a smooth transition
Graduate Student,5,"If you want a top notch education where you can be safe in the comforts of your home while activity interacting with well seasoned Professors, I encourage you to reach out to the Calumet College of St. Joseph admission staff and get registered. I got my BA and now enrolled in the Master's Degree Program. Out of all the schools that I could have gone too, I'm glad I chose Calumet first.  You will not be disappointed. Your education deserves the best and that's what you'll get if you're a student at Calumet."
Graduate Student,5,I graduated with my BA in Public Safety Management and now I'm currently enrolled in the Master's Degree Program. The Zoom Classes are excellent and safe with all that's going on. You still get the privilege of being one on one with the Professor while being safe at the same time. I wouldn't change anything at this point because I don't see any reason too
Sophomore,5,The online experience was something that was handled really well by my professors. We used Zoom and Microsoft teams which were both useful tools. I thought for being thrown for a loop that my professors handled the situation very well and taught there curriculum perfectly
Senior,5,"Overall CCSJ is a great school. Professors really want you to succeed as a student and individual. The campus is small, but that’s why you always feel welcomed."
Senior,5,"When looking at schools, I wanted to be different from everyone else, I wanted to attend a small school where people and my professors actually wanted t get to know me, and I am so happy that I committed to CCSJ, because I am forever grateful for all the friends and family I have gained over the past four years!"
Senior,5,"I love the small class sizes and that everyone is treated like family, we are all so close together that we form such special bonds!"
Junior,5,"I love the tight-knit family feel of the school. Since the student/teacher ratio is so small, I feel like I get the best education because I get that one on one time with my professors and peers. I love the athletic department. I fit right in and Calumet College was the best possible decision for me."
Junior,5,"Calumet College is a small school, which I love. The atmosphere is positive and you know everybody. The teachers always work with you even if you need time outside of class, they’ll always work with you."
Alum,5,I loved the close nit family atmosphere.   I also like the fact the professors are hands on and are always available for us 24/7 if needed be.  They really take the time to get to know us.  We are not just a number at CCSJ.
Freshman,5,"I like college because of how small it is. You meet so many different people from totally different backgrounds and its fun to be around. The chemistry with teachers in class is great. You're always one on one with teachers every time in class. So if you need help with any subject. It's easy to find help.  Also, there is always something to do at school."
Niche User,5,"My experience at this school was great. It's a small school with so much to offer. From helpful, pleasant staff, to energetic, motivated students, the school is an all round great college!"
Senior,5,"Calumet College of St. Joseph has been a great school. Many of the staff members have a lot knowledge to share and different methods to do so. The class size is small, which allows a better learning experience, and there a lot of opportunities around campus. I won't say is a perfect school, but unlike many others school, here you have the chance to leave your print."
College Sophomore,5,I've loved the professors. They work with what they have. I think it should be harder.
Alum,4,"Online classes were offered via the Zoom platform. I prefer classroom  instruction but Zoom was sufficient. Going forward, I expect more classes nationwide to be on Zoom, WebX, or Blackboard."
Junior,4,"To start, this school is average, mediocre, if you want some professors that provide no leniency then this is the school for. If you want kids to treat you like you don’t belong or judge you for minor things, then this school is for you. To say the least, the experience here is less than average. Although there are staff members that love being there & treat kids respectfully so the place is not all bad."
Freshman,4,Online courses are good if you are able to stay focus and get everything done on time. These classes are for people that are good with time management but overall these courses are good.
Freshman,4,"This has been a school for a new beginning. For me, this has been a new start and something that has completely change my life and who I am. I’m proud to say I’m apart of this school."
Sophomore,4,I like the family environment at Calumet College. When I began college I was nervous but that all went out the door after my first week at Calumet College. The professors dedicate there time to helping the students but at the same time push the students to there full potential
Junior,4,The transfer process was very easy. Everyone is pretty nice and friendly. The school is very big and diverse. I can not wait to start my junior year there. I am ready to start my basketball career. I am sure we are going to have a fun season.
College Sophomore,4,"Everybody knows everybody. Therefore, it's hard to do something you're not suppose to do and get away with it. We're all friends at this school."
College Junior,4,"I love that my school is community based. It's a small campus so you get to know everyone. The security guard is even cool with all the students. I even had a conversation with him one day about me arriving late to class. He told me to be on time because missing a class is missing a mission impossible. Everyone is also friendly. Even if you're struggling in a class, there's the tutoring center and other professors that are willing to help."
College Freshman,4,"CCSJ is a small family oriented school where I feel safe and at home, like I am  getting my money's worth, and that I am getting a good education."
College Junior,4,I love the smaller classes I feel it gives the teacher a stronger ability to help students understand assignments
College Senior,4,There are a wide range of programs to choose from. Some are accelerated and some are regular. They truly want everyone to graduate. I am in now a accelerated program for pre-law/paralegal. I have great teachers who now what they are talking about.
College Senior,4,There are plenty of computers to use and internet WiFi service.
College Senior,4,There is plenty of parking. There is no spot that is 'far' away.
College Senior,4,There are many different restaurants located around the school that were in close driving distance
College Senior,4,The professors take their job seriously and take time to make sure that you understand what is being presented to you
College Junior,4,"There are the usual commercial restaurants.  The campus is surrounded by many enthic restaurants and take outs that include Mexican, Italian and Chinese.  I'm sure I'm forgetting some."
College Junior,4,"I have class one day a week for 3 hours long. For me this is the best schedule. The work load is a bit tough, but this is what Major I am going for and I am learning a lot. The professor are the best because what they teach is what they are doing everyday."
College Junior,4,Great Teachers – You will learn. Your teachers are very experienced in there subject because they have actually work in their field that they are teaching.
College Junior,4,There is a wide range of races and religion. You don't feel out of place.
College Sophomore,4,Amazing Staff and Great Classes – Calumet College of St. Joseph has amazing professors that are always willing to help and it feels like they are personally invested in their students education. You get individual attention and can always find a helping hand.
College Sophomore,2,I am a catcher on the baseball team and the school can't even fund catcher's gear for us; we have to buy our own.  The weight room in our athletic building is absolutely terrible and unsafe to work out in. Half of the equipment in the weight room doesn't work. The school doesn't have enough money to fully fund all the sports with all the equipment they need.
College Junior,2,"Unfortunately, in the area where the school is located there isn't any other options besides the public transportation that runs every hour.  Most kids live close to campus and can walk or ride their bikes if they do not have a reliable vehicle.  Others do not have very many options which can cause a problem if your vehicle happens to break down and no one can drive you to school for classes."
College Sophomore,2,"Nice Little Town but Not So Pretty. Whiting has the charm of a smaller town with the convenience of being near a big city; Chicago, IL. There are plenty of fests, parades, parks, and we even have our own little theater to visit. Although Whiting is a great place, our appearance is over shadowed by the BP refineries which cause so much pollution."
College Junior,2,"It's Available – Popular transportation includes the bus (not provided by the school), walking and driving."
College Sophomore,1,"Calumet College of Saint Joseph's does not have any type of campus housing. You are forced to get an apartment or house off campus, which is terrible for freshmen and international students."
College Sophomore,1,I've never met any alumni... Really wouldn't know they exist...
College Sophomore,1,There are no dorms... No meal plans... No campus life... Completely boring...
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life. NONE. I've checked.........
College Sophomore,1,No one cares about the sports teams. The sports teams don't even care about the sports teams.
College Junior,1,Our school doesn't even have dorms. Their supposedly working on building them. Athletes are the only ones with apartments within the neighborhood. Though they have to walk a few miles to get to school.
College Junior,1,I remember our school hosting an event about Greek life but nobody cared.
College Senior,1,"There is no cafeteria full of selections and restaurants, instead there is a small stand with very few selections."
College Junior,1,"You won't find Greek life on or off campus. In fact, neither frats nor sororities exist here."
College Senior,1,"Less Than Satisfactory – The financial aid process at my college has been quite a hassle since I have been there. The application of aid was questionable to me at the beginning and it was only until after I chose to attend there that they fully explained to me how the financial aid process worked. At times when I would go in to get some questions answered, I was, in my opinion, treated less than cordially. Overall, the financial aid department could be run in a much better manner."
College Senior,1,"housing in the area is cheap, but low quality. bedrooms in the apartments are like closets. the landlords are not receptive to students living the 'college lifestyle'."
College Junior,1,"Sports suck. Classes suck.  The people in charge really suck.  The only good thing about this place is that you can do absolutely nothing, get passed and graduate.  You want to be lazy but still make your parents proud? Come here.  You have no talent? Play sports here.  Can't read? Take criminal justice with brown.  He'll read to you and give you the answers to the test.  My friends all passed his classes with c's because he doesn't do grades right."
College Junior,1,"They Don't Care – They all act like they care but they don't.  You can sleep in class, miss class and get your grades changed because they are to worried you will leave school for a real college.  Only a couple teachers are jerks because they think they at a real school."
College Junior,1,"Crimson Wave Says It All – No support.  Soccer coach is a.d. and spend all the money on his team.  whatever is left goes to basketball.  The voleyball team hasn't won a game in forever but yet he is still a coach.  Facilities are pathetic but everyone says their great.  Coaches need help, and scholarships are horrible.  How do they expect us to compete when the other schools have way more than us? Its a joke, man. A freakin joke."

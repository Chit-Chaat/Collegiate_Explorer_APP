Freshman,5,My online classes and professors are still great and make it personal. They really care about what kind of education you're getting.
Freshman,5,"It has a beautiful campus. The campus is small but big enough, the perfect size. The professors truly care about you and actually want to know you and call you by name. Class sizes are small enough that it's personal. The food is great. Housing is nice."
Freshman,5,Incredible school full of incredible people. The academics here are top notch and the faculty and staff really believe in providing a quality education to all students.
Niche User,5,Everything that I have experienced at Presbyterian College has been good. I have felt like I have a new family ever since I applied!
Freshman,5,"I am currently a student at Presbyterian College.  It's a very small school with about 65% of the student body being athletes.  The campus is beautiful and there is a lot of community and alumni support.  The staff and professors are dedicated to their students' success on and off the campus.  
I am still very new to the campus, but so far my experience has been awesome.  There are graduate programs for those looking to extend their education into a master's program.  
Athletics are exciting at Presbyterian.  Football, baseball, soccer,gynmastics, golf, and basketball or some of the many sports we have here at Presby.  The student-athletes are just that, students AND athletes.  Coaches want to ensure their athletes' success in the classroom and the field, court or mats.  Study hall is required for freshman and highly recommended after that.
This is going to be and has been an exciting time in my life and looking forward to the rest of my time here on campus."
Alum,5,I graduated from PC in the late 80’s and sent two of my daughters there. I love the family feel on campus and after graduation. I received and excellent education and am working on my PhD. A great place to grow into adulthood.
Sophomore,5,The professors are absolutely amazing and strive to do their very best inside and outside of the classroom. They really take the time to get to know their students.
Sophomore,5,I just transferred to Presbyterian College from a community college in Florida and I love pc and wouldn't change a thing about it.
Works Here,5,"Great small town community. Everyone is friendly and helpful. Most faculty and staff are devoted to their work and are essential in empowering the Promise of PC initiative for students and potential students. It is a small, yet beautiful campus. I hate that they don't offer my major; otherwise, I would consider continuing my education there! The only downside is the price of tuition and fees. I recommend the campus life and feel of the college. The academics here seem to be highly respected and prestigious, and the student life departments appear to be very active in reaching out to students in and outside of the classroom."
Freshman,5,I have spoken to and met with coaches from this school.  They leave a great impression.  I have also never heard anything negative from other students.
Sophomore,5,"A school’s size may be a deciding factor for a lot of students when choosing their school. I never thought that I would want to go to a small private school, but now I couldn’t imagine going to a large college! It is so nice knowing all of my professors personally and having them know me as well. It makes SUCH a huge difference when it comes to your studies! There is a huge difference in attending a lecture with 20 people than attending a lecture with 500+."
Sophomore,5,The School is a great place to get a great education. The campus is like a small community inside a large community. As a student you don’t have to leave campus unless you would like to . The campus stores had everything you wanted and needed . I can’t wait to go back .
Sophomore,5,"I love the  campus life, great students and faculty make PC very much like home to me. It is in a little small town with lots of history and character."
Sophomore,5,I currently finished my Freshman year and I can say that I have really enjoyed it . The best part about this year is the friends that I have made because I was so afraid that I would not make many or any. The campus is very nice and clean they take very great care of the campus the grass is basically cut almost everyday.Most of the teachers are helpful and make office hours so that you will be able to get help.
Sophomore,5,Loved the academic program there at PC. Professors are great and a small family oriented place in a quiet Southern town.
Freshman,5,"Presbyterian College is a great place for any type of student. From athletes looking for competitive NCAA Division I teams, academias looking for top-notch classes with engaged professors, social butterflies looking for campus involvement and nightlife, they have something for everyone! Although Presbyterian is small, it has a large school social and athletic life, while still maintaining small class sizes so that you get the most out of every experience. The only thing I would like to see change is the food, it does leave a little to be desired on days!"
College Sophomore,5,The professors really encourage internships and help make them possible in the best way. We also have an amazing tutoring center on campus.
College Sophomore,5,I love PC! I can not wait to graduate and be an Alum of an amazing school!
College Sophomore,5,"Greek life is the best! We unfortunately do not have sorority housing, which I wish we did but the sisters and brothers are a great part of PC!"
College Sophomore,5,Presbyterian has great athletic facilities for the student athletes to use!
College Sophomore,5,I love Presbyterian College! It is a great school with great professors!
College Junior,5,"Because PC is a small school, there are a lot of small class sizes. PC also does a good job of making sure each student gets the classes they need. Many students are involved in research programs. The professors are really supportive."
College Junior,5,"Small town college, super safe. I walk back to my dorm alone at night from the library sometimes and I don't feel unsafe at all. Campus police is friendly and reliable."
College Junior,5,"There are three sororities and they're all fairly large. The sororities take do a good job during recruitment. There are a bunch of fraternities. The fraternity houses are where most of the campus parties during the weekend and they're usually open to all students, but you do have to check in."
College Junior,5,"Athletics is a big part of campus life. Blue Hose are known for being good at supporting eachother so there's always good turnout at the games, and Hoseville is always fun! Intramural sports is also a big part of social life at PC."
College Junior,5,"I absolutely love my school. The professors really care about helping you succeed, and everyone is very friendly."
College Freshman,5,PC has been great for me. I know one hundred percent that it is where I belong. Go Blue Hose!
College Freshman,5,"Thankfully i received a dorm close to all my classes, however, a little walk to the dinning hall and frat houses."
College Freshman,5,Greek life is very important at PC. Almost everyone is in either a sorority or fraternity.
College Freshman,5,Even though we do not win every game we still cheer on our team.
College Freshman,5,Presbyterian college is great! The atmosphere makes you feel like home and the town people are amazing and very friendly.
College Freshman,5,The academics of PC are very rigorous. Professors make sure each curriculum is extremely thorough in making sure each student learns the needed material. The material is difficult and requires a lot of hard work and perseverance but it is nothing a diligent student cannot handle.
College Freshman,5,"Safety on campus is not an issue. I could immediately sense this during freshmen orientation when my orientation leaders were so comfortable in telling us that is was okay to leave out suitcases out until our rooms were ready because nothing is ever stolen on campus. It is extremely rare for anything to be stolen and if by chance someone does steal something, campus police takes care of it right away. It isn't uncommon for students to leave their rooms unlocked or leave their laptops on a desk in the library when they need to leave and go get a snack. I feel completely comfortable leaving the library at midnight and walking the short distance back to my dorm in the dark by myself because I know the safety of my campus if incredible."
College Freshman,5,"All of my courses so far have been excellent. The academic rigor is difficult but nothing unbearable as long as the student is ready to put in a long of hard work and studying. Most of my professors have been very flexible and knowledgeable. Some just do not teach the way I like to learn, which therefore it was up to me to study harder to learn the material, but that is no wrong doing of the professor. There is a great variety of courses offered but as an underclassmen it can sometimes be difficult getting into the necessary classes because the class sizes are so small and fill up quickly during registration. But with the class sizes being very small gives the advantage of a lot of one on one time with all the professors and an easier time for discussion in class."
College Freshman,5,"My experience at Presbyterian College has been more than I could have ever dreamed of. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of my classes, especially the ones related to my choice of major, biology. The rigorous academics have already pushed me to better myself as a student and individual. In one semester, I have made more life long friends and memories than I did all throughout high school. The best part of my experience so far has been being a part of the women's lacrosse team. The team is like a second family to me and I will always be able to count on them. I know that my next four years here with be as exciting, memorable, and educational as this first semester."
College Sophomore,5,Presbyterian College gives wonderful scholarships
College Sophomore,5,Our Greek Life is very involved on and off campus. All of the sororities and fraternities get along most of the time. There is definitely Greek Unity!
College Freshman,5,"While on campus, you generally don't think about your safety because there are never any crimes. "
College Freshman,5,"The atmosphere is incredible. Most of the time you know all of your classmates because it is such a small school, and you become well connected with facility and staff. "
College Sophomore,5,"Professors truly love and know their subjects, we have a range of knowledgeable professors in every subject. From Shakespeare to Southern Studies in the English department, Asian wars and culture to Women and their contribution throughout history in the History Department, to plants and vertebrates in the Biology department. We truly have a well rounded staff of professors that are passionate about their subjects.  "
College Sophomore,5,I'm an English and History double major and it is absolutely amazing! I couldn't see myself majoring in either subject anywhere else!!!
College Sophomore,5,"I love it at PC, this is why I'm applying for scholarships so I can continue my education there. I do not want to be anywhere else, or even like the idea of another university. PC is truly a school that focus on community and helping one another, I feel safe and happy there. Everyone is friendly and the staff is always willing to help out, the professors are amazing and truly brilliant in their field of studies. "
College Freshman,5,"The local atmosphere around Presbyterian College is one of a small town - easy-going and safe. The only pitfall of attending a school located in a small town is the lack of restaurants and shopping centers, but there are malls within one hour of PC."
College Freshman,5,"There were no abnormalities in application and admission was simple. If there were any problems, they were easily overcome with a conversation with my academic adviser."
College Freshman,5,"In any department of my college, one will find that most, if not all, instructors are doctors in their field. They are very knowledgeable in their subjects and very open for discussion. I never meet an obstacle when in need to converse on work or if I have questions on careers. My campus is fairly small and all of my professors know my name."
College Senior,5,The Fraternity houses are where most people go to party on the weekends. It is very fun and available for all years. Music is usually pretty good and the people are awesome.
College Freshman,5,"While Presbyterian College is located in the small town of Clinton, an upside is the feeling of being in a safe and secure atmosphere yet still getting the college experience. Though there isn't much in Clinton, its not too far from Greenville or Spartanburg where there is plenty to do. It is also pretty much exactly between Clemson and USC in case you want to visit some friends for the weekend. PC is also full of diversity and accepting students with friendly attitudes. I wouldn't trade it for the world!"
College Sophomore,5,The teachers are great. They push me to work hard and expect me to do well. The department has limited resources but is creative enough to make the best out of what we have.
College Sophomore,5,The weather is sometimes sunny and sometimes it rains fiercely. The weather is exciting.
College Freshman,5,"Parking on campus is a easy task. There are lots in front of evey dorm and also located at Springs and behind Greenville Dining Hall. The permit cost is a little high, but it gets higher if you do not purchase by a certain date. The need for a car is optional. If you like to get out and go places then yes. I lived without a car for my first semester. It wasn't to bad but I was glad to have it for my seconf semester."
College Freshman,5,"Presbyterian has a dress code called Snappy Casual. It is known for their well looking students. Social life is huge, because the school is so small you know everyone and everyone knows you."
College Freshman,5,"I love the weather here! Since the dorms and academic buildings are so close, weather doesn't really affect us too much. A little layering always helps when it gets colder, but overall the weather here is great."
College Sophomore,5,"No Need for Buses – We have no need for buses, public transportation, or anything of that sort because our campus is not as a big as other campuses, which makes the dorms quite close to the buildings, that the classes are in. And for that I am grateful because I could not bare the thought of taking public transportation just to get to my class.However, if a person wants to drive to class, there are some classes that may be a bit far from some dorms, so they have parking for any lazy students who want to drive and avoid a little exercise. But other than this option there is no real NEED for public transportation."
College Freshman,5,"Different Range of People. Just like anywhere else, there's a wide range of people here. The majority of the school population is involved in Greek life and so people dress really well on days where they have to dress up for Greek life.  Otherwise, people dress casually but not trashy, and most of the guys are hot, as well."
College Freshman,5,"There isn't a regular bus, but it's easy to walk everywhere you need to be. On weekends, there is the Pondo Shuttle to take people back and forth between the fraternity houses and the dorms so that people aren't tempted to drive while drunk."
College Freshman,5,"The facilities are clean and nice, but it's partially up to the students to keep them that way by not vandalizing."
College Senior,5,"Go Greek! Greek Life is the main event on the Presbyterian College campus. If you are not involved in Greek Life, well you are not involved in PC. There are several to choose from, but all of them get along so well. There is no competition, we are all there to have fun. Even if you are not involved in Greek Life, you can still attend the parties and have fun!"
College Sophomore,5,"Love Em – The student gym was recently renovated within the past few years I believe so it has relatively new equipment. All treadmills, bikes, and the ellipticals have tvs. There is also a gymnasium on the second floor where everyone loves to play. The library is a great place to study or stay up late and keep people from studying!"
College Sophomore,5,LOVE IT – Living on campus is amazing at PC. You are a five min walk to anywhere on campus and you see everyone all the time. You can wake up late for class and still have enough time to get ready and grab breakfast! Some of the dorms are a little bit further away from the classes but that means they are closer to the food! :D
College Junior,5,The Process Is Very Simple – All do is fill out your FAFSA and PC takes care of the rest. If you need more money they will work with you to help you find and get more.
Senior,4,This is a very small school in an even smaller town but the education there is amazing and the professors are the best part of the school.
Sophomore,4,I like the group of people that i connect with there. Small school is good to get to know a lot of people
Sophomore,4,Love my professors and can't wait to say that I will be an alumni in 2 years! The campus is beautiful. The best part is that people are always walking their dogs on campus.
Junior,4,Great college with awesome and knowledgeable professors. Small school so you will recognize almost everyone. The average class size is about 15-20. Very diverse.
Sophomore,4,"Presbyterian College is a very unique college in more than one way. For one it is very small and at first I was not a big fan of that but now I really like that component of it. Everyone is like a big family there, and the faculty and staff really do care about you as an individual, which I love."
Junior,4,"I love PC but it would be nice to have better housing available or more class options. It’s also very hard because we don’t have kitchens, and I’m gluten free and vegetarian so the dining hall usually only has one or two options for me. But the students are alright, it could be more diverse, the professors are really sweet, and the campus is cute."
Freshman,4,"I love the people, professors, and class sizes.  The town is really small, as is the student population.  I would like to see more students enrolled (just about 1,000 more) and more things to do off of campus."
College Sophomore,4,PC does everything in their power to stop sexual assaults or to help combat them after they might happen.
College Sophomore,4,Campus housing is the next thing on the list to be renovated and they have already started! PC is growing rapidly and the facilities show it!
College Junior,4,The career services office is always open and they have very helpful meetings by appointment.
College Junior,4,"The only problem I've had is with some mold, but maintenance will come clean it. I like the layout options for dorms. There are a lot that are suite style and some hall but my most recent room had a small bathroom in it for just my roommate and I. There are also senior apartments on campus and then senior apartments slightly off campus across from fraternitity court that are also nice."
College Sophomore,4,You're not just a number here; the professors know your name.
College Sophomore,4,In order to graduate you're required to either study abroad or hold an internship; this alone gives students an edge over the competition.
College Sophomore,4,It feels a lot like your stereotypical suburbs at night.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorm rooms are bigger than a lot of big schools, but the buildings are pretty old and could use a few updates."
College Sophomore,4,Tailgating is always a highlight of football season.
College Sophomore,4,At PC you actually get to know your professors and therefore feel more comfortable coming to them with any questions you might have.
College Junior,4,"ok dorms,  well maintained buildings and grounds"
College Junior,4,"community support, top notch work out gym, spirtt"
College Junior,4,"I am enjoying the school, staff and friends met."
College Freshman,4,They take our safety very seriously!
College Freshman,4,The professors are very helpful & personable!
College Freshman,4,I personally love Greek life!
College Freshman,4,The faculty is very helpful when it comes time to helping students find internships and job offers. The network of alumni is incredible due to the fact the it is such a small school that creates a time nit community of people.
College Freshman,4,"There are plenty of good dorm options on campus. The best dorm by far is all male (rumored to become coed soon) is Georgia. It is the newest, cleanest and coolest. The best for female freshmen would be Smyth. It is a neat set up with two rooms but no door and hall style bathroom. As for other dorms, some are older and some newer but for the most part all are adequate for living, you just have to make the best of the situation. For upperclassmen their are senior apartments and townhouses that are available by GPA. The social atmosphere on campus is amazing. It is very family-like and it's hard to feel homesick when you're out and about. Everyone is very nice, friendly and helpful including the professors and other faculty.The housing process was fairly easy. There is a website for incoming freshmen where you create a profile and find people that could be potential matches and you can contact them."
College Junior,4,"PC has a sense of community unlike any of the other colleges I had visited and applied for during the application process. There really is an atmosphere of friendliness here that makes you feel like you've just come home again, but this home is somewhat different, of course. The professors know you by name and help you to get the best education you can get from this school. The English department even sent me a birthday card in my freshman year, which really sticks out to me because it shows that those professors of the English department really care about me and want me to succeed in my college career and beyond."
College Freshman,4,"I haven't started yet, but based on my visits I am extremely excited!"
College Sophomore,4,I didn't have any trouble getting the money I needed.
College Sophomore,4,The campus police are very nice if you are nice to them. Our school has a very strict Honor Code so no one wants to get anyone in trouble unless what is going on could potentially hurt someone.
College Sophomore,4,"There are not any good bars around, but the fraternities throw very good parties Thursday-Saturday."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletic department is great, but they could step up on their game a little."
College Sophomore,4,The majors of study Presbyterian College offers are all great and challenging. I would like it though if the school would broaden its majors in the arts. Dance and Dance Education would be great majors or even minors to start with.
College Sophomore,4,"One of the professors in the Accounting department is not the easiest to deal with, but the other ones are super nice and fun to be around. Dr. Alphonso in the Sociology department is very nice and a wonderful professor."
College Freshman,4,"we pretty much have plenty of good food everyday,"
College Freshman,4,only seniors get to leave off campus housing
College Freshman,4,Most students on campus are athletes who are friendly and smart. 
College Freshman,4,"I don't go out to parties, but they seems to be great. "
College Sophomore,4,"We have two computers labs available to students, plus the library. Printing and internet is free and wireless in the labs. Recently the campus has become completely wi-fi friendly as well. We also have Ethernet options in dorm rooms if wireless is not your forte.   "
College Sophomore,4,"While the weather can get a little chilly, it is wonderful. It snows about every two years, so that might be a problem for some. PC weather will range from hot in the beginning of the school year, to cold by December, so no matter what type of weather you prefer PC will have it!!!"
College Sophomore,4,Presbyterian College has wonderful science buildings and our English/History/Foreign Language/Religion building is a vital part of PC life.
College Junior,4,Everything is there if needed. Free for students to use.
College Junior,4,"Beautiful campus, new equipments, experience staffs, and friendly community."
College Sophomore,4,"Great weather all the time, never to hot or cold. Fall is the best season because it is just cool enough to wear sweaters."
College Senior,4,"Presbyterian College is very strict with the rules. The college is a place where students can have fun, form great relationships and obtain an awesome education. With success like this, PC must maintain a strict level towards school policies."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is very much a part of PC, but athletes don't have time and are discouraged from pledging fraternities and sororites. You can still go to some Greek functions if you're non-Greek."
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus.  Campus Security is there and they will catch you if you walk outside a building with a beer in your hand.  Have to pay a fine and attend a class
College Freshman,4,It's a small school but there are plenty of opportunities to find friends of the opposite sex. Everyone takes pride in their appearance.
College Freshman,4,There have been a couple of scares in the past but I generally feel safe.
College Sophomore,4,"If you get good grades in highschool, participate in leadership/ volunteer activities in highischool, and participate in the music program  and athletics while at the college, you will get lots of scholarships."
College Freshman,4,I got a fair amount of financial aid from the school but the school is very expensive in the first place.
College Freshman,4,There are many types of people on the campus but there isn't a large number of these different people.
College Freshman,4,"There's always a spot and as long as you don't park somewhere you shouldn't, tickets are not given out."
College Freshman,4,"I usually have my own laptop, so I cannot say that I've made full use of the computer labs. Whenever I enter the library, though, there is always a computer or two available. One must pay a fee in order to print, and the hours are a little strange, but it is affordable and the printing station is never crowded; it's best to have your own printer in your dorm in case of emergencies, such as late papers. The network in the public areas are reliable, but there is no or little wireless connection in the dorms."
College Freshman,4,"The classes remain small, so instruction stays personal; it's terribly difficult to go unnoticed in class. The professors are approachable and are there to teach, not to publish work or research, so a student is never brushed off or ignored. The general education curriculum is wide ranging and gives each student plenty of experience before deciding on a major. The workload is strenuous, but not overbearing unless one's schedule is arranged in a stressful manner (i.e. too many classes)."
College Freshman,4,"Drugs are not prevalent on campus, and usage is quickly reprimanded with proper consequences. Drinking is controlled."
College Freshman,4,"The local atmosphere is Southern Hospitality at its best. Although there is very little to do in the actual town of Clinton, Greenville is not too far away and is a great city to get away to on the weekends. The people in Clinton are extremely nice."
College Freshman,4,There's always something going on and I love the small community feel.
College Freshman,4,The people here are really nice and relatively attractive. There's a lot of different types of people here because there's a lot of international students and just students from across the country. I really like the student population.
College Sophomore,4,There are only two options for dining on campus. Greenville dining hall and Springs are the two dining options. They are both really good but they tend to get old. Greenville dining hall has really good Thanksgiving Lunch and other special meals. Springs is good for on the go meals.
College Sophomore,4,most of the students dress similar. Many girls in sororities have to dress up weekly for chapter. Many students dress down for class. Lots of students go to the fraternity houses on the weekends.
Sophomore,2,"Presbyterian College is a great school to get an education. However it is not the best school to meet life long friends. The people here are friendly but not very accepting. My first year at PC the professors were great but now that I'm a sophomore, new professors have been rolling through and have not been doing a great job teaching or getting to know their students well. I came to PC because I thought that the professors would at least care a little about their students since the teacher to student ratio is so small compared to other college campuses. But at the end of the day, getting a diploma is all that matters. I used to play football for PC (another big reason that I came here), but I quit because the coaches does not care about anything but winning and they are not player coaches."
College Freshman,2,Football is only team with good facilities.
College Sophomore,2,There is one dining hall and it is only open for limited hours. They have really nice food when there are visits from potential students but the selection is pretty bad the rest of the time. On the weekends the offerings are meager at best.
College Sophomore,2,"It's in the middle of nowhere, SC. There wouldn't be much if the school wasn't here. Plus the school makes you live on campus for 3 years so they can scalp you for paying for the dining hall and paying for a dorm room."
College Sophomore,2,"PC doesn't really like the idea of students living off-campus. It is partially because we're big on being a 'community' of students and living as such, but living off-campus is an option if you look into it."
College Sophomore,2,"Drugs and alcohol is pretty easy to get a hold of if you really wanted to drink or do drugs, students pretty much drink every weekend. While drugs is something that I do not personally see being consumed on campus, I know it occurs. Peer pressure to drink or do drugs is non-existent though, it is the consumer's choice to do either. However, the general rule when drinking is to never accept a drink from another individual, pour your own drink and watch it. "
College Freshman,2,"The dorms at Presbyterian College are in acceptable condition. They aren't fantastic, but they are not terrible either. The food on campus is horrible, though and the only alternative in town is pizza or McDonalds."
College Freshman,2,Varsity sports at PC are usually disappointing. We loose most games in a variety of sports.
College Sophomore,2,"What on earth IS this town? I would not recommend coming to this school if you're looking for an exciting nightlife.....or day life for that matter. Clinton is small, generally poor, and boring. Bilo is the largest shop here. There's no where to eat unless you feel like McDonald's, Taco Bell, Sonic, pizza or burgers. Nothing really goes on. The buildings are mostly old, but not in the cool rustic sense, in the old. Old. Old sense. This might be a good place for someone who is looking for some peace and quiet"
College Sophomore,2,"While I think our campus is very welcoming, accepting, and kind to what students we have here who ARE more diverse, we are about a 90% traditional school. White, young, straight out of highschool, and mommy and daddy pay for the bills. I am 24, and have returned to school for another degree. This campus is not very accomodating to the student with a fulltime job, we offer no online or evening classes, and we expect students to come almost daily for class. I have seen probably thirty students of different ethnicity my entire year here, and we are a primarily christian school. We do have several international students, and the teachers and faculty are very pleasant to what few unique students are here"
College Sophomore,2,"Look, this is Clinton. This is a SAD town with very few dining options, and even fewer GOOD dining options. We have a Sonic, we have Dempsey's, we have a burger joint, we might even have one or two scary chinese buffets. I for one, do not enjoy eating in this town. Food on campus is much better"
College Sophomore,2,"Totally Safe – I feel completely safe at campus simply because I know that none of the students would do anything to harm me. However, if the student body were dangerous, I wouldn't count on Campus Police to come to the rescue. They don't actually enforce the rules which they try so hard to scare us into following with lengthy lectures."
College Sophomore,2,There is no parking available and not much off campus housing.
College Freshman,2,"Because Clinton itself is so small, there aren't many off-campus dining options besides fast food restaurants."
College Sophomore,2,"PC gives a good amount of scholarship, but compared to the total tuition, most scholarships barely make a dent in the total."
College Sophomore,2,"It Could Be Smoother – The financial aid office handles business, however in my personal experience the financial aid office takes three days to even a week to contact you back on simple questions. But there are sometimes when the assistant in the financial aid office is very helpful with answering my questions in a timely manner. I still think that communication between the students and the financial aid office is lacking big time because they take forever to get back to you about money for YOUR education there. But a tip I would give for incoming freshmen would be: fill out you FASFA info as soon as the application is available for the next school year and stay on the people in the financial aid because they sometimes forget just how important their job is."
College Sophomore,2,"Currently, we do not have on campus parking. It is being paved."
College Senior,2,Fraternity Houses – If you want to go out you have to go to fraternity houses.  There is a drunk bus that carries students back and forth.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Trying, but Not There. PC tries. The Multicultural Student Union was getting big when I graduated in 2000, and there's a bigger emphasis on internationals than when I was there. But it's still dominated by southerners and white, protestant southerners in particular. Greek life is VERY homogenous - especially for women."
College Sophomore,2,Not Too Much – there are some cute small town restaurants around which everyone should check out. Then there is also the chain fast food restaurants like McDs and Bojangles. Our personal favorite is WaHo as it and McDs are the only two things open late (after 11 on the week nights).
Niche User,1,"Went there as an international student back in 2011.
Faced racism and the staff that were there to support international students were basically useless as well. No diversity and inclusion at all. 
Professors were great but the overall experience was very disappointing ."
Niche User,1,Don't have anything to say. Not applicable as I have never enrolled for online learning at Presbyterian College.
Senior,1,"I am graduating a year early from PC because it is extremely detrimental to my mental health to be at this school. I have been sexually assaulted, drugged, and witnessed racism, sexism and hate speech from students and staff. I am not the only one to have experience this many other LGBTQ+ individuals, women, and people of color on campus have felt the effects of this toxic campus. Please if you are considering coming to PC do not."
College Sophomore,1,It is very bad. It would probably be better if there were no off-campus restaraunts. I can't think of any that I would recommend to a person.
College Freshman,1,"There is essentially no night-life to speak of. The frat houses are open to all students, but you have to sign in and are given a specific color of bracelet depending on your age. There are at least ten cops that patrol the area to ensure that there is no under age drinking and that the music is not played too loud. There are also not alternatives in an hour radius from Clinton. Don't fo to Presbyterian College is you want to attend even one good party during your college years."
College Junior,1,Presbyterian College only allows part time students and students that are independents to live off campus. The only other way you can live off campus is if you are going to the Pharmacy School.

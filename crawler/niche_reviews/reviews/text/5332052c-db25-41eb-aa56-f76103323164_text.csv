Alum,5,I took a total of 3 classes online and I am SO glad I did. It allowed me to have a more flexible schedule. I saw no difference in the quality of work! I enjoyed my experience.
Alum,5,"I graduated last year with my BSN! I loved Riv and my entire experience. The professors were fantastic and they were all well-established in the medical field. I had the chance to work with local hospitals, join a bunch of on-campus orgs, and got to make tons of connections that I continue to use in my career. I plan on going back and earning my MSN next year."
Freshman,5,"Due to the COVID19 pandemic, we had to switch to online learning for the remainder of the semester and considering we were all not prepared for it, the professors did a GREAT job at it. The anxiety level amongst the majority of the students was very high and they made the transition as smoothly as possible which made it for a less stressful learning experience."
Freshman,5,"I did take online classes because of the closure of the school due to the global pandemic, but the classes online were amazing and the switch to online classes was  very smooth."
Freshman,5,It’s an amazing place to be and it is filled with amazing staff and students. It is an amazing place to meet new people not only in my intended major but people in all different majors as well.
Junior,5,"Rivier is very interactive with their students as well as incredibly supportive and focused on their students accomplishments and academic achievements. Rivier University provides their students with many clinical and internship opportunities to enhance their learning experience and allows them to be involved in their community. The environment of Rivier is welcoming to all students and faculty through sporting events, academic fairs, school functions, etc. The opportunities are endless at Rivier and the environment is one that any student will succeed in."
Freshman,5,"Rivier does a lot of things to help people get involved and adapt to college life. The campus isn’t too big where you get lost and can’t find your way around. The professors seem to really care for their students. Rivier also does a lot of activities for their students like bringing in therapy dogs, having crafts in the library, online stuff like bingo games and more."
Niche User,5,I am an alumni of Rivier University (College) and credit my academics and college experience for a rewarding and successful career as well as lasting friendships and fond memories.
Freshman,5,"Rivier University is a great school. It is fairly small but I appreciate the size, they have a pretty good range of majors."
Sophomore,5,"What I like about Rivier University is how it is a small school. This is nice especially when it comes to being a student in the classroom. It is much easier to focus on the work and ask questions. Also, it provides for a better opportunity to get to personally know the teachers and for them to know their students rather than just being a number in the class. Moreover, this quality makes it easy when you need to get help or understand a topic. The teachers at Rivier University are always willing to help and work with students to better understand the material being taught, therefore students can maximize their potential inside and outside of the classroom. One of the programs that this quality is really shown in is the nursing program. All of the professors and instructors want nothing more than to teach what they enjoy, help students grasp and understand the material, and ultimately help their students succeed."
Freshman,5,"Rivier is an amazing school that is very cost efficient and gives an amazing education. Professors make it very personal and wants each student to succeed. They make you feel at home by having a great school environment and by keeping you involved with entertainment & activities. The staff is wonderful with each one of them having the best interest for you with open arms. You can’t go wrong with coming to Riv, especially for education and athletics."
Freshman,5,"The academics, facilities, students, and staff make the experience wonderful! My classes are so eye-opening and my professors truly want me to succeed. Great school!"
Sophomore,5,Riv feels like a home away from home with the small class sizes and professors that really get to know you. I’m a sophomore nursing major and am also part of the field hockey team. I love the atmosphere and all of the renovations they are currently working on like the 2020 science building.
Freshman,5,"The professor are so helpful in trying to give you the best to succeed. It’s a great campus, and everyone around you are so helpful to your needs."
Freshman,5,Rivier University has provided such an amazing route for me even when just starting to look into the university. Since I toured they helped me with every step of my financial aid to my future nursing career. They make sure all their students feel comfortable and safe. Each professor has been outstanding so far making sure that incoming freshman know what to do and explain each step of the way. I cannot wait to continue learning at Rivier University.
Sophomore,5,"Rivier University is an incredible university, that transforms individuals into spectacular men and women that will help their communities substantially"
Sophomore,5,"I like Rivier because it is small and very personal. I appreciate the staff here and how willing to help they always are. I love being able to go to their office for extra help, and having them know me by name. I also really appreciate the services offered - such as the writing center, academic advising, disability services, peer tutors, and also the work-study jobs offered."
Sophomore,5,"Rivier is a very small school. There are several athletic programs but education always comes first. Being a small university, class sizes are small and every student gets attention. At Rivier you are a name not a number ."
Freshman,5,"I love it here! It is small, but the size makes addressing campus issues much easier. There are many on campus activities and groups to participate in! The buildings need some renovation and the dorms need updating as well, but it is overall good quality for college living."
Junior,5,"Very nice place to learn. I appreciate how dedicated the teachers are when it comes to lecturing and helping students that are struggling. There is a lot to do being in the center of Nashua and there is never a dull moment. I would recommend this school to anyone who likes a small campus, but surrounded by a city with a lot of places to eat and shop."
Graduate Student,5,Rivier provides an intimate environment for personal growth and development with the care and attention you will not find at larger universities.
Freshman,5,Riv is such a close knit school where the professors take the time to get to know the students. The small class sizes make it easy to get one on one assistance and the staff and student tutors are always there to help.
Alum,5,Rivier has a great atmosphere with knowledable professors that really want to help you achieve your goals.
Senior,5,"Great campus, great dining hall, awesome place to live, great classes, perfect size campus, overall great school to attend"
Niche User,5,I am a transferring student to Rivier University. I would like to see the financial aid process be more flexible with struggling students.
Sophomore,5,I have just started at the university and am very eager to finish getting my education here. I feel like it is a very welcoming environment in terms of staff and students. Professors are always willing to help and the small school size adds to a strong sense of community.
Freshman,5,"Rivier University is an amazing school. The nursing program is phenomenal as long as other areas of study such as psychology, education etc. I have been very pleased so far with the dedication and supportiveness all of the professors have. Being a small campus, you get to know mostly everyone and form close bonds with your peers. The food isn't great, but some days are better than others."
Freshman,5,"Rivier University has some of the best professors I have ever met, and while they are wonderful, they deliver the class material in so many different ways to accommodate all of their students. Rivier faculty care about the students and want to set them up for success. The campus itself is well kept, yet the dorms fall short for what you pay for."
Freshman,5,I love Rivier University so far! It is such a welcoming place and I love everything about it including the classes!
Senior,5,Rivier is  a great school with a small close community. The campus is small enough where students should not feel overwhelmed however it is just big enough where it still feels like you're living away from home. The professors and other faculty are extremely invested in what they do and are always willing to help students.
Freshman,5,"I'm currently a freshman here at Rivier University and I couldn't have made a better choice for starting my nursing career. There is free tutoring and writing resources for all students of all majors. Teachers are always open to talking before and after class and it's so easy to manage your time and get involved on campus. The only con is that it is largely a commuter school and the weekends here are pretty boring, but overall the school is great and I enjoy my classes and my teachers. I feel at home at Riv and if you want a small campus with strong ties to the community it's placed in, then Rivier is for you!"
Junior,5,"I enjoy attending Rivier University because of the care of the professors, staff, and administrators. It is a small school, so there is a small ratio of professors to students. I like having that connection with teachers that enables me to get the learning experience I need."
Freshman,5,Rivier University gives all students an opportunity to succeed. All of the professors are so helpful.  I have enjoyed every day of my freshman year.
Junior,5,"Rivier University is amazing. The staff has been amazing with helping me continue school after I had a baby in January. They're kind, patient, and help you stay focused."
Freshman,5,I am enjoying my time at Rivier University. It is a small community feel and a family atmosphere. The instructors are very good and they take the time to get to know you personally. They are very supportive and offer help when needed. Business office is very quick to help you with whatever you need. One thing I would like to see different on campus is that the classrooms need to be updated.
Junior,5,"I am in my Junior Year of my psychology major with a social work minor.  I am enrolled in the professional studies program evening and hybrid classes.  Being a 40 year old mother of five, finally pursuing my dreams, I couldn't be happier.  The professors are wonderful, the staff is amazing, and the environment is clean.  I would recommend Rivier to young students and and older adults alike.  There is something for everyone here at Rivier. "
Junior,5,"My name is Shawna Bassett I am a Business Finance major at Rivier University in Nashua, NH. It is a great school with a small classroom environment. The teachers are very welcoming and it is easy to get one on one interaction with your teacher. I am happy with my choice in choosing Rivier."
Sophomore,5,"Attending Rivier University was one of the best decisions I have ever made. From dedicated professors, staff and faculty to the energetic and engaging students, I have found nothing but positives. The professors are preparing me for every encounter I will face in my career as a nurse and I could not be more grateful. "
Freshman,5,"I have nothing negative to say about Rivier University! I transferred here to Rivier as a commuter this Fall, and am so happy I did. I took Nursing pre-requisite courses at a local community college, that all trasferred over to Rivier. I have only been here for about a month and cannot believe the positive energy I have and see while attending school a few days a week. Everyone is so kind and all of my professors are very well prepared when coming to class. I have already learned so much, through more then one learning/teaching style or technique. Reviews I heard before applying to Rivier were all very positive, including peers and employers of Rivier graduate students. "
College Junior,5,My university is a small campus that allows professors to work one on one with his or her students. Everyone on campus is so helpful and friendly.
College Freshman,5,You have a relationship with all your teachers. You're not just another student. Being on campus is like my second home. Students and faculty are always approachable and friendly. My school is a community of unique and driven students.
College Freshman,5,"Campus is very safe. there are never any problems that have to do with sexual assult or anyone getting hurt! I feel perfectly safe walking from one side of campus to the other alone, even in the middle of the night."
College Freshman,5,"I love how my school is so small, it's makes it really easy to make friends. They teachers are always looking out for you and some of the classes are really interesting. I would choose my school over and over again if given the chance."
College Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere here! Everyone is so friendly and helpful. The professors are able to give you personal attention since the classes are smaller. Plus, the campus is gorgeous. I absolutely love it here!!"
College Junior,5,"Rivier's staff has been extremely supportive and helpful to me. Whether it was administration, financial aid or one of my professors, my experience has been great."
College Sophomore,5,"If you respect them, they will respect you."
College Junior,5,"when I am on campus I feel safe, but I am only there for classes."
College Freshman,5,I live less than 15 min away and love it! Nashua is one of the larger cities in NH but is surrounded by rural towns.
College Freshman,5,"As a NH resident for my entire life, I'm used to the extreme seasons and weather swings, but some don't like the cold winters or the way the temperature can fluctuate three degrees one day and thirty the next."
College Freshman,5,This past year there was one incident of campus crime that all students were notified of. The campus security makes regular patrols and is very willing to help in any way they can.
College Freshman,5,"Most of the teachers & faculty are AMAZING and want to help YOU to succeed. They are all willing to explain themselves and work with you and/or answer your questions via a visit to their office or email. There are tutors for all the difficult subjects I have done as well, though I've never gone to see any. Workload has been easy for me to handle."
College Freshman,5,There was no problem getting into my program. Only a few people here are English Majors.
College Freshman,5,"Everything works perfectly, and on the odd times it doesn't someone fixes it quickly. IT staff is great too!!"
College Sophomore,5,The campus is great. The atmosphere is awesome. People are so friendly.
College Sophomore,5,I feel extremely safe because we have public safety officers who are constantly patrolling the campus.
College Sophomore,5,"The nightlife includes parties on the weekends, slumber parties, and getting wasted."
College Sophomore,5,I am an English Major. The english department offers internships at local newspaper business's.
College Sophomore,5,We have Microsoft computers. They are very fast and the wi-fi connection is great.
College Sophomore,5,Loved the classes just wished I did not have to take some of the core freshman year stuff.  Boring
College Sophomore,5,So easy and I only brought my own computer because I liked to do my notes on it in class
Freshman,4,The professors and tutors made sure class lessons and assignments were understood and reviewed in a professional and proficient manner. Always there when you need them.
Freshman,4,"I don't have many complaints about Rivier Univerity. I believe the staff is excellent at their job and I am learning more than expected. I especially enjoy the library, as that is were I study and relax between classes."
Alum,4,"Rivier's MBA in Healthcare Administration program was hit or miss, depending on the course/professor. The course difficulty was easier to moderate difficulty. Overall, I think the curriculum prepared me well to move forward in my professional life and it was a good value. They also have some nice flexibility in online and on-campus offerings. After moving away from the area I was able to finish my last three courses online."
Sophomore,4,"Not a lot of extracurricular events, but the commuter association does throw commuter lunches. Mainly commuters, with a diverse student population- many are parents and work full time. They are generous with their financial aid. The nursing program is really good, and they are dedicated to you succeeding. The attendance policy and class cancellation policies are strict."
Freshman,4,My experience so far is great I am enjoying my classes and getting to know new people. as a commuter though it is difficult for me to feel 100% connected with people as they are there all the time and get to see each other at anytime. I wish that meals were also cheaper for commuters who don't have the meal plan. because I can't dish out eight dollars a day for lunch and I don't always have the time to pack a lunch for school nor do I want to be carrying a lunch box around all day long.
Junior,4,I love the community atmosphere. The professors are so friendly and helpful. Rivier reminds me a lot of my high school because everyone knows almost everyone. I would like to see more commuter activities and involvement on campus
Sophomore,4,"Rivier is a small campus which makes everyone feel more at home. I would like to see it grow a little more in size. I would love to see Rivier find a way to get off campus housing and more space for parking. The professors at Rivier are great and truly want you to succeed and learn. Choosing Rivier was life changing for me. Little things can definitely change at Rivier but overall, I would recommend Rivier to all my friends looking for a small school."
Senior,4,"I love the small community feel of Rivier! Because it is a small school, you get the feel of a community and more connected with others throughout the university. There are always activities to do and very enjoyable to live on campus and also to commute!"
Senior,4,Rivier University is a very close nit school where your professors know you and want to see you succeed. I love that my professors know my name and not what my number is next to my name.  The students that attend Rivier all look out for each other since we are such a small school and everyone knows you. This is a school where you cannot walk 5 minutes without seeing one of your friends.
Junior,4,The school is amazing and everyone knows everyone. The price is increasing due to construction making it hard for many to stay at the school.
Junior,4,"The school has very friendly and helpful staff. There are a few things I would change about the academics regarding my major. As a nursing major, I believe the curriculum could be organized better as well as the focus of the class as it pertains to the exams. Overall, the professors have great availability for assisting students and the class sizes are great for learning."
Junior,4,"I really like how Rivier is a small campus and the enviornment. Since this is a small school, everybody knows each other. Honestly not a big party school but you  will not have trouble finding a party if you want to go. Food is awful, do not expect much."
Junior,4,"It is a very open campus, not a lot of security, great campus life that included commuters and residents who all get along, party life is not that great, academics are very serious when in the nursing program"
Freshman,4,"Rivier University is small private school that offers a very immersive and inclusive experience for all of its students.  Due to its size, a strong sense of community takes over the campus which is something I was truly looking for when I was deciding where to attend.  The food here is OK, as a vegetarian it is sometimes hard to find options. I live on campus and am very pleased with the dorms and all of the other facilities on campus. Overall if you are looking for a home away from home, this is it!"
Sophomore,4,"I liked that the school is small so you know all the professors and you know almost everyone in your grade and since the resident size is so small you know pretty much everyone who lives on campus as well. With that being said, it can be difficult when groups do form like high school and cliches tend to arise. Also, they are improving a lot of buildings and food!"
Sophomore,4,"My dealings with Rivier have been generally good.  I take online courses in the Public Health program.  The University and their staff have been very professional and responsive.  The professors are very knowledgeable and really seem to want to help you succeed.  The Tech department is very helpful, which is very important when you are taking online courses.  The only thing I would change is that they don’t do any type of deferral for students on tuition reimbursement from their place of employment.  So if this is your case, you will have to pay in full up front and then get reimbursed afterwards, while some schools will defer and let you pay after you get the reimbursement from your employer (which is of course, much easier).  But other than that I have no complaints!"
Freshman,4,"This is my first year attending Rivier University and I was impressed by the professors and how they are here to help. They want to see you succeed. You can easily become comfortable with them. Most have flexible office hours and are great at explaining things in depth. 
I was not impressed with the academic advisors. They are difficult to get in touch with and I was not helped by them as much as I wish I could have been. 
Other than that, the campus is nice, the food is pretty good, and the professors are wonderful."
Senior,4,Small enough to get comfortable with all the administration.  I had a great academic and athletic experience.
Junior,4,"I!have applied there and got accepted, 78 of my previous credits were transferred in and I don’t have financial aids to cover my tuition, but they are holding on to my seat in public Health while researching for scholarships."
Junior,4,"I would like to see the public safety to be more active in there job. Also, the food is repetitive and bland. As a resident, the food should be a little better."
Sophomore,4,I love how close everyone is. Rivier is not a big university but that’s whats nice about. Everyone is willing to help you with anything and the teachers are super kind and friendly all the staff is
Sophomore,4,"I have only completed  one year at Rivier University, I completed my pre-requisite for Nursing there. I am planning on returning next year to continue. I liked how they were easy to work with when you needed help. There was one  thing that I did not like that I would like to see change. There was a class that was called student success that all income freshmen were required to take that I found was a waste of time and I would have rather spent that time studying."
Junior,4,Smaller school provides a more personal experience where professors know you by name and seem interested in the material they are teaching.
Niche User,4,"So far I have only been to the Accepted Students Day.  The staff and students were very friendly, informative and made me feel very welcomed.  I also met with the Baseball and Soccer coaches who were awesome to talk to and looking forward to play for.  I've had a very positive experience so far.  I just paid my deposit to attend this fall, that's how much I enjoyed my day there."
Freshman,4,"College professors are fairly easy to work with if you communicate with them. Plenty of opportunities to be involved on campus, even as a freshman. Student resources available to help students succeed, e.g. Writing Department. If you need there's plenty of people students or staff one can ask for help from."
Sophomore,4,I loved the campus. It is so pretty and is always being updated. The campus is very small but it worked perfect for me. The classes were all very small and it gave it a better learning environment. The environment of the school was great and so were all of the professors at the school.
Niche User,4,Very good professors and faculty. Help students to access materials to help learn. It is however too expensive for people to afford.
Junior,4,"I enjoy much of the Nashua area, it is a nice city that has just enough going on so you are not bored. They have lots of activities at Rivier and plenty of clubs to keep you busy. Some professors get too personal but most are great."
Sophomore,4,I chose Rivier University based upon the state of my father was due to stage 4 cancer. I never truly gave it a chance until the last month of my second semester. I made some really great friends and realized how incredible the nursing program is.
Freshman,4,"Nursing program is wonderful, Rivier offers lots of help to struggling students, great location- lots to do."
Graduate Student,4,"I love Rivier University. I have attended school there throughout my bachelor's and now my master's. The professors are top-notch and very knowledgeable. As a commuter, I love that the school is small and easily attainable in my area. I would recommend to everyone looking for a great faith-based education!"
Freshman,4,Small school where teachers will do all they can to help students pass classes and eventually graduate. Good party scene of Thursdays and Saturdays but mostly students are focused on academics and not social life.
College Junior,4,I personally do women's cross country at my school. Our gym is great for training and our coaches are very helpful. There is always someone at the gym toes losing injuries.
College Freshman,4,"Our class sizes are small, which I prefer because I can have a relationship with my professor rather than just another student in a 300 person lecture hall.The professors take time to get to know us and assure they want us to succeed. Most professors are easy to reach at any reasonable hour of the day whether it's through text or through email."
College Freshman,4,"My university believes in getting us out in our field as early as possible. One of the main reasons why I choose my school is because it was the only school that placed me in an elementary school to start my student observation hours freshman year, rather than second semester sophomore year. They offer a lot of opportunities to any grad class to start working in their field through internships, study abroad, etc."
College Freshman,4,"Public safety is always a call away. They will do anything for you whether it's to jump start your car, unlock your dorm room, or drive you to work in bad weather when you do not feel safe driving yourself. They are always there for you to make sure you are safe and comfortable."
College Freshman,4,"Even though I am a commuter, I spend a majority of my time on campus in the residence halls hanging out with my friends, sleeping over, or studying in their dorms. Unfortunately though, the cost to stay on campus is expensive. I would love to stay on campus rather than drive 30 minutes every day to class, and then another 30 minutes back home late at night.I wish there were better opportunities given to reduce the amount of on campus living. Even if that meant more grants, scholarships, etc. rather than payment plans."
College Freshman,4,"Our men's volleyball team is phenomenal, and the coach has been awarded every year for best in the league. (Or some high honor award to that area). All the student athletes are passionate in both their sport and in their academics. Coach's encourage their players to preform their best in both areas."
College Freshman,4,"Just about everything about this school is great. the size of the classes is perfect, they are not too big or too small. Campus is awesome, it is always well kept but more places to sit outside could be made and maybe a place to be ablebto get food outbside and eat maybe like an outside kiosk."
College Freshman,4,I absolutely love living on campus! it is a great experience and something that everyone should try at their time at school
College Freshman,4,I could not be happier that I chose to attend Rivier University. It is a very small school and it is great! The people that also attend are some of the smartest and nicest people you could meet!
College Sophomore,4,The public health program has great connections.
College Sophomore,4,"There are four different dorm options available, which works for all."
College Sophomore,4,"I personally am not a athlete, but sports are good here."
College Sophomore,4,I'm in the professional studies program and only know of the sports what I see in my email.
College Freshman,4,"I know that as a education major I am already doing my student teaching as a freshmen. I got placed right away, so internships are very easy to get."
College Freshman,4,"Classes are usually small. Professors get to know you by name, which helps a lot. They are very accommodating to disabilities and to students who are struggling."
College Freshman,4,"Good online resources, especially the library staff!"
College Freshman,4,Well known in this area for the nursing programs.
College Freshman,4,Security services were very helpful during orientation.
College Freshman,4,The support staff in the nursing program is exceptionally responsive to questions and concerns!
Recent Alumnus,4,"There is a career development center and internship coordinator that help students network, write resumes, and prepare for job interviews. Job prospects in my field look pretty good and teachers have also given me advice on where and how to look for jobs post-grad."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I go to college for the education and nothing more. I have made some lifelong friends at my school community and have established myself as a working professional. Courses are very interesting, and there are many to choose from.  Professors are knowledgeable and experts in their field. The only thing I would change is the religion credit requirements."
Recent Alumnus,4,"There is not a lot of crime, and there is security 24/7"
Recent Alumnus,4,"I really like the size of my school because it is small, I get more individualized attention. The education I receive is high quality.  My teachers also know me by name and they are all approachable when I have questions or need assistance. I wish that student life felt more like college though, but instead it often feels like high school."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, I enjoy going to school at Rivier University."
College Freshman,4,"Being at school has been a very great time. I could not be happier with the friends I have met and made. I like my classes, my teachers, and most of all living at school."
College Freshman,4,Rivier challenges you to apply knowledge to everyday thinking and gives you a taste of what tomorrow is like. The professors all want to see success and are all very helpful and kind.
College Senior,4,I love the school and the teachers for the most part but it is very expensive ans tough to pay for.
College Junior,4,"I love how each teacher and administrator etc is looking out for YOU. Not the general population, but you yourself. Each wants YOU to succeed."
Junior,2,The professors are terrible with technology. They struggle on a daily basis with simple things like hosting a zoom call.
Junior,2,This school is not to be recommended. Classes feel like a joke. They are 85% busy work and you do not really learn anything that you didn't already know.
Recent Alumnus,2,There are curfews for resident students and boys/girls cannot be in the other sex's room past a certain time or else the students could be kicked out of dorming.
College Sophomore,2,The school is too strict and fines you any chance they get. The nursing program is impossible and doesn't prepare you for anything and they aren't helpful. The kids that go to the school are not motivated and just want to drink and smoke weed all day. The sports are a joke except for the volleyball program. There's nothing to do on campus.
College Junior,2,"There are some emails about scholarships, but other then that you have to go find them yourself."
College Freshman,2,"There are decent places, but waaaay too expensive for what you are getting."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't as much parties as you would except from a college, then again we are a Catholic school."
College Sophomore,2,Nothing special about getting in.  Probably one of the easier schools to get into unless you are a nursing major
College Sophomore,2,The only way to get anywhere if you do not have a car is using the bus which is not the cheapest
College Sophomore,2,"Sports have been fun, there are some chill kids to hangout with, the parties and dances have been fun.  However, the school is very very small.  Some of the rules they have and some of the courses they require are useless and need to be revised."
College Sophomore,2,It's in Nashua so you have the city to do things in but the school is not really crazy or anything.  Kinda boring unless there is a party which is only on Saturdays usually.
College Sophomore,2,They have okay food but only dining hall and one snack place in the library but not much variety
College Junior,2,Financial aid is never easy to deal with no matter what school you attend as far as I'm concerned.
College Freshman,2,There is no transportation.  The campus is so small you can walk to everything in under five minutes.  However there is public safety and we can ride the nashua transit for free if you need to get off campus.
College Sophomore,2,"I have no knowledge of any off campus housing since I live at home and own my place. Since going to Rivier I have never heard of any one talk about off campus housing but have many classmates who live on campus.  Rivier is a small college and does have limited housing and talking to some of the students who live there, the rooms are very small.  I feel I cannot rate this since I do not live there."
College Freshman,2,Sports aren't the most important thing at Rivier but students do participate and go to support their classmates.
College Freshman,2,There are not many different people at Rivier College
College Senior,2,"There are only a handful of non-white individuals on campus, and they seem to group together."
College Senior,2,"Rivier has several commuter students who live nearby. Rivier does not offer its own off-campus housing, but many students have searched out their own housing in nearby apartments and condos. These complexes are close to campus, but the college does not offer financial aid for these options."
College Sophomore,2,"No one really hangs out in the student center. They only go to eat, and get their mail. The gym is nice, its new but it is still pretty small. But the training room is great! The library is big and there are a lot of places to go to study. Activities are getting better, a lot of people don't go to the activities so its hard for the school to plan them."
Niche User,1,This school was dominantly white women. It was very unwelcoming and there was NEVER any life on the campus. Some of the professors were excellent others needed more consideration.
Junior,1,It is not what the school claims to be.The campus life is awful. Professors pick favorites as well as other figures at the school. This place is high school with more drama and not anywhere close to being a college never mind a university.
Graduate Student,1,Absolutely hate this school! The people here are very rude and disgusting to have to deal with. If I didn't love my program and my classes than I would be gone in a heartbeat.
Sophomore,1,"There is no greek life at Rivier and the only sport taking seriously is Volleyball. No football team. There are curfews for resident students and boys/girls cannot be in the other sex's room past a certain time or else the students could be kicked out of dorming. P. Safety will not leave you alone, they intrude on everything you do whether you are quetly drinking with friends or studying.  If you are drinking and under 21 you can get in a lot of trouble, and if you are 21 and drinking in the same room as someone under 21 you can get in trouble as well.  A fine and ""probation"" are given if a student who is underage is found with an alcoholic beverage. A fine and probation are also given if found on the opposite sex floor after hours. Rivier fines people every chance they get! You can find students smoking weed any chance they get. Before and after class, which is surprising as it is a private Catholic university. Also dorm bathrooms are always disgusting both guys and girls."
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life at my school.
College Freshman,1,"The dinning option we have is either Dion or the Cyber Cafe.  Most people prefer the Cafe to the actual dinning hall.  In the dinning hall food gets repetitive.  It tends to cold.  The food isn't flavorful.  Need more labels for ice cream saying what is in it.  There is a need for more lactose stuff and they need to pay more attention to when the lactose things that we do have start to disappear.  They do not have convenient hours.  Especially on the weekends when there is only 11-1 and 5-6 for meals.  The school has a menu online, however it never follows it.   I don't think I've ever gone when the menu online has been right.  We never know what the desserts are as they never label them.  We have $150 flex cash on our IDs, which most people run out of quickly as they can only be used at the Cyber Cafe.  We cannot even use them on vending machines."
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life on Rivier's campus due to the fact that we are a Catholic school.
College Freshman,1,"I have been trying to receive financial aid since the beginning of the 2014 Fall semester and have had no luck so far. With wanting to move on campus for the 2015 Spring semester, this is not an ideal situation to be in and the financial aid office has offered little help to both me and my family."
College Sophomore,1,opposite sex students are not allowed in your room past 10.  Some of the security officers are chill but some are fun killers and honestly are there to just ruin good times.  They also believe that this is a much more prestigious school than it actually is so they take there jobs too seriously sometimes
College Sophomore,1,They have 2 lots basically and it's a struggle to find parking
College Sophomore,1,It's cold all the time and it snows a lot. It affects my experience because I'm from sunny california.
College Sophomore,1,We do not have anything lke this on campus
College Freshman,1,We don't have greek life. Its a catholic school.
College Junior,1,There are no other dining options within walking distance.  Must take the city bus to anywhere else
College Senior,1,"there is off campus housing such as apartments that alot of students go to, but riv needs to be able to offer apartments on campus. knock down some of the un used homes and make ppl stay on campus!"
College Junior,1,Not Much – There are not that many scholarships available from Rivier.
College Junior,1,P. Safety – they will not leave you alone. intrude on everything you do whether you are quetly drinking with friends or studying. suspicious of everyone.
College Sophomore,1,"You Sure You Want a Fine – This school is very strict with there policy. If you are drinking and under 21 you can get in a lot of trouble, and if you are 21 and drinking in the same room as someone under 21 you can get in trouble as well. There are ways to have fun and party just dont get busted. But if you do get caught expect a fine."
Niche User,1,Awful Nursing Program – I am currently a nursing student at Rivier and have always wanted to be a nurse. I have observed in the hospital setting in clinicals that there are many wonderful caring nurses out there-BUT there are still too many nurses that are cruel to each other. The Clinical instructors at Rivier are no different than the ones out in the field. They can be hell on wheels if they take a dislike to you or see any kind of weakness in you.   If you let them get the best of you then they will.  But that is the problem I have with the Rivier Clinical instructors-you feel that they are AGAINST you not with you.  They don't advocate for the students.  They are constantly scanning you for weakness of some kind. There is definitely a Teachers against  student atmosphere at the school.   It's incredibly nerve wracking.  I'm developing an ulcer being at this school.    Nobody is perfect and if you have one bad clinical day or an off day in Sim lab they think you aren't right for nursing and start focusing on you.  I've seen it happen with many fellow students who are no longer here.   I wish I could recommend Rivier but I really can't for the reason's stated.  It's too much money to pay -you are better off going to a state school.

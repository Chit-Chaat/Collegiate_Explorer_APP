Senior,5,I very much enjoy going to Mount Mary University. It is a beautiful campus and the smaller class sizes allow for more teacher to student interaction.
Graduate Student,5,"I liked the availability of professors, clarity of expectations, openness to questions and discussion based learning. 
I would like more opportunities to interact with other students, which has  been limited by the restrictions imposed by social distancing."
Graduate Student,5,So far the online experience has been great. All the materials are efficiently posted online and easily accessible through mymountmary.edu. Professor are always available to answer questions and face to face classes are planned weekly.
Graduate Student,5,"I love attending Mount Mary University. The small class sizes are great for learning, getting to know people and my professors know me by name."
Niche User,5,"Mount Mary felt very warm when I first entered and it felt like a place I could call my second home. The more I visit the more I become attached to the place. All the staff are incredibly helpful and sincere, helping to answer any questions I may have. The atmosphere Is very relaxed and comfortable. All the other colleges I heard about didn't compare to this one at all and I really love the sense of family you get when you first enter. So overall Mount Mary is not just a school its a home for many and will always live up to that."
Freshman,5,I wouldn't trade it for nothing in the world. I found all that I need to succeed here at mount mary. The professors are so welcoming and the class sizes make it more personal.
Junior,5,"The small campus is an empowering community of strong, fearless women. The teachers know you by name and are 100% passionate about what they do. I especially recommend Mount Mary University to those who are creative, as this community has amazing art and fashion programs."
Sophomore,5,The faculty is incredible and it is a really great environment to be apart of. Everything from applying to acceptance to getting into classes is easy and they help you every step of the way with an open line of communication. The campus is beautiful and there are tons of different kinds of people at Mount Mary University so you are sure to find people you fit in with.
Freshman,5,"Mount Mary University is such a beautiful and fulfilling school! They have many staff, faculty members, and programs that are willing to help you improve and have smooth experience on campus. With the small class sizes it isn't hard to get that one-on-one experience and a good learning environment to help you stay on track. Mount Mary University's community and commitment is what dragged me here, and I don't think I can ever regret coming here and making it my ""home away from home."""
Sophomore,5,"I've really enjoyed my experience at Mount Mary so far. The faculty are very helpful and patient. The teachers are extremely welcoming and the courses are taught well. The campus is beautiful and cozy. I feel very safe when I am walking to class from the parking lot. 
Very diverse and welcoming environment for any of any religion."
Graduate Student,5,I loved the small class sizes and the sense of community throughout the campus. All of the staff and faculty are kind and knowledgeable. They will do anything to help their students succeed.
Sophomore,5,Mount Mary is a great place for people that thrive in a small community. They have great campus life options and good alternatives to the food in the cafeteria.
Freshman,5,"Within the first semester of attending Mount Mary, I've already fallen head over heals for the school. It's a very welcoming environment that is diverse and empowering for young women looking to attain their career goals. So far, there isn't anything I would change about the school, there is so much to love about it!"
Senior,5,"I love this school with every fiber of my being. This school has taught me so much about myself as a woman. as a leader, and an innovator. The class sizes are the perfect small size for one on one teacher attention. The class offerings are socially and culturally relevant to my career goals. I'm proud to be a Mount Mary Woman."
Freshman,5,"This is a great University, they have an outstanding history and they do all they can to ensure women graduate"
Niche User,5,"In my encounters with staff and students, Mount Mary University has been nothing short of excellent. Communication with counselors is easy to initiate and comfortable in each experience. This next school year, Mount Mary is rolling out a new-and-improved Undecided program including career counseling, job shadowing, and an entire course filled with people unsure of their futures or stuck between majors. I recommend Mount Mary."
Freshman,5,"I am a first year college student and so far the journey has been smooth sailing for me. I felt a little nervous coming back to school at the age of 28, but they welcomed me pretty well. They are so helpful and knowledgeable , the staff is there every step of the way to help no matter what dept. they work in they will help or get you to the right person. They helped me set up a payment plan seeing how I had to cut my hours back at work to be able to go to school."
Junior,5,"Mount Mary is a small predominately woman collage. I have been at mount Mary for two semesters now going on my third and I believe this has been my best college experience yet. All of the teachers care about my education, there are so many things to be a part of and I now actually enjoy going to school. I have never received better grades in school until I started at Mount Mary. I am proud to say I am a student at Mount Mary university."
Sophomore,5,"Mount Mary is really great. If you're looking for a place to pursue your goals, this is it. It's a very unique college experience compared to a lot of state school. Small class sizes, great student to teacher ratio, lots of opportunity, and more. If you're looking for you stereotypical college experience, this is not the right place. It's a very quiet school on the weekend and doesn't really have a party scene. But if you aren't looking for any of that, Mount Mary is a great place to live out your college days."
Niche User,5,"One thing that I liked about mount mary is that it was an all girls college and also that it is very small, loving and welcoming. when I went to Mount Mary for a tour, I liked that Mount Mary is very close to home for me because I am not ready to be far away from home yet because I am not ready to leave my mom and family behind. I liked that Mount Mary is very willing to support me in my degree of working with kids."
Graduate Student,5,I couldn't be happier with the courses and professors at mount mary. They genuinely care about your success and will go the extra mile to make sure you get the most out of your classes.
Freshman,5,I love Mount Mary! they have a lot of useful resources and the professors are really nice. The professors are wiling to help you to succeed. The cafes have awesome food and the library is a great place to study
Junior,5,"Mount Mary is clearly dedicated to it's students. There are very few ""bad"" professors, because MMU asks students to evaluate teachers at the end of the semester. Those that do not receive good remarks by students are rarely ever asked back (if they are it is to just finish the teaching contract that they had with the school, but after that they will not be back). MMU is dedicated to giving their students the best that they have, and to improve the facilities in order to improve their programs. However, funding is limited so they have to pick and choose from the multitude of projects that they want done based on quotes by contractors."
Senior,5,I found the small class sizes and close nit relationship with the professors very helpful.  There is a welcoming presence throughout the campus and all professors wants each student to succeed.
Niche User,5,"An echo in the halls remains from my visit, and history engraved within the bricks and stone amazes me. This private school made me feel tingly and reminded me of my hometown school I once went to. Tranquility and action spurs in the library and grass. Art and Sports and Academics are combined wonderfully. A fountain and choir adds quality. Cheers to the bold at Mount Mary."
Freshman,5,This school really want you to succeed and achieve something in life. If it wasn't for this school I wouldn't still be in school.
Freshman,5,"Mount Mary University is an excellent school. I am a college freshman and I have been having a wonderful experience so far. My professors have taught me very well, and the students are so easy to get along with. Mount Mary offers courses that fit perfectly to my major and there is many activities and clubs to join around campus. There is always something exciting happening!"
College Sophomore,5,It is a major concern--which is great
College Junior,5,"I have loved every class I have taken! Every professor has been enthusiastic, understanding, and helpful with my course work."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Mount Mary University offers a variety of degree programs. The advisors of Mount Mary make sure that students are aware of their career options and provide great input. There are programs that students can join where they are introduced to internships, resume and cover letter writing, job hunting, interviewing, and workplace etiquette."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Mount Mary University provides a variety of courses to its students. Students are encouraged to not only complete the course necessary for completion of their program but to take courses that are fun. The professors are always prepared and are knowledgable in the content that they teach. Classes are considered small, flexible, include short breaks, and are never offered during lunch time. Features of courses include in-class and/or online lectures, online and/or in-class quizzes, POGILs, classroom or forum discussions, and online homework."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I would say that health and safety at Mount Mary University is extremely the best. Mount Mary is a very open school, but our form of security makes students feel safe. Our forms of security include surveillance cameras and security guards. As far as health, Mount Mary does a great job providing its students of health, ethical and environmental issues. They do this by providing pamphlets, workshops, and discussions."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The Mount Mary University campus is breath-taking and warm. When one is walking down the halls of the school, he or she is greeted with a smile and/or greeting from a friendly face. Within the campus there are areas filed with lots of space  and comfy furniture where students can either relax with a snack and watch tv or study. The dorms are spacious and filled with comfortable furniture. Just as one can always find something to do on the Mount Mary campus, one can also find someone to talk with. In addition, one can also find social discussion group to participate in."
College Freshman,5,"I have only been at this school for a semester, but so far it is amazing. There is a strong sense of community at this school; compassion, leadership, and the strength of women and what we can accomplish is also emphasized. This is a Catholic-based university, but there are young women of many different creeds that attend here, which I think really shows how open Mount Mary is to all women of all backgrounds. The faculty and staff actually DO care about you and how well you do here, unlike other colleges and universities where it seems like you're just another student body (which was my experience at UW-Milwaukee). There are many clubs and organizations that one can join- there's literally something for everyone: International Club, SPETRUMM (The LGBTQ club), Campus Ministry, an art therapy club, a Jewish club, and so on. The teachers are all very adept at what they do and make learning interesting. There are many resources available if you need help with your classes- not just from the teachers themselves, but also from other students and the Student Success Center, where one can go for tutoring or help writing essays and such. It is a private university, so it is expensive, but there's always opportunities presented- through both the school as well as outside sources- for one to get scholarships and grants. Overall my experience has been very positive and in one semester I have felt my confidence grow because of Mount Mary- I can only imagine how much I will accomplish here in the next three years."
College Student,5,"Mount Mary University is an excellent school all around.  From the structure of the buildings and the beautiful campus, to the determination for your success portrayed from the staff and faculty.  I wish I would have attended this University for the first time I chose a college. Everyone who works in the school is very friendly and more than willing to answer any question you may have.  Since it is primarily a woman's college, I would recommend this school to any woman to start or continue their higher education."
College Sophomore,5,"Mount Mary is a perfect school for me. It's an all girl's university with only male students in the graduate program so there is not only less distraction but more of a school focus on the women's perspective, power, and influence. Our school focuses quite heavily on social justice as well as having a philosophy of the world to love and protect it because of the Catholic touch of our Notre Dame Sisters. It's perfect also because of it's small class sizes and underground passages to connect buildings to each other without enduring cold or unwanted precipitation. Mount Mary is also a D3 school in which students do just as well on the field and in the classroom."
College Senior,5,People are really nice and they do care about you. Ive been to other schools where you are just a number. The pice is high but you won't get this kind of an education anywhere else.
College Sophomore,5,I love my school we have so many opportunity to see the fashion world
College Junior,5,Nice neighborhood. City 7 miles away
College Sophomore,5,"All administration and staff are very serious in wanting students to succeed in the classroom, but out of the classroom as well. There is a strong sense of community on campus and it can be easily felt and expressed when talking with others. I love my professors and staff that I have worked with and they always make sure that you get the assistance and accommodations that you need to succeed. As a student, you won't go unnoticed or just be a number. The small class sizes and small campus makes sure that the administration, staff, and professors know who you are. While they may be strict, they are social and friendly because they all want to connect with students, but also do what is best for them."
College Sophomore,5,they offer many different scholarships and aid.
College Sophomore,5,The diversity is amazing. you will most likely never be in a classroom filled with one ethnicity. there are so many different cultures on campus it is a whole new learning experience.
College Sophomore,5,"I don't know, I pack my own meal."
College Sophomore,5,The admission office help me with my financial aid package. I also received a scholarship from this school which is the grace scholars program.
College Sophomore,5,There are always a police drive around the campus.
College Sophomore,5,They are very friendly and fun to talk to.
College Sophomore,5,My major is social worker.
College Sophomore,5,My campus is very diversity because there are students from around the world.
College Sophomore,5,I don't know because I don't stay on campus.
College Sophomore,5,"It's small, only for girls, and mostly strong in arts."
College Sophomore,5,The town in my campus is mostly good with the friendly neighborhoods and my campus is also located a side a small river and a park. Which it is feel safe during night.
College Sophomore,5,The internship that has in my file is the social work internship.
College Sophomore,5,My specific program in school will be the Student Govt and the Promise Program. The Student Govt lead student to connect with the community and the real world so I think that's a good part of it. English is my second language so the Promise Program will help me with that and with the first generation only.
College Sophomore,5,My school is mostly female so they are more focus on the academic than socialize.
College Sophomore,5,"Great, cant wait to start my field training."
College Sophomore,5,They have a great dinning service and once a month the dietetics department prepares themed meals.
College Sophomore,5,To my knowledge there is no drug use.
College Sophomore,5,"There are a ton of restaurants in the area and you're close to downtown as well.  There are lots of options, ethnic, vegetarian, etc.  Most places have patios and some are located near biking and walking paths."
College Sophomore,5,"I have not lived in the campus housing, but the students that I have talked to seem to like it."
College Sophomore,5,There are students from all over the world attending the university.  They have vary backgrounds and interests and the caps is very diverse.
Senior,4,"Thanks to COVID-19, classes were all online. It can be sometimes challenging to keep due dates straight, but overall professors respond to emails in a timely manner and grade assignments in a timely manner. The professors have office hour where you can contact them if you need to."
Sophomore,4,"I like attending Mount Mary because you are able to know your professors very well. They are able to help you in any way they can. You are not just a student there, you are someone that they want to create an impact on."
Niche User,4,i've heard the mount mary is a very good school for women. women learn how to become a great leader when they go to that school. the become confident with themselves. the teachers and professor are caring. they care about the students education. there's a lot of help for student that need extra help the works. the class are smaller but you will get to know the professor personally .
Junior,4,"There is many reasons on why I like attending Mount Mary University, from the small class sizes to the strong support system that I have encountered there. When looking for which universities to attend I always looked for small class sizes in order for me to learn better and have better student professor relationships. There is also many people at Mount Mary that care about as a person. They care about your personal problems and they are willing to help. If you need help with anything they help with that as well. I'm glad I chose to attend Mount Mary Univerisity."
Freshman,4,It’s a great school academically but when it comes to including commuters they fall a bit short. My first year at mount Mary has been great. The teachers are very understanding and respectful.
Junior,4,The dietetics program is great. I’m learning so much and it offers great opportunities for clinical internships.
Junior,4,I love my experience at Mount Mary! I love he professors and all my peers. It was my first choice of college and I'm so glad I was able to be part of this community. There are so many opportunities for the students here and so much encouragement. The campus is gorgeous as well year round. Only thing I did not like too much was how much everything costs but that's what happens at a private college. It was worth the price and the people you get to network with stay with you forever! Recommend this university to women who want small class sizes and want to change the world!
Freshman,4,this is a personal school that will take the time to really get to know you and your needs. they willing to put forth the help you will need. all your needs are met in order for you to become a successful student.
Junior,4,I am very glad I chose Mount Mary Unversity to attend.  This school had aloud me to focus on my education.  The professor I have had so far has went over and above to help me.
Freshman,4,"My experience at Mount Mary so far is pretty good. The professors and staff here at Mount Mary are willing to help you with anything you need whether its academically or financially. We also have a lot of events that go on, things like bingo, jeopardy, door decorating, Disney spirit week and Karaoke.  This school pushes you to go out of your comfort zone to meet new people and do thing around the school, there are tons of clubs to join. Overall I think this is a great school."
Senior,4,"Mount Mary University is an all female Catholic university. I choose to attend Mount Mary because of the importance of community. If I ever have a question or need assistance I am able to speak with any faculty or staff member. If they do not know of the answer, they will direct me to someone who will. I also enjoy the small classroom sizes. Most classes include about 15-20 students. This allows students to develop a relationship with their professors. Once this relationship is developed, students feel comfortable speaking to professors about the course. It is also easier for students to have a voice in their class. If the class feels that a change in an assignment will increase student success and understanding, they can come together as a class and discuss their concerns with the professor.  Mount Mary University is an institution that invests in student success and community."
Freshman,4,"Mount Mary is a great university for young women. I love that it promotes young women to become stronger leaders within the community. I also enjoy the environment because it's very relaxing, and I like that Mount Mary sets up small areas throughout the campus that lets students relax. The environment is also very safe. I like that Mount Mary is not a party school. It allows me to stay focused on my education. The only issue that I have concerns with is the food and dormitory. The food in the cafeteria, which is served from FSI, does not taste good. Often times, the food is too dry and overcooked, or the food that is served does not go well together. On the other hand, the dorms are fine. I just wish that the showers were cleaned out every week."
Senior,4,"I am a non-traditional student who transferred from MATC upon completion of the Human Services program, I started at Mount Mary in Spring last year and will be graduating May 2017. My experience at Mt Mary in regards to staff has been mixed. The professors are varied in teaching styles, the faculty though pleasant at sight, has a tendency to come off in sensitive. Being an all woman’s University I anticipated that there would be more support to encompass the issues that are specific to women,there isn’t. The lack of racial diversity at this institution is something I hope will change. Other than the lack of cultural resources on campus, support for the non-tradition student, I enjoyed my experience, through the dedication & support of my advisor and most of my instructors, I tapped in to my potential, doors have opened & in those trying moments of being dis-satisfied, I have learned how to make these moments, teachable ones, be it, I am the student or teacher."
College Sophomore,4,Have yet to find out.
College Sophomore,4,All female college. Small size classes.
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience with Mount Mary, though rocky at some points, has been extremely pleasurable. The staff answered my questions and concerns within a timely, professional manner, and they guided me through the application process with ease. I've been able to meet a few of the students, and I can already tell that this is the place for me. It is a very warm and welcoming environment and is almost family-like—something you don't see all too often these days."
College Sophomore,4,They have a variety of courses there and the classes are small so it is easier to interact with teacher and peers. Some courses are challenging. It is easier to get an AB than an A.
College Sophomore,4,"Its is a safe place to attend, there is security on campus and well there haven't been incidents of sexual assault. Incoming students are required to take a sexual assault course."
College Sophomore,4,"This is a great school since the teachers challenge you to reach your potential. The teachers really care about your education, and help is always offered before or after classes depending on their office hours. The advisers at Mount Mary University help guide you so you graduate on time and take all the required courses in your major. Class sizes are 15-20 students so its easier to learn, and have discussions in class. I really like this school."
College Sophomore,4,I haven't heard of any problems on or near our campus.
College Sophomore,4,I really appreciate how the teachers really attend to the needs of the students.
Recent Alumnus,4,There's sorority clubs and engagement available.
Recent Alumnus,4,"MSMU is great. It's a small campus with a lot of carrying instructors and staff. Like everywhere there are difficult people in some departments but a student can seek a lot of support from many avenues from advisors, counsellors, carrying staff or instructors, and even free tutoring. There's a lot of computer labs and learning resources available for students to get help."
Recent Alumnus,4,MSMU has sports teams that cater to the mostly women student population. There's soccer and a basketball team. The school is always promoting health classes and involvement of all kinds.
College Senior,4,"Overall, Im really excited to leave because I can't stand the office people. They simply have no idea what they are doing and no one answers the phone. When someone does answer the phone, its a student and they have no idea what they are talking about. I love my teachers and my close friends from school. If it wasn't for them, I would probably leave."
College Sophomore,4,Not a major school so athletic program is average
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe while I am on campus. Campus security are very friendly and willing to escort me to my car at night if I feel the need to do so. Every semester students are required to take online training on sexual assault, which is good. I'm not sure what we have outside of school therapists to address sexual assault, however; we do have a new LGBTQ club that I Think could be a safe space to talk about this topic."
College Freshman,4,MMU has a graduate school that I think will be really instrumental in my ability to find a job in the career path I want. There are job fairs as well.
College Freshman,4,"The professors and teachers at Mount Mary take great care in their courses as well as remaining accessible to all their students and ensuring that everyone succeeds. Class sizes are smaller, which I prefer. It means more ability to have one-on-one time with my teachers as well as interacting with my classmates. Mount Mary hosts a LOT of campus events to further elevate the feeling of community."
College Junior,4,I am a few semesters away from graduating but have high hopes that I will have high probability that I will have success in finding a good job upon graduation.  Mount Mary has been great in helping with my internships and guiding me through that process.
College Junior,4,I feel very safe on campus.
College Junior,4,Mount Mary is an all women's private university.  It is a small close knit community and works hard to empower those who want the experience.  They struggle keeping up with the times with online courses and technology but they are working to improve this.
Recent Alumnus,4,"At Mount Mary University the workload and registration process are easy. Before every registration period the school makes sure that each student has met with his or her advisor and are ready to his or her next classes. In each course, the professors make sure that the workload is doable and if it isn't, they always adjust."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The athletics at my school are awesome. The department is very supportive of their athletes. They provide all the essentials that each team needs. This includes equipment, uniforms, travel costs, and rewards. My school's teams are really close with each other. Examples of this are studying, going on road trips, and attending school activities together. In addition, the Mount Mary community embraces our Blue Angels and have supported them through rough times and their recent victory."
College Freshman,4,I love how I'm being taught and the professors
College Sophomore,4,"College is not much different than high school work wise since my High school is known for being a college prep school. If anything I have more time in between classes to get assignments done. I go to an all womens college and stayed on campus my freshman year. I liked the overall feel of it. It was like a giant sleepover. It was nice to be able to stay up and do homework, watch movies and scrounge for something to eat. My school is in Milwaukee so there are a variety of places to go if you have a car. It is not as diverse and bustling as the downtown neighborhoods of UWM and Marquette. However, we find stuff to do for the most part. As for the professors, they are great! They definitely go above and beyond if you need them to. Even though some of the core classes I took were not my favorite like Search for Meaning, I can see the merit of taking the course. I also wish that the food service hours were better and had more diverse options. Dinner time is 4-6:30, which is to me is a little early. The next food option closes at 8:00pm and trust me I get hungry past 8pm. So I wish we had later night food options as well. However, despite these small complaints, I love my school and couldn't imagine going anywhere else. I like that its small and the professors are professional. The people are nice, the campus is absolutely beautiful and it just feels like a second home to me."
College Sophomore,4,"Our Public Safety on campus is here to help everyone, and I mean, EVERYONE. The women and men on the Public Safety team are always willing to help students and staff out, they take safety very seriously, and they want to connect with the students and others that they help out. They make me feel safe on campus and they are always fun to have a conversation with. They walk around all of campus, have a patrol car, and have connections with the police, fire department, etc. during times of emergencies and they arrive to campus quickly and respond to those situations even faster. Campus is a very safe place to be, even live!"
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus is awesome! As a student, you never have to go outside unless you would like to on your way to class because of the buildings being connected by tunnels. There are a variety of rooms available to students who wish to live in our one residence hall. You can have a single or double room with a private bathroom or a single room with a shared bathroom. There is also the option of a single or double room with the community bathroom as well. The social atmosphere is very home-y, friendly, and close. With all girls on campus, there is a great sense of community and homey-ness. Food is also great on campus too!"
College Freshman,4,There are lots of choices and help to find what is the right fit.
College Freshman,4,"The rooms are great if they are redone, but the ones that haven't gotten redone still have a lot of space."
College Freshman,4,"I love the restaurants around here, but they can get a bit pricy."
College Freshman,4,Apply to all the scholarships you are eligible for
College Sophomore,4,everyone is really passionate about what they want to do. the work load is reasonable and all with the greater purpose of helping you succeed.
College Sophomore,4,they have a variety of different majors and they will help you find the best fit for you. as well as sometimes adding new majors to adapt to popular demand.
College Sophomore,4,"Mount Mary will really help you make sure that you know where you are going and help you get there. They offer many employer recruiters on campus, as well as the student success center that can help you with finding out what is that you want to do with your major."
College Sophomore,4,not a very modern school. it is 100 years old and in some aspects you can tell it is. Continuous remodeling happening making the college experience more pleasurable.
College Sophomore,4,have to come at the right time to get the best spots
College Sophomore,4,We have almost all diverseness on campus
College Sophomore,4,"food is very good on campus, prices should come down a little"
College Sophomore,4,There are plenty places to get connected
College Sophomore,4,"love the campus, food, staff, professors and classmates and activities"
College Sophomore,4,"we're looked at to really be problem solvers, change the face of the future and people relationships"
College Sophomore,4,Did not like the math tests but everything else was fine
College Sophomore,4,"The bus line goes right by the school, so it's easy to get to school via bus.  The campus is not big, so there is no campus transportation."
College Sophomore,4,Being an older student I love it.  The class sizes are conducive to learning and the professors are top notch.
College Sophomore,4,"It is a Catholic school that is predominantly women, so they have strict rules on alcohol and drugs.  They also are careful about visitors and who is allowed in the dorms.  All classes take attendance and attendance is part of the grading system."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus isn't super strict where you feel the need to tip-toe. There are rules, and they are enforced as necessary. I do not live on campus, so I cannot speak for the dorm/resident rules and restrictions."
College Sophomore,4,"Safety at school is great, but the area the school is in cannot be changed, and the area of the school isn't great."
College Sophomore,4,"I believe that my school, Mount Mary University, has very good diversity. At school, there are people of all religions, ethnicities, sexual orientations, etc. There is no judgement on campus."
College Sophomore,4,We have great places around campus to eat however the best eats are 20 min away in downtown Milwaukee.
College Sophomore,2,Don't know anything about Greek life
College Senior,2,No one pays attention t sports at our school. I just used the athletic facilities for the first time this year in three years. It really needs an upgrade with the workout stuff. Im not even sure what sports Mt. Mary provides.
College Senior,2,There aren't a lot of course offerings. The workload is so over the top and no one seems to gain anything long term from this school besides a lot of debt. A lot of teachers have quit in the past few years and some are just holding out for their retirement package. There are great teachers here just hard to come by because they only get part time hours. Registration is horrible if you need any guidance. usually every major has to take 18 credits a semester to stay on track.
College Senior,2,"They sell jobs for Kohl's, Bon ton and Harley Davison."
College Senior,2,No teacher actually does any advising when you enter this school so you really have to know what you want to get the best. They also don't explain finances like how they have a flat rate for full time 12-18 credits. The wifi is crap. Parking is ok but what do you expect at an all girls school.
College Freshman,2,For some reason they are terrible at keeping records and taking responsibility for their mistakes. They have made me pay $1000 more than I was supposed to in tuition and now they're saying that I still have a book when I returned it within the first week of school. The various offices that deal with finances do not communicate well at all. But I love some of the teachers that I've had so far.
College Freshman,2,"I'm not really feeling accepted, but I have one friend so I'm alright."
College Freshman,2,There are no males here and most of the females are not that great.

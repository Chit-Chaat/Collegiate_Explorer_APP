Junior,5,"MiraCosta does not waste any time or resources providing the best experiences for their students. With a multitude of programs that aim to help disadvantaged students such as first-generation students, those in low-income situations that may require transportation, books, or other financial resources, and ACE programs such as UMOJA, MANA, and PUENTE, that are aimed at connecting students with communities and resources that will help to set them up for success. For me, the resources that have directly impacted me have to be the Promise program, which has helped me pay my way through earning my associates degree, as well as the knowledgeable, seasoned staff and faculty that have the know-how to set all students on the path to achieve their educational goals. Without the resources and helpful people at MiraCosta, I am not sure where I would be in relation to achieving my personal goals of earning a Master's degree and pursuing a career I love."
Sophomore,5,"Classes are mostly online due to COVID-19. However, all of the staff are easy to reach and very accommodating. I like that they’re very inclusive of others beliefs and cultures. I feel like everyone has a voice here."
Sophomore,5,Mira Costa has been such a great school because the students and professors are all so helpful and only want students to succeed.  I was never a fan of going to school but I really enjoy my time on campus
Sophomore,5,I enjoy learning online. I have been homeschooled my entire academics. Professors are very helpful when it comes to learning online and do the most that they can do from another screen to help you succeed.
Senior,5,"MiraCosta has amazing professors that are passionate about teaching and are highly educated in their fields. They are willing to sit with you after class and answer any questions you have so that you fully understand the material. The school also offers many resources such as a food pantry, free farmers markets, tutoring, and much more. I couldn't say enough positive things about this school and I recommend it to anyone looking to start out at a community college."
Senior,5,My last on-line class was very informative and detailed. The Professor really knew her subject and was careful that I really understood the subject matter. The discussions were very detailed and made you think along with sharing your opinions with other classmates. Very professional. I can't wait until next semester.
Senior,5,"Professors are top notch and go out of their way to ensure your success. They are not easy by any means, but they will work with you to achieve your goals."
Alum,5,This is a wonderfully diverse school with equal parts in professors and students. Almost every professor I took a course from was extremely pleasant and did their job well. The campus is always buzzing with groups or activities and the staff is extremely involved with their students. Everything about my experience here was wonderful.
Niche User,5,"I took all my classes online. I hope more of their coursework goes online in the future, but from what I've taken already it has been great."
Freshman,5,I was a good experience and I learned a lot and had the opportunity to do a lot of things like explore classes and explore around.
Freshman,5,It was very good I learned a lot and had very good teachers and were very nice at teaching and overall good.
Sophomore,5,"Attending MiraCosta has been very rewarding and worthwhile. The campus is beautiful and easy to navigate. The classes are small enough to get interact with the professors if you need help, and most professors are more than willing to help if you're having trouble with part of the class. I've had great experiences in my on-campus and online classes. The transfer center counselors have been invaluable with helping me to prepare for transfer to a 4-year university. Within the last few years, too, MiraCosta has started implementing four-year bachelor's degrees into their program. It's very close to the freeway and a lot of shops and restaurants. The only thing I wish could change would be the fourth semester of some of their languages, although I understand part of that is student demand/need for those courses. It would've been nice to finish off my German series at the same college."
Sophomore,5,I had an amazing experience at MiraCosta College. The professors always work to help you learn and understand the material and the staff on campus are always finding ways to make campus life easier for students. There are so many programs on campus aimed to help students to do their best in school.
Junior,5,"MiraCosta College has been an excellent experience for me. I am much more of a quiet and reserved person, so taking the leap to go to college after high school made me very nervous. I didn't know what to expect except what I had seen on television. Luckily, after attending the school for over two years, I can say that all of my fears were erased. The teachers really care about students here, and they take the time to address individual issues because the class sizes are much smaller than university classes. The students have generally been very kind and nice to others. As I said before, I am a very reserved person, so it really makes me feel comfortable and able to break out of my shell when the other students are so open and kind. This is a college that I would recommend to everyone, and one that I have only positive things to say about."
Sophomore,5,Excellent college! I highly recommend MiraCosta College to any interested high school seniors or local residents thinking of going back to school. The faculty and administration have always been kind and helpful.
Freshman,5,"I believe this is quite cheap College with good amount of good professors and classes. However, I would recommend to choose your professors wisely, because there only one or two really good professors for each class.  Suits for international students too."
Sophomore,5,"My favorite thing about Miracosta is the professors. They are all seriously dedicated to the students and care a lot about their success. In addition to this, MiraCosta has an unmatched number of student resources for free, there is a food pantry with free food, free tutoring services for foreign language, math, STEM classes, etc. There is no complaints about MiraCosta, other than the general complaint for any community college, which is that establishing a social network is difficult without effort."
Freshman,5,"Was not a full time student but the classes I did take were expertly taught with professors that really took the time both in and out of class to make sure all their students understood the material. The administration helped me out in a few really tricky situations, and I'm always going to be grateful for the way they handled things."
Sophomore,5,"MiraCosta has the best resources a community college can possible have. Whether it's quality professors, inexpensive printing prices, or hotspots available for checkout. Since it's a fairly small college, there's an intimate connection in all classrooms that makes it easier during the learning process. MiraCosta also overlooks the ocean which is just a cherry on top for everything else it offers. My time at MiraCosta has benefitted me as a student because everyone on that campus is willing and ready to help you with anything. It has helped me financially as well due to all the resources they have readily available. I didn't have to spend a ton of money on books, a laptop, internet, printing, etc."
Freshman,5,The professors here are amazing. Miracosta has many opportunities for success and I have really enjoyed the classes I'm taking.
Alum,5,"MiraCosta College is a great stepping stone for those that are planning to transfer into a 4-year Institution. MiraCosta helped me gain better writing, learning and study skills that prepare you for a university setting. This College works very closely with students and strive for their student's success. I’ve had the pleasure to work on campus and all MiraCosta staff prioritizes each and every student's needs. Professors, academic advisers, and college evaluators are deeply involved to help students achieve their academic goals. 

The Local area is wonderful, you can see the ocean from Campus and is located near food, shopping centers, and my favorite Starbucks. These places are in walk able distance. MiraCosta is a small campus so the athletics and music are small but there are still programs available. Student life is nice, there are many clubs and every week during lunch MiraCosta has an activity in the center of campus such as flash mobs, free food, music, dancing, etc."
Freshman,5,"I didn't do great in high school nor did I do bad. I had an average GPA. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. So I just did good enough to able only accepted to one university CSUSM. But because of how pricey education is I decided to not go there. So I decided to try a community college. This was the BEST decision I have ever made. If you want to continue your education but are unsure what you want to do or looking for a more affordable route, you need to go, Mira Costa. From my experience they have small class sizes, the counselors are very helpful, it's very diverse, and the professors care about you. The campus is nice and well kept. They have announcements and club meetings everywhere. They have taught me so much. Coming here has helped discover what I want to be."
Alum,5,"The campus has the greatest Professors, food, assistance needed for students to work with for the education. I have helped many students choose the right professors for courses."
Junior,5,MiraCosta has a great deal of diversity in it's student population. The staff and professors really care about your success and go above and beyond to help you achieve your goals. It is perfect to start out for higher education because it is affordable and an easier transition from high school. They have plenty of resources to help you assimilate to college and even to reintroduce students returning.
Sophomore,5,"nothing compares to the education and support i've received here. such an incredible place. my classes are rigorous and i learn so much, and the teachers i've had have always been so willing to help in any way possible. love it so much.  they do so much for their students, its really great."
Alum,5,"It was extremely easy to apply, and very easy to sit down with advisors and plan a course line. Professors are extremely knowledgable and most still currently work in their fields of study. Mira Costa is the best rated and highest paying salary (for professors) community college in all of Southern California."
Junior,5,"I have loved that all the professors are very attentive to each student and the class sizes are small enough to get the necessary help and attention from peers and the professors. At MiraCosta, I felt cared about as a student and I felt like my education was made a priority."
Sophomore,5,"Close to the beach, small classes, caring professors, MiraCosta is the best community college hands down."
Sophomore,5,"Great school, smaller community college, great for more attention from the teachers.  Financial aide available, and they will work with you for federal work study, and even internships.  I have had great success here, and I never could have imagined that I would be ready to transfer to a four year institute."
Sophomore,5,"I am fond of the Miracosta college campus and it's staff, This is my second year going and so far I have really enjoyed it. Miracosta is full of diversity and educated individuals with unique stories on why they chose this community college. My campus is located in Encinitas which is very convenient because I live about 7 minutes away. An improvement that could be made is the way situations are addressed on campus, many of it is via email and it can be difficult staying up to date with emails when you have so much going on in your life; I would prefer verbal talks maybe a certain day on campus or something that can make these situations easily addressed."
Junior,5,Terrific school with amazing staff in every department necessary. Great choice for a community college overall. The college takes good care of their students and looks after their well being.
Freshman,5,"Absolutely feels very comforting especially entering as a first generation college student. The counselors are very helpful. They have a free food pantry so no student goes hungry. Amazing faculty staff and professors. Also, free tuition for those that qualify and amazing certification programs."
Sophomore,5,MiraCosta is a beautiful and fun place to be. It is a diverse campus with a lot of energy and resources. The professors are very knowledgeable in their fields and have me feeling confident I am getting the best education. I would like to see them become less strict about parking.
Alum,5,"Loved it here, I was very involved so if you want to meet new people and enjoy it you have to get involved"
Sophomore,5,I think a lot of professors go here since it's close to the beach and the weather. So a lot of professors with impressive backgrounds whether in the private sector or graduating from impressive universities are here compared to most community colleges.
Alum,5,"MiraCosta has a beautiful campus and incredible professors. My experience at this college has been nothing, but wonderful. However, the college counselors are not the best! Although some are helpful, I found myself going through assist.org to help me through the transfer process more than my counselors!"
Alum,5,"It took me awhile but I'm glad i went with Mira Costa College! I went in determined on what career I wanted and when I graduated, I left as a different major but ready to continue more with school!!!!"
Sophomore,5,"I love studying at MCC. I was here for the first two years of my college education. Studying here provided me the knowledge and other outcomes. I wish I could stay here longer because I love its environment and staffs here. It also helped me through the transfer process. I got accepted into UCLA, UCI, and UCR."
Graduate Student,5,"MiraCosta is a wonderful, close knit community college with great teachers. The environment is so friendly and the staff is caring and helpful. I was sad to graduate and would be happy to return some day just to take a fun elective. I highly recommend MiraCosta for anyone of any age looking for a quality education in a personalized environment."
Senior,5,"I love this school and I have never had a problem while attending here. I feel safe, cared for, welcome, and happy when I am on an off campus knowing that I am apart of the community."
Sophomore,5,Very Helpful Councilors. Professor take the time to help you when needed. Campus programs such as EOPS has helped my way through the very expensive books. Everyone on campus is really friendly.
Sophomore,5,It is not only a beautiful campus but all of the professors have been top notch . I usually take the full time faculty and have not been let down . The counseling staff has also been incredible . They even have a free farmers market for their students . They care about the well being of their students and it shows .
Freshman,5,"Great community college with very helpful staff. The professors seem to love there job, their nice, and helpful. There are lots of student support programs such as the transfer center, the writing center, counseling, community service, etc. Love this college!"
Freshman,5,"Although this is my first year at MCC, it is a great school. The climate there is very relaxed but students are enthusiastic about their career paths and determined to meet their goals. There are many resources available to the students for volunteering, information about careers and transferring, and many others. The teachers at MCC are also amazing, and have added to my wonderful experience at this school."
Freshman,5,The teachers make an effort to help you learn the material. The campus is in a beautiful place with a view of the ocean and snow capped mountains in the spring. I also love the wide variety of classes they offer.
Junior,5,"I love the diversity of this school, people are welcoming and helpful. Staff members are great very compassionate. The professors  have a passionate teaching styles that motivate others (Pro. Thompson)."
Alum,5,"My experience at MiraCosta College was phenomenal. From the professors to campus life, everything about it was great. It's a great community college to start your academic career and prepare for a four-year university."
Junior,5,What I liked about Mira Costa the most are the professors and how helpful they are in making every individual succeed also give very good advice for future classes. I would would not like anything changed because the school is already on the right track as it is there hasn’t been a single change that I absolutely hate that the school has done.
Alum,5,"MiraCosta was a great experience for me. Although it is a community college, people do take there education seriously and are motivated to do better. I was a part of the soccer team there which lead me to make a lot of new friends. My class experience was very good. The professors really cared about each and everyone of there students. Unlike other schools these professors really wanted you to succeed. It was as if there job was to make the college experience easier and that’s exactly what they did."
Sophomore,5,"I like this college because it is very close to my house. Finding parking can be a little difficult at the Oceanside location. Both campuses are in good conditions, however I think the Oceanside campus could have some improvement. So far I have liked all the teachers that I've had. Miracosta offers many things to students besides just classes. They have a Career center where they help you choose a major that would be good for you, personally this is the only area that I've had an experience with. Counselors are great as well. I think this is a really good school"
Sophomore,5,I've really liked MiraCosta so far. The teacher I've had have been great. Very helpful and with a lot of knowledge on their field. There is a lot of diversity in the campus as well.
Junior,5,"The teachers all love their jobs and do everything in their power to help students succeed. The class sizes are small and it really allows for a more hands on experience. The students are nice and there is diversity. There are two campuses, I go to the one in Encinitas. The parking is good and the campus feels very safe and comfortable."
Alum,5,"MiraCosta has provided me with the most valuable tool my career will ever see, my first college degree. This has given me the confidence to continue in my academic career, as well as apply for much needed financial scholarship assistance. I have received so much support and encouragement from this institution, that I've pushed myself to achieve goals I never imagined possible. Now I have achieved them, and I am grateful for the scholastic, and career guidance I received from MiraCosta. I am attending California State University San Marcos for Environmental Studies. Not only did I never believe this would happen, I could not be happier with how my life is right now. I Know education has changed my life, and I hope to meet others who feel the same way about the personal growth and development they've gained from their collegiate education."
Freshman,5,"MiraCosta College is a great place for international students as I am. Experienced professors, friendly staff, smart classmates. I love here. Campuses are very well equipped and located at beautiful places. I highly recommend this college!"
Sophomore,5,At first i was nervous about going to a new school after joining the United States Marines but this school has been able to offer alot for me. The classes are wonderful and i havemt have a teacher that wasnt less then great.
Alum,5,Miracosta college is an amazing community college that is affordable and really cares about the success of its students. The professors all are experienced and love working for the school. The school offers some four year degrees as well as a complete nursing program. The campus is great as well as the location. You can see the ocean from campus and most of your days will be sunny. Miracosta also has a great library and cafeteria as well as student life.
Niche User,5,"Ocean views, peaceful campus, lots of open spaces for lounging on the grass and taking a break from studying.  Teachers are great; some adjunct professors from nearby Universities."
Sophomore,5,Mira Costa has lots of great programs and classes.  The professors are also really great!  I've never had a professor I didn't like.  The sports are really great as well.  The teams are super well trained and are super fun to watch.
Senior,5,"I liked how friendly and helpful the staff was as well as having resources available. Coming to MiraCosta, I made new friends, tried out new classes i ended up liking and being able to just come to school and get my work done and following my own schedule."
Junior,5,"This college provides support for its students in various ways. Health Services, Disabled Student Services, food pantry, showers for homeless students and supportive staff who help you reach your goal. The counseling staff help you choose the right classes to reach your educational goals. The main campus is small enough that you are able to spot past classmates and professors. Most people are friendly and helpful. This is the best college I have been to."
Junior,4,"Since COVID has moved school online, I can say that professors have stepped up to the challenge and have made online learning as accessible as possible. For me, I naturally don't work as well online, so my grades have suffered a little, but my professors are very understanding to the outstanding situation, and have worked with me to map out my success in the remaining weeks of the semester. I'd highly suggest going to MiraCosta if you want a quality online experience that won't empty your bank account."
Sophomore,4,"Classes are mostly online due to COVID-19. However, all of the staff are easy to reach and very accommodating. I like that they’re very inclusive of others beliefs and cultures. I feel like everyone has a voice here."
Senior,4,"Online classes can be challenging, but if you are motivated and determined to do well then they should be no problem. The professors have always been very accessible and approachable whenever I have had any questions. Due to the current pandemic, all of my classes have been moved online. The professors are doing a great job of using online resources to supplement the class while also making Zoom sessions engaging."
Sophomore,4,"Overall it has been good there are a few cases where i didn't get along with a professor or 2 but, that's going to happen anywhere you go."
Alum,4,"For the most part I had a great online experience with this college. There were a couple of times when the professors were not very involved with the course, but that was rare. Most professors were eager and quick to help if needed."
Niche User,4,"I took all my classes online. I hope more of their coursework goes online in the future, but from what I've taken already it has been great. Great staff and teachers as well."
Freshman,4,MiraCosta is a great option for many students. Going to community college is so much cheaper than attending a 4 year because at MiraCosta they have the MiraCosta promise which means you can get your first two years free. If you transfer in two years this place is a great option and really sets you up nicely for CSUs and UCs.
Sophomore,4,"MiraCosta Community College is a pretty good college. I'm currently enrolled in here and I'm loving it. I was trying to major in Liberal Studies but then I changed my mind to Computer Science and MiraCosta has been here to help me out. Also the classes while they may seem expensive, just wait until you see the four year college prices. MiraCosta College is a community college to help you save money, the class prices here are actually cheap for what they give you. Now for the teachers, I currently have some of the best teachers possible, it's sad that this term is ending and I won't have them next term. But they have so far been helpful. Last term though while the teachers weren't bad, they were very tough to please so watch out for that. The food here is some of the best I have ever eaten as well. Textbooks can be expensive but they have some classes that you can take where the textbooks are free of charge. So far, my experiences here have been great."
Sophomore,4,"Something I really liked from MiraCosta was definitely the classroom sizes. The average class size was about 20 students the professors were able to make bonds with students. Some counselors aren't as helpful as I imagined but, there are some amazing counselors that will do their best to help."
Alum,4,"I liked it here! It was an affordable community college to attend, along with good teachers! They were very helpful, and assisted students when they needed it. The campus was very clean and eco-friendly. It was a very diverse campus with lots of opportunities!"
Sophomore,4,The campus is very nice and the instructors are always available to assist when needed. I felt like their goal was to make sure I succeeded!
Junior,4,"I have attended Mira Costa College for 3 years and I think it’s an excellent choice and has a very friendly environment on campus. The class sizes are smaller so there is a lot more one on one with the professors, which in my opinion is always a plus ! There’s is also a ton of extracurricular activities to par take in outside the class room! There are multiple events that go on each semester to help recruit fellow students and everyone tries to make that day exciting and as fun as possible! Everyone, professors and students are very helpful and friendly, this is overall a great College to attend!"
Alum,4,There was a lot of opportunity as MiraCosta. They are very helpful when it comes to students and they make sure that the teachers are available to help out the students after class. The tutoring center there is helpful as they have students helping other students pass their classes. Everyone there is really nice and the teachers are extremely passionate and want to see their students thrive.
Freshman,4,MiraCosta College is a great community college filled with diverse people and good community. The professors are caring and well prepared for classes when we show up and are there for their students. I would love for there to be more ways for people to be plugged in and build a stronger connection to one another. However with it being a community college there isnt much of that that goes around.
Junior,4,"Great community college! Some of the professors are incredible since MiraCosta pays professors higher than any other community college in the world. They are very accommodating and have plenty of resources for students to succeed. A lot of their infrastructure feels a bit outdated compared to many Universities, but it seems that they work with what they have."
Alum,4,"There are many different services offered on campus to help each student succeed! The school has free tutoring for almost all areas of study, job and internship opportunities, and assistance for those who need a little extra help in the classroom."
Freshman,4,The veterans department is very helpful and reachable. The counselor who assisted me guided me through the entire process. Showed me exactly the classes I needed to take and was super honest. I didn't have trouble to start the process for college which was my biggest concern. It was super smooth and easy. The veterans at the lounge area were super helpful as well and made me feel comfortable. Which was the most important thing for us transitioning service members. I was able to relate and talk about our experiences and share new ones since being out of the military. Only thing is on Fridays the one of the veteran offices close at noon which really gives no time to stop but unless your free in the morning. Good thing there are open during the week till 7 which helps me since I work down in San Diego I still have time to stop by and drop off paperwork or ask questions if needed.
Freshman,4,"The people, both staff and students, are very kind and welcoming at MiraCosta. There is a good academic environment and all of the staff are incredibly supportive in order to help students achieve their goals. The only reason 1 star was lost is because their application, course selection, etc. process was a bit confusing. I have been told that they are completely revamping their website, so hopefully they will make the process less confusing and more clear with their new website."
Sophomore,4,Teachers are very understanding and helpful. This school provides a safe environment for those who need it. They hold small events in which students interact with another about different topics in school. They also make sure your aware of the different help programs they have and the different clubs they offer as well. They also send a lot of friendly reminders about school events and share transfer meetings so one knows what they need to transfer.
Graduate Student,4,"The teachers, for the most part, are of surprisingly high caliber, many of which teach at the local universities as well.  the San Elijo campus is beautiful and right next to the beach with excellent parking."
Sophomore,4,"I would love there to be more computer science courses. Additionally, the counseling staff does not really seem to know how to guide you; you'll have to be familiar with your transfer plan."
Sophomore,4,"Just your average community college. Some of the teachers are well qualified, while others are not as much."
Sophomore,4,I like how big the campus is and how small the number of students per professor ratio is. I like how several of my professors had PhDs and had taught or are currently teaching at reputed colleges. They provide students with many resources and want to see each student succeed. The overall environment is safe and friendly!
Niche User,4,"The atmosphere at MiraCosta is very good; the class size is often small and allows for a better interactive experience. The campus is nice, with good scenery and useful facilities such as a library and tutoring services."
Sophomore,4,"I love the school, I specifically go to the San Elijo campus which is very small. It's a bit old and could use some renovation. Overall though, I have had amazing professors/classes at this college."
Junior,4,The class sizes are small and the professors are very attentive and helpful. You are easily able to meet with your teachers and get one on one help. I have noticed most of my teachers want you to succeed and will help you to do so. The tutoring center and writing center are easily accessible and helpful and it isn't hard to make an appointment. If you are looking for a school for sports this isn't the one for you. The college is less of an art and sports school and more for science and math based. Though it is not much for sports it does have an amazing dance program and I love my hip hop classes. I would definitely recommend this school based on the professors and educational assistance.
Sophomore,4,"I think since most of the teachers there are underpaid, it shows just how much they like their job because they stay with it and teach well. Lots of resources and diversity. Not very hyped up though."
Alum,4,"For the most part, the teaching staff was very well equiped to navigate students to their desired 4-year institution. The facilities felt a little outdated, but the view of the ocean was unbeatable."
Alum,4,"This was a great school, I successfully was able to get my Associate degree. The classes are of average size, and the staff is pretty helpful especially if your not familiar with the area. Would recommend for local students!"
Freshman,4,"Great faculty, and small class sizes make this community college a great place to begin your higher education journey."
Junior,4,The professors do a great job at getting to know the students and they genuinely want to help the students succeed. The counselors are also very helpful and are there for whatever a student needs.
Sophomore,4,"It has a beautiful campus and an excellent library, which is very important to me. They have excellent academic counseling services and many ways to get involved in activities like stargazing and hiking and community service."
Sophomore,4,"MiraCosta is a great community college. The professors are kind and care for their students’ success, the campuses are beautiful, and the classrooms and other facilities are clean and new."
Niche User,4,"Miracosta is a very enjoyable place, although it is a bit small. The school the culture will keep you very happy to be part of the this school. There are small class size which helps a lot for learning and also the professors are easily approachable."
Sophomore,4,"MiraCosta College is a wonderful community college. With my experience as a student, I've enjoyed almost all of my courses I've taken in the past year. I was lucky enough to have educated professors to push me to my full potential. Which has been challenging, yet beneficial for me as a student. I honestly don't think I would change a thing about MiraCosta. I have learned so much and will be forever grateful for education I've received from this college."
Freshman,4,I have not had a experience with Mira Costa. This will be my first year with Mira Costa.  I chose to go to Mira Costa because I like the way the people were when I called for information as well as they have Associate Degree that I was wanting to obtain.
Sophomore,4,"I wish Bridge to success were advertised better and that I had known about it the first day I attended. For every amazing teacher there’s been a few equally horrible ones who shouldn’t be allowed to teach. They shouldn’t allow any sales or voter registration people on campus with out clearly going over rules with them. They aren’t allowed to approach students, students have to approach them if their interested, but the would bother me in the middle of studding any way. I liked the fact that their was little to no sports or partying or if there was, I wasn’t exposed to it. I don’t like that teachers have stopped having students signing sylubi as contacts and treating them as such. I have had two new teachers not count assignments I completed and ignore counting completed and on time extra credit. I had to go above them to force them to do it."
Sophomore,4,I originally hated the idea of attending MCC. I wanted to go straight to a 4-year after high school and was always told the negative aspects of going to a 2-yaer. But I am glad I am at MCC now. It is a great stepping stone and has allowed me to solidify what I want to do with my college career and has introduced me to new  opportunities and helped me find different groups of people to interact with while on campus.
Freshman,4,"Although they have a fantastic Student Services Center, the campus is very spread out and not easy to navigate. The signs directing you to go to the different areas of campus are very small, and difficult to read while you're driving, especially if you're new to the campus (don't trust your GPS to get you where you need to go!). It can be disorienting and frustrating to find many areas of the campus due to lack of signage, buildings that aren't marked at all, and parking lots that are often either crowded or have seemingly endless construction going on that blocks access to important parking spots...like those for disabled students and visitors."
Alum,4,I went to MiraCosta College before transferring to  SDSU. I enjoyed the professors and most classes. The vet center was terrible basically gave me wrong information every time I went in there.
Freshman,4,"I think that the campus is beautiful and the professors are dedicated to helping their students excel. The school also has many resources available to students of different backgrounds enabling them to further their college careers. If I had to improve the campus, it would be to enhance the level of security as well as create more parking for students. Overall, this is an amazing community college."
Freshman,4,All of my professors are great and knowledgeable. The campus is very nice and pleasant to be on and always clean. Small class sizes really help with the education process.
College Senior,4,I prefer online classes because I can work on my own and usually at my own pace. The discussion boards are usually very interactive and the teacher is available every time we need them
College Senior,4,Not from personal experience but I know people who were able to go to the career center and get some post grad opportunities
College Senior,4,I am a psychology major and there are dozens of classes that relate to psychology. I get the opportunity to see it from different perspectives as well and I think with a lot of other majors they don't get to get different perspectives on that subject
College Junior,4,Taking online classes is easy and very relaxing.
College Freshman,4,"It was easy transferring my past credit from a previous school. I haven't had to ask to extend any homework assignments, so I'm not sure what the flexibility of the class is. So no hassle as far as I know."
College Freshman,4,"Its awesome because they give a list of courses needed in order to transfer as well as additional courses that you can take here that are the same courses in the University, but are cheaper as its a community college."
College Freshman,4,"The courses were challenging at times, but the professors were awesome and are accessible if you have any questions or need clarifications about the class."
College Freshman,4,"The value of a degree from this school isn't that great, but its an awesome stepping stone to transfer to a University."
College Freshman,4,The classes and courses that I need to take to get my degree and things that I need to learn in order to get a better job. The workload isn't too much.
College Freshman,4,What makes it unique is that there are people from all walks of life who attend. People who are fresh out of highschool to people who are older and going back to get their education. Also it's fairly close to where I live. I have many friends who attend this school so I would choose this school if I could do it all over again.
College Freshman,4,The school does a great job helping the students find internships or jobs.
College Freshman,4,"I mean I m only at the community college level and am only taking pre-requisits, so I mean these classes are preparing me. But I feel the work is manageable and the school helps us if we need to find internships or job opportunities. They are great with that."
College Freshman,4,"I chose the ""It's great"" option because the school really is great. Every class that I have take has had an instructor passionate about the material they teach. I don't ever feel that I am uncomfortable in a class because of the lack of motivation. I believe this is what makes Mira Costa College unique. The reason I didn't choose, ""It's  the best"" was because of the lack of student involvement the school puts on. I know college is not all about school spirit, but sometimes it is nice to see that and participate in that. That is why I am working hard to achieve all my needed credits, so I can transfer to a university as soon as possible."
College Sophomore,4,"I've taken one online class to fulfill and elective requirement. The class was easy to register for and there were emails and notifications letting me know how to access the coursework. In this class there were multiple class discussions each week, connecting the class together even though we never met. The teacher was readily available over email for questions. I personally don't like online as much because I don't feel like you remember the content as well as a normal class setting. It's a little superficial. I also have had other students plagiarize  my work in class discussions which was a huge mess. But other than that, the content is usually good. The work loads can get a bit heavy since professors want you to engage."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a vast variety of courses offered. If you want to learn about something, there is usually a course for it. The professors are very helpful. Generally their coursework is straight forward. What is on the syllabus is what is going to be taught and expected of you. There are no surprise expectations. In the beginning of the semester, you know what you'll be doing. The class size depends on the course, for instance, english is usually a small class of around 15-20 students. When you get into the more specialized and high demand classes you start seeing class sizes of 30-40 students. Many of them will drop by the end of the semester though, so you end with half that. Every teacher teaches differently, but is mostly lecture and note-taking the review for tests. Registering for classes is straightforward too."
College Sophomore,4,"Since Mira Costa is a 2 year college, it's main focus is to get you your general ed or help you transfer to a 4 year institution. Because this is the main goal of the school, it has many tools in place in order for you to achieve this and be successful. The value of the degree is great. The honor society is great, as it has many tools for this as well. The career center is very helpful."
College Sophomore,4,"I was at Mira costa to complete general ed and prepare for transfer which I have completed. The academic experience is fantastic. Most the professors understand the trials of being a college student and will aid you in any way they can to get a great grade in the class. The teachers teach at a high academic level, but keep the workloads at a doable amount. The career and counseling services at Mira Costa are wonderful. Making appointments is easy and there are people that will sit down with you for an hour and figure out your plan, draw it out for you, and give you options. Each and every professor I have run into is interested in seeing you succeed. Overall, it is a great experience and the academics are great."
College Sophomore,4,"Mira Costa is a wonderful place for you to transition into college learning and creates a supportive environment for getting to where you want to go in life. If you choose to put in the effort, Mira Costa will aid you in all ways possible to achieve your dreams."
College Student,2,"I had previously attended a semester at Arizona State University through their online program and I had a semester's worth of credits that did not transfer from Arizona State University to MiraCosta.  When I had inquired about why they weren't transferred, I received a very unsatisfactory answer."
College Freshman,2,Miracosta doesn't technically have my program so I have to do classes that are similar but not the same as the classes I would take at the school I would be transferring to. It's a bit of a pain.
College Junior,2,"I do not recommend graduating from a community college that only offers associates degrees in almost every field of study. In this westernized country, there is no way you will get a well-paying job based on your degree you achieved from a community college, so I do not think anyone should settle for graduating from a community college. But for a community college, they have great career counselors and a great atmosphere to figure out your path in life."
College Senior,2,There aren't really any Philosophy majors at my school as it is not an offered major. I will likely need to change to General Studies to get an AA. I will transfer to a 4 year Philosophy program.
College Senior,2,"The RN program itself is bad, BUt my other courses have been good as far as scheduling."
College Senior,2,There is no help with RN positions. It took a previous classmate 8 months to get a job with no help from the program.
College Junior,2,"The site used by most online teacher called Moodle is ridiculously slow and over complicates everything. You basically teach yourself with online courses, so I think it is a waste of money. Avoid online courses.  "
College Sophomore,2,The Counseling department has meetings 2-3 weeks out. During drop-in hours you rarely get see a counselor. When you do finally get a meeting with the counselor one will tell you a different thing than the last one. This can be a big deal because meetings are few and much classwork to advance towards your educational goals follows these meetings; make sure you confirm from an outside source if you follow any educational objectives given by the counseling department.
College Freshman,2,"I would never take an online class unless forced to. The work load seems tedious and the burden of learning is heavier. The teacher may provide self made lecture notes, but expect to look into textbook more often. Interaction from the teacher comes from the occasional email or bulletin post found on the site which hosts the course. Peer to peer interaction is mainly responding to posts found on the site which hosts the course."
College Sophomore,2,Incompetent assistants or representatives. Economy is bad. Counselor and similar reps. have never helped!
College Junior,2,i did not want to talk a online class because i was afraid i was not going to learn anything and not take the class seriously. That is exactly what happened i feel like its not a class more like a book discussion club because the professor barely even talks to us through black board and honestly i think i  am just not learning anything applicable to the real world.

College Sophomore,2,Burnouts and 14Th Grade High School Students. There are a few diamonds in the rough but generally speaking most of the people I had classes with had very little ambition. They seem to end up at MiraCosta because they don't know what else to do with their lives.
College Sophomore,2,"Mostly White – The students attending MiraCosta San Ellijo campus are mostly upper class white kids.  There are a quite a few Asians, I believe that the school has a study abroad program set up with Japan.  There is an equal amount of males and females as well."
College Freshman,2,Post Grad – I dont really know anything about post grad programs
College Sophomore,2,"Cheap and Cheerful – The tuition is cheap, but since it is a community college, there is a limit to the college experience that can be had here. It is hard to break away from the feeling that people are only on campus to take their classes and leave, but the general atmosphere is friendly."
Sophomore,1,i would not recommend it most teachers did not communicate well and knew little to knowing about teaching online and kept going as if it were a normal class. the only accommodations they gave where giving powerpoints and having video calls. in my opinion due to covid-19 they should of went over their tests and quizzes more to make sure they were online friendly.
College Freshman,1,"There is no interaction with your peers, no study groups and you're pretty much teaching yourself all of the material. Also, the workload seems greater because you are teaching it to yourself as well as completing assignments."
College Senior,1,"They are understaffed. I feel rushed each time I go there. They never answer the phone, ever. They are basically unhelpful."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Nothing is unique about this school. Small campus, at least the san elijo campus is and its very plain."
Recent Alumnus,1,"the only online course I signed up for was a nightmare. I thought that since it was an 'online' course I could do the work whenever I was available, however, the instructor required we log on at specific times of the day, those times were in conflict with other courses scheduled. I had to drop the course"
College Junior,1,Easy Classes – As a history major( don't laugh I know) the history courses they provided were lack luster. I know it's a CC and most of us are here to get credits and transfer but the history classes were like non-ap history classes in highschool. I knew more about ancient history from occasionally watching the History Channel than what was taught in class. The workload was a joke; read a couple pages from a book and you're good.My advice for other history majors or general transfer students is take anthropology instead for humanities credit. The course is a tad bit more challenging and the professors more lively and just wait to take history courses at a real university.
College Sophomore,1,Not So Great! I would say the only good thing about attending MiraCosta College is that it is close to my home.  If I could go back in time and change the fact that I started out here I would!  I have tried transferring schools a few times but the counselors are incompetent and unhelpful.  The school often looses transcripts and therefore you end up spending money trying to get them sent out on time.  The classes used to be easy to get into but now its such a hassle.  Everything fills up and it is hard to get the classes that you need or want.  All in all it has been a harsh experience and I cannot wait to go somewhere else!
College Student,1,tacher was nice. tried to help me as much as he could
College Freshman,1,Online ! I am not a fan of the online classes. It is very hard to log on & pay attention. I personally did not like my online class experience. I dropped the class because it gave me a head ache. I am a visual learner and I am very talkative. I ask questions all the time and online i felt like everyone was a robot. Online classes are not for me.
College Junior,1,"Apparently, there was a 50% increase in applications this year, and we are halfway through the semester and I have still not recieved a response from my application that I filed 2 weeks BEFORE the semester started. It's horrible! I had to pay everything out of pocket."

Freshman,5,"The professors did well by using the necessary tools and going even further by finding more to make at home teaching/learning much, much easier."
Sophomore,5,A very inviting atmosphere. Everyone tends to feel welcome here. The science professors are very engaging and work to ensure that each student understands what is being taught.
Sophomore,5,"Hello all, my name is Vernecia Phillip. I have attended in the past and do continue to attend the Albert A. Sheen complex (UVI). One of the best things about this particular university is its particularly beautiful campus. On a beautiful sunny day, which is mostly everyday, the trees sway in the cool breeze; the birds sing in their nest and go about their business feeding and catering to their young, while professors and students walk by greeting and engaging in conversation with each other. With a campus so beautiful one could easily forget that this place is an environment for higher education and relax into all the goodness that nature and people alike have to offer. Most professors and staff members are good natured and easy going"
Freshman,5,The University of the Virgin Islands is a wonderful institution to attend if your looking to further your academic learning. The University of the Virgin Islands
Alum,5,Loved the campus and the easy accessibility to other educational resources. Its located on a beautiful mountain site with walking distance from the beach. The faculty members are very helpful and provides thorough understanding of the material and what is to be expected of their students. There is a cafeteria near the dorm room as well as public transport that comes walking distance from the dorms. Food is customizable to ones needs and everything else is available in the book store.
Sophomore,5,"The University of the Virgin Islands has been a great experience so far. The school is small and down to earth and there is free help such as tutoring for math m, writing and any subject. The teachers are very knowledgeable and understanding. The dorm life is amazing you can go out and have fun with wonderful people on campus with rides to and from any scene. The campus is really amazing and anyone can excel here."
Freshman,5,"Its a cool school, and it feel homie like. I have been attending here for about a year now and i love it. The place is diversity and you meet people from all over the place. they have different activities and programs that can fit the character of any person."

Freshman,5,"Not only does the University of the Virgin Islands accommodate your stay with room and board, but they offer great classes to fit your major and/or minor. In my opinion UVI has fit my needs and others very well as they are not only trying to help you reach your degree but encourage you to have a fun time achieving it as well."
College Junior,5,"I did my own research as freshman, I wouldn't have had this opportunity at the other university i was accepted to. Ive gone off island this past summer to do research and UVI played a huge role in that. I may also have a chance to do an internship with a federal organization next summer because of UVI."
College Junior,5,"The athletics in my school are very great, progressive and competent in every sports that the school participate in except for football in which I'm in and also to which one of our opponents is better than ours which cause that we haven't win a championship for football in a very long time, but in all of the other sports we always win and bring the trophy home with us whether is in soccer (in which I participate in), basketball, volleyball, baseball, softball etc... Actually, just the year before last year, we won every championship sport, except football just like I said. All of those were able to accomplish cause of our team performances, from our fan support, school spirit and our athletic facilities and mostly the most important the support of our community."
College Freshman,5,Drugs are not a major issue. People respect others and are aware that it is not acceptable.

College Student,5,Have to show ID's at the gate after midnight
College Student,5,"The best thing about living in the Virgin Islands is the great weather that ranges from 71 degrees at night to 82 degrees during the winter the months. It never gets to hot during the summer if you want to take classes, I would say it gets about 89-92 degrees on the St. Thomas campus. It has scattered showers everyday but thats expected because it's a tropical island!"
College Junior,5,Not much happens on campus in regards to safety

College Sophomore,5,Opportunities are endless. It just takes confidence for someone to get up and get it! 
College Sophomore,5,"WAY better than the dining in the cafeteria. Italian, Brazilian, French! you name it, there is something always interesting to catch out. Even during late hour. "

College Freshman,5,Its very entertaining living on campus.
College Freshman,5,"Parking is in the middle of the dorms and the university itself, its very convenient."
College Sophomore,5,The security on campus is very great. Students will often see the campus security personnel walking or driving around to make sure that students are secured. There are cameras on campus to keep students and staff safe. I feel safe on campus.
College Sophomore,5,The parking on campus isn't far from the campus. There is always space in the parking lot so one wouldn't be spending half hour looking for a parking spot.

College Freshman,5,Parking is great. There is a huge parking lot that accommodates most students .

College Sophomore,5,The campus is very safe. Recently they have put up a gate and this has made me feel much more safe.
College Sophomore,5,"As an elementary education major, I will begin student teaching in my senior year, which acts as an internship. Student teachers are unpaid, but the time commitment can be just as rigorous as a regular paid teacher. My responsibilities include coming up with lesson plans for the week. Providing a sense of understanding to my students"
College Sophomore,5,Drug safety is of much importance here we hardly here or have any trouble about those things
College Sophomore,5,It is very inexpensive for transportation to and from the university.

With the beautiful year round weather and the locals warm hearts tugging at you with pure kindness, great food and shopping. The atmosphere is idea for a pleasing lifestyle of simply living."

College Junior,5,"Professor Are Very Helpful – The professors here are excellent in this respect especially when they know  you on a personal level but you've got to show personal interest and even sometimes when you don't they still give a little encouraging nudge to help their students. At UVI  there's also a bulletin wall with information on job applications, graduate school, etc. The networking opportunities are inevitable because of the different backgrounds of professors there."
College Junior,5,24-7 Summer – It is an extended summer vacation in the tropics and all one have to do is attend school. 78-89 degree F most times nice walk to classes. when it rains sometimes at nights the air feels fresh and clean
College Sophomore,5,The weather is great for UVI...ITS ON THE ISLANDS..WHAT MORE TO SAY
Freshman,4,"The University of the Virgin Islands is a very special place. Because it is located on a group of islands, it is a pretty small campus, so you get a very intimate experience. The students are very friendly, and the culture of the islands is very much felt on the campus."
Freshman,4,"Teachers make you, the student a priority, and it feels just as though you are in a normal classroom setting."
Freshman,4,I love the campus. It is very spacious with various atmospheres of groups of people. The scenery is also very nice.
Freshman,4,"Attending the University of the Virgin Islands has sure been a different and memorable experience for me so far. Things that make this school unique in its own right are the teachers and experiences made there. The teachers at this school always  attempt to create a connection with their students to better relate to them. They also provide you with the best conditions possible in order to suit your work needs in a given situation, as long as u communicate with them. Loving on campus provides a different experience with people because you are exposed to many different cultures of people, whether foreigners or locals throughout the islands. It exposes you to many different and interesting cultures and creates a learning experience that your won’t usually get at most colleges or universities. The only thing that can improve for this school is conditions of buildings. But overall, the University of the Virgin Islands is the place to be."
Junior,4,"With the knowledge and experiences gained thus far, I know I made the right choice with attending this HBCU. I chose UVI because it is located in the Caribbean and offered a degree program in Music Education. Also, the lower tuition cost and the close proximity to home were a plus for me.  My advisors and professors invest wholeheartedly in my education. They also develop personal relationships which make me feel like more than just another student. The university is a welcoming community and is not so big that a student would feel lost in the mass of students. UVI’s low student-teacher ratio of 12:1 creates a nurturing environment in which students can thrive. These are the reasons why I am happy with my decision to study at UVI.
I would, however, like to see changes with campus food, student life, and athletics."
Niche User,4,My experience at the Univeristy of the Virgin Islands was very good. I took a trip there to get information about my reserach topic. The professors are well educated and friendly.
Sophomore,4,"Going to college in the Virgin Islands is an amazing experience. You are surrounded by culture, beaches right around the corner, and teachers who are willing to help find the better you and push you as far as you could possibly go. However the on-campus experience is a little shaky, the only complaint i have is with the food. They don't have food for everyone to eat such as those who are vegetarian."
Niche User,4,"The University of the Virgin Islands is an excellent school. They are very nice, patient, and willing to work with you."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about the University of the Virgin Islands is the fact that it has two campuses, one on St. Croix and the other on St. Thomas. I love how both campuses are very spacious. You have many different places to study and meet new people."
Alum,4,"UVI is a Historically Black College and University (HBCU). You can expect a top-notch education with outstanding instruction. All degree programs on the undergraduate and graduate levels are very rigorous, and prepare you for your career and life! Attending UVI has been a great academic decision for me, on reason being it was very cost effective. In state and out of state tuition and overall costs are much cheaper compared to other colleges and universities nationwide. There are various sport teams, clubs, groups, and other extracurricular activities that an individual can participate in that will enhance your academic career. The school's population is quite diverse as students are of various cultures, ethnicity, religious beliefs, and sexual orientation; this contributes to the type of experience that you will have. However, one major drawback is the scheduling of classes which do not provide much flexibility for individuals who are working full-time and may be single parents."
Junior,4,The University Of The Virgin Islands is a good school. Has quite a few majors to offer you. I think there should be a wider variety to choose from. But the college life there has been pretty amazing. The teachers are awesome. I really like the fact that there’s the writing center and math center for students who may be having trouble. UVI has a lot to offer. There’s different pageants and outdoor activities to enjoy. The people are really healpful and friendly in the library as well as the registrars office.
Sophomore,4,"The University of the Virgin Islands is such a good  school. The staff is amazing they welcome students with smiles and they are always ready to assist when they are needed .The advisors make sure students keep on task and they always encourage students to be the best .  The teachers are the best. They don't only teach but they show you how to use what they teach in real life situations. Although the teachers may also be strict they try their best to make lectures, labs & etc fun. UVI is also filled with opportunities. UVI has work studies & they have so much programs that can help students be the best at what they want to be. My only complaint is that they don't have much activities for students."
Freshman,4,"The University of the Virgin Islands recently experienced a lot of damage due to two category five hurricanes (Irma and Maria). However, despite the UVI has gone the extra mile to help their students get back on track.  They hosted many relief drives, offered counseling, and even financial aid to students who experienced damage to their home and personal belonging."
Freshman,4,"I am currently taking two class at UVI's, St. Croix  campus. The professors are very helpfully and will help you anyway they can if you don't understand something in class. the campus is beautiful, but can be a little confusing at first. Over all my experience here has been a positive one and has changed my perception on college for the better."
Sophomore,4,"This school is amazing and affordable. Academically, the curriculum is engaging yet challenging. The professors are willing to go beyond to help students in need. One thing that could be better are the work study opportunities."
Freshman,4,My experience here at the University of the Virgin Islands have been great. The school is outstanding. The people are welcoming. 
Recent Alumnus,4,"My overall experience was spontaneous. Reviewing my analysis really deciphered how well my future can relate to my current situation. I've encountered numerous challenges, however. still I push through. Thus far, progression and future relations have consciously tweaking my awareness."
College Junior,4,Any party scene in the Carribbean is awesome. There are even free shuttles for the college students to go out and party and bring them home safely.
College Freshman,4,The university is very diverse in one's individuality.
College Freshman,4,"It is wonderful to live on campus the study areas are in walking proximity. People respect your quiet time. The cafe is open late at night after you finish studying, exercising , working , doing homework to catch a late night snack."
College Freshman,4,We go all out for our athletic teams on our campus because with out them they would be not that much team spirit.
College Freshman,4,We are all a loving community Greeks are acceptable because we do not discriminate one another.
College Freshman,4,I feel comfortable on campus. I can exercise at night without being worried about crimes. I can come outside and sleep on my blanket and watch the stars without being afraid.
College Freshman,4,The career center at the University of  the Virgin Islands is very helpful. They are available on weekends. They have students helping mentoring other students in the subject matters that they may struggle with. They also give you a short survey at the end pertaining to any concerns  / what you liked.
College Sophomore,4,The athletic facilities are great places to work out in.
College Freshman,4,Campus is a small community so even if you don't know someone well you know them well enough to look out for them and vice versa.
College Freshman,4,I feel really safe on campus. Everyone gets along mostly.
College Junior,4,There should be more course options. The registration process is pretty simple. The students are not given more than they can handle. Just ask around and you will find out who are the best professors.
College Junior,4,The professors encourage open discussion. They want the students to have an open mind about whatever topic is brought up. I wish more majors were available.
College Junior,4,Everyone tries to look after one another. The campus is basically safe. I'm not sure how helpful security is because I don't really see them doing much.
College Freshman,4,"I love how everything is fast paced making me want to keep up and stay on my own two feet. It just took a bit of time to adjust to the new setting of my classes as well as breaking that ice between my peers. If I could do it all over, I would choose to be in another school. Even though I love the weather, the environment, and the classes, I want to experience being independent, away from home because St. Croix USVI has been my home since 2007. Now, I want to change my scenery."
College Junior,4,My professors are very understanding and helpful.
College Junior,4,The rules are being enforced in full effect.
College Sophomore,4,"There are weekly parties off campus, on campus party happens once every month or so. However, the on campus parties receives a lot of support from the students"
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is very safe, security is very strict on campus and they do patrols around campus."
College Sophomore,4,"The policies are strictly enforced, anyone caught breaking any rules will be penalized."
College Sophomore,4,"The local atmosphere is okay, there are many friendly people."
College Freshman,4,"I feel safe on campus,but when students allow friends into the dorms without a further check worries me at times."
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy UVI because i am not into parties and nightlife. professors are very concerned towards students performance nad ensure that students excel. Classrooms are pretty small and quite easy to  discuss concerns with teachers.
College Sophomore,4,it just needs more internships.
College Sophomore,4,it just needs more internships.
College Sophomore,4,its small so every body feels welcomed.
College Sophomore,4,Everything is in need of improvements but still benefits.
College Sophomore,4,"Everybody has a choice, there is no pressure."
College Sophomore,4,"The food choices are great, there is a lot of options to choose from. The dining halls are okay, money spending is affordable."
College Freshman,4,you might need your own printer but all else is well
College Freshman,4,its accessible to everything.....and its convienent
College Freshman,4,"The school has a no drug and alcohol policy, so it is not noticeable on campus."
College Student,4,The labs are very accessible. They are great.
College Student,4,The school is more minority. The school is accepting.
College Student,4,The social life is very lively between students.

College Freshman,4,People from different parts of the World and Caribbean attend
College Freshman,4,helpful with anything that comes my way
College Freshman,4,given an easy list that can be easy to follow
College Junior,4,Campus security often make rounds. There is shuttle service to take you to and from classes and a nurse on campus 24/7. There is also a doctor and a gynecologist who visit every week.
College Junior,4,This school is really diverse. There are students from different parts of the world and the great thing is they all get along.
College Student,4,The only disadvantage is that they have a break around two o'clock which is disappointing for students who have class around that time.
College Student,4,The biggest factors depends on your RA and the other students you are living around.
Freshman,2,My experience with the university of the Virgin Islands was very poor they are very laid back even when you going up to the workers and asking them about stuff they don’t know anything or tell you anything. If you’re under a sport scholarship they don’t put it in and they take all of your finical aid when you repeatedly tell them you need it for books because your scholarship would cover it. The only good thing about the Virgin Islands Is it’s by a beach. But the most of the faculty is terrible.
Freshman,2,"We don't have potable water to drink or brush our teeth with.  They refuse to provide it for us. We must buy our own water to drink. Last semester a student was shot to death but the story never made it public because that would make the college look bad. While the deceased students vigil was being held, the college was holding an ice cream social. It is the worst school I have ever been to.
But it's cheap. So, there's that."
College Junior,2,There are no parties on campus at all.
College Junior,2,"The school is mostly west-indian. Its difficult to be a ""mainlander"" in this campus, and don't even consider being openly gay here. I have seen on multiple occasions gay men being called ""faggots"", a ""disgrace"" and ""not a man"" I have even seen many islanders openly bash gay men and call them disgusting. I was horrified to witness this, especially since being a lesbian, or a gay female is totally tolerated and even encouraged. Only gay men are discriminated against and not gay women."
College Junior,2,"There are very few activities, groups and friend circles. Everyone attending from the main land will feel as though it is difficult to make friends or feel socially accepted. Islanders in general have a lack of openness twoards non-islanders. I attended this university for 2 years and couldn't take it anymore. The website looks promising but do not let the view or beach make your decision. Know that this campus' faculty is so unhelpful, rude, and generally inconsiderate of the students needs. The facilities date back to the 80's with little improvement since, including the laundry room which is typically broken or unusable.In my experiences over the 2 years I attended, I had to force or demand services that other universities would willingly give or be helpful with. I strongly recommend spending a semester visiting as an exchange student before enrolling. (by the way i didn't get my acceptance letter until 2 months after the school year had started, that should have been a clear warning to stay away) You will not feel like you are getting the education you are paying for. Generally as far as athletics, basketball is the only sport recognized or supported, my boyfriend ran track and was denied the scholarship promised to him at the end of the semester."
College Junior,2,"Since located in the Caribbean, there is a severe need for air conditioning, which is priced at an extensive premium. The air conditioned rooms are priced over $500 more than the other rooms available on campus, which are stuck in the relentless heat. Only a ceiling fan is offered to the rooms with no air conditioning. there is a strict separation between the haves and the have-nots. Not to mention the constant ant and roaches."
College Freshman,2,There is a need for more housing and the process is a hassle.
College Freshman,2,In order to be linked up with alumni and internship opportunities it's up to the students because school doesn't put to much effort into helping students with that. Thankfully networking is a lot easier on the island.
College Junior,2,"Not many students take part in the Greek life. When a non-Greek sees a Greek, it's like they didn't even know the campus had a Greek life. Can't say much about the Greek life because I hardly notice them."
College Sophomore,2,"On-campus, parties are few to none existent"
College Sophomore,2,My Mother received cut backs on her check. yet the refuse to give me aid for the 2015 year
College Sophomore,2,There are certain places in housing that do not house University Students.
College Freshman,2,I didn't like the process
College Freshman,2,Not really any places to eat off campus.
College Freshman,2,"There is absolutely no off campus housing opportunities for students. They either live with their parents or family members ,or with their boyfriend or girlfriend."
College Sophomore,2,There is not too much emphasis on sporting activities except basketball.
College Sophomore,2,it is kind of dry.
College Sophomore,2,we don't enough programs and that should improve.
College Freshman,2,"The nightlife at my school is very quiet, there are not much parties. As a result of the lack of transportation many people are unable to leave campus to go to clubs."
College Student,2,A few kids smoke weed.
College Junior,1,"Very, very, very poor academic standards. I have had so many incompetent teachers who admit to being under-qualified for their position. Although you do get some teachers who are excellent, most unfortunately are not."
College Junior,1,"I strongly recommend students who are considering attending this university NOT TO. the staff is so rude and inconsiderate, the facilities are below standard and the class work is easier than most high schools. I even attended a class in which my professor had never taught and admitted on being under-qualified to teach. You will NOT get your moneys worth going to this school as the entire staff is lazy and uneducated for being a part of an American University."
College Junior,1,Very exclusive given the small amount of students.
College Junior,1,"The staff is so unfriendly and unreliable. Don't count on the EVER answering their phones, even during business hours or tending to any matter that needs any attention."
College Freshman,1,"UVI barely has any sororities and even less fraternities, and the ones that we do have no one knows about."
College Freshman,1,"Parties are very boring,and not very exciting at all."
College Student,1,There is no off campus housing at my school.
College Freshman,1,For my financial aid i did not receive nearly enough money that i needed.
College Sophomore,1,"Everyone complains about the food, their is not a wide variety and most times it is the same kind of food every day. Most student take the food and throw it in the garbage or go to the grill section which is not healthy"
College Senior,1,the university of the stx campus have poor school spirit and does not have varsity teams.
College Freshman,1,"The only athletics their is in the University of the Virgin Islands is the archery class, and Karate"
College Junior,1,There are no greek Housing available. Greek life is almost nonexistent at the University of the Virgin Islands. There are some Greeks scattered here and there but it is not a big deal. There are no discriminations between Greeks and Non-Greeks. Most of the Greeks are Much Older than the rest of the student population.
College Junior,1,"Lets start off with the dorms. The living experience the past 4 months has been awful, and there has been numerous conflicts of domestic violence in the dorms. The dorms are not safe at all; anyone can get into them at any time. it is very easy. I have been woken up at night by horrific screams and one time gunshots. The food: the food is terrible. I have actually seen a bug craw out of another students food. The cafeteria is left open 24/7, so no telling what can craw in there. The food is under cooked all the timeand all we have is chicken and rice. A food inspector should shut this place down it is very unsanitary. Work environment: they have actually been in trouble once for not their faculty not showing up on time. No one seems to care enough to take control of any situation. They are very far behind on finacial aid and orginization. There are no clubs or activities to do on campus. Dont think about calling the police most of the time they dont even show up unless it is a extremely drastic situation. The professors are mainly her for research and teaching is a secondary job to them they are lzy and unprofessional. DO NOT GO THERE!"
College Senior,1,There are no freshman etc dorms here. You get in where you fit in which is based on what you can afford.  Living on campus is really convenient but you tend to have a few problems such as leaking rooms or not enough ventilation.    There is the new dorms on the west though that are in very good condition.
College Junior,1,"Security at UVI is very laid back.  The most action they get is unlocking doors.  They are big, fat and lazy.  You can do whatever you want to do on campus."
College Freshman,1,"Slack on the Leash – my school's strictness isn't really all that bad i think its lacking because a lot of people are able to get away with things that you shouldn't be doing on campus, like smoking weed, having visitors after 12, drinking and coming back on campus drunk. I think the strictness needs to increase because people will just abuse there privileges and then others who are doing the right thing will suffer."
College Senior,1,This is not available at the University of the Virgin Islands.
College Senior,1,"Since attending the University of the Virgin Islands, I am aware of only two businesses that offer student discounts to registered students.  When asked, 98% of the businesses I was informed that such discounts are not available.  However, I must emphasize that discounts are granted to attend clubs and not purchase the basic necessities of students needs."
College Freshman,1,Non Existent – There are very few affordable apartments for college students.
College Freshman,1,Very Small – I come from a big city and its not enough to do on the island.

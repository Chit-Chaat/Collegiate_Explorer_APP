Sophomore,5,Princeton has poured a lot of time and effort into making online learning during COVID-19 as immersive as possible. So far my online learning has been just as effective as my in class learning.
Sophomore,5,Great academics and amazing financial aid. I have only ever had good experiences working with faculty and other students.
Freshman,5,"The courses, faculty, resources, and community here are all wonderful. There is truly a culture throughout the university of caring about the students and doing everything possible to help them succeed. The academics are, of course, extremely challenging, but there are plenty of ways to get help and the academic faculty are always very receptive to students needing assistance. Most everyone has the drive to succeed without creating an overly competitive or cutthroat environment. Culture outside of academics - arts, music, clubs, sports - is vibrant as well."
Alum,5,"Amazing undergraduate experience. It was difficult, but I made some of the best friends of my life. Financial aid is superb. Great diversity of ideas, races, and nationalities."
Niche User,5,They are a great school. Amazing  school. I visited and I thought the campus was great. I really am hoping I can attend in the fall.
Freshman,5,I'm only half way through my first semester and I can already tell that Princeton was the right choice for me.
Niche User,5,"I love Princeton University because, the people and professors are amazingly nice. Also the people are sometimes just too nice."
Sophomore,5,"Academic resources are outstanding, and the amount of help offered students to enhance both personal and academic life is nearly overwhelming.
Classes are challenging yet include stimulating discussion and ample opportunity to make lasting connections with peers, mentors, and professors across campus. 
Student life is diverse and varied, allowing for nearly any club or activity to thrive if students are interested in participating."
Niche User,5,"I greatly enjoy the overall ambience of Princeton University. The University truly offers a high quality education, especially as a result of its wonderful professors, some of which are Nobel Laureates. Moreover, the University's network allows for extensive connection between current and graduated students. This leads to great opportunities that would not necessarily be available elsewhere. Lastly, I really believe the Bridge Year program instills a humble nature in students through introducing the opportunity to volunteer for a year abroad. Doing so allows students to mature and experience other cultures prior to embarking on a difficult, yet rewarding task of attending Princeton University."
Sophomore,5,"I have had such a great experience with Princeton. The professors and courses were excellent, but mostly I've been so happy to find great people all over the campus, and a community I genuinely click with."
Sophomore,5,"Having just completed my first year as an undergrad, I can truly say that attending this university is the best choice I’ve ever made. Not only are the professors incredible and the resources abundant, but I’ve made an incredible network of close friends. And, as a low-income student, I have never wanted for anything due to Princeton’s generous financial aid."
Sophomore,5,"It's definitely not all perfect, and is a lot of hard work to be a student here. However, Princeton has many amazing resources and I have been able to do a lot that I would not be able to elsewhere."
Niche User,5,Princeton is a great college.  The student body is very diverse and there are many different clubs and activities.  The campus is also very beautiful.
Freshman,5,"The school has plenty of resources. Don't get overwhelmed by that fact. If you are blessed to go in already having an idea of what you want to do, you should be set. As for going in with no idea and trying to figure it out, you might become overwhelmed. That's normal. Good luck."
Freshman,5,I fell in love with Princeton on my first college visit. I am an athlete and loved the academic and athletic excellence associated with Princeton.   I was accepted as part of the class of 2023 and am very excited to call Princeton home.
Alum,5,"Princeton is my favorite place on Earth. It's not perfect, it has room to grow to make it a better place for all students, but I believe it is working toward those gaols."
Freshman,5,"Princeton is a great school. Quite challenging but definitely worth the investment. The party scene can be quite boring at times but you should be doing your work anyways. The professors know you by name and aren't looking to kill you with work. Also, their is a real undergraduate focus at the university."
Freshman,5,Princeton provides a great deal of support for it's students.  Class offerings are excellent and amazing faculty teach those courses.  Princeton's focus on undergraduate students makes it a special place to study.
Niche User,5,I love the diversity and the blend of liberal arts with STEM. That is why I am attending the university in the fall of 2019.
Niche User,5,"I liked the community setting, and the overall city of Princeton. It has a nice, cozy feel to it, and I'm sure that anyone who goes there will come out great"
Alum,5,"Princeton instilled in me an incredible work ethic that I don't think I could have developed anywhere else. While the coursework was always challenging and there were times I was completely exhausted, I wouldn't change it!"
Niche User,5,"The campus is very beautiful, it's a very studious university, so you won't be seeing a lot of partying like you would with other school, public or private."
Junior,5,"I love the academic strength and rigor. My only problem is the party scene as I feel all groups (athletes, narps, ...) just stay together and don't really mix due to the eating club structure (as opposed to having bar-life near a college)."
Niche User,5,Prestigious  Prestigious Prestigious Prestigious Prestigious Prestigious Prestigious Prestigious Prestigious Prestigious
Sophomore,5,"Classes at Princeton are superb in all regards. Faculty to student ratios are very low, so students can receive a significant amount of attention from world-class professors and extremely helpful teacher assistants. The amount of resources dedicated to each student is unmatched. The alumni system is very structured, ensuring a connected student body with those in industry or academia. The campus is beautiful, showing off a gothic architecture juxtaposed with modern designs. The local area is a safe, cozy college town. The university is within an hour of New York and Philadelphia by train, but there are countless activities, clubs, and organizations to stay busy on campus. The food is relatively good and healthy. Some of the dorm conditions could be improved, but regardless the university does provide adequate housing and space for all students."
Senior,5,Princeton University is an amazing college for students. they are ranked the number one best college in the united states. their education is high quality and very renowned.
Niche User,5,Wonderful campus! The faculty and students make you feel so welcome once you enter nearly every building! Great comradery.
Freshman,5,"As an entering student, I visited Princeton University in the middle of April. The campus is coated in blossoming trees, while the buildings are old yet renovated inside. The air is cool and moist, but not humid like southeast Texas.

Another thing I enjoy is the commitment to sustainability, especially in projects abroad and the dining hall food. The Princeton Environmental institute does classes with local farmers using a variety of methods and chefs from many culinary backgrounds.

What I like most about Princeton is the community. My host and his friends had endless intellectual and personal discussions and readily invited me into their part of Princeton."
Niche User,5,"The students at Princeton University are so bright and are willing to share what they know with the community. The area surrounding Princeton is beautiful, and has a lot of food options. The sports aren't great, but they're still fun to go to."
Niche User,5,Great university. Provides many research opportunities. Professors are very open and willing to meet with students after class. Would highly recommend.
Niche User,5,I have attended their campus tour and information session since I am a future applicant. I have no complaints and this is my dream school.
Niche User,5,"It is an amazing school. Visiting the campus at Princeton, and learning about its various course options is a true joy."
Freshman,5,Princeton University is a stellar institution with a strong focus on undergraduate teaching. World class faculty are approachable and invested in the success of their undergraduate students.
Sophomore,5,"At Princeton University are world-class professors and facilities. Not only would you earn an excellent education and have access to a myriad of on-campus resources, you will also be surrounded by an environment rich in history, diversity, and community."
Alum,5,"Students are consistently motivated by high standards, enthusiasm, and responsibility from staff, faculty, and fellow students. The school provides very diverse and engaging learning and experiential opportunities that are unique to the university."
Alum,5,"Great focus on undergraduates. I loved my time at Princeton, learned a lot, and now I'm in medical school."
Senior,5,"Going into Princeton, you know it's going to be hard.  No matter where you went to high school, no matter how hard you worked, no matter how smart you are, you're going to be working really hard, and there aren't really any ""paths of least resistance.""

That being said, Princeton is an incredible place, and probably the best undergraduate education in the country.  There is no where else where you have even nearly as much access to nobel laureates, successful businesspeople, famous lecturers or general funding as you do at Princeton.

As far as the student body, they work hard and play hard.  Everyone has a lot of work, but the students really do like to have a good time, be that through engagement in extracurricular activities or a party at one of the eating clubs.

I would do it all over again, and easily would make the same decision."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Even when it is hard, you are with such an incredible group of people that the entire experience is amazing. There is room for whatever you commit to making time for - athletics, socialization, volunteering, etc."
College Freshman,5,I have never felt unsafe on campus and I have never heard of anyone else feeling unsafe.
College Freshman,5,A Princeton degree is worth a lot. It helps greatly with internships and just about anything else career related.
College Freshman,5,It's Princeton for a reason. Professors are amazing and geniuses. They are also typically very helpful and care immensely about the undergrads.
College Freshman,5,It is the most challenging yet most rewarding experience I have ever had. I am growing so much as a person and learning so much about myself and the world around me.
College Senior,5,"As a graduating senior, I can definitively say that my four years at Princeton have been the best four years of my life. No-loan financial aid, a wealth of quality opportunities, and the best student and faculty body I could have ever wanted combine here to make a school which has rightly been rated #1 the whole time I've been in attendance. Princeton has some of the tightest-knit and most generous alums in the world, and it's easy to see why. If you get accepted, you'd be a fool not to come."
College Freshman,5,"Princeton is a place of incredible opportunity.  Where else could first year students learn from a Nobel laureate in a class of 25 students?  Over the past months, the integrated science curriculum at Princeton has introduced me to new subjects and ways of thinking about problems that are totally different from anything I have experienced before.  I was also impressed with how approachable faculty are and how easy it is to form relationships."
College Sophomore,5,"It's been a dream come true! Of course I'm challenged daily socially, physically and of course, academically! That's just all a part of the fun!"
College Freshman,5,"Literally the best university in the world, no doubt."
College Freshman,5,"One of the things that I think every Princeton student can agree on is how pretty the campus is. The campus sprawls but it's neither too big nor too small. Since I've come to campus, there are plenty of new places I've discovered. It's a rather old campus so while it maintains the old style for which it owes its famous (IMO) it also addresses that yeah, we live in the 21st century, silly."
College Freshman,5,I'm sure it's pretty cool. The alumni seem like a great resource.
College Freshman,5,"The professors are definitely experts in their field. The professors I have had so far are enthusiastic about what they teach and give honest feedback. Grading at Princeton is notoriously ""strict"" when compared to other Ivies but that's just what comes with attending this school. It can be pretty stressful at times but student organizations seem to be making an effort to make it more manageable. There are several classes one can take and although Princeton doesn't offer majors in things like Theater or African American Studies, one can get certificates in these fields. Many people study in Firestone or the work spaces of their individual res colleges."
College Freshman,5,The school is pretty safe thanks to the environment of the town.
College Freshman,5,The school offers the best undergraduate education.
College Freshman,5,The party scene at the eating clubs is great compared to other Ivy League schools.
College Freshman,5,Princeton invests heavily in their housing. Laundry is free. Students are divided up into six residential colleges which greatly enhances the community feel.
College Freshman,5,"It's very lenient where it should be: drinking, dorms, and social events. But it's also strict where it needs to be: the Honor Code. And most students understand and respect where the Honor Code comes from."
College Freshman,5,We have some of the best professors and top individuals in their field teaching our courses. The introductory computer science class is also one of the best classes. Workload for engineers and STEM students is significantly more than other majors. We stay up very late most nights working.
College Junior,5,I live in Forbes residential college and it is like a home away from school. The cost of dorms are going up year to year but it is still at an okay price. The housing process depends on draw-times which are randomly assigned and upper-class men get priority. If you get good draw time you get good rooms. The social atmosphere is amazing. There is always something to do on campus!
College Junior,5,There are so many opportunities to take advantage of especially if you are pre-med. The downside is that pre-meds at my school are very competitive and would kill for an A so if you are in a class with lots of pre-med beware that the curve might not work in your favor!
College Junior,5,"We have a variety of amazing food every breakfast, lunch, and dinner!"
College Sophomore,5,"Princeton is the most gorgeous campus around. It has started to combine its gothic architecture with more modern buildings, and the blend is quite refreshing. Frist, the campus center, offers a variety of food options, study spaces, and relaxation areas. Dillon gym has plenty of machines and treadmills."
College Sophomore,5,"Late meal is the greatest thing ever. The dining halls cycle through meals every three weeks, so it can get a little repetitive, but late meal food is always great. Plus, if you make friends in eating clubs, you can throw in more variety. Murray Dodge cookies are also incredible!"
Sophomore,4,"You can pursue anything at this school and come out feeling accomplished at the end of 4 years. Countless ways to get funding for your projects and interests at-home or internationally, and many research/internships opportunities are present at the school. Eating clubs are overrated, niche, and exclusionary."
Junior,4,Your professors handle it very well and adapt to the new conditions. You miss your friends and the social opportunities with them.
Junior,4,"I had the  unique experience at Princeton of getting in for engineering and walking on to a varsity sports team. Needless to say my days are generally longer and harder. However, you are very well taken care of. The rooms are nice, the food is good, and as you progress the professors get better and better. School carries a heavy load, but it is manageable. Don't ever pass on an opportunity to spend times with friends: this will be the main thing that keeps to going."
Freshman,4,"The transition to online was undoubtedly difficult, but for the most part, my Princeton professors were reasonable and accommodating. They seemed to have our best interests at heart and always worked hard to preserve as much of the Princeton experience as possible. I was fortunate enough to be able to do well in my online classes during the second half of spring 2020."
Niche User,4,"It is one the leading university in the world allowing for internship and  employament on completing the study program , more opportunities to connect,network with the community where we work and live both economically and social through assistance such as grants and financial aid such as scholarship to finance your tuition and stay while at the university,the student support for the minority is good for the international student who come to study in a different cultural environment from their home country making them settle in and concentrate on their studies.The academics is very competitive,the diversity support is very good,the athlethics is very competitive,the professors highly ranked ,the dorm facilities are very good,the safety is fine,return on investment is good,the campus is fine,the party scene is good,the local area is nice,the campus food is good,student life is very satisfactory."
Sophomore,4,Princeton is very diverse. There are a lot of different perspectives as well. I like the amount of activities one can be involved with. The professors are very open to meeting with students for help with assignments. The campus life is great. There's always something going on that you can get involved with. The food is good too. I think Princeton would benefit from more academic support and better advisors.
Senior,4,Challenging curriculum. Highly motivated student body. Professors are very helpful in junior and senior years but freshmen year could be isolating. Overall a wonderful experience. I will miss Princeton
Junior,4,Princeton devotes a lot of time into its undergraduate students so the students come out with a lot and have access to a lot of resources. Academically it is challenging but you learn valuable life lessons throughout the experience and the friendships you make at the school is invaluable
Junior,4,"Princeton is a very challenging school and will definitely push you both academically and mentally. I've learned a lot since coming to this school, and I am glad I chose it. However, the stress of classes and the pressure to always be doing something (during the term and the summer) is sometimes overwhelming.  But I believe the amazing opportunities (study abroad, internships, career help, funding, etc.) outweigh these grievances."
Niche User,4,The campus is beautiful and everyone I've run into is super nice and helpful. The town surrounding the campus is awesome and there is always something to do!
Niche User,4,I am currently on Princeton's Bridge Year Program and am loving the experience. Princeton seems to understand the importance of experiential education and I am learning a lot from my NGO work and the general culture and atmosphere in Jogja.
Freshman,4,"Princeton is a University that will continuously invest in you as long as you invest in yourself. It doesn’t matter your past or your situation, Princeton will be there for you through it all. With that being said, sometimes it’s difficult to find your niche within the university, it’s there but sometimes it can be a bit hidden."
Sophomore,4,"I like the small school vibe which makes Princeton feel more tight-knit than larger universities. The residential college system also helps to promote a sense of unity among students on campus. I also think there is enough entertainment on and off campus with eating clubs on campus and NYC and Philadelphia within a train ride away from campus. However, academics can be intense and stress culture is definitely palpable, especially during midterms and finals period."
Freshman,4,"its pretty good, very nice town and cute shops! the dining hall food could be a lot better though. add more veggies!"
Niche User,4,"Princeton University is one of the top schools in America. Not only does it provide students with a great academic life, but it also provides chances for everyone to meet new people and create a community."
Sophomore,4,"Great scholarly environment. However, the fast pace makes it much more academically challenging than it needs to be."
Sophomore,4,"The campus culture here is amazing. It's rigorous academically, but the vast majority of people are supportive of each other. There is a problem with diversity - or a lack thereof - but the university and (mostly) students make support networks."
Freshman,4,"In my experience, which has only been one semester, Princeton is a wonderful place. It has comfortable dorms, beautiful study spaces, delicious food and amazing professors. I am pursuing a BA degree rather than a BSE, and I was able to take a wide range of classes that I enjoyed. There are endless oppportunities for extra cirriculars. It is however, a stressful environment depending on how many things you decide to take on, in addition to the pressure of going to such a prestigious institution with students that have the same goals of achievement."
Sophomore,4,"I found that Princeton University has a very difficult and challenging curriculum - there is no such thing as an easy major or an easy class. However, it really sets you up for the mentality that there will always be something new to learn and ways to improve yourself."
Alum,4,"The environment was such that I felt that almost any subject that I wanted to learn or investigate, I could."
Recent Alumnus,4,My experience at Princeton was wonderful. Everyone at Princeton is so humble but extremely smart and talented. It is a brilliant environment to learn in.
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are campus safety cars EVERYWHERE, and they are not there to get people in trouble, just to keep everyone safe."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I was an athlete, and I thought the overall experience was great. Sometimes there is less fan support during midterms, etc., but overall the student body is small and tight-knit, and there will almost always be friends in the stands."
College Freshman,4,"It's like living in a castle. It's pretty awesome. That being said, your experience varies depending on your res college. The newer the room, the better."
College Freshman,4,"I am a Varsity athlete and there is not a ton of support for athletics, but it is certainly a great experience."
College Sophomore,4,"If we were a bigger football school with a better team, I think athletics would be more of a thing on campus among students but otherwise most other sports get a fair amount of recognition."
College Sophomore,4,"It is very hard and challenging but if you capitalize all of the resources available to you and learn to ask for help, you will have a much better experience. The challenges become smaller."
College Freshman,4,"For big games, a good amount of the student body comes out and supports the team."
College Freshman,4,The vibrant social life helps counterbalance the workload each week.
College Sophomore,4,"Like with any school, Princeton has its pros and cons. One of the best things the school has provided me with and one of the major reason's I chose it is because of its financial aid package, and the financial support it gives students in whatever endeavor you wish to pursue. Princeton has renowned professors, classes are rigorous but rewarding, the campus is beautiful and the food is excellent. On the other hand, one of the things that has frustrated me is that selectivity seems to be the rule of the game on campus beyond academics - whether its for extracurriculars which often have application processes, or socially with eating clubs. However, it is the best school in the country for a reason."
College Freshman,4,"I would choose this school for many reasons, one of which being I don't think I could go to a better school for less money. Princeton is a great school but what really helped me choose this school over others was their great financial aid package. I also enjoy how Princeton feels like the best of both worlds in a way. If you like a suburban sprawling campus with a heavy focus on undergraduates (seriously, sorry potential grad students) then Princeton is definitely unique, especially when it comes to other Ivies and equally competitive universities. I like that I don't feel overshadowed by a renowned graduate school. I like that I can see new people every day but I can also recognize faces in Frist. There are things that Princeton should work on: like economic diversity (or at the least, addressing it), spiffing up cultural understanding amongst the student body and frankly changing the entire finals schedule but overall, Princeton is a pretty cool place."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, Princeton is a really great institution that is also great for the price. Like any school, it has its shortcomings, but those are often outweighed if one thinks about the great things the school has going for it."
College Freshman,4,"I was surprised by how diverse Princeton is, especially for an Ivy League. There are so many people here from so many different countries. In most of my seminars, there was a fair representation of students of color. That being said, there are still cases of intolerance that have become apparent after such incidents as Ferguson. Politically, Princeton seems to be a bit split. There's only a small portion of people that seem particularly interested in politics but those that are can find their niche in either major political ideology. Religion isn't a major major part of campus but if you're religious, there are ways to get involved. There are students who make that a big part of their campus experience. Sexual orientation is also something that seems pretty acceptable here. In terms of economic background, I think that's the most taboo thing of all. While there are several students who come from lower-income families, Princeton as a whole doesn't really address differences in lifestyles. There are several (more) students of privilege here and if you're not one of those students, it could be easy to feel left out in some ways."
College Freshman,4,It's pretty great. World class. The workload can be pretty stressful.
College Freshman,4,"Princeton seems like a nice town. I would definitely not live here. The town seems defined by the campus which is fine if you like that kind of thing. Personally I don't hang outside of the Princeton Bubble much but I'm sure if you were really into that you could find yourself having a grand old time. Princeton isn't necessarily isolated. There's a train that can take you to New York City in about an hour. Newark and Trenton are pretty nearby. Philly is about an hour south. So it could definitely be worse. However, if you're on the campus for too long you may begin to lose touch with reality, with what's going on outside Princeton."
College Freshman,4,"What's really great about the food at Princeton is the fact that there are so many options. There are four dining halls to choose from and if you don't like the meal in your res college, you can just go to another. None of them serve exactly the same thing. In my opinion, they all have their own styles. The biggest ones -Rocky/Mathey & Wilcox/Wu- are arguably the best because...well, they're bigger and offer more options.  That's not to say that all the food is great -it's not. There are definitely bad days. The meal plans are pretty nice but aren't really very useable for food off campus. Late Meal at Princeton is great for underclassmen who have an unlimited meal plan (and it's arguably better than the food in the residential colleges) and many students utilize it. If you don't have an unlimited meal plan, it's a bit more difficult but there are still plenty of food options available."
College Freshman,4,"Financial aid is great at Princeton. I received more money here than I did at any other school to which I was accepted. Princeton has money to burn (or so I hear) and if you ask the financial aid office for more money they're likely to at least consider your case. I came in with a couple of outside scholarships that definitely helped and I recommend seeking that out rather than completely relying on the Princeton for financial aid (especially if you're stuck in the middle class rut). If your family makes a little less than a certain number (I don't know what exactly), Princeton pays nearly everything."
College Freshman,4,"I got really lucky with my housing this year. As a freshman I was placed randomly in a college resident. I got Whitman which is arguably the best residential college in several ways: it's the newest, many residents have singles and it it's in a nice location. I was lucky enough to have a single. That being said, I've been inside every residential college and all of them have their perks. I won't say that all of them great there are a few halls that leave much to be desired. A couple of the residential colleges, Rocky and Mathey, are pretty old and therefore don't have air conditioning. Compared to some of the dorms of other colleges I've seen, Princeton's are definitely above average."
College Freshman,4,"Although Greek life does not exist, eating clubs do not make you look for more."
College Freshman,4,"I placed out of a lot of my pre-req classes with AP credit and placement tests. You have to choose your major in sophomore year spring semester, and as a freshman I still feel in the dark about what I am supposed to be doing exactly. and what the timeline for these things are. Especially for certificate programs."
College Freshman,4,"The administration is mostly on your side and mainly enforces the educational aspect of things more than the social/drinking/sex/drug part. However, if you are caught with drugs you can get disciplinary action. The honor code here is unique in that none of our tests are proctored; we just sign a statement saying we upheld the honor code. But if you are found to have cheated you will get suspended, most likely."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are amazing and spacious. Although you don't spend a lot of time in them, there are other facilities within the building that make you want to spend your time there. There are so many social events and spaces within the dorm buildings to make that possible."
College Freshman,4,The Town of Princeton is known for its restaurants. The scene for dining is so nice and so many little shops around with home-made icecream etc. People come here from other towns to try out the icecream and dining options here.
College Freshman,4,The school is actively reviewing and attempting to improve its sexual assault policies. Crime is almost non-existent. The campus is isolated and safe.
College Junior,4,I have not had an internship yet through the school mainly because I did not take advantage of the opportunities around me and did not go to career service for help. I do plan to have one this summer and do not have any concerns finding one.
College Junior,4,I love the Princeton township. It is safe and has so many attractions!
College Junior,4,"I'm not much involved in the sports' life on campus but from what I've seen, there is great school spirit and put team is getting better!"
College Sophomore,4,Our athletic facilities are great.
College Sophomore,4,We have a very supportive financial aid program.
College Sophomore,4,The housing is great compared to other schools that I've seen.
College Sophomore,4,The biggest difficulty was feeling like I was behind with my preparation.
College Sophomore,4,"Coming from a predominantly white, straight, Christian, middle-class, Republican, omnivorous area, I thought it was so interesting to suddenly be surrounded by all sorts of ethnicities, sexual identities, religions, economic backgrounds, and mostly Democrats. It has been an amazing learning experience for me. However, I have heard from a few people who identify as queer that the campus is not entirely receptive to people trying to come out."
College Sophomore,4,"The Honor Code is taken super seriously here, but then some things are very easy to get away with. Unless you are in substance-free housing, it is typically okay to have alcohol in your dorm. As far as underage drinking goes, you only have to be 18 to get into the Eating Clubs, and from there they don't ID anyone for beer. Even if someone underage gets drunk and has to go to McCosh (the clinic on campus), they don't punish them for being underage. They want people to feel comfortable getting professional help when drunk rather than being afraid of the consequences of being underaged and risking major health issues."
College Sophomore,4,"Our varsity football/basketball teams aren't very important to the Princeton experience, unlike some other colleges. I know more people on Sprint Football and other club/intramural teams than I do varsity athletes, except for crew. Everyone does crew."
College Sophomore,4,"There are lots of restaurants I like, and there is a lot of variety, but most of it is slightly too pricey for a college kid."
College Sophomore,4,"I love Nassau Street. It is quaint and charming, but in reality it is pretty upscale.  As far as nightlife goes, there isn't much beyond the Street with all of the Eating Clubs."
College Sophomore,4,Have a low income? They will pay for everything!
College Junior,4,"The town can get pricey, but it's a pretty area - lots of shops and nice places to walk."
College Junior,4,"There are lots of parties on Thursday and Saturday nights, mainly at the Eating Clubs."
College Junior,4,"There is a lot of diversity on campus, and I've enjoyed getting to know people from very different backgrounds from me and with very different interests from mine."
College Freshman,2,Greek life is not really recognized by the university and not really a part of student life.
College Sophomore,2,I don't know anyone who lives off-campus because it's expensive and not widely available.
Recent Alumnus,2,Princeton needs more true diversity.
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you like non-bland food, late meal will be your only salvation. Dining hall food sucks. Eating club food is sometimes good but sometimes sucks too."
College Sophomore,2,"Speaking specifically about alcohol: once the weekend comes, it's almost everywhere. Whether in its physical form or if a student is talking about it. Pregaming is almost the rule. Fortunately, most of it is in a designated location (Prospect) with the exception of students who stash in their room. If you get caught with alcohol, you will probably be given a warning."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is pretty non-existant. Apparently there at 12 Frats, but only two are considered ""cool."" Most people see Frats/sororities as a gateway to a certain more exclusive eating club."
College Freshman,2,"I happen to live in one residential ""college"" that I was randomly placed in. I am a mile from my nearest class and as a second year student share a 180 sq. ft. double with a roommate. I pay the same rooming fee as someone who lives in central campus with a 300 sq. ft. single."
College Freshman,2,Everyone lives on campus; there are good facilities and locations for upperclassmen
College Freshman,2,"Your experience with computers will definitely depend on where you are. I live in Whitman College, and we have a library downstairs. However, during peak seasons, the library is always crowded, and you'll be lucky if the two media macs are available. I usually go to Butler, because there are less people. Their computers also work better. In the Whitman Library, computers sometimes freeze up while I'm trying to print."
College Freshman,2,There's a Lot of Drinking – The drinking at Princeton is comparable to that of state school students.
College Sophomore,2,"Limited Selection – There's very few choices for off campus housing, and they are more expensive compared to on- campus housing. Most students live on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"P-Safe Can Be Tough – Public safety, if they catch you, will be strict. While you are safe on the Street or walking around campus drunk, DO NOT ever drink outside. Drinking in your room is safe, provided you are never caught with a drink in your hand. As for parties in dorms, make sure that there are no drugs (if drugs are found, everyone at the party gets punished), but feel safe going to one. P-safe doesn't come too often, usually only in cases of extreme noise. Just don't get caught with a drink in your hand, and you are fine."
College Freshman,2,"Housing Horrors – The far flung outskirts of Princeton are home to a smattering of houses and their dreary denizens will tell you that it is both expensive and inconvenient. Dorm housing, though under the beady eye of the administration, is far more prudent."
Alum,1,"After reflecting on my four year of attending, and comparing it to my graduate institutions and study abroad, I feel that Princeton leaves much to be desired for engineering/COS students. Much of the coursework will not prepare you for graduate programs. 

Despite doing academically well, I felt that my quality of life suffered in comparison to equally credible institutions due to an incompetent administration. I do not think that the university is a safe place. If you have a choice with another top institution, go elsewhere. The ""name"" wasn't worth it as a student or as an alumni- assuming you have a choice of another top university."
College Senior,1,Overly liberal. Students are more liberal than profs
College Freshman,1,Social life revolves around the eating clubs at Princeton. Greek life has little to no effect.
College Freshman,1,Right now Greek life is pretty underground after the University made it against the rules for freshman to even be in a Greek house. The Greeks are not recognized by the University at this time.
College Sophomore,1,Freshmen and Sophomores aren't allocated any on-campus parking space. Juniors and Seniors must pay a fee to be allowed to park on campus.
College Student,1,"There is no parking on campus. At all.
The nearest parking lot is usually crowded, and several blocks away from the rest of campus.  If you need to get around in a hurry, bring your bike.
And underclassmen can't even  live off campus or have cars, so that kind of tells you what it's like."
College Student,1,98-99% of all undergraduates live on campus. Enough said.

Freshman,5,"Great campus! Very clean and open! Not many downsides. The only complaint would be something unchangeable like the weather. The weather on Guam is very hot.

College Sophomore,5,"Awesome Restaurant! J's Kitchen is a restaurant that is located right next to my school (University of Guam). I frequently go there to eat lunch because it is an ""all you can eat"" restaurant for only $10.00. To top it off, the waiters/waitresses are extremely nice and welcoming. They also give discounts."

Senior,4,"I have taken a few classes online, such as philosophy, music, world history, and half of my family nursing course (due to covid-19). The university campus offers free wifi, which helps. The classes have also either posted video lectures or in-print lectures to read. Although I prefer in-person classes, I was still able to learn in the course because the professors would link additional educational content, such as videos and simulations."
Senior,4,"I like the small size of the university, which fosters close relationships between classmates and faculty. There is a direct focus on each individual student. However, the small size of the university also has its disadvantages, such as a limited opportunity for growth. Due to a limited amount of faculty, some classes may be hard to get into. This has happened to me in which my course plan had been delayed for a year due to lack of available slots in a particular class."
Freshman,4,"The University of Guam is great for students who prefer a smaller campus. they have many majors and programs available for students. Some professors are very passionate about their teachings and subject. However, the campus is usually filled with local students who live off-campus. There are dorms available near the campus, but it is rarely occupied."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is very clean and the staff are extremely friendly. There are some days where the restrooms smell awful, but other than that I have no complaints with the school."
Sophomore,4,"As a 2nd year student at the university, my experience so far has been quite good. All my professors were friendly and were accomodating whenever life happened and always sought for their students overall enjoyment and maximum take away from their classes. The university is located in a great spot, not too far from entertainment and stress relief areas, such as malls and various gyms. There is also an amazing cliffside view of the ocean at tbe south side of the campus which makes for great scenic jogging or exercising."
Niche User,4,"I just graduated from high school and is attending the University of Guam this fall 2019. As of now, currently, I do not know much about this university personally, but I do hear comments and news as to how University of Guam is just as great as any other universities there are."

Freshman,4,"Love the atmosphere of UOG, staff is really friendly and helpful. The campus is very clean and well kept, also have a lot of free services to their students which I love. Parking is no issue as well!  One thing I would like to see change is a renovation in some buildings like the Math and Science building."
Junior,4,"University of Guam consists of a group of close knit individuals that help each other succeed on finishing their college careers. I didn’t give it a full five stars, because there’s improvement UOG can work on."
Niche User,4,"I appreciated all the various sources of help, but I would like to see change in how admissions and finances are handled in such a slow and messy manner."
Freshman,4,"The staff such as the professors are very passionate about their subjects and leave the students with a challenge and increase learning. As for the advisers from departments, particularly Nursing were very helpful and willing to assist."

Niche User,4,"When attending Summer classes at UOG, I loved the environment around campus. The students, professors and staff were so friendly and welcoming. The energy inside and outside of class felt active and driven. The faculties were quite accommodating and clean. UOG always promoted a positive student lifestyle, especially when proudly portraying many different works from students. Also, UOG constantly assisted students attending the surrounding high schools so they could further pursue their education. When I was attending UOG, I  was always so excited and ready to learn. University of Guam gave me a taste in experiencing life in college and motivated me to look forward to life after high school."
Freshman,4,It has a very comforting place to study and meet new people. Professors are engaged in students activity life and academic status.
Niche User,4,"University of Guam campus is a small-medium size campus with a beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean, trees and flowers, food trucks, a friendly, safe and familiar environment. The professors and the staff in the ALS building are great, they want whats best for the student and they working very hard to make things happen. The admissions office staff are very welcoming, patient and helpful. The book store is great, it has almost all that you need for school, from books to materials. I have not used the GYM facilities, but it's fairly big and kept well maintained.  I also have not been able to visit the marine lab, but I've heard great things about it. My only complaint has been the student aid office. If you don't walk in and check up on them, you may end up having to pay the consequences, because they don't get a hold of you if things are not in place. Also finding a parking spot can be a little bit of a hassle..."
Freshman,4,"Pros: Affordable price, rofessors and advisors are willing to make time to give extra help and there are many clubs, activities, and events offered.
Cons: Processing documents/requests for academics and housing takes longer than it should."

There are various resources available to students such as the computer center where you can use the computer and print for free, the writing center where you can get tutored In your English courses, and the math lab where you can get tutored in your math courses. Also, you'll never get hungry on campus! There are multiple food options to choose from whether it's the cafeteria, food trucks, or a cafe. The environment is very friendly and you will have no trouble getting along with people."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Guam is diverse college that allows all to broaden their skills and talents. Although the University of Guam happens to be located on an island, it is still able to uphold a full curriculum that caters to most students.
Most of the students enrolled in the University of Guam are locals. We get multiple students from other countries through our exchange program and from the other islands that surround Guam.
The best part about having other students from different ethnic backgrounds allows the locals to experience different types of cultures in the most accepting way.
The University of Guam is one University to look out for."
Junior,4,The University of Guam is a well presented school. I have gained a lot of knowledge from the Professors I have taken. Some things that I would like to see the University do is to provide more sections for certain courses.
Sophomore,4,"I'm still currently enrolled at University of Guam, and I really admire the numerous forms of student services available on campus. The education quality is great and  most professors are extremely enthusiastic. However, if I could change one thing about this college it would be to have more efficient parking, that would facilitate students getting to class on time. In addition, competitions should be held consisting of monetary gift certificates."
Niche User,4,I liked the college and professors. They were very accommodating and really guided me through my experience with them.

College Freshman,4,"For the many years I have spent touring the campus, I have yet to see any person(s) using drugs or drinking alcohol while on campus. Which is surprising because there are minimal to no signs posted stating that these things are not allowed on-site."
College Freshman,4,The University of Guam provides Sexual Harassment training for students to take prior to any semester they wish to attend. This assists with their efforts to give students the sense of safety and security while attending classes.

College Freshman,4,There's not much internships offered but I know enough that the Board of Regents are trying their best.
College Freshman,4,"University of Gua does not necessarily have my intended major which is CyberSecurity, however, they have fundamental alternates such as Computer Information System (CIS) and Computer Science which are pretty valued by Professors."
College Freshman,4,UOG is not very crowded. Each class has about 20-25 students which makes it manageable for the professors.
College Freshman,4,The student career prospects are great.
College Freshman,4,"The University of Guam fits me perfectly because, as a person who grew up in Tinian, I felt like the university was just like home. It has that island vibe and atmosphere which makes me feel very comfortable. The university also has all the resources I need to succeed in college, such as dorms, computer centers, libraries, financial aid, tutoring, and jobs. Unlike universities in the mainland, the University of Guam is very cheap and gives similar academic training to students. I feel like the university of Guam would be the best place to be for young adults like me who want to start small. I am convinced on graduating here because I believe that this is the place for me."

College Junior,4,I've enjoyed my professors for my program.  I feel prepared to finish my thesis.
College Junior,4,Great place for Masters Program
College Freshman,4,"UOG is a campus where there is a lot of ""green"" space. It is very environmentally welcoming and I believe is safe. There are barriers around the campus that would mark the school's premises, and students would feel safe in there, if not, I guess no one wouldn't want to get a dorm in campus if that is the case."
College Freshman,4,"UOG is a great university. They have professors that are highly respected in their fields, and the overall reputation of the school is great."
College Freshman,4,"The professors are great. I believe they all have their master or doctorates degree. They are all professionals in their fields, and they are approachable. Some may be the ""terror"" type, but I guess it is only because they wanted to push their students to do more and be at their best."
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at UOG is active. They continue looking for athletes that could posotively contribute to the institution, and of course to the performance as well. UOG students are very supportive of this."
College Junior,4,"In the three years I have been attending UOG, I have only ever heard of one sexual assault that happened when a man was driving around UOG asking girls for sexual favors. The UOG immediately put awareness on that issue and assigned security guards around the campus thereafter."
College Junior,4,"There are many job openings for students who want to work, but it does not necessarily focus on the students' interest. However, classes within one's declared major would have internships depending on the course. This is often brought upon students who are close to graduating."
College Junior,4,"Every course is different and so is every teacher. Like many schools, there are good teachers and then there are not so good teachers. I'm among the fortunate who have had more good than bad. I have watched Gilmore Girls, and I'm proud to say that there were a few outstanding teachers in UOG who are similar in terms of teaching styles as the ones reflected in Yale according to that Gilmore Girls has portrayed. Unfortunately, UOG does not have a diversity of courses to take. The honest and top courses people come here for are business, education, nursing, and biology. More often than not, one of these would be majority of the students' answers."
College Freshman,4,The professors know what they're talking about.
College Freshman,4,The professors are passionate when they speak.
College Senior,4,I am in my first semester of the University of Guam and so far it is going great. They have a wonderful staff and great advisers that kindly assist students. They have many activities and workshops to attend and so there is always something to attend every day. The campus is great!
College Junior,4,"So far, the University of Guam has been very welcoming. The first two days of school, the student body hosted an activity to welcome all new students and returning. I enjoyed that because it got me less nervous about going to school. What makes my school unique is that it is diverse and not as big of a campus were a person might uncomfortable walking alone. If i had the chance to choose this school and start all over again it would probably because of the experience i had and the great people i have met."
College Freshman,4,There is a variety of-campus dining places!
College Freshman,4,The campus is very secured and protected.
College Freshman,4,There exists some great night life across campus.
College Freshman,4,The prices on campus food is affordable!

Recent Alumnus,4,I love the location where the university is located.
College Freshman,4,There are very little issues with campus security. Everything is very secure and safe on campus.
Junior,2,"The University of Guam is the cheapest university in the United States, with its out of stat tuition matching that of in state tuition of most schools in the mainland, however, you get what you pay for. The campus WiFi is also pretty useless, getting up to 1 Mbs when your lucky, or more often, hanging around 200 Kbs or less. Not all is bad, The professors, excluding the ones in the school of business are great. The classes are challenging, but engaging and fun. There is a decent variety of majors to choose from. The dorms are also quite cheap. The neighborhood around the school is just that, a neighborhood, with a few food places and, which make better, cheaper alternatives to the food available at school, which marks on par with fast food when it comes to healthiness. Public transit is almost non existent, so a car is needed. If you don't mind the downsides, and want a more affordable island school, this is the place, but keep in mind, in paradise, technology is a little bit behind."
College Freshman,2,"The student campus housing available at the University at Guam is somewhat miserable at best. With millions in dollars of yearly revenue, the University deems it unnecessary to upgrade their housing facilities to that of the national standard across the United States."
College Freshman,2,"Although a proud University, the University of Guam does not have a sufficient budget to expand their intramural/varsity sports or their facilities. They have had the same Field-house since the day the campus opened its doors to the people of Guam. The only sports offered for students to participate in currently is Basketball, Volleyball, and Soccer. There are very few athletic opportunities provided for the students as proof of the very limited options the University has to offer."
College Junior,2,Most of the graduates are jobless
College Junior,2,"Students are unmotivated... So much gossip regardless of calling themselves a Christian institution. 

Teachers are kind and caring... Thats the only good part of this school...

I cannot call this school an university... Classes are middle school level"
College Junior,2,"The dorms lack the cleanliness in the facilities. And although it is convenient, it is not that great in terms of insects. I have created a photovoice/documentary in my website http://www.educationalgroup.wix.com/dorminsects for more information."
College Freshman,2,The prices for off-campus housing is very high.
Recent Alumnus,2,What in the world is Greek's focus important?
Recent Alumnus,2,"Well, there's a lot of weighs to take into consideration. Living off-campus is not that bad when family or relatives are able to house you. Now a days cost of living is expensive especially food. The rent, electricity, running water and most importantly transportation to and from the university."
College Sophomore,2,No enough options within walking distance.
College Senior,2,Not a lot of sports/athletics that I know of
Recent Alumnus,2,We have a school cafeteria which only opens from 7am to 3pm. It is so bad that we don't have a 24-hour or night time dining options that will allow the students dine out during the night. The cost of meals is also expensive for the students.
Recent Alumnus,2,There is no such thing as party life at school. The student body is so weak that they don't do activities for the school such as night parties on campus. 
Recent Alumnus,2,There is no such thing as students discounts at the nearby off-campus dining options. They also have costly prices for their meals. 
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is a need of campus shuttles. Students really need transportation to and from school. With those that are living in the dorms, it's very hard to get their necessities because they have no way of going to the stores. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"The school never helps student to find off-campus housing. Therefore, it is one of the hardest things for students to look for when trying to find one. Most of the available houses are costly for students to afford. The houses are not really close to the school so when it rains it gives students problem to find ways to reach the school. "
College Freshman,2,"Of course people at our school who are athletic have a lot of school spirit, their very involve in school function and other curricular activities compared to those who are not athletic at all. We do have training and workout facilities for students to use but not a lot of students are active in sports."
College Junior,2,"Getting financial aid assistance is not always as easy as thought, it is always packed and sometimes I had to wait outside because there are no more chairs to sit on. When I do finally get to see an advisor they tell me that something is either missing or wrong with my paperwork process. I suggest if you do not want to wait too long, go in the morning or make an appointment with your financial aid advisor via email. Make sure you have copies of all your forms, carry your student ID with you at all times, and make sure your grades of the previous semester does not effect your current semester's award from your financial resources."
College Junior,2,"I transferred to the University with the intention to major in computer science. I have since decided to change to engineering. Although engineering classes are offered, there is no engineering program established at the University."
Niche User,1,Not enough sections available for courses. Horrible parking. Takes extremely long to graduate because courses aren’t always offered. Limited degree options.
College Junior,1,"I see cockroaches daily, dirty plates in the kitchen, leaking toilets... 

Its a third world condition..."
College Junior,1,Only offer volleyball for girls.. Men have basketball and volleyball.
College Freshman,1,UOG doesn't have a Greek life
College Junior,1,There is no Greek life
College Junior,1,Extremely unhelpful. Very slow to get back on questions. Does not know the answers. Does not offer other ways for financial aid. Do it yourself kinda thing.

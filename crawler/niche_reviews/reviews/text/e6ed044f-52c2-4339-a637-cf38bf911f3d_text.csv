Sophomore,5,I'm a running start student at SCC. I am in my second year working towards my AA degree. The instructors that I've taken classes with all have high expectations  which you need to keep up with. I've had a great experience here at SCC.
Niche User,5,"I live nearby so I often utilize the campus. I received my NAC through SCC. Currently, I am enrolled in SFCC another branch of CCS. My instructor was very personable and answered phone calls and texts. The library is very big and open to the public, as well as SFCC. Location is prime! The Spokane Transit system has a park-n-ride on campus. This allows you to catch any major bus line or connecting bus in Spokane. There is fast food, coffee, groceries, gas stations, Gonzaga, and the freeway within a 5 minute drive or less."
Freshman,5,"I am currently in the enrollment process, and I absolutely love it! All the people I've talked to have been kind. They accepted me even though I didn't finish college. Their campus IS a little hectic because of all the construction, and the buildings are placed oddly, but it's a fun environment and in a nice place."
Freshman,5,I really like Spokane Community College! It is very affordable and they work with you financially. They are very helpful with helping you choose a career and guiding you in the right direction. They have many programs and their credits are all transferable. They want every student to succeed.
Freshman,5,"10 years ago I was a student here. I moved away, tried new things in new places, but am overjoyed to return here this fall and finally receive my certificate!"
Sophomore,5,The things I like most about Spokane Community College is the variety of classes available and the wonderful teachers they are very helpful in  helping me succeed.There is nothing the school needs to improve they are giving there hundred percent to all students.
Alum,5,"I went for my pre required credits to become a dentist and ended up changing to become a Dental Assistant. The Dental Assisting program is AMAZING. It is run by ladies who have written the text book. So they know what they are talking about. The classes were well explained, so although the content was hard, the course was easy to complete."
Freshman,5,The staff has been absolutely wonderful since I have started attending school here. They are always there to help and timely about returning phone calls. Most everyone there has helped me accomplish some part of my goal in becoming a medical assistant.
Sophomore,5,"All the instructors are awesome. The auto program is one of the best around. Very well setup and ran program, with lots of extra learning resources. Its one of those programs, where the sky is the limit, and you are the only one that controls how far you go, or how much you learn. And all the certifications are either covered by tuition, or are included in the course of the program. If you complete the whole program, you end up with 8 ASE certifications, a associates in business, 609 refrigerant recovery, several Subaru skils training certifications, plus many more than easily obtainable. It is a great starting place to a unlimited future"
Sophomore,5,It's  a nice community within itself. The teachers care about what they are teaching the students.  And most teachers and staff create a bond with the students while they are there.
Junior,5,"I love Spokane Community College. I have enjoyed almost all the professors there, and have had a wonderful experience leaning and growing as an individual. I will take all I have gained from SCC and will carry it with me into the future."
Junior,5,"The instructors at this college are excellent and really make it a point to help you learn and succeed. Almost all of the counselors and front desk staff are easy to work with and help answer any questions.
The programs offered are some of the best in the state with high success rates."
Freshman,5,"While I experience the same kind of issues that would arise with any community college, SCC has always been helpful in providing a solution to these situations. Great and passionate teachers!"
Freshman,5,"I love this college, all of the teachers I've had so far have been incredibly helpful to me in my studies and work and it's been an amazing experience."
Freshman,5,"I am currently in my last quarter as a freshman here at Spokane Community College where I am playing on the women’s soccer team. As a collegiate athlete, most of my free time is spent at practice, in the weight room, or in my coach’s office discussing classes and soccer. I also have a job through the work study program at my college. Another place I spend a lot of my free time is at a local church called Life Center, which is right across the street from Spokane Falls Community College. At Spokane Community College, there is no student housing available, so I live in an apartment with two of my soccer teammates right across the river from campus which is only about 10 minutes away. Overall, I would say that I am very lucky to live in Spokane and attend Spokane Community College."
Freshman,5,"Let me start off by saying the staff and professors are exceptional at Spokane Community College.  I can not explain to you how helpful and knowledgeable they are with everything and anything you would need help with. They are also friendly and welcoming to a ""t""!"
Graduate Student,5,I am currently taking my 2nd course both 2year courses. This is my 3rd quarter & i have found there is always someone who can help you with whatever you need to have a good experience and succeed in your goals
Freshman,5,"My experience at Spokane Community College so far has been wonderful. The instructors are very friendly and helpful. I have been out of school for about 8 years since I graduated in 2010, and the teachers have certainly been patient and understanding with me. They make sure I fully understand the subject and if not they sit down with me and break it down to the best of their knowledge to help me better comprehend. The instructors are very good at giving us students resources. I also am very content with all the additional help that the campus provides. There is a food bank, student center which helps students find jobs, multicultural center which helps with scholarships and so much more. I myself as a struggling single mother has had to utilize the food bank and student center already and I am truly grateful."
Freshman,5,All of the staff and anyone on campus is willing to help you and care about you. The professors are very understanding and constantly check inion your understanding giving you great feedback.
Freshman,5,Spokane Community College is full of staff that are wanting all students to succeed. I'm very pleased with my experience at SCC!
Freshman,5,"The staff is knowledgeable about campus services, program requirements, and job prospects after graduation. Very organized and professional."
Sophomore,5,"I have gone to this college now for 2 years, and it truly allows very good one on one experiences to help better your understanding in classes. Also professors are much more helpful in a smaller class size and that's typically what you'll find at SFCC and SCC."
Freshman,5,"SCC has the most AMAZING programs available to all levels of education. The staff, here at SCC, are here to help you every step of the way! Great Support system!"
Junior,5,"Spokane Community College is really nice!  The professors have all been amazing, and even the ones that had lesser ratings online or none at all have been fantastic!  The student services are also great, the school administration definitely shows that they care about it's students.  All in all I love this community college."
Freshman,5,"At SCC, the campus is very diverse and the students and instructors are all super nice. My first day, I already felt at home."
Sophomore,5,"Spokane community college is one of the best school 2years school in Washington, with a great affordable learning experience. the teachers are very friendly and nice to everybody.  They provide math lab, English lab and many more lab for the student to get succeed in their education. I wish, they had on campus housing for students."
Niche User,5,"This college is a great place to start out when just starting college. It is great because if you are unsure of what to study, you are still able to attend school and get a feel of what the classes are like. It is a great atmosphere and has a lot of student involvement opportunities. I graduated with my Associates degree through the running start program and made amazing friends along the way."
Freshman,5,I like how the people working there try very hard to help you as much as they can. And for the most part the students are really great.
Freshman,5,The community at this school is outstanding! The advisors and teachers put a ton of effort toward making students succeed. The school is driven to educate students and prepare them for either their career field what to whatever college they move on to next.
Freshman,5,"It's in a very calm place, people are nice, many international students, professors are good, I recomend for everybody who wants to study."
College Senior,5,The class size is small so the teacher has more time with the students.
College Sophomore,5,The forestry and botany programs are extremely Hands-On and difficult but very informative. Depending on how many courses you decide to take dr. Ruth Kirkpatrick can create a massive workload but she is willing to work with you through it and will give you excellent PhD level advice and techniques to you as a student.
Recent Alumnus,5,"From what I have seen it appears to be very good, but I have not yet graduated nor used any of those resources."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The professors all seem to care, and are fun to interact with even in the classroom. You really get the feeling, that even once you finish their class they still care and are there to help you if you need it. The class sizes for my program are nice and small, you can know all your peers, and it doesn't feel like our professors are stretched too thin. The quality of the classes is wonderful so far, and I feel like i am really learning things that will better aid me in the future."
Recent Alumnus,5,"At least in my current field the graduation rates are fairly high, and anyone I have spoken to about it says that it really prepares you for the work to come. I get more from this school than I might going to a special school for my field, and it means I have better prospects and am better prepared than I might be for the future."
Recent Alumnus,5,"It is a lot of work, but the professors are always there to help if I feel I can't do it. they expect a lot from you, but not in a bad way. They treat us as adults, good and bad, and expect from us what that means. The work is hard, but it's good and I feel it is preparing me for what is to come regarding my chosen field."
Recent Alumnus,5,"This school has made it easy for me to continue my education, and has been wonderful in helping me with anything I have needed. They seem to care about students, and I am always able to get through to someone if i have a question or a problem. If there is any issues, they always contact me and help make sure I am where I need to be."
College Senior,5,"The courses are varying and cover most fields, the instructors are communicative and care about teaching."
College Freshman,5,have not gotten to this point in the course yet but from what I hear it is real good turn out for the jobs and internship
College Freshman,5,started out with 29 in the class and only 22 spots to fill in the program now we are down to 24 at this point the attendance is critical in this class it is just like the real life work place you miss 3 day you are done unless there is a good excess
Senior,4,I'm glad I went to a community college. It prepared me well to move onto to a four year college. This is great if you are a non traditional student.
Alum,4,"Great experience at this schools. The largest class size that I had was about 24 people. Great student teacher ratio for all of my classes. Teachers are generally very available to students. Older than average student body, as a fair number of students are returning to school. Student government is very active in planning events for students. There are many clubs and activities for students to get involved in. The school has a great gym. It is very convenient that there is a restaurant and bakery on campus. (Although, their hours are limited.) The Inspiration Salon is also on campus, and it is available to the students and community! Also, the cafeteria there has a lot of great options, and the food is alright! I believe that it is run by the culinary students!"
Freshman,4,"I liked all of my instructures, the counselors are also very friendly and accommodating and the campus is easy to traverse."
Freshman,4,The online experience was very new to me. I had a little trouble staying focused just because thats the person I am. But other than that the course material was easily to find and the programs used were very user friendly and straight forward.
Niche User,4,"I took several classes online, and they were all structured very well. Professors were very helpful with creating clear and concise guidelines to each class requirement and deadlines. Professors and advisors responded in a timely manner."
Niche User,4,The college is very centrally located and is easy to get to from public transport. The campus is very nice and has several clubs and activities that students can attend. Buildings are located close to one another for convenience. The professors are professional and helpful. The student base is very diverse.
Junior,4,"It definitely depends on the professor that you have, but they are always there to help when you need it. Some professors are really hands-on and have weekly zoom meetings while others are available by zoom or email when you need them."
Junior,4,"Spokane Community College is a great option for students who want  wide variety of degree and certificate programs for an affordable price. I have attended the college for two years through the Colville branch during high school. Although there was some confusion with regards to my program which messed up my progress a few times, the staff is very nice and willing to help when they can. The professors I had were for the most part excellent instructors, many of them hands on and willing to provide extra assistance for students who may not grasp a  concept. Overall, Spokane Community College is a great choice for many students as it provides an affordable education for those who attend."
Junior,4,"I took quite a few classes online, and actually prefer them to in person classes. The professors were very helpful, and many were even willing to help on the weekends. Managing a schedule can be tough, as they are primarily at your own pace, but once you get the hang of it, it is a lot easier. The classes, for the most part, are very organized and set up in a manner that is simple to understand. The school uses a website that is very easy to navigate, as everything is labeled and easy to follow."
Sophomore,4,"I am just finishing up my first year, and have really enjoyed it so far. The teachers are all willing to go above and beyond to help you and their main goal is to help you succeed."
Sophomore,4,"I have taken almost all of my classes online since I started last year and it has been so nice to be able to work at some what of my own pace. You are able to go back and rewatch lectures and videos which is something I really like, it helps a lot if you do not fully understand it the first time you watch it. Online courses also allow you to have a little more freedom with you schedule outside of school which is super helpful if you are working or have other things going on."
Freshman,4,"A few things I liked about SCC was the tutoring centers, my classes, campus, and the people I met. Math is an area that I struggle in and had it not been for the Math tutors, I would have not gotten as far as I did in my Math classes. I also appreciated the English tutors too. Apart from what my English instructors taught me, the tutors also taught me very significant things to know about writing essays. Even though I lived about an hour and 15 minutes away from SCC, I still looked forward to going to school every day. I very much enjoyed the whole experience of attending In-class school, but I cannot say the same for Online classes."
Freshman,4,It was great and everyone made me feel welcome. The atmosphere was very comforting and conducive to the learning experience and I made many good friends and potential colleagues.
Freshman,4,"A good place to further your education, and start a brand new journey. If its an associates degree or if its a certificate your after, there's a place for you at SCC. There are so many options at SCC, and this really opens up more opportunities for students to succeed"
Junior,4,"Overall, my time at this college has been a really good experience. I believe that you get what you put into it and I have done the best that I can do and have succeeded thus far. There have been a couple of teachers that were horrible but other than that, it's a really good campus filled with really good people there to help you."
Freshman,4,I like the application process. The campus is easy to access and pretty easy to get around. So far the staff has been easy and helpful
Freshman,4,Spokane Community College is a wonderful and convenient alternative way to get a degree at a rate and price that can work well for anyone. The professors want to see you succeed and make themselves available for any extra help that is needed. The campus has something for every student to enjoy and includes many resources a student might need. The overall campus experience might be improved by more security cameras and better lighting in parking lots for better peace of mind for many students.
Sophomore,4,"Spokane Community College has a very pretty campus. they have many classes to offer, although I do wish they offered more photography and zoology classes. This school has pretty good professors in my experience. The professors will often take extra time to help you understand class work. They are also generally very understanding and accommodating to everyone. SCC is a very diverse college with a lot of knowledge being passed from students and professors."
Freshman,4,"This is my first quarter on campus, and everything has been going great. The instructors and staff have been nothing but welcoming and nice. The campus is very diverse and welcoming to every kind of student. something I would like to see more on campus is more club promotions and flyers about the kids of clubs we have. I have not seen more than 3 club events since the fall quarter started. When I walk into the lunchroom I see everyone is spread out and there are not many people interacting. I do realize some people are here to get their education. but as the world becomes more globalized and diverse, we need to work on our communication skills."
Sophomore,4,"I wish the counselors were more helpful. Teachers are great though. They move at a fast pace and if you're interested, they're interested in helping you."
Freshman,4,"Spokane Community College has all the tools to give you a good education. Their campus is safe and updated, the teachers are all very helpful and want you to succeed!"
Freshman,4,Presently I am enrolling and registering for classes at Spokane Community College. So far all of the staff and teachers that I have met have been friendly and helpful. The school campus if very nice and open although some of the campus is still under construction and renovation. It has a couple grassy courtyards as well as a very large parking lot area.  There is a bus transfer station in the parking lot of the school which makes transportation very convenient for those without their own personal vehicle.
Freshman,4,Is a very well organized school I hope to get a lot of friends from going hear. I like the main campus it has a great look. I feel that a lot of people would like it.
Freshman,4,"They were very helpful when I was navigating through the enrollment process. I needed help with my financial aid paperwork, and they were super fast getting me sorted out. Thank you for making this process so much easier!"
Senior,4,"I like the professors and campus, however the construction has caused parking near the main building a pain. I think the Canvas system is very user friendly and great for people that do online courses. I would like to see more University type activities on campus. When I attended ASU, there was always music on campus outside going building to building, the dance and cheer teams would be out handing out flyers for social events, and different groups on campus would have booths so you could learn about them and sign up. I think those types of things could liven up the campus. Even us old folks are hoping to have the full ""college"" experience!"
Freshman,4,"I love the professor to student ratio. I feel like I learn best when I can speak one on one with my professors and they actually have the time to. I wish the student services on campus were a bit more flexible to my learning, but I’ve learned to adapt. The library has very short hours and limited study rooms for my study groups. Aside from that, I love the campus, professors, and programs available!"
Sophomore,4,"I’ve had a great experience so far with SCC. My program, Health Information Management, has been very interesting and even thought it is an online course, everyone has been very involved in making sure that we succeed and keeping us accountable."
Senior,4,There are too many hoops to jump through to get funding. Students are dropped from classes for inability to obtain financial aid.
Freshman,4,"I love that they just started a Small Farm Associate program! That is what I am enrolled in, but I do wish they would add a Bachelor program for it. The students are friendly, instructors are knowledgeable, and there are many resources and opportunities available!"
Niche User,4,"The communication from teachers to students, as well as, from the facility to the students is exceptional. There are many ways to submit work and take tests that you do not always have to be on campus or in a classroom to do so. The course work is covered well and there is a great student population as well. I am 10 years older than most of the students, and I don't feel like I am 10 years older."
Sophomore,4,"I am entering the medical diagnostic sonography program this fall at SCC. I am happy with the range of programs offered by the college, and most of the professors i have taken classes from."
Freshman,4,"I have made many great memories at Spokane Community College. The classes are kept small (less than 30 students) so the professors can give more attention and care to the students. Most professors are very easily accessible and willing to help with any questions. There are also a ton of recourses available on campus if any student needs help with counseling, tutoring, financial aid, or anything else. Cafeteria food is not good though - I have never bought their food and I don’t think I will until the quality improves."
Niche User,4,My counselor has been great about helping me with whatever I need and guiding me in the right direction for where I want to go. Most of my professors have been good and willing to help when its needed.
Sophomore,4,Excellent college that helps their students succeef. Counselors are helpful and respond back to emails in a timely fashion.
Senior,4,"I spent four years in this college. I feel like they could remodel some of their buildings because you can tell that it is wearing down. But overall, all staff members and teachers were ready to help whenever possible which created a very welcoming vibe."
Freshman,4,I am beginning my first year. Returning to school in my 30's is daunting but they have made the whole process so easy and have helped me navigate financial aid and scholarships.
Niche User,4,"Very close-knit college, engaging and fun place to be. Even at the satellites campuses, there's plenty to do and learn."
Freshman,4,"I have been having a great experience here at Spokane Community College. I have really appreciated the help and guidance that the instructors and the staff have given me. I have been attending the branch in colville. Every time I have needed help for the staff in Colville they have ben very open and helpful. Canvas, the online program they use, took awhile to figure out how to use, but once I got the hang of it, it was easily navigable."
Sophomore,4,SCC is the only college I have ever attended so I cannot compare it to other college experiences. SCC has provided all  steps necessary for my success as a student and I am very happy with the results to this point. The instructors are very competent and there is a lot of resources for students to learn and achieve their goals.
Sophomore,4,"I love the small town feel the college has, and how easy it is to recognize everyone because the school is so small.. the thing that needs changed is educating, and informing people on deadlines for enrolling, and making important dates or tasks more aware."
Niche User,4,The college is a local community college which offers a variety of programs. I have found the instructors very caring and willing to help.  Those on campus are friendly and are helpful.   They give you multiple way to learn ans have several options if you need help in any department.
Sophomore,4,"Ive been going to Spokane Community Collage for little over a year now and i really enjoy it with the students and the teachers. i do wish that people that work in the office/financial aid/ registration needs to be more informed of their jobs, i dont know how many times i have been told 1 thing then told a different thing then different place, this is one of the first steps to students failure due to lack of knowledge in the office area."
Niche User,4,"Mostly positive experience. Professors are generally helpful, counselors are available and ready to help. Students are a variety of ages, but I found that there was mostly students around the age of 30. I didn't participate in extra curricular activities on campus and I never really heard anything about them. Students are mostly hardworking people and friendly. I think there should be more class options, but it is just a community college so it is probably unrealistic to have more variety. I have always gotten into the classes I need with no problems though."
Freshman,4,"After seven years absence, I decided to return to Spokane Community College because I genuinely had a good experience the first time. It is affordable, the campus is easy to navigate and the instructors make it easy to access them if needed. This year is even better since the addition of a student bus pass that is on our student identification cards. Due to this I have started riding public transportation and reducing my stress about driving and the cost of gasoline. The resources at Spokane Community College are incredibly helpful and there are multiple resources. Someone is always willing to help you find what you need. They treat you like family."
College Sophomore,4,The school is very accessible but they do have busy times in the terms where it's difficult to do things like speaking to a counselor.
College Sophomore,4,Took an online course my first term back in school after 14 years. It was fast paced and involved a lot of time management but I made it through with a 4.0 and plan to do more classes this way.
College Sophomore,4,I have no personal experience yet but my family members who graduated from this school have been very successful in their endeavors.
College Sophomore,4,This school has many great teachers and they show that they genuinely care. There's a few that simply come to work for a check but overall the staff cares.
College Sophomore,4,I know a lot of people who graduated from this school and are very successful. Including several family members.
College Sophomore,4,Still doing prerequisites but so far it's pretty good.
College Sophomore,4,It's a great school with lots of options.
College Senior,4,It was a great school and the teacher was wonderful
College Junior,4,"This college offers a variety of courses. On the website, they even have the classes laid out in order, quarter by quarter, to earn specific degrees. I found that very helpful because I didn't know where to start before."
College Junior,4,"I am in the Natural Resource Management program at SCC and so far love it! The workload can be stressful at times but it is always manageable. After completion of this course, I will have several certificates under my belt that will allow me to advance in my career. I look forward to continuing my education."
College Junior,4,Spokane Community College has a great staff. Teachers are friendly and make a strong effort to communicate to the class.
College Sophomore,4,For the students that for applying themselves I could see that the professors single them out and I have no problem with that. For the few of us that were there to actually learn in progress as a student and future worker the professors give us absolute sincere care and helped us achieve our goals.
College Sophomore,4,It was difficult to understand the administration and financial aid process but the biology courses were top-notch
College Senior,4,I haven't had many problems and when I did there was someone to help.
College Senior,4,Welding jobs line up at the college door looking for welders.
College Senior,4,Degrees at this school can easily transfer to four year colleges.
Niche User,2,"I've only had problems with this system. I started in 2011 as a running start student. Nobody returned any calls and the office was always ""closed for lunch"", even in the mornings."
College Sophomore,2,You are pretty much left to figure it out on your own with very little help coming from admissions or any sort of registration office.
College Junior,2,they just want the paycheck and thats  so  sad....
College Junior,2,I will not be able to transfer my credits.
College Junior,2,There are multiple sites that you are required to use and the Homework/ test calendar is not accurate.
College Junior,2,"There aren't very many internships, but there are a good amount of leadership internship projects and work study."
College Senior,2,"It seems that few people employed at the college care about the students or even know how to do their job.  They generally late for appointments, not prepared to answer questions, give the wrong information and fail to follow through with procedures."
College Senior,2,Most instructors do not know their subject or cannot TEACH well.  They act as if the students are a bother.
College Student,2,you don't learn much an theres a lot of waisted time on technical issues
College Sophomore,2,I have had an around bad experiance in trying to get the right information. There have been many times when I have not been properly informed about financial aid (and other areas as well). It is especially hard for me because can't just drive out to campus when ever and I am doing online classes. Also the website isn't very user friendly and is really of no help at all.
College Senior,2,Registration process gets too busy to the point where you can't even see the counselor.
Recent Alumnus,2,I've had three online classes. Two of the online classes I had bad experiences. The teachers weren't helpful and everything was self taught. Only once did i have a great experience with an online class.
College Senior,2,"My Spanish class had homework online. It was terrible. The teacher didn't help us with any of it at all. It was extremely frustrating and stressful. You only had a couple of chances to get the answer's right, and if you got them wrong, you lost points and couldn't get them back at all."
College Senior,2,Career center counselors are not nice and they take forever. They often only take walk-ins and don't accept appointments. That is very frustrating because I don't have time to wait an hour and a half to ask something that will take 10 minutes to help me with.
College Junior,2,If I get funding I am thinking of attending Spokane Falls Community .College
College Junior,2,They only give you  2 chances before they put you on probation. I dropped a class because I could not keep up and I changed my program of study. My GPA was at standard and I lost my financial aid. They telling me I have to pay myself Fall 2014 and there is no possible way to pay for it without the financial aid.
College Senior,2,The student body wasn't involved in school spirit or helping new students engage in school activities.
College Senior,2,I look forward to changing schools as soon as possible. I have recently began taking classes strictly online because I do not enjoy the environment at school.
College Junior,2,"The first online class I took was alright, I passed with a pretty high grade but when I took the next course in the series I found out the professor didn't cover a lot of things that were supposed to be covered. The second online class I took I ended up dropping because the professor didn't even bother to explain anything. She gave us a bunch of stuff to read in the book. No e lectures or anything just go read the book. If I wanted to just read a book I wouldn't be in college, I would just read books."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's in Spokane, the administration is pretty grouchy. The students here don't want to be here. "
Niche User,1,"Absolutely garbage. Blaming COVID for ruining kids lives, but a pandemic doesn’t stop people from being able to send the most important email of your life only a couple of days before to schedule an interview. What are you guys thinking? Just through email? Few short days notice? Lazy and unprofessional. Get it together. Only go here if you want to spend your money, and have some tell you to “f*** off”. Thanks SCC!"
Niche User,1,"No communication. It was wonderful. Want to spend your life going to school, then come home only to be online for the rest of the night only to have “professors” not respond to anything you do? This place is perfect for you!"
Freshman,1,"Since the Covid-19 outbreak, my spring classes were switched to online. This quarter has been very difficult for me. Me being a person who needs that interaction with my fellow students and instructors, while also being a person who is not tech-savvy, this Spring quarter was a struggle for me. I will admit that I did not pass one of my classes this quarter, and that has brought my GPA down tremendously. I have also noticed as the quarter ends, my grade continues to decline, but I am still hopeful for what Fall quarter brings!"
Sophomore,1,I am having a really difficult time doing two mathematics courses online. I do not do as well in hybrid classes either. I truly miss the on campus experience.
College Junior,1,There are no post grad studies at the college.
College Senior,1,NO interaction with instructors.  They will not answer questions or respond to concerns.  Assignments take weeks to get graded and tests come and go without knowing if homework is correct or not.
College Student,1,I haven't heard much about careers or where I can go from here
College Sophomore,1,"I have honestly hated this school. I feel like they have not Idea what they are doing ( not the teachers, but administration and other staff). The only reason I have been able to get things worked out is I have good counselor who has helped me through all the issues I have run into. I am very disappointed with my experience and would not go to the school again or recommend it to anyone else."
College Sophomore,1,"I have had many issues with enrollment, registration, financial aid and other areas. I have got many email with false information and there have been many mix ups with my information."
College Senior,1,"Everything requires a current student ID card. But to get the student ID card, you have to go from building, to building, to building. Trying to track down and actually receive the student ID card is extremely difficult."
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid is non existent. The people they have working there have no clue what they are doing. i have been waiting for my financial aid for over 3 quarters now and still haven't received any of it.
College Sophomore,1,i had recived a check in th email about financial after the first semeter
College Freshman,1,"Career Center Unhelpful – After I graduated, they offered no help finding a job in my field. So naturally, I went to the Career Center for help, as it should still be an asset to me post-graduation. However, I was disappointed they dident help anymore than i could help myself but a tip of some every once in a while. I felt like a number, like I was swept under the rug after commencement. It's as if the school's sole focus is to find new fresh and happy faces for their prospective pamphlets."
College Junior,1,I was told to fill out the FAFSA and the was on my own. I will be paying for most of my education and I will make the most of my degree.

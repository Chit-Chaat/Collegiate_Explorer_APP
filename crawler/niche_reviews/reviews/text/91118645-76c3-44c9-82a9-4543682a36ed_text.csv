Alum,5,I did not take courses online at Shepherd when I attended the university. I was a resident student that took all in person courses.
Alum,5,"Shepherd's small size allows for greater personalization and creates that "" big fish in a small pond"" situation where you can have growth and leadership opportunities not available in larger schools. Couple these factors with its great location on the outer edge of the Washington DC area make Shepherd a hidden gem. It definitely set me up on the road to success both personally and professionally."
Freshman,5,"I enjoy shepherds open and available campus, their diversity in subjects in people their wide range of intellectual and compassionate professors is absolutely wonderful."
Senior,5,I love taking classes online at Shepherd. The professors make it so easy to get into the lessons and are easy to reach whenever you need them.
Sophomore,5,This is the perfect college for someone that wants one on one attention from their professors. It’s smaller college but it has a lot of personality. There are so many activities planned for the students to do and so many volunteering opportunities. The buildings are well kept. The staff are so helpful and really want to help you succeed. I would recommend this college.
Alum,5,Shepherd University is a great school in a small town setting.  It boasts strong academics and one of the better athletic programs in the area.  Shepherd Students Succeed!
Freshman,5,"I’m a second semester Freshman and a sophomore by credits. I’ve really liked shepherd. It took a minute to get accustomed to life at a small school, but the professors are helpful when you need it and administrators are really great. The town is adorable, but more importantly, you can make fast friends with people in town."
Junior,5,So far I have loved the customer service of the university. They have been extremely helpful in guiding me through my transfer. Shepherd's social work program has nothing but a great reputation and I look forward to becoming a member of the B.S.W. graduates.
Junior,5,"I transferred to Shepherd and they made some errors with my transcripts but took full responsibility and helped me fix what was wrong. The administration and the staff have been nothing but nice and helpful, especially when I was struggling through a 15 credit hour semester with a severe concussion. If you ask for help, they will help you."
Sophomore,5,"Shepherd University has been great. The campus is amazing and you have the town right next to it to walk to and look around in free time. Also, the food is fantastic, no matter where on campus you eat."
Sophomore,5,The campus is very friendly and nice. Everything is within walking distance and easily accessible. They have many places to eat on and around campus
Sophomore,5,The campus is very well laid out and easily accessible throughout a range of hours and helps students with any needs they desire.
Sophomore,5,"Shepherd University has been the best school I've ever went to. The professors are great, they offer many many classes and different times that can work with most schedules. They do activities that include every student, both young and old."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently enrolled and attending Shepherd and am contently happy with the campus, staff, and overall environment. The professors are some of the best teachers I've experienced from their hands on teaching methods to their lectures that open my mind and drive me to learn more. The college is placed nicely in a thriving place with many easy accessible hang out spots. The change that could improve the school is the parking situation. Many times I have found myself searching high and low for a parking spot and have had to go to a meter. The meter police are also very strict in the area and will hand out a ticket the second your meter expires. This proves as a constant struggle to the students and if addressed would fix the only issue I can see within the school."
Niche User,5,"As a dual enrollment student at shepherd, I love it. I know I want to go there after I graduate. The teachers are so helpful and they are willing to work with you on essays or projects. Wonderful experience and wonderful town to explore."
Freshman,5,I adore this school! It's my first year at college and my first time away from home and Shepherd has become my new home and has opened me up to so many positive experiences. The professors are all so kind and willing to help in any way possible to see you succeed. The classes are relatively small which allows for a more personal relationship between the instructors and students. The campus and surrounding town are diverse and open-minded; a welcoming environment for anyone regardless of minority affiliations.
Niche User,5,I'm currently a member of Shepherd University's Dual Enrollment program. I'm taking classes there while still being in high school. The professors are really understanding and you will never be left out in the cold by the staff.
Junior,5,"Shepherd is a nice campus with an awesome location (as long as you enjoy the outdoors and are not a city person). 

The classes are not too large and it is clear the professors care about the students. 

Overall I recommend this University."
Graduate Student,5,"I think shepherd was a great place for me to get my bachelors at. I chose shepherd living close to the region, and the university delivered everything I expected it to. I think some other students get mad because they don't want to work hard - so this school isn't the place for a easy degree but that makes being a graduate from here even more valuable. 
Something the school really can't help is the town police department really sucks - if you park in the downtown, even if you pay your meter- be prepared for the town police to find a way to give your car a ticket. My advice - never risk it. Always park on campus it is worth it -"
Junior,5,I believe the Admissions Staff and Faculty are amazing. They are very prompt and they know what they are doing. I would like to see more financial aid opportunities and a little better communication.
Niche User,5,"I extremely LOVE Shepherd University. Its an easy, adapting environment and an extremely safe and small campus. The campus reminds me of my high school because of the class sizes. Also the atmosphere at Shepherd University makes me feel as if I am home."
Junior,5,I love Shepherd University and the town of Shepherdstown.  I call Shepherdstown home now.  Shepherd University was a perfect fit for me.  I would not change a thing about my choice in the University.  Let's go Rams!
College Freshman,5,The athletics at my school are great! We are known for having great athletics and the whole school shows a lot of school spirit for them too.
College Freshman,5,"I work for a newspaper as a sports stringer. I report on a lot of sports at Shepherd University. All of the coaches and staff members, as well as the players, are extremely friendly and spirited. There always a lot of fans filling the stands and cheering on our Rams. I have written articles for soccer, basketball, lacrosse, softball and baseball. Through my experience covering these games have made me more appreciative of sports, and I am proud to be a Shepherd Ram."
College Freshman,5,"Honestly, I love Shepherd University. I am a college sophomore as of the fall of 2016, and I have had the experience of a life time already. My school is small and easy to get around, yet comfortable and safe. I would never choose a different university to attend, because the professors are genuinely caring and effective at teaching the material. I have formed close knit bonds with most of professors, and the advisors have helped me get thirteen credits ahead of my peers as a sophomore, so I can graduate early. I changed my major from psychology to political science, and I have received emails about internships, scholarships, financial aid and other opportunities involved with my newly selected major. Many people always assume that West Virginia University is the best school in West Virginia, but I'd have to disagree because my school is the perfect choice for me. I'll stand by my opinion always as a Shepherd Ram!"
College Junior,5,"The professors are like friends who get to know and understand you as an individual. I am an art student and while the art professors are the most amazing I have ever had, my general studies professors have been just as helpful. There is a lot of community involvement at Shepherd and everyone is like a family; students, faculty and staff, and residents."
College Junior,5,Our football team is amazing and everyone gets involved in the games
College Freshman,5,I don't really much towards Greek Life
College Sophomore,5,"I live in Substance free and am very happy with my choice. It is clean and the whole building has a great social atmosphere. We all know each other and are friendly, even if we are not in the same social groups. 

We only have one laundry room which is an issue a lot of the time, but we get by."
College Sophomore,5,There is a lot of fa support and school spirit at my school. People are always at games and use social media to advertise the games reaching a broader audience. The teams are also supported by our surrounding community and are a they have great pride in our athletes.
College Sophomore,5,"If you're in a strongly invoved degree program, a lot of jobs will look at it knowing that it has a great reputation. Nursing, teaching, art, and a few others are the school's strongest programs"
College Freshman,5,I love the school amd the atmosphere around it. The people at the college and in the town are really nice and helpful and I recommend anyone to go to Shepherd. Although there are some professors who are horribly mean but there are just as many maybe more who are the best!!
College Freshman,5,Everyone is very friendly on campus and the falculty loves to be around their students and I can tell that they enjoy their jobs. I love my classes the teachers are awesome. The events are cool.
College Sophomore,5,"I submitted my financial aid late due to transferring to Shepherd late, but I had enough to cover my cost with loans. The people care about your feelings and try everything they can to help assist you with tuition cost. There is not a lot of communication on the things that need done, they need to send out more reminders then when it has been due for a month."
College Freshman,5,"There has never been a time where I have felt unsafe on campus. I have walked back from my car many times at night and have been approached by someone who didn't want to walk alone. There is nobody here to cause harm to people here and if you do ever feel unsafe, there are callboxes located every 20 feet."
College Freshman,5,You get a great education at Shepherd. The courses are challenging and the professors are great. Getting a degree fro here is something to be proud of.
College Freshman,5,"All the local restaurants such as Blue Moon and Betty's are outstanding. They offer plenty of variety and are locally owned, which is a good way to support the economy. The fast food chains such as Sheetz, McDonalds, and Dairy Queen are owned and operated by locals, which makes them very friendly to go to."
College Freshman,5,"The overall area of Shepherdstown is beautiful and filled with lots of culture. The local businesses are very friendly towards students. There are many things to do in the area, but most involve driving."
College Senior,5,I believe that the safety on campus is very high because there are always emergency call boxes available and the police department are always out patrolling.
College Freshman,5,Love being on the soccer team
College Freshman,5,"The amount of diversity is abundant. You encounter all kinds of people on campus, and n one is shunned for their race, religion, or beliefs. It's a very accepting community."
College Sophomore,5,I love my school athletics! WE are a D2 school and we play to win. Our football team is amazing!
College Sophomore,5,I love that my program is small. My advisor's and professors all know me by name and can work personally with me.
College Freshman,5,Go Greek. The community is awesome
College Junior,5,Lots of options but prices are high. 
College Junior,5,"All of these areas are superb, especially the professors. All of the professors have gained expertise in their fields by working in them before teaching. The amount of students to teacher ratio allows for plenty of one-on-one time, and the professors are more than happy to stay after class to assist in anything the student may need. Their availability outside of class is also excellent. "
College Junior,5,"I am the type of person who is not going to walk across campus alone. even if I know the campus is safe. However, in the event of an emergency, there are blue lights spaced across campus. You can press/call and a campus police officer will be there in a matter of minutes. The number for campus security is posted everywhere around campus."
College Sophomore,5,"There is campus police, an alert text messaging system which makes me feel safe.  It is a small community and I feel comfortable there."
College Sophomore,5,"Shepherdstown is a small town where that people are friendly. It is also a historic town, being the first town in West Virginia. There are many shops and restaurants to which students and people can interact. The thick culture and history that is found there truly makes the town a great place to attend for school."
College Freshman,5,I am in a freshman at shepherd university and did very will my first semester.
College Senior,5,"The location of the school is, in my personal opinion, perfect. It's a small town school that's a moderate size with students. You can walk from one side of campus to the other. But it's also geographically positioned in an ideal spot. At the foothills of the mountains, there's unlimited hiking, rock climbing, long distance biking, fishing, kayaking, canoeing, and river rafting throughout the Shepherdstown and Harpers Ferry areas. In the town of Shepherdstown, there are many small business boutiques, shops, and restaurants that are the highlight of Shepherd life. Everything where the local pub's basement is actually carved out of mountain rock and perfect for those late night local rock shows, to the best smoothie place you've ever tried that also has a yoga studio upstairs. There's the conveniences of Walmart and fast food for about a 15 minute drive down the road, and several malls in different directions from campus, each taking about 45 minutes to drive to. The local rock shows are the best, as are the local theater productions and there are also many events that classes hold at the small business venues on German St as a part of their classes. For example, French tables meet every other week at 2 of the restaurants, and there are deaf coffee chats every Thursday morning at the smoothie place."
College Freshman,5,Shepherd is a very safe university. There are always police strolling around campus. If anything does every happen the students are notified immediatly via rave of the incident. I
College Freshman,5,I recently just became involved in Greek life and it has been one of the best decisions I have made.
College Sophomore,5,"I live on campus and don't really leave unless necessary so I don't lose my parking spot. If you get back early Sunday, assuming you go home over the weekend, you will have no problem getting a great parking spot."
College Senior,5,"Long story short, campus does not have many varieties of food, but town does! The cherry on top is that a majority of the restaurants in town (walking distance) accept the Rambler as payment which is the students meal plan/money card. We have Spanish, Indian, American, British, Home cooked, Healthy, vegan, vegetarian, Japanese, Chinese, McDonalds, Dairy Queen, Kings, Dominos Pizza, Sheetz, there are many options from ritzy to inexpensive. I love Mellow Moods, which is in town, it has so many healthy options and even offers fresh juices. The staff is amazing, the food is excellent, the drinks make you feel good inside, and the prices are reasonable for what you are buying. Next would be Maria's Taqueria which has amazing chips and queso, she makes everything fresh, its like our own little chipotle or Moes."
College Junior,5,There is a lot of variety and I have had no problem getting the classes I want.
College Freshman,5,"All I have to say is that you can put your mind to anything at Shepherd. It is a small campus, but it is very involved with the community and the city of Shepherdstown and there a lot of battlefields nearby to go and visit, Like Antietam."
College Sophomore,5,"Shepherd has many sports to attend and the student really get involved with the teams. The band, cheerleaders and dance team help get everyone excited for the game and keep it up during the games."
College Junior,5,All my teachers have been wonderful and every person on staff has been easy to work with. All my fellow students from all walks of life have also been very nice.
College Sophomore,5,It Is Great! Everyone is very nice and it is well worth the money.
Freshman,4,"Like any other college, every professor who had a face to face class that turned into a online class has adjusted well. I have Psychology 101 online, and the teacher has done well with preparing the course material for the chapter(s)."
Freshman,4,"Shepherd University definitely takes care of their incoming freshmen- first time freshman or not, they know how to have you prepared. I've only been there for almost one semester and my advisor, along with the Shepherd Success Academy, has helped me very step of the way from academic support to figuring out how Shepherd works in general."
Freshman,4,The online classes are Structured well. Teachers are doing the best with what they can given the global circumstances. I’m looking forward to the rest of my classes starting this year.
Alum,4,Shepherd did the best they could to provide an online environment that would lead to success with their students.
Alum,4,I always knew I was going to go to Shepherd and when I got there I was pleasantly surprised. A majority of professors cared about their students deeply and the campus was beautiful in every season.
Senior,4,Online professors seem to be better than most professors you see in person. They seem to care more about student learning and are more understanding of situations.
Senior,4,"Great campus, great professors who actually care about their students, a lot of opportunities to get involved on campus and in town."
Freshman,4,I have had some really good professors for my classes at Shepherd. It is connected to / apart of Shepherdstown which is really great as it is a fun town.
Alum,4,I believe the photography program specifically has a lot of work to go through. But as far as academics and the
Sophomore,4,"I like that I know a lot of people who go here. The campus isn’t too small and it’s not too big. But I would like for the party scene to be a little bit better, because the weekends are really boring here. But other than the party scene it’s a pretty good college, the academics at shepherd are really good, shepherd has a really great nursing program. There’s just so much more to this college than you would actually think."
Sophomore,4,"I would like to see teachers to be a little more set into teaching the students rather than focused on following this ""book"" too often are we not told about something we need to know, because it isn't in the curriculum, but we should know it for what we are learning. It makes knowing what we are doing too difficult. Professors think that a C average is acceptable."
Freshman,4,"So far, I mostly think Shepherd is a good school. It’s definitely a great school for this area, and the campus is charming and beautiful. Some of the teachers are great educators, but some are subpar. I’m sure that’s true for any institution. I will say it’s nice that people remember your name since it’s a small school, and the administration/office people work quickly and keep in touch with you when you need their assistance."
Freshman,4,"Shepherd University has a beautiful campus, especially in the fall! many of the professors are charismatic and want you to succeed. Some of the buildings are quite hold, but the campus is surrounded by historic areas, only adding to its charm! there are many opportunities to get connected to both the local community as well as programs internationally."
Sophomore,4,"Shepherd University is a very nice school to go to. It is good for those who like a smaller classroom size where you can get to know everybody. The classes are not too overwhelming depending on the professor you get. There are multiple area's to eat at on campus which offer fairly average, ok food. you can also do a quick walk into Shepherdstown and go to the local food areas there too! It's very cute and quaint to be in."
Senior,4,I love the accepting environment. I have had wonderful experiences with almost every student and faculty member I have met. I think I have learned a lot from my classes because most of the teachers truly have a passion for teaching. My biggest complaint would be the lack of flexible class schedules. Shepherd has gotten better at having more online courses but they are still limited and the evening options are all scheduled for the same time and day so it is nearly impossible for a working adult to make a schedule that works.
Graduate Student,4,"Shepherd University is a relatively small university in WV in terms of both the size of the campus and the number of students.  The class sizes are also small with the sizes ranging from around 15 to 30 students in most classes. My time at Shepherd University was a very enjoyable one with most of my professors being very knowledgeable professors who genuinely cared about my success and learning at Shepherd.  The small class sizes allowed for more face-to-face interaction with the professors, which is something that I very much appreciated and enjoyed.  Professors knew you on a first-name basis and could respond to your emails fairly quickly to help you whenever you needed.  The facilities at Shepherd such as the Wellness Center and the library are clean and have relatively new technology.  The dining centers across campus are a bit of a let down but they are certainly not terrible either."
Freshman,4,Shepherd University is a stunning school filled with young open-minded individuals. I chose to attend shepherd in the fall of 2019 because of their promising nursing program. When I toured the nursing division of Shepherd it was on the smaller side of programs yet still held it's head high with an almost 100% passing rate for the NCLEX-RN exam. I am proud to be a student at Shepherd and highly recommend others to check into this university.
Junior,4,"Shepherd has an excellent culture: diverse, welcoming, and the professors want to see you succeed - not just in the classroom, but in the life and career that follow."
Sophomore,4,"I like Shepherd University a lot! The professors are kind and want their students to succeed. Shepherd makes their admission process simple for their students. Their registration process is also very simple. However, Shepherd's office of Residence Life is not always the most helpful. They tend to respond to emails very late and not always answer questions completely. The school as a whole is great though!"
Junior,4,"Shepherd University is a wonderful school with patient teachers that love what they do. It is not much for nightlife or day life, to be honest, but the town is very quaint."
Senior,4,"Shepherd University was more than I expected and I have had so many professors here who have not just helped me pass classes to get a degree, but have also encouraged me to participate in experiences like, study abroad and entrepreneurship, that have helped me to become a well-rounded student as well as a professional musician in my area of focus."
Freshman,4,"On student acceptance day there were so many friendly faces. Food wise it seems are delicious, and has a lot of varieties to choose from. Staff there are great helpers if  you need help."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy Shepherd because it is kind of small. I am from a small town,so big party colleges is not what I'm looking for. You can see alot of the people,the campus is not too spread out.Compact is good word for it. I enjoy the food at variety of places they offer. But would Like it more if the dinner hall would be in a more common visited area. I dont go there as often cause I dont have time to walk between classes. But the food variety is good when I do."
Junior,4,"I like shepherd, but I have one complaint. While the people and the professors are great, they hardly ever have classes that are outside of the box. They need more variety than just the basics. I also wish it had more diversity in culture and people of color."
Niche User,4,"I applied to Shepherd University and they got back to e really quickly on any and al questions, and I got accepted!"
Freshman,4,"An incredibly beautiful campus, but because the school is so small you will tend to run into the same people everyday."
Sophomore,4,I love shepherd university because it is small which allows me to have a One on One relationship with every professor. They go out of their way to know my name and at least something about me.
Junior,4,Shepherd University is a really good school. The campus is great and there are a lot of really good faculty and staff members. There are a wide variety of programs of study available and many ways to get involved on campus. The campus is very commuter friendly and offers many opportunities for students.
Sophomore,4,Love the feeling of being a small school and creating close friendships. The sports here also give us team spirit and we’re proud of how good our teams are.
Sophomore,4,"The strong academics and student-focused learning are what make Shepherd a good place to learn. For students who prefer small class sizes and opportunities to interact with a variety of people, the college and surrounding town are a plus."
Sophomore,4,"I am so happy that I chose Shepherd. The school is small enough that I can get to know people and professors well, and I can get around easily. But its also large enough that there are endless opportunities for me to succeed in different organizations. I love it!"
Junior,4,"I am a student at Shepherd University, and the diversity is what sticks out to me the most.  Coming from West Virginia and being a West Virginia school, I expected little diversity and little acceptance.  However, many students I met are from out of state, and chose Shepherd University because of its sports, academics, and overall inclusiveness."
Sophomore,4,"I love that Shepherd has the town next to it that a student can visit and that there are tons of activities to participate in. I wish that the university was better about canceling classes before the weather gets too bad though. I once got to classes the day a bad snowstorm was predicted and classes weren’t canceled until the weather got bad, even though surrounding school districts canceled and it was guaranteed by the weather forecasters."
Freshman,4,"Overall Shepherd University is a great place for young adults to further their education. As a student at shepherd I feel that I have the resources I need to excel in my courses. Also, Shepherd makes me feel safe and at home. All students and administration are kind and caring to each other."
Senior,4,"I currently am a senior at Shepherd University and I really like the small community in Shepherdstown. The only thing I really dislike about Shepherd is that it is not a Christian University. It used to be, but now they have strayed away from God so much that it is discouraging. However, the professors and students are very friendly, but I disagree with the evolutionary standpoint of the curriculum. Overall, I would say that my experience is very good simply because I have not gone to any other university before to compare."
Sophomore,4,"Shepherd University is like a second home to me. The location is great, there isn't too many people, and it is beautiful. The history behind it adds to the beauty. The professors are kind, and understand you are there for a reason."
Freshman,4,"Shepherd University has a beautiful campus. The small town of Shepherdstown, West Virginia provides a quiet, nice environment in which to expand one's knowledge in one's studies. Throughout my experience thus far, Shepherd University has provided me with very helpful resources and commendable staff members."
Junior,4,"Great school. The classes are small, so the professors learn your name and actively communicate with their students."
Freshman,4,"Shepherd University is a great school as far as academics go. However, other aspects make the school less appealing. Only liberal views are encouraged by the school, professors, and most of the students. Students with other views are strongly encouraged to keep their opinions to themselves. Up to $1,000 in athletic fees are charged to every student regardless of their participation in sports or other events."
Freshman,4,Shepherd university is a nice school in a very pretty part of West Virginia.  The professors are nice but parking here is a daily struggle
Freshman,4,Shepherd is a growing college in a beautiful setting.  They make it easy to get additional help by teachers and tutors if needed.  So far my professors have been knowledgeable and consistent.
Freshman,4,I love Shepherd University. The small town of Shepherdstown is amazing to explore. Classes are small and most students are nice. There's always something going on at the campus from free shows to moves. We even get free food and coffee on occasion from groups at the college.
College Senior,4,"There is a wonderful job/internship program at Shepherd, I have had a first hand experience because i was in the co-op program. If you want an internship, you're guaranteed one when you sign up for the program which also a class you get credit for. Honestly, I'm not sure about recruiting or the career services on campus."
College Senior,4,"There's a lot of classes available for this being a small school and campus. The nursing and teaching department are excellent. The class sizes are small, at max you might have 30 kids in one class. I think there is a shortage of professor though, I'm a FACS major and I have the same professor for all of my FACS classes. That same professor is also my adviser."
College Senior,4,"Greek life is very big at our school, they do so much for the community and school. They are some of the nicest people I have met around campus and are very welcoming. They encourage all students to join. I think non-Greek students, such as myself just see them as groups of people, I would say even a family. I believe some of the fraternities have off campus housing, but I have known everyone else to just live with each other in available apartments."
College Senior,4,"Athletic groups are relatively big at our school, the football team is amazing and have won most of their games. The football games is a crowd drawer, I'm pretty sure I see most of the school there when I go. The fans are crazy and support our teams through our school colors and chants. We have a huge brand new gym, the Wellness Center, it's a beautiful gym, with an indoor walking track, pool, exercise group rooms, and so much more."
College Senior,4,"I attend Shepherd University and fun fact it's one of the most haunted towns in America and we have a tv show. It's a small campus in a quaint town. I love the vibes and feelings while walking to class to hanging out around campus, everyone is so nice and you pass smile after smile. You really start to feel at home there because of the family you build and comfort of the town. There's lots of school spirit and fun themed days to boast moral like hot coco day, peanut butter and jelly day, Popsicle day, and so much more. There's little spots to eat around town and lots of hiking opportunities. The professors are kind and easy to talk to. The small class size is one of my favorite things because all of my professors know my name and we form a nice student teacher relationship. I would chose my school a million times over again due to the unique small town features, great professors, beautiful scenery, and school activities. You are encouraged to be yourself and have a free spirit here!"
College Freshman,4,"I feel very secure at shepherd. Although I'm never there at night, I think it is a safe place to go to school."
College Freshman,4,"So far, my college experience has been great. The professors are very helpful and friendly. It is also very easy to get involved.  I love how Shepherd has a small town feel to it. My favorite thing about Shepherd is how many activities there is to do around campus. There is always something to get yourself into."
College Sophomore,4,Some of the classrooms should be updated to include power outlets since many students use laptops to take notes and battery life does not last through three lectures (some laptops don't even last one lecture). Updated world maps would be convenient for history courses (a professor tried to use one and it broke immediately).
College Sophomore,4,"The staff does what they can to prevent sexual assault and to provide resources for victims, but many students neglect to acknowledge the presence of sexual assault on college campuses and the effects it can have on victims and their loved ones."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics and its facilities are great, but do not have the best placement for many students to get to them without taking a car or walking for 10-15 minutes."
College Sophomore,4,The teachers are very knowledgeable in their fields and are very willing to help their students with their course work as well as anything that can advance the students overall success.
College Sophomore,4,For the most part all of my professors have been helpful and caring. Ive had very few who were not.
College Sophomore,4,"We have campus police, which i believe play a big role in myself and my fellow students feeling safe."
College Sophomore,4,"My overall college experience so far has been great. I love how fun, friendly and free spirited evey person that ive met has been. Shepherdstown is such a great location for the University, although it is a small town I couldnt imagine a better place to be furthering my education. Shepherd University is great!"
College Freshman,4,Greek life is something everyone should experience. You will be around people who will become your long life friends and also do things around the campus to bring everyone together!
College Freshman,4,Shepherd University is a great school to attend because it's a small school so your professors will actually know who you are and are willing to help you if you need help or simple have a problem
College Freshman,4,"I have never been a part of Greek Life at Shepherd, but I did consider joining the sorority of Tri-Sigma. Shepherd's Greek Life has absolutely no hazing, and are very involved in volunteer and community service. I would love to be a member of a sorority, but I work two jobs, including being a Shepherd University history tutor, and couldn't find the time. As I adjust into being a college student, I'd probably reconsider joining a society and being a part of a bigger cause."
College Junior,4,"I lived on campus for one year and it was perfectly fine. Never had any problems while living in Shaw Hall. We had heat and air conditioning, carpet, large closet, and the bathrooms were very spacious and clean."
Junior,2,Make it more about the students than about making money.  Seems many people do not graduate after 4 years and need to take addition class due to scheduling conflicts and poor advising.
Niche User,2,I spent 5 years at Shepherd and didn't graduate with a degree. The school doesn't want to take the time to help their students. The professors are the same way. They are either lazy and can't do their jobs or they show up to lecture and then leave and won't respond to emails or questions. 
College Sophomore,2,"Personally I do not agree with the methods that Shepherd uses to handle sexual assault cases, people can easily be falsely accused of sexual assault  and people have gotten away with sexual assault. Shepherd needs to find a new way to conduct these cases and always have a Title IX coordinator on staff.  Although the police on campus do seem to do their jobs well."
College Freshman,2,"When coming to live on campus I thought it would be much better than the reality of it. The rooms are in awful condition. Tight spacing, limited closet space, dirty carpet and walls, lighting, and how thin the walls are. For the place I am living in I believe the price is much too high. The bathrooms are also a major issue. They reek and are always dirty. The social atmosphere is okay, I'm almost never in my hall during the day so I don't interact with a lot of people in the building."
College Junior,2,"The faculty don't seem to care about the students, and the university only seems to care about how much money it can squeeze out of said students. I have encountered many bad professors who couldn't be fired due to tenure."
College Sophomore,2,"Suite style living is a 10+ minute walk to campus, freshman dorms located in prime spot near d-hall and classes. running de-humidifier in the suites at all times is a must."
College Sophomore,2,"Tony's on Thursdays, frat stuff. not much else around."
College Sophomore,2,"I did not enjoy my experience. I felt like I had no privacy, and I didn't have much in common with my floor mates. The rooms were small, and most  of the halls did not have air conditioning."
College Freshman,2,The wireless is awful. It's very slow. I use my own laptop and printer because it costs too much to print in the library and sometimes there's no computers open so it's just more convenient.
College Junior,2,"SCHOOL NEVER CLOSES. Well, it does, but not often. Only for ice will school postpone, this makes it a bit difficult for those of us that commute and the weather is legitimately bad. "
College Junior,2,"PARKING. Other than nightlife is my least favorite subject. Parking prices add up very quickly. There are never any spots, and I don't use that word lightly. The majority of the time I have to park in the parking lot farthest away from everything, and that's if I come early. If I'm the slightest bit late, it's off-campus parking and walking. However, after 5pm the spots slowly start appearing. Law enforcement is incredibly strict, I have been late getting back to a spot five minutes, and have been ticketed. Parking is very stressful. "
College Senior,2,It cost way to much for a permit for the fact that there are never any parking spots so you still have to pay the parking meters so it is pointless to buy a parking permit.
College Senior,2,Keep on the financial aid office because they try to keep you on the back burner until last minute in order to make you pay full price and get a less chance at getting financial aid.
College Senior,2,"There are two sides of campus. The main side of campus barely has any parking for commuters. As a student, you have to get to the main side of campus at like 7AM just to get a spot, other wise you have to park on the other side of campus and walk very long. "
College Senior,2,I not sure on how many students drink but I hope they are safe
College Senior,2,The campus police do their job well 
College Senior,2,It is very peaceful I like 
College Senior,2,There are a mix of people on campus gay straight and in between 
College Senior,2,Everyone is nice I get along with people 
College Senior,2,It is good food off campus
College Senior,2,It was easy my advisor really help my understand the process of political science. 
College Senior,2,The techs are really good at my school 
College Senior,2,The  teachers are really good they want to help you as much they can 
College Senior,2,I was a hard to get In but I did 
College Senior,2,The dorms are really old and need updated
College Junior,2,"The internet is frequently out of order. Save and save often. Back it up on a USB, email it to yourself, do whatever you have to.  Don't plan on finding a computer in the labs easily, especially during exam weeks.  The computers are fairly old, too, with one or two Macs every once in a while.  The art/comm department gets an A for their computers, but everyone else has old technology."
College Junior,2,"The school is old, so that tells you how buildings are.  Instead of updating the buildings, they spend more money on grounds upkeep.  Students complain about various business offices when they encounter problems, which is often.  On average, people graduate in 5 years, not 4.  It may have gotten a good rating from the college rating people, but they obviously aren't students. Most students feel the same, that Shepherd isn't bad, but it's not A material either."
College Sophomore,2,"The facilities are adequate when comparing them to any larger school. However, for a small school like Shepherd the facilities are pretty good."
College Sophomore,2,The weather on campus is random. Middle of winter we had sunny skies and temps. near 70 degrees. The weather changes so often there is no telling what you will get through out the day
Recent Alumnus,2,"Although the local shuttle service (Pan Tran) will get you from A to B, it's almost always too crowded on rainy/snowy days when you need it. I don't know if there is any other public transportation around. As a commuter, parking permits cost $70/year (good for fall, spring and summer), and while that sounds like a great deal, parking is a nightmare. If you have any academic classes in anything except music or sports, you will probably have to park on one side of campus and walk to the other. I highly recommend a bike rack on the top/back of your car to provide a quicker way to cross campus. With the new underpass, there are no major roadways that you'll have to cross if you have highway bicycle anxiety. Furthermore, parking close to your classrooms can be done with meters ($0.25/30 mins) and is relatively cheap compared to other cities. However, don't get caught with an expired meter or it's $10 every time."
College Freshman,2,Campus hardly EVER gets shut down for snow. It has to pretty be a blizzard for them to cancel classes. Make sure you have a pair of rain boots!
College Freshman,2,"After your FAFSA grants and scholarships finding scholarships is slightly difficult. Their is a general form for scholarships in the university. They will sign you up for scholarships you may qualify for through the information on the form. Other than that they make you really search for scholarships, and you probably will have to find scholarships outside of the university. The financial aid office employees are as helpful as they can be if you go to see them."
College Senior,2,"The students attending Shepherd for academics are very hard working and determined. The programs are skewed so the vast majority of students do not graduate in 4 years - more like 5 or 5 and half years. The programs are skewed towards art students and away from science students. To be specific, I was in the biology major for a while with my heart set on medical school. I was not able to pass this one class with higher than a D (being a straight A student, that was devastating). The professor confessed to the class that he had been instructed by the administration to ""weed out"" as many students from the science program as possible because they were not interested in expanding the science program by hiring more professors, as they wanted to allocate those funds to the construction of more art buildings."
College Sophomore,2,Parking at Shepherd can be a nightmare! The main side of campus is always packed and if you are not on campus at least 45 minutes before your class you have to walk across campus.
College Freshman,2,Shepherd does not put too much into their sports. I have been at the university for several months and have not attended any sporting events. Perhaps if the sports teams were really good I would go to them.
College Senior,2,"Shepherd University is a commuter school, so there is commuter parking but people always complain about how far it is from there classes. They also say there aren't enough parking spaces, so we need more for parking to be more convenient. The parking for residents are fairly convenient but sometimes can be distant depending on what side of you live on."
College Freshman,2,"Shepherd University isn't the right place to meet your soul mate in my opinion.  There are a lot of guys that are cute, but have a girlfriend, so basically all the good ones are taken.  The girls aren't extremely the best looking girls, but you can find some beautiful ones hiding behind all the other girls."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much of a diversity at Shepherd University.  Because I come from Hawaii, I have noticed that there aren't many people that come from a diverse ethnic background.  However, the political beliefs, religion, and sexual orientation are widely diverse and accepted at Shepherd University."
College Junior,2,"Eh, It's Okay. Food at the dining hall is okay. Breakfast is the best part, they make omelets and french toast to order and it's very good. Lunch and dinner is okay. They let you take the food out to eat back in your dorm or car. Ram's den is good but they often run out of lettuce and tomatoes which sucks.The Wellness center is the best place for food, VERY tasty sandwiches."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life on the campus of Shepherd University is almost undetectable. Its rare that you actually see any sororities or fraternities actually participating in any practical Greek life activities. You see an occasional bake sale here and there, but for the most part Greek life is very low key. I'm pretty sure other students, as well as myself would like to see that change."
Sophomore,1,"Will hold your grade hostage to force you to participate in ""school events"".

Half the teachers don't speak English and are probably on a VISA.

The school is in the middle of nowhere, so its safe in that regard. None of the doors can be locked so if anything does happen --- ""DEAD END""

They refuse to let you withdraw from your classes even if you have a valid reason. 

Majority of the students are antisocial. Good luck talking to people and getting more then a 1 word response of ""Yeah"" or ""No"".

I know for a fact the one building has mold in the ceiling. How? The water damage is rampant. 

Ask the students attending, 90% of them will say to avoid the school. 

This school should and could be sued for a lot of stuff. 

As for actual education - you won't learn anything useful here. All the stuff they are teaching is outdated that your parents probably learned."
College Freshman,1,I do not like my school at all. Every aspect and category of this school is lacking
College Freshman,1,"If you do not feel like taking the time to read this, feel free to jump to the last sentence. I did my best in summing it all up. There is nothing to do, ever. The fraternities are jokes, the food is horrible, the dorms are trash, and the class size makes me feel like I never left Highschool. The professors (or should I say, ""teachers"") are always up your ass about bringing your appropriate materials to class, having your phones out, and attendance. I never liked this place but I came here to play a sport which ended up not working out, and if you aren't an athlete I am not sure why you would attend this place. Considering the school is like 60% commuters, you're basically attending a community college and it feels like one. On the weekends, the place is a ghost town. And with the atmosphere of a community college, so comes the intelligence. Other than my honors classes, which are the most horrid and uninteresting courses I've ever had to endure, the people here are extremely dumb -- I wish I had a more intuitive word to describe them, but dumb seems to frame it perfectly. I have multiple classes with middle aged men and women in them because, like I said, it is a beefed up community college. I thought this would be a way for me to be close to DC and Baltimore and finally get that out of state feel, but ladies and gentlemen 90 miles sounds a lot better on paper than when you are driving it. On a final note, and for those that did not want to take the time to read my inglorious rant, this place sucks, and I consider it the biggest mistake of my life -- currently in the process of transferring."
College Sophomore,1,"Very few scholarships, beyond promise a managed to scrape together a couple of honors scholarships."
College Sophomore,1,It is extremely difficult to get a scholarship through the school which is why im on outside websites.
College Senior,1,I like my political science teachers  
College Senior,1,School is hard but it is a learning process 
College Junior,1,"All I have to say is that I recommend getting here an hour or two before your class (if you are a commuter.) Residents don't have much of a problem unless trying to park during peak hours.  For the most part, residents will walk to class and stay parked unless venturing out to the store.  Commuters, however, try to park close to their classrooms.  East Campus has parking for commuters and faculty only, but most of the time commuters have to park on West Campus and walk to class, too, because the spots fill up quickly."
College Junior,1,Finding off campus housing that is affordable and nearby is difficult. Landlords in the area are infamous for being difficult to deal with and unreliable. Shepherdstown's population also tends to discriminate against students.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Overall, not that great.  The dining hall has a lot of choices but most meals remind me of a high school lunch.  The Rams den better in terms of food that is more edible.  However everything is fast food style: burgers, pizza, fries, chicken tenders etc.  Not to mention the employees in the dining areas are not very friendly or customer service oriented.  the food on campus is my biggest complaint about shepherd."
College Sophomore,1,"Hard to Find – I have just started looking for an apartment in or close to Shepherd.  The apartments in town are usually above a store and are expensive! But there are also houses that are rented out, that have 2 or more bedrooms and those are nice.  As far as finding the apartments and what is for rent I find that difficult but I'm still learning the area and what help is offered through Shepherd University."
College Junior,1,"Where Is Wifi? I spent the day on campus and when I had time, I wanted to check my email.  No WiFi in the Student Union.  Could not check other spots on campus that day."
College Senior,1,Not the Greatest – Shepherd has only two parking spots for residential parking and they are the farthest lots away from the classes. The rest of the lots are for non-residential students and they are not very big. Shepherd does have a lot of metered parking spaces right in front of and beside the classroom buildings but it is always difficult to find an empty spot there.
College Senior,1,NO PARKING – There is only one parking lot on the main campus area and you have to get there at like 7 am to get a spot. The rest of the parking in on the west side of campus where all the dorms are and it's basically a mile away. Try walking that in the heat and or winter. Also there is one public transportation which is the pan tran and it sucks. I have yet to find out when and where it comes.
College Junior,1,"Oh. My. God. Parking is ridiculous, it's such a pain in the ass. There's only two parking lots: the one across from White Hall (where all of your classes are located) and the larger one located on the other side of campus. You can never find a parking space near White hall unless you are willing to wake up at 7 AM. The one across campus is large but you'll have to walk up to a mile and be late for your classes. It really sucks on bad weather days. Parking in Shepherdstown is just as bad because you'll end up getting a lot of tickets for unfair reasons. Just awful!"
College Sophomore,1,"As far as diversity goes, West Virginia as a whole is probably one of the least most diverse states in the country. To say the least, Shepherd lives up to that reputation. There are a few other ethnic groups, but not very much diversity. Although Shepherd University is not at all as diverse and many other Universities, it takes full initiative in making sure that every student is treated as an equal."
College Senior,1,"The parking on campus is awful! It is very hard to find parking. If you find a parking spot, the meter time is not reasonable. The cost of a ticket is manageable but if the student receives a bunch of tickets by the end of the semester, it could be very costly for the student. Which is helpful to generate money for the town police department."
College Junior,1,"People who go here are so stuck up it isn't funny.  I have tried numerous times to make small talk with some of them and it is really impossible.  I am a very social person and I really don't find the people here friendly in anyway.  The girls are all ugly and the guys are nothing to look at either.  Most of the students are white, there are a few black students too and I have only seen one Indian and two Hispanics."
College Junior,1,"Parking and Safety – The parking situation is horrible here.  I have paid $75 for two different stickers and have trouble finding a spot that is even remotely close to the building where I need to be unless I get there at 7:30 am, which means I have to leave my house at 6:15 am.  So this is what I do.  Then I either have to wait on a tram that is never on time or make the hike over to the west side of campus, which is a walk.  Sometimes I do not feel safe because of the maintenance men who watch me walk and creep up on me in their truck. Crossing the main road to the west side of campus can be a challenge if the crossing guard isn't there.  Cars are not quick to stop for the pedestrians in this area."
College Junior,1,Awesome school if you want to be a teacher or nurse but if you are not interested in that I don't recommended Shepherd.The other departments are HIGHLY lacking.

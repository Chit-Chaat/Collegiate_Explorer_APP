Freshman,5,We currently have hybrid classes. This means that some days we meet face-to-face and other days we meet online. The professors give us plenty of time to complete assignments that are posted online. They also try their best so that everyone in the class feels like they have learned something new.
Freshman,5,"This year is my first year as a college student. I am a first-generation college freshman and Campbell University has made sure that students like me feel welcomed and prepared. I love the environment of the campus because it is filled with nice people who love to help if you are experiencing any trouble. At Campbell University, there are many student resources that are provided which make life so much easier. For Example, we have tutoring sessions that are provided for students that are having difficulty with understanding material in their classes. So far, I love Campbell University."

The instructors are well versed in the courses and are willing to put forth the extra effort to see a student succeed. Overall Campbell University offers a solid education and a creative, wholesome environment for students to learn and mature in."
Junior,5,"With the Covid-19 shutdown mid-semester, Campbell went into online class mode. Many of the professors had never done online classes and had to learn as they taught. I commend their ability to continue teaching while going through such a chaotic period. The school did adjust and continued all courses with a minimal of contact between students and teachers. They devised schedules for classes that required labs which allowed students to perform the needed lab hours while remaining safe from the virus. The dedication of the staff, from the grounds keepers to the Dean of the University, was evident prior to the pandemic and has continued through the upheavals required during the quarantine. This experience will expand the teaching capabilities of the University and the professors teaching there."
Alum,5,"The campus cruiser is easy to navigate. The IT staff is amazing. Issues are resolved quickly, and professors work with you during outages. If you need assistance, there is plenty to be found."

If you are looking for a school and you are wondering if Campbell is the right choice, don’t wait! It is the best choice!"
Freshman,5,There is a feeling of connection and homeliness that you get at Campbell that I did not feel anywhere else. The other big plus is that if you like smaller class sizes Campbell is definitely the place for you. Campbell is an amazing place to go to school at.
Freshman,5,Campbell University is a wonderful school. At this school they make you feel a part of everything. They have wonderful programs such as the 4+1 program which allows you to get your Masters in 5 years!!
Niche User,5,"Campbell University is a Coed Private University located in Buies Creek, North Carolina known for their many Academic and Professional Programs. Visiting over the summer showed me how serious they are about education. I met with medical students who were still continuing to pursue their career. For any students who are looking for Excellent Medical schools to attend I would totally recommend Campbell University.. Go Camels!!!"
Junior,5,"I enrolled into Campbell University in the Summer of 2019. All the staff, professor, and students are very nice and very supportive."
Junior,5,I am a student with Campbell's online program. I find it to be convenient for me and the professors are patient and work with you.  The classes are face-paced but the instructors have been very good.
Freshman,5,"One of the reasons I love Campbell is because of the community and social experiences available on campus. Campbell has a plethora of clubs and organizations, so students can stimulate social, cultural, intellectual, leadership, and recreational skills, whether their interests are in politics or art, sports or science.  Every week there are multiple free or low-cost activities, from mud-volleyball games to movie screenings, to food trucks and international celebrations. Campbell is more than a place where I learn and study - I've made friends who are like family and built a home away from home."
Senior,5,Campbell University is the place to go to pursue a career in education. Every professor in the School of Education loves the students and the content that they teach.

Freshman,5,Wonderful growing community and diverse culture.  Excellent academic and athletic programs.  Excellent staff and faculty!!
Graduate Student,5,"The College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is great. The professors are here for you to learn and will help you, but they will not hold your hand. I received a plethora of hands-on experience as an undergraduate and a graduate student. Campbell is a smaller school in a small town, so the sense of community is very much felt by the professors and students alike."
Senior,5,"My overall experience visiting Campbell University was stellar. Tours are done on a one-on-one basis, in which a select counselor will meet with you and give a personalized tour of the campus."
Freshman,5,Campbell University is not to big nor to small. It’s the perfect size.  They have small class sizes so you get more individualized instruction. The  Professors are invested in student success. Good support services.  Easy move in process.  Good food in dining halls.
Freshman,5,I love the experience I had when I went to student registration/orientation recently. The staff is awesome. Campbell University is a great college for me.
Sophomore,5,"Campbell University is a rigorous school that pushes students to work their very hardest. Even when the goings get tough, there are multiple tutoring services and professors openly announce their office hours. Campbell is located in a small, safe town which is sure to make every student feel at home. Campbell University's academics are off of the chart and support every degree's needs."
Freshman,5,It has such a nice campus and everyone is SOOO friendly! I met so many people and had an amazing time and experience. I can’t wait to continue my education there in the fall!
Senior,5,"Attending Campbell University has been a great experience. Coming from a predominately black area, I wanted to show that I could hang at a PWI. I am coming up on my senior year, and I can say that I have made it thru with God's help. The school work is challenging, but the lessons you learn go far beyond the classroom. You begin to see the classroom learning show up in the real world. Being a business major, I especially see this, as I have learned that every decision made is essentially made due to comparative advantage."
Freshman,5,Perfect school! Love the size and environment on campus! Everyone is so friendly and it's easy to see this school as a second home.
Graduate Student,5,"My experience with Campbell has been wonderful! I completed my bachelor in psychology online and blended and I am so glad I chose this University. All the professors were excellent and always here to answer any questions. Even if I was not always on campus because I was doing the blended program or I was online, I felt part of Campbell University! It is like home! If you are looking for a school and you are wondering if Campbell is the right choice, don’t wait! It is the best choice!"
Junior,5,Wonderful campus and great people/staff. I love going here and all the classes are fun and educational.
Sophomore,5,"I have recently applied to Campbell University as a transfer student. Upon applying, the staff has been extremely helpful and has provided with an exceptional amount of assistance. The staff was very quick with response to emails and also sent a text to my phone notifying me that I was accepted. The school has gone above and beyond my expectations so far and I look forward to achieving my education goals with them."
Sophomore,5,i’m enjoying my experience here as i’m a sophomore now. i love everything about this school. it’s beautiful the people are so kind.
Graduate Student,5,I have just been accepted into their Medical School.  The staff are wonderful and care about the students.  The facilities are beautiful and the labs are new and modern.
Freshman,5,"I love that Campbell is local for me and has such a relaxed environment. I really enjoy being able to openly express my Christian faith and find others that do the same. I have had a few professors that I do like, but there are also some that do not tickle my fancy. Some of them really do express the Christian faith that Campbell represents. But the ones that do not can be rude about it and not allow it to be communicated in the class room. Overall my experience here has been great and I would recommend it to anyone!!"
Freshman,5,Gorgeous campus! I really feel at home on campus and everyone is so friendly and goes above and beyond for the students
Freshman,5,"I love the ""home"" atmosphere that Campbell gives off. It feels like a community and not just a place that you go to classes at. I enjoy the people here and the professors are easy to get along. The professors are easy to work with and talk to. They are willing to help you in any way possible. All in all, this is my dream school."
Freshman,5,My name is Adrianna Young. I am a freshman at Campbell University. Campbell is an amazing university. There are so many opportunities to get to know others and get involved religiously. The learning environment is one of the best places that is comfortable and caring.
Freshman,5,Campbell university is beautiful on the inside and outside. The staff care about and put students first. They also offer a lot of opportunities to get a start on your future. The only thing I don't like is the amount of time it takes you on the phone before you can ask one question.
Niche User,5,It is a great school my mom went there and it has grown from the beginning. Before it was a school now it’s a college
Freshman,5,"Campbell University has great academic courses, that cover everything you need to know about your major. The teachers are very active and help students ut when they need it. The campus is a very nice campus and everything is near each other so, you do not have to walk very far."
Junior,5,"Campbell University provides a friendly environment and it also allows students to make connections quickly. Staff are always willing to help and there are several services that college students might need during their time in at Campbell University. The professors are friendly, understanding and want their students to succeed in their classes. Lastly, there are many events going around campus that give students the opportunity to gain extra credit for their classes."
Senior,5,"I attended Campbell University from 2015-2017. I believe that Campbell offers an extraordinary value for what you get in return. It’s professors and support staff are of top notch quality. They will bend over backwards to ensure you understand the material. Moreover, they invest every ounce of effort possible to ensure you do well academically. Although Campbell isn’t well known outside of the South, their programs are designed to maximize the potential of every student while, at the same time, safeguarding the integrity of the field of study. If you want an academic program that will equip you with every tool you need to be successful, strongly consider Campbell University."
Graduate Student,5,I love Campbell University. I really became an independent person living in Buies Creek. I formed lasting relationships with the professors and other students.  I was also involved with a fraternity which was added during my undergraduate experience.  This added to the student life with socials and sporting events.
Freshman,5,"Campbell is a University where being kind is a value that distinguishes their students from the rest. It is a small school that really cares about each student, which is hard to find at larger universities. Every staff member I’ve met has been willing to assist me without hesitation. Overall, I’d recommend this school to anyone I encounter."
Freshman,5,The campus is small and beautiful. The atmosphere is that of a community and it  is hard no to get involved with stuff around campus. The academics and sports are very good along woth the food and housing.
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Campbell. I will be a junior this upcoming year and have loved the time I have spent there so far. Everyone (teachers, students, etc.) are so friendly and willing to help."
Senior,5,"Everyone at Campbell University, whether it be professors or students, are extremely helpful and friendly. School is very family oriented and focused on helping the community."
Niche User,5,"There are a few things that I like about Campbell. The first thing I like about is the place it is located at. There is not much around there, but there is so much to do on campus that you do not need to leave to go anywhere. I do like all the activities that they have for the students to get involved in. I also like how that have everything that I am interested in studying in. A thing that needs to change is placement of some location. For example, I love chick fil a but it is located in the school store and everyone on campus loves chick fil a too and that is where everyone goes. If they moved certain place, like chick fil a, or even a class that I am taking then it would be a lot easier to maneuver."
Graduate Student,5,Faculty goes above and beyond what they are required to do in order to assist the students and make sure their needs are met. Everyone I met was extremely friendly and willing to go out of their way to assist me.
Freshman,5,I’m an out of state student who grew up in a small town it was hard to let go and move on to something I wasn’t familiar with. Campbell staff and students make you feel at home and comfortable. Professors are there for whenever you need them especially if you need help. My biology professor literally told out class that she would come to our dorms when a group of us needed help studying. Professors actually want to see you succeed. I’m also a first generation student and I want the best for my siblings because they’re going to look up to me and ask me what life was like for me in college. I’m the one who’s going to be there for them when their time comes. I absolutely love Campbell and I would recommend it to anybody who’s looking for a school to actually help them succeed to the place where they want to be.
Sophomore,4,"I love that my school is like a big family. The key word I would use to describe Campbell is ""community"" because everyone here is welcoming. I feel at home here."
Junior,4,"Although a small campus, Campbell University has lots of opportunities for students. The class sizes are small which allows for help one on one from the professors. You get to know your peers and classmates well in which you can create study groups and learn from each other. Social wise, Campbell University has several campus traditions that brings the student body together and really makes our school feel like home."
Junior,4,"During the transition to online teaching due to COVID, the professors did really well with quickly changing over to a virtual system. It took a while to get adjusted but after a few days it became the new normal. Most of the teachers go out of their way to supply you with the extra resources that elaborate on what is being instructed in class."
Junior,4,"I’ve enjoyed my overall experience at Campbell University! I started in the spring semester which made getting involved more challenging than my previous experience with another college; however, all the faculty were very welcoming and helpful!"
Junior,4,"I did not originally register for online courses; however, with the covid outbreak Campbell University  transitioned to online learning the backhalf of the spring semester. The professors did an amazing job with this shift and were very accommodating!"
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the small class sizes that Campbell University has to offer and the one on one learning experience in the classroom.
Sophomore,4,"Campbell has enlisted many well respected professors. I have only had a bad run in with one professor each semester. Life on campus is always active, open, and inviting. The school prioritizes student involvement and community and it really shows on their campus.
Overall, my experience with Campbell has been positive. I have met many wonderful people, and have benefited from their academic assistance tremendously. They care deeply about their students - and have many options for tutoring, peer mentoring, and other ways of providing students the ability to better their grades and help them succeed.
I only provided 4/5 stars because while the school does have many wonderful characteristics about it, the small minor details, such as building maintenance and facility upkeep is rather poor. The university has provided many new buildings in recent years, but have not done well in up keeping their older buildings, such as the aquatic center and Kivett Hall."
Sophomore,4,"Campbell University is a great school for all majors, however the medical majors and pathways are the best. They prepare students for graduate school and further. The school teaches us to live a life through service. However, the school does need more opportunities for student life."
Sophomore,4,"Campbell is a great place to make friends within your degree and the extra curricular events you chose to take part in. If you try to reach out to the professors, they do their best to meet you half way with the issues you bring up to them!"
Senior,4,"Leading through Christ and learning through public service. Campbell University has enhanced my love for Christ and learning. I have been blessed enough to call Campbell ""my happy place."" Everyone is friendly and kind. I have made friends for life."
Freshman,4,"It was a great tour with very nice facilities, especially the new freshmen girl dorm. I also appreciated the size of the campus and feel like I could walk to classes without any trouble. My one complaint is the lack of shade/shelter as it would suck in the heat and rain."
Sophomore,4,"Campbell University is a smaller school with a lot of great opportunities and people.  Although I did not have the best first year, I am excited to better myself and my education this coming up 2019-2020 year.  The professors are a miss or hit when it comes to who is good and who you want to avoid.  I really enjoy the opportunities and resources Campbell provides for their students."
Freshman,4,I will be attending Campbell University for the next 4-years. I just love how much there is to do on campus and all the activites I can be involved in. How college makes you feel like you have reached a stage of knowing before adulthood.
Freshman,4,"Well I don't move in my dorm until August but I will say its a pretty awesome college full of bright minds, students and teachers alike."
Senior,4,They offer a robust online curriculum that is accessible for adult education and online learning. The program offerings are vast and the office of Adult Online Education works hard with students to ensure their success.
Junior,4,"I transferred to Campbell from North Carolina A&T University. The biggest difference between the two is diversity. I am an African American student and here at Campbell, majority of the student population is Caucasian. I would say the campus is a lot more peaceful than my previous university also! The staff and professors are just as helpful; being that Campbell is considered a small university. The transition has been smooth and I am glad I made the move."
Senior,4,"Campbell University is a small but rapidly growing school, with some really amazing professors and solid programs offered. However, what really holds back this school from being a perfect five stars would be the price to attend this university, with the cost rising its becoming very difficult to continue attending class here. Because of this I can see the price holding back many people from wanting to come here and even cause some already here to drop out or transfer due to high cost. But, the small campus environment, the amazing educators, and the future amenities make Campbell University an amazing place to pursue an education."
Sophomore,4,I have been Campbell for the past year and a half. I am mainly online and have a had such a great experience with them so far!
Freshman,4,They are very religious but have good programs. you will learn things in classes. It take time to get used to and there are many required classes for everyone. Three of them are on religion and you have to take them so be prepared.
Sophomore,4,My experience at Campbell has been great. The class sizes are not too small and also not too big. All my teachers have  known my name which I really like because it makes me feel like they really care. The only thing that I would change would have to probably be the location because there isn't much too do close to campus.
Junior,4,"I'm a junior attending Campbell University for my BS in Clinical Research. Campbell's program is outstanding. The professors that care about the students make up for the ones that don't. No program is perfect and you will always find riffs in life, however, you must learn to roll with the punches. The tension is high at this school. It is felt by everyone this semester. But I feel that it is worth being with Campbell because at the end of the day, I bleed Orange. I love the staff in the Registers Office and even though Mr. Girt is gone they always make me feel like I'm at home. Nothing but love and honesty always, because the staff there cares about every students success."
Junior,4,"I like the community and how beautiful the campus is. I like the many resources and programs this university has, but I wish the location was closer to the city."
Sophomore,4,"You'll never find a university that cares about not only the students but the culture of the area, it truly embraces the culture of Harnett County."
Freshman,4,I am a new student at Campbell University and so far my experience is going great! I am looking forward to continuing my education with Campbell!
Freshman,4,"My overall experience at Campbell University is  excellent , my major is biology to become a future pharmacist . Campbell has a variety of pre programs ,and one of them are Pre Pharmacy in which i’m in . The Pre Pharmacy program helps prepare me for the journious future i have ahead of me ."
Senior,4,"Campbell University is a good place to get your degree in the social sciences. The teachers are fun and helpful and explain the subjects you'll be taking in great detail. The university  is small but currently expanding, so classes aren't far apart from each other like NC State. Other places to note such as the Library will have all the resources you'll need for your topic papers. However if you are dependent on financial aid or scholarships to pay tuition then good luck."
Junior,4,"A small, quaint college town that is an emerging leader in its academics. But unlike most universities, our roots are located in serving others in need. Hence, we strive for the highest of quality while serving those in need."
Junior,4,"Campbell University has a character that distinguishes itself from any other mid-sized university. The professors are welcoming and are willing to go out of their way to make sure that you are getting the best possible education, especially within the Lundy-Fetterman School of Business. Campbell makes you feel like they truly want to invest in you as a person, not just as a student, and put time into helping you grow both spiritually and academically. Even as a non-religious student, I felt welcomed on the campus and accepted for my personal beliefs, despite Campbell's status as a Baptist Christian university. While the party scene is basically non-existent and the campus is dry, it is still a fun school to attend and students get very excited for some of the bigger school and sporting events. As a rising-junior, I always look forward to the start of the academic year and becoming more involved in the Buies Creek culture."
Sophomore,4,Campbell University has a very diverse group of people and a tremendous amount of options. It is easy to explore many different pathways that they offer. Campbell University is a small campus which gives off more of a “homey” or “family” environment. You can spot the president around campus saying hi to students and you may even spot him in the dining hall.
Senior,4,Great school. You really see yourself grow and become the person your are meant to be when you are there
Sophomore,4,"What I like most about campbell is the advisors always giving you information on internships for your future career,"
Graduate Student,4,"An excellent school for people who appreciate a quiet environment. Friendly, family-oriented atmosphere with pleasant teachers and multiple student organizations. What it lacks in entertainment outside the school it more than makes up for with various on-campus activities."
Sophomore,4,"Campbell is a great school. All of the professors are extremely nice and friendly, they will help you with just about anything you need if you are kind and patient. The campus is very good close proximity and great food on campus"
Niche User,4,"Campbell university is a relatively small, private college. It is located in buise creek, North Carolina. It is known for its business program but offers a wide variety of majors. It is on the pricey side compared to most public colleges but is a smaller one on one feel with the professors. The campus is amazing and not outdated at all. Campbell is perfect for someone who does not want the crazy hustle and bustle of normal colleges."
Senior,4,"Overall at Campbell University, I have had a great and joyful experience. They provided a close family relationship among one another and made my college experience amazing.  However, just like any university it does have a few down sides in terms of a lack of facilities to accommodate its growth. With that in mind, I believe that Campbell is the place for anyone that enjoys a close knit environment but is also ready to see growth and expansion beyond your wildest dreams."
Freshman,4,"This is my first year in college and I just finished my first semester with lots of great memories and lessons. Even as a commuter, it's still a transition from high school to college, and Campbell was able to help me make the transition very simply and easily. Most of my professors were really good, and the student activities I was able to participate in were very fun! I've learned and gained some new responsibilities throughout this first half of the year which I believe I'll be able to carry with me throughout the rest of my college career and life."
Graduate Student,4,New facilities are great and everyone is nice and loves to help you out. The downside is that being a Baptist school it's a dry campus.
Junior,4,"I'm an athlete at Campbell and overall I've enjoyed my time here so far.  Most of the professors I've had will do a lot to help you, although some can be pains (but you'll find that anywhere).  The university offers a free tutoring service for a variety of subjects which comes in handy.  As far as campus life and such, it is very much a commuter campus and lots of people leave on the weekends.  But for those that do stay, the school always has athletic or social events going on.  The party scene really depends on how many people stay for the weekend and the weather.  While there is nothing really immediately around campus, it's not too bad to drive to Raleigh or one of its suburbs for some food and entertainment.  Overall, I like the school.  It's small, and the people are very sweet no matter who you are."
Alum,4,Smaller school that is growing. Love the unique mascot. Had small class sizes for my major. Lots of scholarships.
Sophomore,4,"Choosing Campbell University was a decision that I continuously feel better and better about. As an out-of-state student, the transition of moving to North Carolina was difficult, but Campbell faculty and staff made the transition so much smoother than anticipated. Even though Campbell is technically a Baptist university, they still made everyone feel included no matter what religion they associate with. The professors and faculty are all very welcoming, and are always open to students coming to them with any questions or concerns. The university also provides a great support system for students, both within the Campus Ministry and Student Services, in an effort to ensure that all Campbell Students feel content with their experience here at Campbell. Overall, I would have to recommend this university to anyone who is considering furthering their education in North Carolina."
Freshman,4,"They have a nice campus and very nice people. It is not very diverse, mostly just a couple groups. They have a lot of helpful resources though. Not that big of  a campus so its not a lot of walking."
Sophomore,4,"I personally love Campbell University, I enjoy the small campus. Although there is not much to do, its quite easy to make friends with the students on campus. Sometimes the dining hall has good food choices on a good day. Since the class sizes are fairly mall, students are able to connect with the professors on a much deeper level. Around campus, they are always adding on which is a good sign of growth within the university. Campbell University actually cares for you as a person and who you are becoming."
Sophomore,4,Small school with a big personality. Everyone is so helpful but the school can be slow to answer emails or phone calls.
Sophomore,4,"Fantastic school which is very small, exceptionally friendly, and has good teachers. Has very high costs, however."
Senior,4,"Campbell University provides it’s students with a quality education with Christian values. While the education is high quality, there are not many eating establishments to choose from. The town of Buies Creek is consumed by Campbell University but there are only five eating establishments in the whole town."
Sophomore,4,"I think that Campbell University is a good school to attend, under certain circumstances. The private Baptist University located in the south has many great majors to offer students from all over the nation plus."
Niche User,4,They have beautiful scenery. The staff is very welcoming. The dorms are amazing and spacious.It was an exciting experience on Accepted Students' day.
Freshman,4,Campbell University is a great school and the staff and people are nice. I think that Campbell could be better if they include more social activity of different culture and made every aspect of Campbell University diverse.
Freshman,4,I absolutely love Campbell University. I feel very safe on and off campus. Classes are small so your professor gets to know you on a personal level and all are very willing to help you. There are also a lot of resources to use to help you academically. Campbell is growing and to hold more majors. Love the Christian atmosphere and the fact that everyone is very kind and willing to help you in whatever way they can. Some of the facilities are older but the school is working on updating the facilities. Like I said before love this school!
Sophomore,4,Campbell gives you numerous opportunities to get involved with your major and the people around you. The school encourages you to strive to become a better person academically and socially. I would recommend this school to everyone. 
Sophomore,4,"Campbell University is a small private college located in Buies Creek, North Carolina.  It is a fairly secluded campus, free from many distractions of universities in major cities.  Campbell offers a diversity of degrees to choose from and provides it via classroom, online, or distance education on remote campuses.  I have always received excellent support from faculty and staff.  I highly recommend Campbell University to someone looking for a close-knit student body."
College Junior,4,There is plenty of help when it comes to job seeking and placement.
College Junior,4,I attend online mostly so I am not completely aware of the athletic portion of the school.
College Sophomore,4,"Based upon the sporting events I've attended, I'd have to say that they are a fun way for everyone to be involved and have a great time!"
Recent Alumnus,4,Most classes range from 30-40 students. Very intimate classrooms.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Campbell has very strict dorm rules. The opposite sex is not allowed in dorm for long periods of time and must sign in. Dorm rooms have room checks twice a semester. Best dorm: Burkot, Worst: Baldwin. Every dorm has a lobby with TV's and lounging areas."
Recent Alumnus,4,Im not a part of Greek life but i have friends that are and that love it.
College Freshman,4,Division 1 but small school
College Junior,4,"I'm sure bad things happen (just as in anywhere else), but to my knowledge everything and everyone feel very safe."
College Junior,4,"I attend the extended Campbell campus aboard Camp Lejeune, NC and the staff is always eager to help, the professors always passionate about what they teach, and the material to be appropriately challenging."
Sophomore,2,"Because of the global pandemic, some of my classes are online which I do not like. I personally find it difficult to learn this way whether or not the professors are doing a good job. Assignments and quizzes are very difficult for me to complete because technology can be quite confusing for all of us."
Freshman,2,"You pay way to much for what you actually get. The dorms have mold in them, the food was undercooked at Marsh. They also got a horrible food ratings, and the only good dining hall had bad hours. Everything closed early and the gym was small nothing like other schools. The teachers I encounter lie (thats not the case for all) and they don't give their students the best resources to be successful. You also need to watch financial aid and the business office."
Senior,2,There is a good bit racism and favoritism among professors at Campbell University. Also there is a lack of concern with students who are not athletes. The only good thing is their ROTC program
Alum,2,"Located in a small country town, about 30 minutes from Raleigh, NC. I would have to say that depending on the degree type it isn't worth attending for the price. Go to a state school."
College Sophomore,2,The night life sucks. Everyone either goes off campus to drink in circles in a neighborhood or to a bar/restaurant filled with forty year old locals and drunks. The people that stay on campus don't go outside and don't do anything at all.
College Sophomore,2,"it's a total bust! Everyone here goes to a local neighborhood and stands in the streets or in homes in circles and crowds and drinks until they pass out. It's practically a depression group gathering, and if they aren't there then they go to this local restaurant that becomes a half bar place and hangout for all the local drunks and elders that are trying to hook up with the barely legal girls at the school. On top of that there isn't many girls that go there anyways so it ends up being a crowded fuss of drunken horny old men or reckless male students and the pass around girls."
College Sophomore,2,"im not really going to rate the Greek-life of Campbell, i dont hold frats and such in a very high light. in my experiences ive never heard of a frat doing good for its members or others. and the small good they may occasional do doesn't hide the shady and many wrong doings that occur due to there presence. while Campbell Greek-life is not terrible they still have there own issues and problems throughout the years."
College Freshman,2,Campbell is terrible at every sport and our fan base reflects that.  Football games is the most attended sport there and it can't even fill the stands
College Sophomore,2,"I hate this school, and I'm stuck here. Its unorganized and although the advisers are very good, the people working in other offices are not kind or helpful. I chose to go to school here because of location and because of the scholarship I received, also the campus is very pretty. But now I wish I had gone somewhere else. I'm a biology major with a minor and music, and although the music program is fabulous, the biology program is not kind to students. The work load is heavy and unfair. The professors are pretty terrible. In a lot of my classes I feel like I don't amount up to anything because I work as hard as I possibly can and I still don't succeed. Also I've had several teachers treat me with disrespect. This school is unorganized and unreasonably difficult to work with. Don't come here for undergraduate studies."
College Freshman,2,I wouldn't choose Campbell if I had a chance to do it all over again. The price for the school is too much and you can't get many scholarships. The rules about opposite sex is dorms are slightly ridiculous. My time is limited to see my friends which I don't think is fair. The dorms are very outdated and some are not very clean. A shower in my dorm stayed dirty for over a week and no one did anything about it. I was told that they clean the bathrooms more than once a week but I'm guessing that's not true. The administration are VERY old fashion and strict about things that most colleges wouldn't be strict about. Transportation is a big issue. Everything is 10 minted away and if you don't have a car you can't get to it. The food on campus is not very good at all and marshbanks isn't clean. There are very few food options unless you have a car to drive to them. Most things are over priced. I currently don't have a roommate and just wanted to switch rooms and it would have cost me $700. I really wish I would have spent more time researching Campbell before I came. This is not the place to be if you want actual freedom and you want a real college experience. They try to have campus activities but not many people show up to them.  The good thing about Campbell is that the teachers are very helpful and want you to succeed.
College Junior,2,Not many options within close distance. Often have to eat at the same places. No student discounts.
College Junior,2,Meal plan hours need to be 24 hour. Hours for dining options need to be increased. Often there is not a place open for people to eat if it is a weekend or holiday. The food is not great quality.
College Junior,2,The dorms are not of great quality. There is one high-quality freshman dorm. The RAs and RDs attempt to have programs to increase social atmosphere but they don't often have high student attendance. The cost to live on campus is ridiculous. The dorms are all very close to classes which is convenient. If you live on campus you have to have a very expensive meal plan.
College Freshman,2,"it is just now starting up, so it is understandable that it won't be that good"
College Sophomore,2,"Being that Campbell is a private and wealthy school, most students believe they'll get financial aid. However, I know many students who are struggling to get financial aid and scholarships from the school. Most students I know who have transferred did so because of the cost at Campbell, and the inability to continue paying for it. As for my personal experience with financial aid at Campbell, it has not been good. This is my second year at Campbell and I will NOT be coming back. I had help with my dad's GI Bill this year and last year. However, it ends at the beginning of Fall 2015, leaving me to find new ways to pay for Campbell's tuition. I was told by my Adviser to go and try to find out how much I could get from Financial Aid. When I did, the woman was not helpful at all. She told me I could take out a pell grant, and she kept repeating herself every time I would ask a question. For example, I asked her ""Are there any scholarships from Campbell that I could apply for?"" Her: ""Yes, there's Campbell's biggest scholarship, but you can't apply for it until April. You can always take out a student loan or the pell grant."" (This deadline is not fair considering the fact that if I had to transfer, which I am, if I relied on the deadline and the slim chance of winning this scholarship, I wouldn't give myself enough time or the fair chance to get accepted to another school). Me: ""Thank you, but my parents and I don't want to have to take out any loans or use the pell grant. Is there anything else I could do?"" Her: ""Let me see...Well, you could always take out a loan."" I honestly got no where with her, and the appointment did not last even ten minutes before I gave up. This woman was polite and kind, but she didn't make me feel like Campbell wanted me to stay. It was during this appointment that I made the hard decision to transfer schools. I didn't feel important, the way that I had felt when I was first accepted to Campbell."
College Student,2,I usually have to drive further away to get a good place.
College Student,2,Have to drive ten minutes to get to anything
College Student,2,"It is a lot cheaper to live off-campus, but the process you have to go through to get approved is a head-ache. There also is not that many off-campus options."
College Student,2,"The parking lots are extremely tight, many vehicles get hit."
College Student,2,"Most food places on campus are very unsanitary. There is not a lot of options, you feel like you are eating the same things over and over again."
College Sophomore,2,It's a Christian school so it is a dry campus and if you get caught you get fined.
College Sophomore,2,There are barely any restaurants around us and they are not very healthy.
College Junior,2,Everyone goes home on the weekends. The party scene could be much better
College Junior,2,Greek life just started within the last 2 years so it is not very developed on campus
College Freshman,2,There is not much going on off campus
College Sophomore,2,"Love the school, feel like some classes are a waste"
College Sophomore,2,You got to be ready to do some sneaking around
College Sophomore,2,Try to find other food than campus
College Sophomore,2,Greek life just got started. Many of the Greeks are viewed as obnoxious by Non-Greeks. Greek life hasn't really done anything that has significantly impacted the community and campus.
College Senior,2,Campbell is in the middle of nowhere. You would want to live in one of the cities near the school for any kind of city life.
College Senior,2,"There is no off-campus housing near Campbell. It is probably the only school that I have been too that has very FEW selections in apartments that are available near campus, and you cannot get a hold of the staff to get information."
College Freshman,2,"There are no public transportation on or around campus. The nearest cities like Raleigh and Fayetteville are about 30 - 45 minutes away from Buies Creek. If you don't have friend to help you with transportation, you are going to be stuck on campus."
College Junior,2,Greek life has just been introduced this school year and has not included wide range of fraternities and sororities for every ethnic group and academic group.
College Junior,2,It's in the middle of nowhere.  There isn't even a movie theater in Harnett County
College Junior,2,There are a few sports bars in Lillington. You'll have to go to Raleigh to bar hop.
College Freshman,2,"Definitely not the best food in the world, but it's tolerable."
College Freshman,2,New program; just getting started.
College Freshman,2,"No one has helped me, i would love to be a pharmacist but if i dont have the advisors help i wont get anywhere because they assign classes ect."
College Sophomore,2,Internet is fine...when it works.
College Freshman,2,I don't let it bother me.  I believe they  can do their thing and I can do mine and I don't have to interact with them unless I choose to.
College Senior,2,We basically just have fast food restaurants and it takes about 10-15 minutes to get to one. If you want to go to a nice restaurant you have to go to raleigh (about 45 minutes)
College Senior,2,The nightlife at campbell is pretty non-existent. There are not many bars near campus and students must drink in off campus houses or drive to Raleigh (about 45 minutes) to go out. 
College Senior,2,"Campbell is a very strict school. There is a no tolerance drinking and drug policy both on and off campus. Quiet hours in the dorms are from 10pm-10am and are pretty strictly enforced in most dorms. There are ""open house hours"" from 6pm-12am every night and that is the only time that boys can be in girls dorms and vice versa, and the guest must sign in in the lobby and leave an id. "
College Senior,2,If you do not have a car on campus or don't have a friend with a car on campus then there is no way that you are ever going to be able to leave and go anywhere. the nearest store or restaurant is 7-10 miles away so a car is crucial. 
College Senior,2,The network at Campbell is not very reliable at all. It goes out on a fairly regular basis and is liable to be out from several hours up to several days. 
College Sophomore,2,It's a Christian University in a small town 40 - 50 miles to Raliegh
College Junior,2,"The options outside of the dining hall are decent, but limited and you get pressed for a new taste in your mouth after eating the same thing for weeks. The dining hall hasn't done well with their sanitation grade, but the food is decent on a good day."
College Junior,2,"Dry campus and a drug free campus, so if caught you will be in trouble. Visitation rules are getting better you can visit anyone's dorm between the hours of 6pm-12pm...on campus apartments, however, aren't strict at all as long as you aren't being stupid."
College Freshman,2,We recently are starting up Greek Life here so cannot completely say how much it will develop within the upcoming year.
College Freshman,2,There are not many places to choose from though student discounts are given for particular restaurants. Although everything is kind of far away so it's a rush to get food and come back to school in time.
College Freshman,2,Most buildings are far apart so you have to walk in the rain and its cold. 
College Junior,2,"We need a new student union on campus.  Ours is pathetic to say the least.  Maybe if it was improved, people would be more inclined to stay on campus over the weekends.  "
College Junior,2,Most of the time things go smoothly for me.  
College Junior,2,"It's a little difficult to find anyone who doesn't want to talk about religion and/or politics in a narrow-minded fashion.  The interests of the population don't seem very broad-ranging, which can often be boring.  There are exceptions of course, and those I am aware of are some of my dearest friends.  "
College Junior,2,"I have a commuter sticker, so I can park almost anywhere.  The main commuter lot is behind the building where I spend most of my time, so it's ultra-convenient...unless they close it off for an event.  It would be GREAT if we could get a parking deck behind the Convocation Center and one behind Lundy-Fetterman Business School/Taylor-Bott-Rogers Fine Arts Building.  "
College Sophomore,2,"I've yet to work an internship after attending Campbell, however, I am currently working with the Athletics Marketing & Promotions department and love it.  The pay is less than ideal, but I am doing what I love."
College Sophomore,2,"Campbell is very unorganized.  You must see at least 5 different people to have one conflict solved.  The professors are great and willing to help out in any possible.  The problem, however, is that the university is so unorganized that hardly anyone knows how to get things done."
College Sophomore,2,"For the amount I pay, I should be living alongside President Obama in the White House."
College Sophomore,2,"The nightlife is fair, assuming you're into the whole late night study session thing.  There is one club/bar within 30 miles."
College Sophomore,2,"As a varsity athlete, I am not impressed with the support from other students.  The vast majority of the student population resides to their hometowns on the weekends."
Sophomore,1,"I hate this place , all they care about is money. They have employees that get worked into the ground while the administration makes huge checks and bonuses . Stay away from this place"
Sophomore,1,"Campus safety gives out predatory parking tickets and love doing it, this place is very greedy to be a self proclaimed Christian school. Parking enforcement sit and watch people to give very expensive tickets. This place is a joke!"
College Freshman,1,If you're not an athlete or know athletes or pgmers you aren't going to know about parties athletes throw all of the parties
College Freshman,1,It blows the only place to go is the county seat and even that is hit or miss.  The worst part about it is that they have a monopoly on the damn place
College Freshman,1,it is not very diverse.  I am one of the few atheists here and I hate being here because of the fake religion i see around here.  But everybody is also very accepting of me and minorities
College Freshman,1,"The Greek life blows.  People only join because they want to be like a big school, its all snobby douchebags nobody really hangs out with them. they don't throw parties or anything they're just a group of spoiled rich kids."
College Freshman,1,"All that the school cares about is your money, they don't care about their students in any way shape or form."
College Sophomore,1,There is really no greek life on the campus and they are very cliquish
College Freshman,1,"Parking tickets are VERY over-issued and over-priced. With as much as tuition costs, we should be able to park in a spot for 15 minutes without recieving a ticket. Visitation hours are also ridiculous, with persons of the opposite sex only allowed into the dorms between the hours of 6pm and midnight. This makes it difficult to do simple things such as go study in a quiet place or have lunch someplace other than the cafeteria with friends. We are adults, and restricing when we can see our friends is absolutely ludicrous."
College Student,1,The school is way to strict on petty things that other universities would not even take the time to address.
College Freshman,1,"No boys or girls can sleep over at your dorm, out by 12."
College Freshman,1,It's so new that we only have like two or three total
College Freshman,1,This is the middle of nowhere.  20 minute drive to just walmart.
College Student,1,They only do what is best for the college not you.
College Student,1,I was never told about off-campus housing.
College Senior,1,"There is hardly any off-campus dining. No starbucks, no buffalo wild wings. Nothing that screams college campus."
College Sophomore,1,"It's raining one second, then sunny the next."
College Sophomore,1,"People don't stay here unless they get married and have kids right after college. It's sort of like getting stuck. People don't stay for long, though."
College Sophomore,1,"They are ill deserving of any special treatment but, they don't think so."
College Sophomore,1,"If you don't fit the cookie cutter mold, have fun being a token friend and standing out."
College Sophomore,1,You don't have a car? You're stranded.
College Freshman,1,no wireless have to use ethernet cord.
College Freshman,1,No public transportation. If you don't have a care or know someone who has a car then your SOL
College Sophomore,1,The school is very expensive!!!
College Sophomore,1,"There are absolutely no transportation options, if you do not have your own car...find friends that do or you are just S.O.L!"
College Sophomore,1,"Campbell is in Buies Creek, NC. The students are the majority of the population"
College Sophomore,1,We have no night life...we are a private christian school with a plethora of restrictions.
College Freshman,1,"If you are living on campus the only options to get to places off campus is either walking/biking the 10 miles or having a car. if you don't have  a car it is more likely you won't waste your money
"
College Freshman,1,totally dead unless at the grill or in the lobby
College Junior,1,There is no public transportation.  
College Junior,1,"The international diversity is the most noticeable.  We have a lot of students from India and other countries in that region.  We have several from Australia and others from places like Sweden.  The campus is Baptist based, and therefore openly very conservative.  The result is this odd sense of denial regarding the diversity of the population on campus.  An example is the attitude toward varying religious backgrounds; I think I have encountered as many atheists and agnostics (all good people) as I have Baptists or Methodists or whatever.  Also, many students seem to prefer to pretend that the LGBT presence on campus is non-existent.  However, recently some students have organized a Gay-Straight Alliance, which is excellent.  "
College Junior,1,"The main haunts, from what I can tell are Cookout in Dunn, Bojangles in Lillington, Mi Casita in Lillington, County Seat in Lillington, and local favorite Sunny Skies Ice Cream, home of Cold Sweat and Exit Wound flavours.  "
College Junior,1,"The main bar near campus is County Seat.  College night and weekends are pretty good there.  We have one other sports bar that I've never been to on a busy night, but they have fantastic food for decent prices.  Any other night life/bar/club scenes you have to drive to Raleigh which is almost an hour away.  THAT is where you get the real variety.  The two-star rating is not quality, it's quantity near the campus.  "
College Sophomore,1,"AWFUL.  The wireless internet rarely works.  The internet in the classrooms is better, but fails to load over half of the time.  Ethranet is just as bad."
College Freshman,1,"If you don't have a career on campus or  friends that drive, then your life will be miserable."
College Freshman,1,Only transportation provided is to/from the airport
College Sophomore,1,There's no way to get around the fact that the food sucks.
College Junior,1,Campbell is pretty strict. If you do anything that goes against school policy you are likely to get caught and there will be repercussions.
College Sophomore,1,"No public transportation!!!!!!!!! You have to have a car because the nearest anything is 6 to 12 miles away. There are no buses, no trains, planes, or any way to get around. They allow you to bring a bike on campus, but there is no where to go on your bike other than from building to building on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"I came to Campbell specifically because there was no Greek life, but next year (2013-2014) they are going to start adding some. So, I give this an F. If you are looking for a good, small school that is Greek life-free, Campbell will not be the school to pick."
College Freshman,1,"I wish there was more around campus but all that is here is the school. There are a few mom and pop shops but nothing major. A Walmart and a Lowes Hardware are about a 10 or 15 minute drive away. Raleigh and Durham are about an hour away. There is a lot to do there. There is not a whole lot of school spirit, but there is potential; our football team is new. Safety has not been an issue here. There are plenty of clubs to get involved in. The only huge negative is the surrounding area of the school is pretty empty and boring."
College Sophomore,1,There has been robberies on and off campus. My friends car was broken into this year and campus security was no where to be found other than sleeping in the library lobby. It's sad.
College Sophomore,1,"Nightlife at Campbell includes off campus parties, walking around campus, movie night, skateboarding, box hockey, and relaxing inside a lobby or dorm room. There aren't many clubs in the area, so most students take a trip to Raleigh, NC or Fayetville. You have to have a vehicle in order to experience true nightlife as a college student at Campbell."
College Freshman,1,there arent many things to do at night unless your involved in a club .
College Freshman,1,they have no transportation most of the time students ride with theire peers and it also is a very rural area so majority of the students have cars whethere they are a freshmanor not.
College Sophomore,1,"You absolutely need a car. The only shuttle takes you to the bus station, train station, and airport. Some majors have events off campus and may provide little transport to event and back to school  but that is it. nothing else"
College Senior,1,There is no transportation provided by Campbell University.
College Sophomore,1,"Small Campus – Since Campbell University has a small campus there is no need for transportation to go to classes. The only problem is when someone needs something from the grocery store, there is quite a ride to the nearest Wal-Mart. So it is very inconvenient if one does not have a car."
College Junior,1,Infirmary Sucks – They almost made me sicker by giving me a prescription that was wrong. They also told my roommate who is the happiest person in the world that she was depressed...turns out she had mono....thanks for the help stupid infirmary. I will never go there again.
College Junior,1,Christian Environment – They are pretty strict. No drinking. No Greek life. It sucks.
College Junior,1,"Bad Service in the Financial Office – Had to work on my own financial application,regardless of seeking help from employee who works as an financial advisor"
College Sophomore,1,"Fast Food – There's only fast food around my campus because I go to school on a military base. There's not enough dining places that are close, sad to say."
College Freshman,1,"Not Convenient – Parking for the boys is less convenient than for the girls, we don't have that many lots near us"
College Sophomore,1,Nazi Prison Camp for on-Campus – It doesn't even feel like college sometimes becasue you have the school watching over you like a protective parent
College Freshman,1,"A Waste of Money – At over $30,000, Campbell University is a big disappointment and waste of money. The dorms are small and dingy. My hall (Kichin),was for freshman and had no Resident Director and chaos reigned. The campus is patrolled by campus police, county sheriffs, highway patrol and give tickets all day long. There is no place for fun or relaxation. The atmosphere is depressing when compared to other campuses I've seen. There are few places to eat and no cafeteria. The food for sale is expensive and dorm kitchens are rundown (our microwave was broken).  The housekeeping staff has keys to your room where magically your shoes and electronics get stolen!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Policy Enforcement – There are to be NO drugs or alcohol on campus, if caught you get a write up, and possible misdemeaner.  The school is quick to jump onto innocent individuals and tell them they are guilty of breaking these rules even when it is not the case. And the local enforcment agency is just as bad. They handle the situations completely wrong. In Buies Creek, there is no innocent until proven guilty. It is simpily GUILTY. The RD's and the RA's just look to write people up for this. And student life, allows this behavior."
College Senior,1,The other transportation is to and from the airport in Raleigh.
College Sophomore,1,"Campbell is in the middle of nowhere, so there's really nowhere to go within walking distance, and Raleigh is 30m away. Unless you have a car, ride from a friend, or family nearby to pick you up, you're not going anywhere as Campbell doesn't provide transportation (I think they have golf carts, but those are used only for campus tours)"
College Junior,1,Off-Campus WHAT? Cook Out. Western Sizzler's. Yamatos. Burger King. McDonalds. Pizza Hut. Bojangles. Waffle House. Off-Campus dining options? Let's say you have a car. I suggest driving either 30 minutes up the road to Fayetteville or an hour or so up to Raleigh to enjoy QUALITY off-campus dining.
College Junior,1,"Choosing the Red Pill or the Blue Pill? The Pharmacy program at Campbell University is sub-par to say the least. You may begin to wonder why a current student that is currently enrolled in the Pharmacy programs would say such a thing about their own craft, so to speak. The reason for the aformentioned statement is as follows: the program as well as the school is only worried about how things look to the public. Once you're enrolled in the psuedo-mind state of a college campus you being to understand that ""THIS IS NOT WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR AND I WANT TO TRANSFER."" Along with signing your life away to student loans, the school doesn't nurture each student into being the best they can be. The simply pass each student along and pat them on the back. The workload for the incoming freshman, especially if you're a pharmacy major, is RIDICULOUS. Many of my friends who came into the school intending to be pharmacy majors have either switched their major or dropped out of school all together. These friends I speak of are the ones who were cum laude graduates from high school (so they are by no means bumps on a log). The professors only care about attendance moreso than if the student are actually learning any material. The professors are also snobbish and make the material harder than it should be. Some professors take the time out to actually learn about their students and help them out by that is neither here nor there.

The only positive thing the school has going for itself is that fact that it's a rather small school and the relationships/friendships you develop there will last a lifetime. If you do choose to come to this school, be prepared for a life altering experience. If you do choose to come to this school and pursue pharmacy, put away all your baggage at the door and be prepared for stress central."

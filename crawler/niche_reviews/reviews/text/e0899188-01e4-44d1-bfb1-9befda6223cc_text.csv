Freshman,5,So far Skagit valley college has been a blessing in my life. Counselors as well as teachers make sure we have everything we need to succeed and are always there to help. During the covid-19 pandemic they have been very supportive and attentive with us as students.
Freshman,5,The online experience is great and easy to use. Canvas is well organized and if we have any issues we can contact our school and receive immediate help.
Freshman,5,"i completed the running start program a skagit and had an awesome experience. nice teachers and plenty of class options... if you're self-motivated, running start can be WAY easier than high school."
Niche User,5,"With a wide range of studies to choose from, friendly, supportive, and helpful staff, a great location, and affordable tuition, I was able to attain my AA-DTA degree (Associate in Arts - Direct Transfer Agreement). Smaller class sizes make for a an approachable environment to learn in."
Freshman,5,"I'm enjoying myself being back into school to further my education, in Human Serives. 2019 was my querter attending school. really em enjoying the time and all the lovely students. It sure is nice to see a great number of students coming next querter."
Freshman,5,"Teachers and staff at the Mount Vernon Campus are excellent! I have had no issues with staff, and have had a very smooth and easy experience at this college."
Sophomore,5,"The teachers really go the extra mile in order to reach out to you when taking online classes. Normally taking online classes would be the hardest part, yet all the classes I have taken online have been very beneficial in my learning and quick access to the teachers via email or even texting when needed! The instructions were always thorough and challenging to the mind too."
Sophomore,5,"SVC provides great academic support for all students. Professors are very knowledgeble and always be with students. SVC is expert for caring students and guide them to their individual future goal, providing high quality of education and helpful resources. One thing that I suggest to SVC for better changes is to adjust the level of difficulty. It should not be different depends on the professors for the same class material."
Sophomore,5,I was always afraid of being in College because English is my second language and I was very scared when I graduated and decided to go to College but Skagit Valley College made me feel accepted and comfortable. for my skagit valley college is one of the College where they show you a lot of confidence and give you a lot of help so that you always feel very good and feel very comfortable. What I like most about skagit is that whenever you need help there are many people who can give it to you and I also like that the teachers show you a lot of respect and they are always there to help you. The only thing that I would like to change is that the students try to get more involved in the cultural clubs and show their support.
Sophomore,5,"I went to skagit for running start for two years, and now am back doing a two year medical degree. I have nothing but good things to say. The teachers are amazing and very willing to meet with you, the campus is very safe and practices safety procedures every quarter, the campus is always very clean and modern, and the food options are great with 3 different cafeterias to choose from. The only downside is the parking can sometimes be a chalenge, but arriving to school early solves that issue."
Freshman,5,I have had a great experience at Skagit Valley College. It is closely affordable and interesting. Highly recommended!
Graduate Student,5,"Skagit is a school full of happiness. It is a school that has been slowly growing up to offer incredible benefits to students to continue their schooling. Skagit has increased the number of building and classrooms. This school, in particular, makes you feel like at home. There was not a day where every staff member would pass by, smile and say good morning or have a nice day. Like all school, it had its ups and downs, and one of those downs was not having enough activities within the school. Form my own experience, I would have loved to see more festival days being celebrated in school. However, Skagit is a great school to do pre-requests and start the journey of a future."
Junior,5,"Great teachers who are willing to help a student understand information, and who are well organized. The Running Start program is also a great addition and help to high school students who want to get ahead."
Freshman,5,"The campus is easy to navigate your way around. Staff is very helpful, and caring about education and helping you the best way they can. College website is easy to navigate as well."
Sophomore,5,"Skagit, was always the college I wanted to go to. It has exceeded my expectations oh it, the staff are great, kind and very helpful. The camps is nice, very open lots of places to study. So many clubs to join. Their is always new event and activities. A lot of volunteer opportunities."
Alum,5,"I attended Skagit as a Running Start student, and it was an absolutely phenomenal experience for me. While not all of the professors here are brilliant, if you do your research before signing up for classes you will be treated to a quality of teaching that matches or exceeds that found at most four-year institutions. The campus community is diverse and thriving, with dozens of extremely energetic and active clubs aided by an administration that is truly engaged with the needs of the students.  Add to that a newly refurbished campus with state-of-the-art buildings and a wide selection of courses in both the liberal arts and technical fields, and you have a perfect recipe for an extraordinary experience."
Sophomore,5,A great environment on campus and the programs are awesome. I'm in the automotive program and there is a 10 door garage and a dyno. I know the allied health program rivals the best in the state and the automotive was also 3rd in the country in 2003 I believe.
College Junior,5,Like I said the DTA agreement is a great feature here in the Pacific Northwest.
Recent Alumnus,5,its a good start to transfer to the bigger universities.
Recent Alumnus,5,I love my school !!!!
College Junior,5,The ease of spacing classes out allows for time to review material in other courses.
College Junior,5,"Though online courses allow a ""work at your own pace"" approach, they have tight deadlines as instructors will assume that students know how to manage their priorities effectively and efficiently."
College Junior,5,"Career center services provide helpful resources to help you write an effective resume, cover letter, and conduct a successful job interview. Employment opportunities are always posted via the online job board or bulletin for students seeking work between or outside of classes."
College Junior,5,"The career center/services is your go-to place for clarification with writing effective resumes and cover letters, as well as developing skills for a successful job interview. Furthermore, don't hesitate on taking advantage of job postings such as employment opportunities on campus, local businesses and/or employers."
College Junior,5,"Anytime you should experience difficulty understanding course content or struggling to make progress, the best point of advice is to communicate with your instructor(s) or counselor to discuss what resources are available to help you learn material more effectively and potentially advance in your classes."
College Junior,5,Dropping by an instructor's hours are crucial should you seek clarification of course material or discussing options to improve the grade in any classes you are struggling with.
College Freshman,5,"The workload is very reasonable, homework is due at the end of the week so you have plenty of time to complete it if you have a full time job or other classes to take care of"

College Freshman,5,"This school has made every effort to be an accesible enviorment for all students. Coming to Skagit, everyone I met was friendly and has been truly interested in helping me.

I have grown so much with this school and can only hope future others will as well."

College Sophomore,5,Scheduling is very flexible and offers an abundance of open space between classes to focus on other studies or obligations.
College Sophomore,5,I really like how this school seems to let you do things at your own pace. The environment is very welcoming and it's not too far from home.
College Sophomore,5,Professors are very friendly and offer a more engaging approach to learning in the classroom.
College Sophomore,5,"In terms of diversity, you will come across many different people regarding their age, background, and culture. In addition many of these people are very approachable and have a lot of interesting stories to tell."
College Sophomore,5,Staff is very friendly and can help make sure you are on the right track to financing your education.
College Sophomore,5,Resources such as tutoring and study centers are very accessible and provide tutors to help students get through their studies.
College Freshman,5,I love the online class that I am taking I get what I am supposed to be learning and knowing and I can do it on my time before the assignment is due.
College Freshman,5,The nursing program at Skagit Valley College is one of the best in the area and probably in the state.
College Freshman,5,So far the academic experience at Skagit is great there are so many people that are there to help you learn or understand what you missed. There are also plenty of tutors available to help.
College Freshman,5,The campus is full of resources for just about anything. From teachers to financial aid to counselors to tutors to administrators.
College Freshman,5,The student body at Skagit is one of the most diverse things I have ever seen it has people from all over the world and that plays a huge role in the way our students interact
College Freshman,5,Teachers and staff are very flexible and have great hours of availability as well as they check there school emails frequently and reply very fast.
College Freshman,5,"The athletic center is awesome. I am on the track team but even after practice I like to go work out, they have a variety of different work out machines and they are very nice. The library is a very nice place to go to study it is very quiet and has a lot of seating.  "
College Freshman,5,"I am going for nursing and the nursing program is rated very highly, I am currently just doing my pre-recs to get into the program but I am loving every step of the way so far."
College Freshman,5,"I think one of Skagit Valley College's strongest areas is campus resources. They have an athletic center open long hours. They offer a library with many computers, study areas, help desks, printing services, and books. They offer a math center and a writing center, as well as free tutors in many subjects. They offer a wide variety of sports and clubs. "
College Sophomore,5,It is the best option for what courses i need to take how far it is from home and how i can fit in getting an education with such a busy life.
College Sophomore,5,The computer lab is available for when you need during the school day. Printing on campus if fairly cheap they give you a 10 allowance at the beginning of a quarter for printing included in tuition and it lasts most of the time. The network is very reliable i am able to get WiFi throughout the campus buildings.
College Sophomore,5,People come here from all walks of life. Many i have met are in or have family in the military and are working to go farther in life. There are many clubs for everyone to be able to take part in making this school better.
College Junior,5,"The tutor centers are amazing, the math, chemistry, and writing tutors and centers are wonderful and very helpful"
College Junior,5,I had been out of school for a long time and the transition into college was very smooth with the help of all the teachers. the curriculum is constantly exciting.
College Junior,5,My school hosts a lot of special club events and offers a lot of opportunities for people to meet and have fun
College Junior,5,The computers and library resources are up to date. The counseling center is always well informed and well staffed.
Freshman,4,"My professors were amazing and gave us information pretty clearly of what was expected and what we needed to do. If you are independent it’s great, you do what you need to."
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed going to Skagit Valley College! The campus is easy to navigate. The professors have been very knowledgable and helpful. I highly recommend going to this school.
Freshman,4,"While the main campus is located at Mount Vernon, I actually went to another campus an hour away due to close proximity. I found the school accommodating to my needs, however, due to a mishap during my fall quarter, I ended up having a grade that did not reflect what I had been led to believe I had received. After months of back and forths, I was able to get the grade I had initially had on my transcript. And this quarter, my teacher was not very accommodating at all, as I had transferred into his class a couple of days into the new quarter, and he refused to let me have an extended period of time to do my work due for the first week, and made =no attempts to extend the period I could take the quiz for the first week--as I did not yet have my book and his ""did not like to permit late work."" Other than that, I've had little to no issues with my professors or classes."
Sophomore,4,"Over all I enjoy attending Skagit Valley College. A lot of people go to a Community College expecting
 to get a lesser education than a person studying at a higher university. All staff and instructors  are very knowledgeable in their fields. The international student program is great, and the international students really are well incorporated into campus life. If I could change one thing, I would like to see a wider variety of programs offered at SVC."
Sophomore,4,"My experiences at Skagit Valley have been surprising. There are always new people or new events every month. It’s a beautiful school. The teachers are great, but are very strict."
Alum,4,"I attended this school for 2 years. Classes were very flexible with my schedule. I even took time off to have a baby and it did not affect much. I would recommend this school. Although, some professors do not put much effort into teaching."
Sophomore,4,"Moderate sized classes were nice. Once I entered a program, the classes were small and I felt like I got one on one help if I needed it."
Freshman,4,If you are having trouble deciding which community college to attend or just recently graduated and are clueless as to what to do next then may I suggest Skagit valley college. Skagit Valley College is located in Mount Vernon. Very diverse community and offers many opportunities to make sure you succeed.   The classes are small and the teachers take the time to address any concerns students may have.  I have had no problems so far and my experience overall has been great.
Freshman,4,I like SVC because almost are the teacher from that college are really nice and always be able to support their student to success in college.
Freshman,4,"I really like skagit valley  college , it make me safe. All people are nice and helpful when I need help , I get help from them right away .I think it a great place to study. Also, it near home. Which gives  more opportunity for studnets to attend.."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy going to Skagit Valley College, I’ve been there for a little past a year and it’s been great! The people there and teachers are good people, very helpful. I feel welcome at the college and great clubs to get involve in the community as well as with other students."
Sophomore,4,The professors are very clearly committed to their students success. They're looking to help wherever they can. Where the college needs to improve is with it's mandatory college success skills class. Although slated as a two credit class I found the workload to be much closer to five credits.
Sophomore,4,"Skagit Valley College is fun to attend and it is great watching all the new buildings pop up. I have made a lot of friends here that have been classmates, and have gotten along with all of my instructors well. Most of them are very fair when asked for exceptions. Skagit also offers a wide variety of clubs and does not discriminate against anyone."
Alum,4,"Great atmosphere and lovely landscape, large windows that let in a lot of light, but the office staff can feel bored or not very emotionally expressive, leading to sometimes awkward or irritating interactions."
Sophomore,4,The Staff is very helpful with any of my school needs. I enjoy the teachers and find that they too enjoy their jobs. It's a beautiful campus with lots of friendly people.
Sophomore,4,I love this school. There are 2 different campuses and both are great. The staff is great and the students are great too!
Freshman,4,Staff is nice and very helpful. Offers both online and on campus classes. Also offers certificate programs as well as degrees.
Freshman,4,"The college has a real chill vibe to it. They offer for most of their classes and option to take the class online or at one of their campuses. I am not giving them five stars because when I took the compass test they input the wrong scores into their system. They gladly changes the scores when I pointed out the error. I also don't like that they don't have a person dedicated to getting people scholarship money, or at least they don't do a very good job at out reach."
Sophomore,4,"Great school. Small campus and faculty. My professors get involved and really want the students to learn. I don't live on campus so I didn't rate the dorms, party scene or food. There are a lot of activities and clubs on campus. Even though it is a community college, they do offer one four-year degree program and are planning to offer more soon."
College Junior,4,They really need to revamp their online program. I find myself using Khan Academy for my general education requirements. Canvas is not really user friendly. It needs work. But this is not the school's fault. This is the developer's of Canvas's fault.
College Junior,4,"I've taken a few courses at Skagit and I am amazed at the knowledge, dedication and professionalism my teachers exhibit day in and day out."
College Junior,4,"One of the greatest things about this program is that as soon as I am done with my Associate's degree, I'll have access to a wide array of employment opportunities, as well as opportunities for completing my Bachelor's at a 4 year university. The DTA or Direct-Transfer Agreement degree provides students like me with the opportunity to build a strong academic foundation, with tangible results that are guaranteed to grant you success in real world applications."
College Junior,4,"My workload is paced really well. We don't get overloaded with assignments every week. Class sessions at Skagit are inquisitive., We are always given plenty of insight as well as intuitive feedback on the subject at hand. I couldn't be happier with my experience here. It has been great."
College Junior,4,"Skagit Valley College is an excellent school. The staff is really helpful, the teachers are passionate about what they are teaching and overall I am really satisfied with the services I've been provided by the school and the great opportunity that's been given to me to attain my education. I do think their online services, such as the academic advising features and your registration features need to be modernized a bit and be made into more user friendly databases. Other than that I love Skagit Valley. Great staff, great students, amazing campus."
Recent Alumnus,4,There are a lot of interesting classes online which is good so i can take some during summer quarter when im out of the country.
Recent Alumnus,4,The staff in here are so helpful and give me the advice's in anything i need for my success college.
Recent Alumnus,4,Skagit Valley College is such a great school in the good environment. All stuff here are willing to help.
Recent Alumnus,4,It is  a good academic since im the international student.
Recent Alumnus,4,it is such a great school which located in a small town. the classes are mostly small but filled with good environment.
College Senior,4,"I've had a variety of class times to choose from, occasionally I have a little trouble getting into the classes I need, but overall, it's worked good for me."
College Senior,4,"I'm not great at taking online classes, but I have found that the online classes that I have taken here have been good."
College Senior,4,"Most of my professors are understanding towards the struggles of a student, and are sympathetic. However, at the same time they are always challenging us to work hard to understand the material. The class sizes sometimes feel a little to large, but most of my classes have been a good size."
College Senior,4,"There are a lot of other students going into nursing, so there's a lot of people that are going through the same classes as me. The science teachers all know what they're talking about, I have a fun time learning from them."
College Senior,4,"I like the diversity, and there are many ways to be involved on campus (for example in the large variety of clubs)."
College Sophomore,4,this school provides great off campus clinicals with many different health care providers promotes school to career relationships
College Sophomore,4,course work and clinic work supportive of enforced learning
College Sophomore,4,Love the Oak Harbor campus. Low key supportive and beautiful setting
College Freshman,4,Well connected and supportive career center.
College Freshman,4,Enjoyable with small class sizes.
College Freshman,4,Great career center. A lot of support!
College Junior,4,Online classes are convienent and aright
College Junior,4,Very strong alumni in area and good prospects for post grads
College Junior,4,The advisors and the student council work hard to relay information  and provide opportunities to connect with alumni and representatives.
College Junior,4,The instructors have been great. Very friendly and helpful. The attitude is they are there for you. They are approachable.
College Junior,4,"Every one was very friendly, and helpful."
College Sophomore,4,"What I loved most about going to Skagit was how helpful the teachers were. They wanted to see you succeed, so they would always have office hours encouraging you to come see them right away if you needed help. I have even personally made friends with some of my teachers, its a great college to be apart of."
College Senior,4,"The teachers are accessible and friendly, which made it easy to form friendships with them. The school also provides many job opportunities/internships for students to gain experience in fields they normally wouldn't be able to work in without a degree."
College Junior,4,The staff of every department has been very involved and seem to be genuinely concerned with any issues.  They were especially helpful when I needed to change majors.
College Junior,4,I have not had to do financial aid which I am very great-full for but I have heard that they are really good.
College Junior,4,"Some of the teachers can be really hard, but that's okay because as long as you do your work you should be fine. Registration is not that bad either it can be a little difficult trying to figure out what you have to take and when you need to take it but if you ask for help they are more then willing to help you."
College Junior,4,It is really easy to find classes that you can work around you schedule.
College Junior,4,"There are so many different programs you can do here it is amazing. I had so many options even though I knew what I wanted to do already, but I still had the option to pick other things."
College Junior,4,The class sizes are pretty very good their is not to many and not to little. Some professors are hard but if you do your work you should be fine. There is a variety of classes offered here.
College Junior,4,"The programs that they have for online classes are very user friendly. It is very easy to submit assignments and get things turned in on time. Also it is very easy to have class discussions with your classmates. They only thing is right now we have two different programs because they are trying to get the new one up a ready for every teacher, and to make sure that it works. So things can be a little confusing, other then that things are easy."
College Junior,4,"Since it is a community college there are a lot of different people their, from young to older, white to black, they school is very diverse which is good."
College Sophomore,4,"Online courses are very convenient as they don't often require being in the classroom or physically doing assignments. However, due dates are a lot tighter and you may have to put in more hours of studying to get caught up."
College Sophomore,4,"I would say the campus resources are good, they have a big library with many assistants to help you. The gym is nice and available for student use most of the time. There are many types of study halls and tutoring centers to help students with work."
College Junior,4,Lot's of lovely characters in each class.
College Junior,4,"It's an awesome school with knowledgeable teachers, good class and class size, it's affordable and there are classes any time of the day you wish."
College Freshman,4,The financial aid office is good but they are sticklers for what classes you can take and if its a part of your course of study.
College Junior,2,"I failed an automotive class that was required online and I have built motors before, the material wasn't new to me. I failed entirely due to poor communication with deadlines and due dates but mostly due to server failure that would cause me to end my test before I was finished, thus getting a significantly low score. There is much room for improvement in this area."
College Junior,2,"As a laptop owner, SVC's incredibly slow wireless internet is extremely inconvenient.  Don't expect to be able to load any big files or even large YouTube videos at anything more than a snail's pace.  On the plus side, there are many computers available for student use around campus, and students can rent laptops from the library for home use.  Printing, at 10 cents per page, isn't usually much of a hassle, although the color printer in the library can get a bit backed up."
College Freshman,2,"Personally, I don't like the online courses all that much. I am a kinesthetic learner, so I learn better when I'm actually in the classroom interacting with others. The college uses Moodle, which I find confusing and disorganized. The interaction with students is okay, but I much prefer actual face-to-face interaction with students. I was never able to view my grades for the class that I took online, which was very frustrating. "
College Senior,2,"The financial aid office is my only complaint about the school so far.  They are very busy and are probably doing the best they can, but they are sometimes rude."
College Senior,2,They are rude the only one who is nice is the older lady. They do not have many office hours and when they do it is not a convenient time for a student
College Junior,2,Computer Labs – The computer labs aren't exactly high tech. They are useful though. I would reccommend bringing a flash drive if you're planning to work on something important so your information doesn't get lost.
College Senior,2,"It is the best school I can afford where I live. I wish there was less push to do online classes. I am at a branch campus and the coarse offering are limited. I know online classes save money, but I find them useless. The work load is about the same as my high school - lower than I was expecting. I know the state has cut the budget, but I feel like the students are milked. I have liked about half of my professors and classes. There are many rather tooth gritting electives."
College Sophomore,2,"There are somewhat okay resources on the Oak Harbor campus since it's only a sattelite campus, a fair amount of the funds are spent on resources at the main campus in Mount Vernon. The amount of on-campus teachers is decreasing and the college is having to make more classes online only, reducing the amount of classes available. The library is a decent size but more on the small side and there aren't a lot of computers available for public use."
College Freshman,2,"Why Is Skagit Unique? To be honest, there is nothing specifically unique that makes it any different from any other community college."
Sophomore,1,"I had the worst online experience in my college career. The teachers dont teach new content, lessons feel pointless and out of touch, professors look like theyd rather be dead than in the classroom and the campus is in an area thats accustomed to shootings. Stay away"
Sophomore,1,"This school has disappointed me in more ways than i ever thought possible. Poor quality faculty, an experience that somehow makes such a cheap college seem not even worth it. You will lose money and time trying to attend this circus of a college"
Freshman,1,Terrible College. Their graduation percent rate is 20%. I think the reason being is because they do not help their students at all.
Freshman,1,"Online is useless with this College, if you need help don't bother asking anyone who works there because they will just tell you to figure it out."
Alum,1,It was ok for the most part. But they don't follow their mission as they say. Go to Whatcom in my opinion.
College Junior,1,it was very hard to get help and I still am not gully sure on my financial aid.
College Senior,1,The teacher's act like they are better than you. Some are lazy and don't prepare for lecture and others prepare. You get no spoken directions on assignments just detailed instructions that are so detailed down to how many sentences can be in each paragraph and then they still failed almost everyone on the papers 2 quarters in a row and gave out more directions that were different than the original. The teachers give out conflicting information. It is just a horrible frustrating program that I wish I never went through at this school.
College Junior,1,Why I Wouldn't Choose My School Again – I wouldn't choose my school again because this isn't where I want to live and im basically waiting two years to start the life I want. I would have rather went to a college in California so I could pursue modeling as well as get an education.
College Senior,1,"Job Possibilities – The only reason to go the this school is to get a transfer degree to go to a four year university. You will save money, but be bored doing it."

Freshman,5,I did not take any online courses yet but the professors are great! This coming semester I will be taking online classes and the college has us well prepared for them.
Junior,5,Every black girl needs a space like Spelman College! I love the feeling of being on campus and learning how to be your own kind of Black woman leader while being surrounded by many others challenging themselves as well.
Freshman,5,What I liked most about Spelman College was the campus life & the multiple activities offered.  What I’d like to see changed is the menu & food selection.
Freshman,5,"I strongly prefer in class experience over the online option. However due to the pandemic, we were forced into this new situation and I did well.  Online may work for non-science classes better than science & math. I feel math & science along with labs is better suited for live hands on experience."
Freshman,5,"I grew up in a predominantly white area and naturally grew up loving blonde hair and pale skin. Attending Spelman College is by far the best decision of my life because Spelman has taught me to love my black self. I understand my role in society as a black woman, a black feminist, and a black woman in the stem field. My experience would have not been the same if I had not read great authors such as Toni Morrison, Audre Lorde, Marcus Garvey, and so many more. I am forever humbled by my experience at Spelman College and it is because of Spelman that I am actively choosing to change this world everyday."
Freshman,5,"Going to Spelman College was one of the best decisions I have ever made. The opportunities, the people I’ve met, and the faculty are amazing. My only criticism so far is the financial aid. My financial aid package was 100% loans. They do their best to find outside scholarships for their students, but I still had some of my classmates leave for financial reasons."
Niche User,5,"Great connections and family environment! I have always wanted to go here and it has been a dream of mine since forever. The women who graduate from Spelman College are not only well equipped, but they are ready to take on the workforce and pave new paths for other black women who will come after them."
Alum,5,We are women who serve. Attending Spelman empowered me in a way that would not have been possible at any other institution. I have a community or family of Spelman sisters that will be with me forever. I wish I could have my college experience one more time to take advantage of more opportunities to presented to me at that fine establishment. Black women being educated and supporting one another is beautiful and powerful.
Freshman,5,"My 1st semester experience at Spelman has been rewarding, challenging, fun and opened my eyes to a world I never knew existed.  This has been one of the best decisions I've mad and I'm thankful to God and my parents for providing a way for me to attend, even in spite of financial challenges.  If I had to change anything, it would be the food which at times tends to leave a lot to be desired!"
Freshman,5,"Spelman has great instructors and staff who want nothing more but to see their students “win”.  Spelman offers their students much support and guidance. The school can work on the foods in the cafeteria, but other than that, I don’t have any complaints."
Sophomore,5,"Spelman College is an illustrious institution with a top-tier undergraduate program. It is the number one HBCU in the United States and can maintain this title due to its wide variety of liberal art majors, well-educated professors, and innovative student body. It is the home to approximately 2000 black women, and its mission is to convert these young-women into worldwide leaders. Spelman offers numerous opportunities for advancement academically, socially, and career-wise. Attending Spelman College was the best decision I could have made."
Senior,5,"I am currently a Senior Health Science Major at Spelman College. Attending this institution is one of the best decisions I could have ever made. There is simply no other school that would have helped me grow into the person that I am today. There are numerous opportunities for people in any major, specifically in the health career field. Every Spelman Alumna I have met are incredibly successful and they all attribute it to being a Spelman Woman. I cannot thank this school enough."
Senior,5,"Spelman College has been the best college for me! I am an African-American young woman who grew up in Minnesota. I needed to be in an environment that did not make me feel different. At Spelman College, every day, I am encouraged, challenged and respected."
Niche User,5,"I loved the college campus life. When I visited I saw the ""Market Friday"" which instantly drew me even more to Spelman. I also love the sense of connectivity of sisterhood established at Spelman"
Niche User,5,The Spellman campus is very welcoming and not to mention how bright and friendly everyone is. The campus is beautiful.
Junior,5,"Spelman is an excellent HBCU!  Once you hit the campus, you will meet other women who will do great things.  You will be surrounded by women who strive to excel and want to support each other through ups and downs.  The campus is a small campus but is part of the AUC (which include Morehouse, Spelman, Clark Atlanta and Morris Brown).  Attending this school will be one of the best decisions you will make."
Sophomore,5,"I am transferring in the spring, I have not attended or even been accepted but I have extremely high hopes about this HBCU and I plan on furthering my education at HBCU by hopefully attending Howard for medical school in 2022."
Alum,5,I loved the sisterhood experience that I gained at Spelman.  As well as going to school with people who look like me and share similar aspirations as me.  It helped motivate me to strive for what I want.
Senior,5,"My experience at Spelman College has truly been amazing. I have grown so much as a young woman and become extremely confident. Although Spelman College is rigorous, I have become a better student because of it. I would definitely recommend this college."
Junior,5,"Spelman College is the ultimate HBCU experience. The academic environment can be thoroughly intimidating at times, but it also is created to push you to your greatest mental heights and potential, along with the teachers, The social environment is very live, but it is also very easy to slip up if you indulge in it too much without any difficulty. In all, it is a very beautiful experience of an academic journey rooted in sisterhood and self-realization that women of all ethnic and cultural backgrounds can enjoy."
Sophomore,5,"Spelman is truly a sisterhood. If I did not make the choice to go to Spelman I would not be who I am today. Spelman has taught me that no matter how hard you think you work, there is always someone working harder. This fact is what pushes and motivates me to work as hard as I can."
Niche User,5,"Spelman College is truly meant for women who are ready to learn about their culture, dive into deep issues, and are prepared to grow in character. Spelman's academics are like no other (very rigorous). Spelman challenges the individual to think beyond the surface. Spelman also has a beautiful campus, and is well-secured from the surrounding community of Atlanta. My experience at Spelman College's Early College Program has taught me a lot about my African American heritage and has helped me to become humble. Spelman College is expensive in price, however, the education is worth it!"
Niche User,5,"My aunt attended Spelman College.  She always speaks very highly of it.  She also attributes her career advancement to the education she received at Spelman.  Her ability to speak well, to write well, and to be perceptive and think critically are qualities Spelman demanded to its students.  Loving and embracing her womanhood came from being in an all female environment at Spelman.  It was truly a unique experience for her.  It also emphasized the contributions of African Americans not only in the United States but throughout the world.  It gave her a greater appreciation for her race, her heritage, and her appearance. Most of all helped her live up to her potential."
Freshman,5,"the campus and campus life is beautiful, its welcoming and a place that understands, caters, and nurtures to a woman."
Sophomore,5,I am a rising sophomore at Spelman and I thoroughly enjoyed my freshman year.  The professors were great and the community feel of the school made me feel right at home.  I met so many students from all over the world and know that I made the right decision by attending this school.
Alum,5,"Spelman College was a great place to attend college. While it is an HBCU, it has a very diverse population. I was always involved on campus, because there are an abundance of opportunities. I also was challenged academically, and I believe the college has prepare be to achieve anything that I set my mind to! It is also located in Atlanta, GA, which is an amazingly progressive city."
Niche User,5,I haven't actually attended the school yet but have visited quite a few times. From what I could tell the school is absolutely amazing and gives black people a chance to prosper in a community that isn't toxic or unconventional for us even if we are a minority. It gives black people the chance to be the majority in a place where they would otherwise be the minority.
Sophomore,5,Attending Spelman has afforded me unique college experiences and activities that are above the average college. Spelman pushes you to excel in every area of your life. The world-class professors present engaging instruction and demonstrate sincerity and care for each individual student.
Niche User,5,"I have not attended yet. I plan to attend this upcoming fall, but the event that I went to called ""Spelbound"" was so much fun. I was able to sleep on campus, there was a party, and many activities and showcases for the incoming Freshmen that showed the life of Spelman students. I really, really enjoyed it."
Niche User,5,"The focus on academics and self confidence. It is obvious that pride, self esteem, making a difference, and changing the world will be the focus."
Freshman,5,"I enjoy that Spelman College is an all women's HBCU. When I visited the campus last year for the SpelBound weekend, I enjoyed hearing the stories and testimonies of students who attend the college. They told the truth about their experiences and the challenges they faced at the college. I was also able to sit in on several classes and talk with professors. I am glad I had such an interactive experience on the campus before I start classes in the fall."
Junior,5,"Spelman College is the most renown college for Black women.  They truly believe that desire to learn is instilled within their students, and it is their job to flesh it out."
Freshman,5,"I believe Spelman is preparing me for the next phase of my life ""Medical School"". Upon graduation from college, I plan to obtain a Doctor of Medicine degree and complete a rigorous residency among the nation's leading students and professionals of the OBGYN specialization.  

As a practicing Physician, I will dedicate my time and efforts to making sure that the work of my hands leave an impact long after I’ve left this Earth. I will focus a lot of efforts on women in underserved communities that do not have access to holistic health and reproductive care. It is my desire to utilize my education to give back to women in communities all across this nation and beyond."
Sophomore,5,"Spelman College is an amazing Mecca of black female excellence, it is a small community where woman have the resources and supports to become leaders in society. The immediate surrounding area is a low income urban area that is not very safe, but the campus itself if fully gated and heavily guarded ( trust me , any Spelmanite will tell you safety is not an issue inside of Spelman's gates ). Some limitations because of the surrounding neighborhood are quick access to local stores and businesses and the overall safety in these places. To avoid this, transportation becomes necessary and expensive (Uber, Lyft, etc.). Atlanta is a big beautiful city though full of things to explore. The rest of Spelman is what you make of it."
Graduate Student,5,Spelman is an experience unlike any other. Like most schools it is what you make however unlike most schools it's designed to help young black women thrive.
Freshman,5,"My mother’s resilience, determination, and selflessness throughout her fight with breast cancer have fundamentally shaped my character and contributed to my growth. I’ve learned so much through my hardships, and they have shaped me into the young woman I am today. This experience forced me to be strong, thoughtful and highly motivated, which is a mentality I plan to bring while furthering my education. I am determined to become successful, which to me means working to be a strong student, a positive role model for my sister, and the first in my family to attend a 4-year university."
Niche User,5,I absolutely love it! The campus is beautiful and the people there are so welcoming and warm hearted.
Niche User,5,"The location is a great place to consider. In Atlanta, Spelman is near many other major colleges and universities so meeting people of different background is very common. Being the number Historically Black College or University (HBCU) definitely draws the best and brightest around. Lastly, Spelman's mission to support, advance, and enlightened the community near and far is a mission many want to join. Spelman is a chance to change the world."
Junior,5,"Classes provide an open and safe environment for learning/discussions. If an all-female institution scares you, don't worry! Male students are on-campus until 12am so you'll see them around eating or interacting in different campus orgs. Also, a lot of the women at Spelman are driven and passionate so if you're a student who doesn't know exactly what they want to do yet(like me), your Spelman sisters motivate you and help guide you to finding your passion. There are also plenty of research opportunities. Spelman is also supportive of their students and will address gender/sexual discrimination or incidences as an institution. However, like any institution Spelman has its issues. Some issues include: that the cafeteria could have longer hours and better food, there needs to be more areas on campus that are open 24 hours for studying, and Spelman is really expensive (these loans are no joke)! Other than that, I love my institution and I'm proud to claim that I am a Spelmanite."
Niche User,5,"I am in love with the campus and the atmosphere surrounding the campus. I am in love with the culture there, the fact that it’s a Historically Black College and University. The school really helps young African American ladies to pave the way for their own futures, and become empowered within themselves."
Niche User,5,I have yet to attend Spelman however I am excited about the opportunity to possibly be an attendee.  Spelman is a very prestigious institute with several great programs available for the ladies to attend.
Sophomore,5,"Spelman is not just an hbcu, it provides so many opportunities to do the things you want and to do what will help you succeed in college and beyond."
Niche User,5,Spelman has welcomed me onto its beautiful scenery and I enjoyed their company. It make you feel as though you are at home and I have became friends with some of my soon to be Spelsisters.
Niche User,5,Their admissions counselor is VERY welcoming. She has a great vibe and she's easy to talk to. She made a great impression.
Niche User,5,"Although I am not in college yet, I did receive the significant opportunity to tour the campus of Spelman College. My experience so far with the school has been amazing! I absolutely adore the enthusiasm and energy that the campus itself offers."
Niche User,5,With open arms they put the differences behind them and they accept you for who are you. A black beautiful young lady.
Niche User,5,I was so impressed with the campus and the campus's attention to safety. I will be very comfortable knowing my daughter is safe while attending college.
Niche User,5,Spelman College has a phenomenal women education program and is rated worlds best black female university of all time.
Niche User,5,I really enjoyed researching this college. It made me eager to apply and I hope that I get in. From what I heard it is a very good school
Niche User,5,"Spelman college is just the overall ideal of an all African-American women’s college. It gives you everything you’ve ever asked for. Not only are you connecting with other women and creating an unbreakable bond, but the college experience I’ve heard of is like no other. There’s a good student:professor ratio and there’s good people around you. You’re connected to your neighbor colleges which consist of Moorehouse and Clark. Attending Spelman gives you a lot of opportunities that you wouldn’t experience anywhere else!"
Alum,5,"I am a proud graduate of Spelman College.  The professors were awesome and they were very encouraging.  They never talked in a way that said ""if"" you would be successful, it was ""when"" you were to become successful.  I think that my experience at Spelman shaped who I am."
Freshman,5,"So far, I truly love being at Spelman College and being apart of the Atlanta University Center. Everyone is very nice and extremely welcoming and supportive. I love my Spelman sisters even though it's only been a few days. The campus is easy to navigate and the new student orientation has been very helpful."
Niche User,5,"Spelman was community where, I felt as though, I could be myself and express my emotions in new ways."
Junior,5,"Spelman has such a loving atmosphere where you will feel seen, important, and a part of a loving black female community that is still full of diverse individuals. This institution pushes you to grow into the best person that you can be."
Senior,5,"I love and cherish my institution for instilling in me the value of education, networking, focus and dedication. The opportunities that are available at Spelman are unmatched. I have had the chance to learn, grow, and thrive as an individual at Spelman, and I appreciate the journey that it has brought me."
Niche User,5,I am a perspective student looking to attend and I visited the school for my sweet 16 and I must say everything about Spelman is great and I wouldn’t change a thing
Freshman,5,"My experience with Spelman College was like no other. Spelman is very welcoming, humble and caring. The sister bond is strong, everyone strives to help others and themselves succeed. The environment is very strong, black excellence and confidence. Like the motto ""A choice to Change the World"", I am choosing Spelman because I know with my education there just like my sisters I too can change the world."
Niche User,5,I loved the environment of the school. Black women are encouraged to not only embrace their pursuit towards a higher field of education but also accept themselves as women of color in America.
Niche User,5,"As a black woman, spelman was the perfect place that I felt I could really succeed. One thing that they pride themselves on is being a support system for us young black women, who try everything to help us succeed. There are an extensive amount of opportunities as well at spelman!"
Niche User,5,This notorious HBCU is an amazing college for young black women that intend to be trailblazers in today's society.
Senior,4,"Spelman truly demonstrates the pinnacle of what black womxn, and individuals, can accomplish. My peers at Spelman are one of my main sources of motivation, as it is nearly impossible to not try your best at all times in a space where everyone around you is doing the same and accomplishing amazing things. No matter who you are Spelman's environment will cultivate you into a more ambitious and well-rounded person. If I was presented with the option to attend Spelman or go elsewhere, I would pick Spelman 100 times over."
Freshman,4,Spelman is an all inclusive school and is very welcoming. Just wish they would have better housing conditions for the students.
Freshman,4,"I have very mixed emotions when discussing Spelman College. Being a black woman and attending the illustrious Spelman College has made me feel important and seen. I love that I am able to be myself while being surrounded by the most brilliant black women. Even though living in the West End can be very difficult and a big change from where I grew up it's definitely a learning experience for me. I love my school and I cherish every minute of it, there are many ups and downs when attending a Historical Black College, but I find it very rewarding in the end."
Niche User,4,I love how they are all about their students and their atmosphere. I know some people who attend/ed superman and they said  that the academics re hard but it's all worth it in the end.
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love Spelman. It is a campus where you are surrounded by strong and driven black women thriving in their studies. The sisterhood among the students is warm, welcoming, and uplifting. The only thing that I could complain about is how reluctant the school is to financially aid their students. Many women dream of going to Spelman but are unable to attend or have to leave after a year or so due to a lack of financial aid."
Niche User,4,This college is great for strong women who want to get a great education. (Although a few of these teachers can be to strict.)
Freshman,4,I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Spelman College thus far. I would tell any incoming students that it is academically rigorous but the strong support system from fellow students and faculty makes a huge difference.
Freshman,4,Spelman College is a good school. Financial aid and access to financial resources are very poor at the school. Many people end up taking out many loans to be able to afford it.
Sophomore,4,"A beautiful campus, with hundreds of other like-minded hard working women who want to see one another succeed."
Freshman,4,I love Spelman! It's a great way to get in tune with the HBCU life with amazing academics. Everyday they push you towards greatness. The sisterhood is real!
Niche User,4,"I went on a college tour and it was amazing. I love the student to teacher ratio, the percentage of graduates that end with a job, and the diversity throughout the campus."
Freshman,4,"I love the beautiful bond between the students of Spelman. The campus is clean and gorgeous. The history of Spelman is fantastic to learn about. I love how there are so many amazing opportunities for the students to join. I do not like the unorgnaization of Spelman and how stingy they are with their money. The ""tradition"" of freshman dorms having no a/c."
Freshman,4,"When I started looking into colleges I was lost and didn’t know what school I wanted to attend. I applied to many schools in a frenzy not knowing which one was right for me. My biggest concern was ending up in a place where I felt alone due to hearing many testimonies of people who felt lonely or even depressed at their school. When I came across Spelman, the first thing I noticed was the sisterhood values of togetherness and community that the school prided on. This summer, I experienced just a taste of the community feeling in group chats with my sisters where we always asked about each other’s day and motivated each other. I realized the community aspect at Spelman is something rare that you can’t find elsewhere."
Junior,4,My experience was different because I came in as a transfer student. It was very hectic and I had a hard time adjusting. The school did me well and broke down learning into thinking outside the box. Spelman provided a fresh start and being challenged in the classes helped me become a competitive woman. They shaped me into a new person and helped me become ready for the real world. The only thing I would change is if they would work with the student body on being opinionated. I did not feel the love as much and found myself distanced from my graduating class.
Sophomore,4,"Spelman College is the most beautiful place that a black woman can attend and grow in. Although it is not for everyone, once you visit you will know if it is for you or not. But Spelman teaches you how to live and operate in today's world as an independent black woman."
Freshman,4,"Spelman College has been a great experience. It has opened my eyes to the challenges that people of Black descent face in the world and provides a community that uplifts its students. Overall, I have loved my first year of college."
Freshman,4,Great school! produce great students. I LOVE IT HERE. I would give up this experience for everything in the world. You meet the best student and learn from the best teacher. You should tour and see for yourself. The small class are a bonus
Freshman,4,"I enjoy my time at Spelman College. For me it's like going to school with my family members. I feel like I'm surrounded my several of my aunts and uncles, and of course my sisters, who all want me to succeed. I feel like I'm surrounded by family members who care about my success, and who wouldn't shy away from using tough love in order to see me exceed."
Freshman,4,"Spelman College is a great opportunity for any young African American woman to learn more about their true history and feel empowered by finding and understanding their true self. The environment is one of hard work, dedication, and a certain unique  quality of sisterhood. Although this is a very illustrious institution it is very expensive so, if I could change one thing it would be the cost of attendance."
Freshman,4,The food needs to change and they need more scholarship opportunities  but other than that I love Spelman.
Niche User,4,Spelman is a wonderful college for young black women looking for a rigorous educational experience while being surrounded by other like minded black women. Spelman allows young woman to create their own safe community for themselves while still being able to connect and interact with students from Morehouse and Clark Atlanta University. Spelman is an institution that houses some of the most beautiful and brilliant black minds in the country and helps ready black women for success.
Junior,4,Spelman cultivates girls into woman and gives them the opportunity to grow within themselves and their community.  One thing that needs improvement is the transition for transfer students.
Sophomore,4,"Spelman is the epitome of Black Girl Magic. You're bound to be successful after attending. From your first semester there, Spelman will make sure that you are educated about your past, present, and your future. The opportunities are bountiful. The bond you have with your sisters (current students and alumna) is unmatched and untouchable. Spelman College should be on every young black girl's college list."
Sophomore,4,"Spelman College is a great place for open-minded, driven, outspoken young women. I believe Spelman prepares young black women for real-world circumstances as well as provides you resources that other institutions may not provide. However, I do recommend doing your research prior to applying or entering the gates of Spelman. The rules are strict and the women are fierce."
Sophomore,4,"I love the sisterhood and overall culture at Spelman and within the AUC. However, I would like to see better financial support from the college to students."
Sophomore,4,"I have only completed my first year at Spelman College and I'm considering transferring for my sophomore year so I can properly prepare for my remanding years of school. My freshman dorm was fairly poor considering the amount of money I paid for the institution. Very small rooms, no air conditioning in the hot Atlanta heat, and half of the showers working in the community bathroom. Although there are various cons about this school I enjoy the small campus and diversity of clubs, organizations, and people in one small environment. Having Morehouse and Clark Atlanta made my Spelman experience better. Ultimately, COLLEGE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT."
Junior,4,Spelman College is an exceptional institution for the furthering of education for black women. It creates an environment for strong minded women and a feeling of home within the Atlanta University Center.
Sophomore,4,"It's a pretty good school, although the fees and tuition is kind of expensive and the campus food isn't worth the money"
Freshman,4,"Spelman is an amazing institution. The women here are inspiring and the faculty are polite and caring. Being a student here also gives you unique and productive networking and internship opportunities. This school is extremely expensive, but if you can get here it is well worth the price."
Freshman,4,"I like that they are a very dedicated institution. The classes are rigorous and challenging. I know it will prepare me for Medical School. I wish they had longer cafeteria hours because students get hungry at night. I wish there were places to eat out near by. I like that they had many study abroad programs, which encourage us to travel. There are many organizations available, but I find it a bit difficult to balance a personal life while keeping grades up. I like the African Diaspora and The World class that is required for all students but it's nearly impossible to get a high grade if you don't participate in the class discussion."
Freshman,4,Love the energy and diversity  at spelman. There are many organizations and clubs to join for any interest or Demographic. The academics are tough but there are countless sources for help and tutoring that If you struggle it is because you did not take advantage of the resources available. The on campus residential life is fun and makes the new adjustment smoother. I love Spelman College and the decision to attend was the best thing I could have done for myself.
Freshman,4,The curriculum is challenging but helps prepare  you for your future. The classroom settings consist of a close and personal relationship between the teacher and the students. There is an indescribable sisterhood that takes place at Spelman College. At the beginning of my Spelman experience I made so many connections with my fellow peers. Spelman makes sure that this happens through the endless activities such as convocation and events like Olive branch. So far it has been a great experience.
Sophomore,4,Spelman is a great school for African American females who are trying to find who they are. Although it is costly it is worth it. It is very hard to receive scholarships because almost every student has a great GPA and the funding is not fully there. If you plan to attend Spelman College you will learn a lot about the black women and how strong we are.
Alum,4,I had an amazing experience at Spelman it lead to opportunities to conduct research with top organizations. Every college has its pros and cons its just a matter of finding what works for me and Spelman worked for me.
Niche User,4,"When I went on my tour , everyone on campus was so welcoming! My tour guide told me about to the good programs and majors offered."
Freshman,4,"I love how Spelman College is very family oriented. Once you get here everyone becomes your family. The teachers and your peers want to help and see you succeed. However, Spelman is very slow to update and get information out."
Niche User,4,"I love Spelman. It is a wonderful HBCU that promotes sisterhood and achieving higher goals. All the students, no matter who is watching, they represent the college well. Their pride and sisterhood goes deep and I know that I will always have a sister at Spelman."
Alum,4,Spelman College was an environment that helped me grow into a strong and confident African American woman. Spelman nurtured me as a student and gave me the tools that I needed to continue my education.
Freshman,4,"Spelman was not my first choice of college, however I am happy that I made the decision to come here. The academics are amazing and many focus on empowering us as intelligent black women in America. The courses are challenging so come prepared to thing deeply. My complaint lies with financial aid and food and housing. Spelman is a private institution so scholarships are very hard to come by, very very hard. It is very hard to eat healthily here, and if you are vegan your options are limited. The freshman housing is very old, and while the heat does build sisterhood the radiators in the winter made me and a few other students sick because of how old they were. Other than this my experience so far has been excellent."
Niche User,4,"I went to Spelman on a college visit and got to see all the ins and outs of the college. I was able to experience the everyday life of a student at Spelman college. One thing I truly loved about the campus was its cleanliness. Spelman is a tight knit campus due to its small population. Therefore, it makes keeping the campus area clean easier.  Also while I was there I noticed the drastic change in dorms by grade level. The lower class men dorms weren't as up kept and nice."
College Freshman,4,Professors have been really nice and helpful at showing us what we should expect during lectures.
College Freshman,4,"From what I've seen in the few short weeks that I've been here, the school takes public safety extremely seriously, and does their best to make sure that its a safe campus."
College Freshman,4,The people I have met so far have been overwhelmingly welcoming and enthusiastic.
College Freshman,4,"Greek Life on campus is about sisterhood and improving the environment of our community, I respect it alot."
College Sophomore,4,"There are several courses that are solely Spelman courses & you may hate them from beginning to end because of the tough professors and heavy unnecessary work load, but they will prove to be very useful & insightful courses in the long run."
College Sophomore,4,"Our campus security is efficient. There could be improvement on entry process onto the campus during the day, but at night campus security officers make sure there aren't any unwanted guests pass curfew."
College Freshman,4,The illustrious spelman college. The Spelman woman! I hold myself to a higher standard.
College Sophomore,4,A lot of students that attend Spelman are always studying abroad and getting amazing scholarships. Prospering.
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the crime that occurs is usually on the Promenade, with Spelman being a closed campus I feel really safe."
College Sophomore,4,The new gym that Spelman added is lovely and a good asset to the campus.
College Sophomore,4,I love this school and the sisterhood the educational experience is beyond any type of experience I have had before.
College Sophomore,4,"Spelman is a wonderful school. Like any other school, it has it flaws but those are easily overlooked when focusing on what I gained in my first year. Some of my best experiences came from that school during my freshman year and I am excited to return this fall. My school is unique because of it's history and tradition, and how so many women value this tradition and carry it for generations."
College Junior,4,"Hard classes, but you learn so much!"
College Junior,4,"We don't have Greek housing. Everything at my school is low-key, but everyone wants to join!"
College Sophomore,4,The few issues we do have concerning safety have occurred off of our campus to my knowledge.
College Sophomore,4,"With a strong exception to the freshman dorms, the campus is very nice. The landscape is beautiful. The older buildings are still in good shape and the newer buildings are wonderful."
College Junior,4,Living on campus is pretty great and I feel safe.
College Junior,4,They are very involved in the community and have a strong sister bond.
College Sophomore,4,"I have always felt safe walking on Spelman's campus since it is small and close knit. The only problem is when you step off of the campus. Sexual assault is an issue that spelmanites feel very passionate about and are working to change the problems that are associated with it. The only thing is to be careful when walking outside of Spelman, but its no different than being in any other neighborhood."
College Sophomore,4,"Spelman is a wonderful institution and I love everything about it. However, it does have its faults just like any other school. Spelman isn't perfect, but its a wonderful place for young black women to come and get an education while at the same time be inspired by their sisters."
Junior,2,"This school is very expensive and the administration is less than helpful regarding helping students. The counselors, financial aid department, and etc. are very lazy."
College Freshman,2,"I felt very unwelcomed at the school. Because of financial reasons, I commute to school and it is very difficult to make relationships when living off campus."
College Freshman,2,School doesn't think about freshman class
College Freshman,2,"I have a horrible time receiving aid and for me it is an ongoing process. Everyone has their own way of providing for school, so I wouldn't say it is difficult for everyone. The financial aid officers are not the problem, the problem is the amount of aid that is being given out."
College Freshman,2,it actually sucks but morehouse has cfa and whichwich. you will most likely enjoy the cafe 4 times a school year.
College Freshman,2,I haven't stayed off campus but I do have friends that live in off campus housing and its definitely not the move. Well at least not the ones in close proximity to the school.
College Freshman,2,All the off campus dining near campus are fast food restaurants. Every last one of them. You have to go out a bit a way near downtown atlanta to get decent food and dine in restaurants.
College Freshman,2,The Spelman financial aid department is horrible.
College Freshman,2,When your a freshman you can only have boys over from 6pm-11:45pm which gets really annoying. Spelman is overly strict when it comes to visitation
College Freshman,2,"On campus there is theft which is always unnerving! But mostly close to campus there is so much crime that it can be a turn off to go out. I've had a friend shot, but most friends have been robbed sometimes at gun point."
College Freshman,2,"Its mostly fast food, which I don't typically eat unless I'm treating myself (Once or twice every couple of weeks), so honestly I don't eat off-campus unless I go all the way Downtown or to Buckhead which is where you will find plenty of options (Atlanta has fantastic dining, just not in the West End)."
College Freshman,2,"I am still waiting to get scholarship money from financial aid. While financial aid is pretty good with notifying students of outside scholarships, which I have been applying for, I feel like more students who are in need of financial aid (scholarships!!not loans!) and are excelling (3.7+ GPA) with many academic achievements/extracurricular should be considered. I feel like financial aid sometimes assumes just because a students parents per capita income in above $75,000 that it is easier for them to pay of loans, when many times that is not the case."
College Freshman,2,"As a member of the Slow Food executive board, I can clearly recognize the issues with the current cafeteria options. There are very few clean options in the cafeteria and a strong lack of whole foods. Every now and then the caf will have better options like grilled chicken breast or baked fish and baked/steamed veggies (kale, brussel sprouts, sweet potatoes,etc.), but most days you will have something along the likes of processed breaded chicken breast with two-day old canned corn. For this reason many students find themselves gorging on pizza,waffles, and fried foods from the grill just to have something to eat. Definitely not a nutrient rich diet to live on.  I find myself mostly eating from the stir fry bar (which isn't always that convenient)."
College Freshman,2,"Students really lack the typical partying college experience because the repercussions are severe. This is one of the reasons why students move off campus. We have dates for visitation with Morehouse and Clark students. Spelman is just really strict when it comes to alcohol, drugs, and visitation but they let almost anyone through the gates of the school."
College Freshman,2,Campus is really strict with underage drinking or looking bad so there are no parties on campus ever. Many students go to Georgia State or Emory for frat parties. Going to house parties near the school brings a lot of characters and sometimes they get violent or out of hand. Some students also go to clubs. I wish the campus wasn't so strict or the surrounding area was safer.
College Freshman,2,Only a few late night places on grubhub. No car.
College Sophomore,2,"The off-campus dining options near my school include fast food restaurants such as Taco Bell and chinese restaurants. The convenience is great... but the food is very unhealthy. Some of the restaurants have student discounts but nothing major. Its all pretty much the same food... soul food, chinese, and bbq."
College Sophomore,2,Spelman's financial aid isn't very helpful. I cannot count the number of times I've left that office crying from frustration. TIP: Get as many outside scholarships as you possibly can because Spelman will not help you receive any more aid during the year.
College Sophomore,2,We do not have an athletic department but we do have plenty of workout classes with great instructor's.
Recent Alumnus,2,"It was a struggle. I was fortunate to receive some scholarship from Spelman, and I would definitely recommend going and doing the best that you can to see what scholarships they have, but going into the financial aid office was an overall unpleasant experience for me."
College Sophomore,2,"Small rooms, no air-conditioning and dirty bathrooms."
College Sophomore,2,It is bittersweet being in my specific program at school.
College Sophomore,2,The strictness on campus necessary and than unnecessary at times.
College Freshman,2,Campus is shut down for flurries of snow!
College Freshman,2,"IF YOU DO NOT LIKE NORMAL RULES, DO NOT APPLY. The college's safety rules are strictly enforced and can really make you regret attending. Maturity plays a huge part in the overall appreciation of the rules on campus."
College Freshman,2,"I suggest take-out. The only off-campus dining we really have is Popeyes, Churches, and Papa Johns. They need to step it up"
College Junior,2,"The financial aid process for me was terrible. However, this school does not give out scholarships. They are very stingy with the money and will close your account over a very small amount of money."
College Junior,2,"Most parties are house parties. Those are fun every once in a while, but not all the time. You'd get tired of seeing the same people all the time. There isn't much diversity for fun."
College Freshman,2,"The freshmen dorm I am assigned to has no air conditioning,"
College Freshman,2,"I hate living in the freshman dorm, you won't be satisfied until sophomore year when you can choose a bigger, and more spaciest dorm that is suitable for you. Plus we can't have microwaves, or mini fridges and have to share a big fridge with the entire dorm."
College Sophomore,2,Athletics have been cut as part of the budget. 
College Junior,2,Receiving financial aid at Spelman is so difficult. The college is horrible about helping the students financially.
College Freshman,2,Spelman is all about sisterhood but at the same time they promote self motivation and assistance. If you do not motivate yourself to apply or take advantage of the opportunities given to you at Spelman College they will not help you. I had and still do have a very hard time dealing with financials.
College Freshman,2,Since Spelman College is an HBCU we are predominantly black. But we have many study abroad students and other ethnicities also. There are so many programs that introduce us to different possibilities that come along with diversity. We are also required to take a Adrican Diaspora class which also opens out eyes to the diversity of our own race and how we interact and exist in the world.
College Sophomore,2,There is a shuttle that travels between the AUC and the train stations. It also stops at the West End Mall (if you consider that a mall). However it is always off schedule and the waiting area for the shuttle is outside. The trips are also extremely long and for some strange reason it only comes around every 30 minutes on weekends when you really need it.
College Junior,2,"Some of the Greeks like to think they're are better than others. I definitely wouldn't like to be a part of some of the organizations. Of course, this doesn't apply to them all. Some of them are very nice and seeking positive change around our community. I don't believe that there is any special Greek housing."
College Junior,2,"The pros of living off campus include: 1) It drastically cuts down on expenses of college since it eliminates room and board, and you may have a roommate to split costs with, 2) You may not have to share a bathroom with anyone, 3) You may have visitors as you please.

The cons include: 1) Our campus in in a very high crime area, so if you live somewhere near, there's a good chance you may be ambushed, burglarized, or even killed. However, if you live in a nicer area away from campus, you'll face the inconveniences of gas expenses, more travel time, and possibly being late for class (not to mention, the housing is more expensive in nicer areas.).

The school does offer off campus housing fairs, but I was told that these only help somewhat."
College Sophomore,2,The shuttles take forever and stop running at 12am. There needs to be a better system.
College Sophomore,2,"I have just completed my first year so I can only speak on my experience in a freshman dorm. In short, the dorms need to be renovated. The walls and floors have cracks, the heaters need to be replaced, no air conditioning, no wifi, and the water is not always hot or working. I think this distracted students from their studies because they did not have a comfortable place to live. Renovating the dorms would be a positive move for the school."
College Sophomore,2,"The location my school is located in has a lot of historical value, but not attractive. There are shopping centers, places to go hang out and party."
College Freshman,2,GREEKS DO NOT HAVE ON CAMPUS HOUSING. I DONT SEE ANYTHING SPECTACULAR WITH THE GREEK LIFE.
College Freshman,2,The freshman dorms don't have air conditioning and the bathrooms are horrible.
College Sophomore,2,I have heard bad things about campus housing and they arent that great
College Freshman,2,"There are lots of academic things going on around Spelman ALL THE TIME. However, you will rarely hear about campus parties at Spelman. Although, there are many at Clark Atlanta and at clubs nearby."
College Sophomore,2,"On campus housing is not great at all. There are residence halls that are very old, raggedy, and bug infested. Freshman halls and one of the upperclassman halls do not have air conditioning, but this is not a major problem if you and your roommate(s) have several fans and keep the windows open."
College Freshman,2,Spelman is getting rid of athletics in the 2013-2014 school year and then on to build a new gym and then further promote the wellness of the whole school. Spelman is definitely not a school you would go to to play sports and expect to go pro.
College Freshman,2,"In the West End of Atlanta there is not much to do besides parties which are all the time. If you go into downtown Atlanta, the city is great! It is a somewhat atypical big city though, after a while, it might get boring"
College Senior,2,"The SC Athletic Department Sports are considered Division III. Sports are not emphasized on campus, but are great if you need an extracurricular activity. There also isn't a lot of variety. We offer very few competitive sports, however  the range of classes that count towards physical education are much more varied and fun."
College Freshman,2,Spelman College is not really known for its sports so there you go...lol
College Sophomore,2,"Not the Best – If you're a freshman, then you've got it the worst. None of the freshman dorms have AC with the exception of the Honors dorm that only a few students get to stay in. All the other freshman dorms are fairly old. However, they are being redone over the next few years. For the upperclassmen, it gets a little better. Most of their dorms have AC with the exception of 1. These dorms are much better furnished and the appearance is better.  Juniors and Seniors can even apply to live in the suites.  They are only five or six years old and inside they look like a nice hotel."
College Sophomore,2,Not the Best – I never hear anything about sports at Spelman. Sometimes I'll get emails about upcoming games but I doubt that anyone ever goes to them
College Sophomore,2,"Not That Great but They Are Making Changes. The food on campus this past year was not very good so often times you would want to go off campus to get food that you particularly enjoyed, but it was quick to just eat on campus. The school this year is starting to make changes and add new places to eat on campus and changing the cafeteria up a little bit so things should be better this fall."
College Junior,2,"Spelman lacks in alot of the general campus aesthetics. However, the education, experience and networks makes up for it."
College Sophomore,2,"The cafeteria has a variety of food the majority of the time, however after a while, the food becomes monotnous and you start heading for the Jaguar Underground grill or off campus dining. Inconsistancy across the board."
College Freshman,2,"Drugs Are Prevalent – Most of the students here either drink, smoke weed, or do both. A lot of students do smoke weed so you have to be open to the whole idea"
College Sophomore,2,"Atlanta Weather is VERY unpredictable! Some weeks, you will experience all four seasons. It tends to be very hot the first few weeks, but the best weather is after that period and early march when the weather heats up. I advise you pack all seasonal wear with you when you come."
College Senior,2,"Too Strict – Ridiculously strict when it comes to boys visiting dorms on campus, unnecessarily so. Also very strict on academic progress."
College Sophomore,2,The only real transportation to and from campus are the shuttles and they only take you to the library or the MARTA train station.
College Freshman,2,"Could Be Worse – There are not a lot of dining options outside of Spelman in the West End area. If you want to walk, the closest places to eat are: Popeyes, Churchs, Taco Bell etc. If you prefer healthier options, there are none.The ""typical"" places deliver (i.e. pizza, chinese food, burgers) but again, the food is not veery healthy. In order to get good quality food, or healthy food, you would have to go outside of the West End."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's an HBCU – Most of the people are African American/Black because it's an HBCU. It's expected. There are a few biracial people and international students though. There is a lot of diversity though outside of race. There are people from all over the United States, even from those forgotten states like Iowa and Rhode Island as well as some from the Bahamas, Jamaica, Bermuda, and places like that. There are different backgrounds and religions as well as different financial backgrounds."
Sophomore,1,Professor were not readily prepared for online instruction. As an alternative they piled on unnecessary work for students to complete on top of what was already on the syllabus. Despite time differences students were still expected to be not even a minute late for instruction.
Sophomore,1,"The overall well being of students at Spelman College is vastly disregarded whether that be financial stability, mental health, or safety on campus. Administration is only looking to reap the benefits of bright young black women whilst they struggle to survive."
Sophomore,1,The rooms are trashy  . They smell bad im going to Harvard . I thought this was the place of my dreams since all the reviews were great. I was left in disappointment. Please help. Go spend your money somewhere else.
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have sports team, which is horrible because a lot of the current students were amazing student athletes during highschool."
College Junior,1,We do not have athletics at our school.
College Freshman,1,"Well, it is the worst because we don't have athletics. That is the worst."
College Sophomore,1,Needs a lot of work and shows they don't care about the students well being!
College Sophomore,1,We have no sports !
College Senior,1,The classes are limited and not very stimulating. Some classes you can just get by in the class and not learned a single thing.
College Senior,1,"I have heard that the counseling services are bad. The counselor snake the students feel bad about themselves and they don't want to go back for help,"
College Senior,1,"The professors don't work with you all of the time. When you go to help to the deans office about certain professors and the Provost can't come up with a solution and they just shove it under the rug, I feel like Spelman doesn't really care about their students. They just want to get paid at the end of the day."
College Senior,1,There are too many rules and I feel like I am still in high school and have a lot of rules to follow. I would have fathered lived off campus but you have to stay on your first two years.
College Senior,1,They took away all of the sports for women my freshmen year. There are no sports now.
College Freshman,1,Our campus police and faculity tell girls what they want to hear instead of fixing the problem
College Freshman,1,Freshman dorms are old with no air and small. We have bug problems and the bathrooms do not always get clean
College Freshman,1,Do not have sports must attend Morehouse College Sports
College Freshman,1,Spelman is soooo tedious with the financial aspect i always find myself asking is it still worth it.
College Freshman,1,"It is not easy AT ALL to find housing around here. Either it is affordable and amongst a DANGEROUS neighborhood, or it is safe and EXTREMELY OVERPRICED (due to the fact that we are so close to downtown Atlanta)."
College Freshman,1,"I'm not sure if it's just the freshman dorms that are this disgusting, but these dorms are filthy. The cleaning staff are really nice women, but to be perfectly honest, they do not do the best job keeping up with the maintenance of this building."
College Freshman,1,There are no sports teams at Spelman whatsoever!!!
College Freshman,1,"Besides the fact that there isn't much around here but fast food restaurants, the people that work there are very rude and the location isn't all that great either."
College Sophomore,1,Sports has been taken away from Spelman entirely.
College Sophomore,1,"There is so much need for money for the students, but very selective as well for giving out financial aid."
College Freshman,1,The college itself does not offer financial aid. Outside scholarships and aid is accepted and a fairly easy transaction.
College Freshman,1,"Spelman College is located in the worst neighborhood. The people who live in the West End are VERY unfriendly (and to be honest, a little scary). Atlanta requires a car to get around so if you don't you're kind of out of luck. The ""mall"" by the college is an embarrassment. If you safely make it into downtown Atlanta and all the surrounding cities, there are a million and one things to do."
College Senior,1,it is mostly fast food resturants
College Senior,1,I'm not really into that
College Junior,1,"It's mainly McDonald's, Checkers, Burger Kings, Popeyes and Taco Bell."
College Junior,1,It snowed twice in one month. Both times I was out of school for the entire week. Terrible.
College Junior,1,"They're very strict which prevents a lot of fun events from happening on campus, even if there's no alcohol or drugs involved."
College Freshman,1,Again you will hate visitation rules!
College Freshman,1,There's no athletic's here at Spelman
College Freshman,1,"Spelman College is known for being very ""stingy"" when it comes to financial aid. Very few students are given any aid at all. Even some top tier students are attending Spelman with little to no financial aid, me being one of them. I have not recieved any financial aid from Spelman College despite my 4.0 high school GPA and my acceptance into the very selective Spelman College Honors Program."
College Freshman,1,"I was blessed and received a non-school specific scholarship that covered all of my cost. The school only gives each incoming class 20 full scholarships, it is hard out there for a pimp."
College Freshman,1,Spelman got rid of their athletic program to save money
College Freshman,1,There is no off campus housing that is offered by the school
College Freshman,1,There are very minimal amounts of scholarships for students. The financial aid faculty is not of much help either. They portray an atmosphere of not caring. 
College Junior,1,There used to be athletics at Spelman but the president got rid of the athletic department a year ago so there are no sports at Spelman unfortunately. 
College Sophomore,1,"There is no such thing as athletics at Spelman. Spelman is more worried about the fitness of the students, not the sports."
College Sophomore,1,"So, we don't have sports, but we have this wellness revolution, where you can still get fit. We are improving in our sports department but as of now it needs much improvement. "
College Sophomore,1,Seeing a white person on campus is like seeing an unicorn.
College Sophomore,1,"I was almost certain that I would be able to get a considerable amount of financial aid, but I received none from Spelman. I had to stay on top of them to make sure my outside financial aid was handled. Spelman doesn't offer very much aid and their work study program is very unorganized."
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid is very poor which really saddens me. I have had a hard time getting a small scholarship of only $2,000 for Spelman and they do not give scholarships out regularly. The small scholarships they have awarded me barely make a dent in the yearly $40,000 tuition."
College Freshman,1,"Spelman only has TWO shuttles that run at random times, making it very hard to travel outside of campus at particular times. Im a freshman so I don't have a car and too often the shuttle services don't take students to useful locations. I don't think this is fair. "
College Freshman,1,"The food here is a disgrace, The cafeteria although nice in appearance has been experiencing serious sanitary issues. Spelman MUST do better."
College Junior,1,"There are scholarships at Spelman, but the school will try to get you to pull out a loan first. They really do not advertise scholarships at Spelman, jsut state or national scholarships anyone can get. You also have to be pretty much homeless or willing to sell your soul for work study."
College Freshman,1,I didnt receive any scholarship from Spelman at all.
College Sophomore,1,"At Spelman, students focus is on academics, because of this there is little to no support for student athletes. The athletic program in fact is so small, and serves such a small amount of students, that the program is being cancelled after the 2012-2013 school year. However in the next years Spelman is going to through a large renovation to read hall, the athletic center, to provide a better area for students to workout. Wellness Revelation is what the project is called."
College Sophomore,1,"Coming from a big city, Atlanta is nowhere near easy to navigate. MARTA (the transportation system) is spotty at best; trains don't run frequently (average wait time is 15-20 minutes), bus maps are indecipherable, and it shuts off at midnight or 1am depending on the day, leaving anyone out late at night stranded. The easiest way to get around is by car, which freshman aren't allowed to have, and even if they could, the streets are confusing (they go in a circle and there are about 15 different Peachtree Streets), and getting around on the highway, a popular option, is dangerous, as Atlanta drivers are notorious for being speed demons and frequently breaking traffic laws."
College Freshman,1,"The sports teams are very little known and that's if there is a team. We do not have many teams, all are Division III, and the athletics program is being cut."
College Junior,1,Good food is hard to find. Will require an adventure to the West End!
College Junior,1,The parking deck fees are fairly high. Sucks that I have to pay 4$ for 2hrs?? Permits are not an option for students who are struggling financially. If you attempt to park on campus for call b4 5pm you will get ugly orange stickers posted on your driver's side window. Parking at Spelman College is horrible for a broke commuter student. Something needs to be fixed ASAP.
College Junior,1,"I thought the 11,000 dollars in housing would at least give me air but I was wrong. I was sweating bullets every time hot seasons came in. Bring your fans. Only few dorms have air. Also living space is veryyy small. both roomies i had stole my clothes. I was soo happy to move off after they decided to not give me and a bunchhh of others no housing"
College Freshman,1,"Not Very Competitive – I am only entering my freshman year at Spelman. I went online to look for intramural sports and there weren't any. So I decided to look at the regular sports teams. And most of them weren't as competitive as I expected. It is a liberal arts college, so the focus isn't on winning as many games as possible."
College Freshman,1,"Super Strict – I am only entering Spelman in the fall and I already know how strict the school is. The campus is dry, there are no parties . Everything is supposed to happen off campus. If you are in a relationship or are talking to someone, go to their room. If you are caught hooking up with anyone they make you do a ""walk of shame."" You have to walk down the hallway of the dorm you were in and everyone living their watches. Just don't get caught doing anything stupid"
College Sophomore,1,I got absolutely no financial aid from Spelman College.
College Junior,1,"I know they want to keep the traditional setting on campus but the freshman, sophomore, and junior dorms need to be updated."
College Sophomore,1,Sexual Orientation – The LGBTQ community is not accepted for the most part.
College Sophomore,1,The area around the housing for students is extremely unsafe. There are non college students living there from low income families making the area not the best place to live for a college student.
College Freshman,1,Not Alot of Whites – The majority of the student are black. The school is really focused on black pride!

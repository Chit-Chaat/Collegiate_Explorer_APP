Junior,5,It's amazing the core forces me to learn things that are outside my comfort zone which improves me as a person.
Sophomore,5,I was impressed at how UD handled the adjustment to online classes due to covid-19. They were very understanding and prepared for any scenario. The level of learning was the same as in-person and the professors were just the same.
Sophomore,5,"The professors, people, staff, and Core are amazing! I am a science major and it feels like I am double majoring in Biology and the Core, but it is totally worth it. You learn so much and bond with so many people it feels like home. The liberal arts education given at UD is better than I expected. If it were easy it wouldn't be worthwhile, I love the challenging classes."
Graduate Student,5,"I have recently applied to a graduate program at UD.  Upon being accepted, the faculty have been open and inviting.  I like the family atmosphere and I am excited about beginning my college experience at UD."
Niche User,5,"I love the sense of community you feel as soon as you step onto campus. The students are all so friendly, and the professors are ready to help you anytime.  The campus is settled not too far from Downtown Dallas-Fort Worth, it is a short trip to even more fun for a night out with friends,"
Graduate Student,5,Excellent University that fosters independent thought and has excellent professors. My favorite part of this university is that the class to teacher ratio is perfect and allows students to really gain an understanding of class subjects
Niche User,5,"The community is great and the academics are stellar! I would like to see a change in the campus appearance because it is not very attractive. However, the people are very friendly and helpful, and my visits have been all positive!"
Freshman,5,"I found out about UD through their basketball program.  I instantly felt like family and everyone there was so nice.  The counselors, coaching staff, players, professors, and even the cafeteria cooks.  The campus is beautiful and and small enough to easily walk to all the classes.  The student body is all connected and has multiple fun traditions every year.  The business program is amazing and very promising for the graduates earning that degree.  The opportunity to visit Rome for a semester is something I loom forward to.  The University as a whole is a great place to be at to earn your education."
Junior,5,"I would recommend attending the University of Dallas because of the rigorous academics and the tight-knit community. With a strong liberal arts core program, UD provides a solid foundation for all of its students to build upon. The focus is not just on getting a degree; instead, the focus is on how this education will form you as a person. The professors have high expectations but are invested in your education, with many opportunities for one on one interactions.The community at UD is a product of this holistic approach to education. Authentic community is cultivated campus-wide, providing students the opportunity to belong to a family much larger than themselves. The University of Dallas cares about the success of each individual student and is continuing to provide successful independent thinkers who are prepared to change the world."
Freshman,5,I love everything about UD. The campus is beautiful and the people are amazing. One thing I would change is the gym.
Sophomore,5,"The University of Dallas fosters an independent education and teaches students how to approach problems in the real world with a foundation in classical resources. The students attracted to UD are hard workers, naturally intelligent, love celebrating life and love making deep and meaningful friendships. Thank you UD for helping me be the best person I can be!"
Freshman,5,"When you're told that the professors genuinely care about their students, don't just dismiss that information as biased or exaggerated. It's true. The professors ACTUALLY care about their students. Sure, you'll meet a few odd ones out from that description here and there, but you'll quickly find that, for the most part, it's 100% true. When it comes to the academics, coursework is often very difficult, but a good type of challenging and thought-provoking. Come to this university willing and wanting to learn. You want a solid education? You're going to get a solid education. Student life is EXTRAORDINARILY active. There's literally always something new and exciting happening on campus. The overall student body attitude is one of hard work and motivation to sally forth and CONQUER this whole education thing. Campus life is one of faith, friendship, and joy."
Junior,5,"The University of Dallas is really a top of the line school. If you want a good classical education that will prepare you for anything and that will make you a better human being, this is the place to be."
Niche User,5,"When I went to go visit the University at Dallas I was impressed of what a different environment I saw to where I am from. Different people, different cultures, diversity, etc. I like this University since the first time i visited my cousin. I've seen my cousin has done well and she's received a lot of help from the professors and staff. I chose this university because I know I will have great experiences and i will make history. Also When I went I got informed of all the majors they had and they had a variety of them and even better the ones I'm interested in. Hope I get accepted and have the best experience like my cousin did."
Alum,5,"I agree with everyone who said the professors are exceptional, the students are friendly, etc. However, as a graduate in the sixties, I want to mention something from an older point of view. An incredible number of students have met their spouses at U.D. (I met my husband there) and many offspring attend U.D. (our oldest daughter graduated from U.D. and our granddaughter is now a junior). My U.D. education enabled me to become a freelance writer, instructor, editor, and volunteer for a number of causes. I'll love U.D. forever for everything it gave me and highly recommend it to anyone who wants an extraordinary education."""
Junior,5,"The professors are extremely knowledgable and caring. Financial aid is very helpful and works hard to make sure that you can afford to attend college. I feel like an individual here. Not only do my professors know me by name and care for me, but so do many of the administration workers."
Junior,5,"I love the atmosphere at UD. It's exciting, it's eager, it's fulfilling. Students are motivated to do well and better themselves as they move toward entering the work force, where they'll make a real impact through the Core classes and exceptional staff offered by the University of Dallas. I look forward to joining the ranks of the alumni."
Junior,5,"The University of Dallas is a 4-year Catholic liberal arts school. The university has an awesome core curriculum that every student takes for a total of 60-70 credits. I find this very useful as students are able to gain both a wide array of knowledge useful in other classes, as well as direct you towards a field of study that interests you. UD has an amazing study abroad program for a semester in Rome, which is really a capstone to the end of the core studies that allows for an overall grasp of what you have studied the past few years. The teachers are brilliant and are always willing to help you learn, as well as classes are small which allows for meaningful class discussions a lot of times. The students are all so kind and helpful, as the campus is arguably one of the safest in the country with little to no crime. The only thing I would change about my school would just be renovating the campus to a more modern era style. Overall, this school gets a 5/5 stars!"
Sophomore,5,"Equipped with a rigorous core curriculum and a close-knit community, UD is a nourishing campus. Some crusaders may complain about the reading done at UD, but UD teaches its students the truth about living. We’ve all read Homer, Milton and Dante by the end of our first year in addition to Aristotle, Plato and Aquinas! It’s not just an education based on the sciences but a well-rounded one. The campus is built with boring architecture but within those walls are a family of students and staff who hold on to unique traditions. Groundhog week is only a sneak peek into the energetic and creative life of a crusader. I love UD if there was anything I could improve at UD that would be the Asian Food section in the cafeteria!"
Junior,5,UD is a fantastic school to study the liberal arts. If you want to perfect your writing skills this is the perfect place to be.
Freshman,5,"The University of Dallas really is a “Catholic University for independent thinkers.” It’s small campus makes for an intimate, supportive community."
Junior,5,"Great academics, the athletic program is small but full of great people. The professors are wonderful and the classes have about 20 students."
Freshman,5,"University of Dallas is such an amazing school! If you want to make incredible friends and have a great,  faith filled education this is the perfect school and is the best decision I ever made!"
Niche User,5,I absolutely adore the small campus. I come from a fairly large high school so the quaint size of this college is a nice change. All the teachers and staff were very nice and helpful while the students were close knit. It is a fantastic campus.
Junior,5,"The Catholic culture is what first drew me to apply, but the academics and community keep me here. UD does not shy away from difficult questions. There are often panels of professors and noted intellectuals that debate difficult topics. This is a university that graduates thinkers. 
My professors have been the people who push me to my limits, but they have formed me into a thinker, a questioner, and a lover of liberal arts. The professors really care about each individual student, and some will go to great and enormous lengths to stick their neck out for you. They truly want you to succeed.
I love this university more than bankrupt human language can describe. If you want a college experience like a refiner's fire- excruciating at the time, but come out purified and strong- then the University of Dallas is for you. If you can't take the heat, however... come see that we can prove you wrong, that you can do more than you ever thought you could."
Junior,5,UD is a great liberal arts college right outside of Dallas. Everyone has to study works such as Dante's Divine Comedy and Descartes's Meditations.  This is something that not many other colleges does. Although the college is small there is a great sense of community.
Freshman,5,"The University of Dallas is the perfect place for any student seeking to broaden their minds and engage with the world and academics on a new and deeper level. The courses are rigorous, but the homework is not busy work; rather, it guides the student to grasp the material and uncover the value of the work. The campus is small, but the people studying at your side are some of the best, most intelligent, and kindest people you will meet, and they share a love of learning and self-improvement that is hard to find elsewhere. The professors genuinely care about their students and want them to achieve what they have set out to achieve. All told, UD is exactly what a college should be: a place where learning, growth, and companionship are encouraged and expanded in new ways."
College Senior,5,"Academics is a very strong point for the university.  The core curriculum has 60 credits and offers classes on subjects such as philosophy, theology, economics, biology, history, and politics.  The professors know what they are talking about and are always willing to explain and further expand on their subject with students.  The workload is tough and it takes a while to adjust, but with tutoring, other students, and professors' office hours, there are a lot of resources offered to students."
College Senior,5,There is not much drug presence on campus and when there are drug related situations it is handled well.
College Senior,5,"The professors are amazing.  They are all very well spoken and know their field extremely well. They offer a lot of office hours, and when their hours don't work with your schedule, they're very willing to set aside time for yo."
College Senior,5,"This school has been an amazing experience, it has really shaped me as a person.  The classes are challenging, but also have pushed me to think in a way I didn't before. The professors are really there to help their students, they love what they do and want to make sure others succeed at it too. The small size of the school is great because I have really gotten to know a lot of the students and there is always a familiar face around."
College Junior,5,"The University of Dallas is a unique liberal arts school, located in one of the best cities. Our rigorous academic programs,  desire to learn, cultural experiences learned from our Rome campus and strong faith life on campus are some of the best qualities of the school."
College Senior,5,I've loved all of the courses I've taken here. Our small class size allows the professors to really get to know the students and allows for great interactions. The Socratic Seminar style classes are excellent for the many discussion based classes. The professors really care about their students and want to see us succeed.
College Senior,5,"Perfect school for me. We have a really unique Core program and study abroad program in Rome. With our own campus and professors we have the advantage of a program of the same high standard with immense opportunity for travel and widening the learning experience. The campus community is incredibly valuable; the people here all value academics and experience and really look out for each other. There are academic, athletic, and travel opportunities, as well as the opportunity to increase one's faith life. They are constantly working to address student's issues and concerns. The University of Dallas has provided me with a place to pursue academics, understand other cultures, foster meaningful relationships, and become a person I'm proud to be."
College Sophomore,5,The varsity athletics program is great but does not overwhelm the academics. The athletes work hard at both athletics and school. The intramural sports are huge on campus and everyone enjoys them and loves to come watch.
College Sophomore,5,University of Dallas is an incredible university where I can be myself and truly grow as a person. The students are open and friendly and the professors truly love to work with the students. The campus is earthy and homey and the facilities and helpful and useful. The living possibilities on campus and around the campus are affordable and nice and I always feel safe.
College Junior,5,"The professors at the University of Dallas are experts in their fields and passionate about the topics they teach. Class sizes are always small, making it easy to maintain a discourse with your professors and fellow classmates. The Core curriculum has a very holistic purpose, designed to offer a top-notch liberal arts education to every student, regardless of their major."
College Sophomore,5,"There are some things that I wish were improved. For example, the buildings are pretty old and our campus isn't that pretty. Most people get sick of the food. It's things like that that I wish were improved... but the people are so great that they make up for what is lacking. The people make it the beautiful place that it is!"
College Sophomore,5,"I am very lucky to be able to attend this fine institution. High expectations make for great learning environments. The atmosphere is small and not right for everybody, but those who choose to endure the work load, high tuition, and soaring expectations reap unbelievable benefits and knowledge. The Rome program allows students to engage in cultures across the world, and learn from some of our greatest ancestors."
College Freshman,5,You can leave your door wide open
College Freshman,5,The school is challenging and people recognize that
College Junior,5,"The Workload is tough, but not unmanageable"
College Junior,5,Everyone bonds through the tough courses
College Freshman,5,"Although the workload is strenuous, the courses are very worthwhile."
College Freshman,5,I find the courses to be both challenging and thought provoking. The professors are extremely helpful and the class sizes are perfect.
College Freshman,5,"This university is a very challenging institution regarding academics, yet it is also extremely valuable in the way that it incorporates varied aspects of studies within every course."
College Freshman,5,The school is active and inviting as well as the students
College Sophomore,5,"Big enough to always meet new people but small campus, so it's easy to get around. Good for intelligent, hardworking people who also enjoy a party. I trust that most people I meet are decently moral people. Most students are friendly and kind. Academics are good. I enjoy the Great Books program, despite being terrible at papers."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The women are well dressed, smart, and easy to talk to. It's no wonder so many people leave engaged!"
Recent Alumnus,5,MacNab Pitch is so sick!
Recent Alumnus,5,Greek life is the best because the only Greek life is while in Rome. Aka there are no frats.
Recent Alumnus,5,Old Mill is the place to be!
Recent Alumnus,5,The people are wonderful to be around and everyone is incredibly inviting.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Fairly strict, but in hindsight I wouldn't want it any other way."
Recent Alumnus,5,Nearly everyone gets a fairly decent scholarship.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Everyone is incredibly friendly and welcoming. Also, it is a wet campus!"
College Freshman,5,"A typical internship will be to shadow a medical personnel, the pay, time commitment, and responsibilities varies. I plan to have an internship as soon as possible because it is crucial for my medical experience, and for my resume to medical school."
College Freshman,5,i couldnt ask for more.
College Freshman,5,I usually go to the Whataburger a couple of miles away from school and it's great.
College Junior,5,My particular major has a great support system and allows for great relationship building opportunities
Freshman,4,So far it's been okay. I haven't seen much because classes just started. There's a lot of people here for us and we can get help as long as we ask for it.
Junior,4,Covid-19 was a shock but the campus corrected accordingly and it's was a great success. Even that art classes managed to switch to an online format.
Niche User,4,"I attended University of Dallas for two years of undergraduate studies. The first year and a half was as a seminarian (studying for the priesthood) and a semester as a regular student. Academics are quite rigorous but enriching at the same time. You can meet various people from the U.S. and some international. The one thing to consider is tuition, which is pretty high. Overall, they have an outstanding liberal arts curriculum (especially philosophy and theology; along with the CORE) and can teach you to appreciate the classical studies or studies in general."
Freshman,4,My experience at UD thus far has been amazing. The teachers truly do care about their scholars and support our success and growth tremendously.
Freshman,4,I like how small the campus is and how the professors really do take the time to know each student. I also love how quiet the campus is and how nice the people are.
Graduate Student,4,I have not yet started at this school but they gave me a chance to prove my self in academia when i didn't think anyone else would
Sophomore,4,"It's like kinda pretty good if you like, you know, going to college and that sorta stuff. The weather's nice, but hot and it rains sometimes."
Senior,4,"A fantastic Catholic University with a vibrant campus culture that is oriented towards strang academics and genuine faith. The buildings are all ugly (especially the monstrosity of a structure Cardinal Farrell Hall) but it is what they contain that is so vital to this university.
A highly dedicated staff with a long line of superstar professors sets up an environment among the teachers which encourages them to excel. This, in turn, benefits the students who continue to receive an education that has been recognized as one of the best offered by any Catholic University.
The university also has a great overseas program where sophomores go to Rome to study the classics (part of the core curriculum)."
Freshman,4,"it was a very safe university that made me feel welcome and accepted no matter where i went on campus, but i would like to see majors that reflect new trends developing in society"
Sophomore,4,"It's quite the place. You either love the Core or hate it, and if you hate it, you probably leave. It fosters a unique student that really learns to be an ""independent thinker""."
Niche User,4,"When I approached on campus for the first time , it surprised me to find that all the students were welcoming. The feeling you get when on campus is the definition of southern hospitality . I recommend more people to attend this school and receiving all the benefits this school has to offer."
Niche User,4,"All the staff at the University of Dallas were really welcoming. I would not mind going to the college to attend school because of how strong the Liberal Arts and Business programs are there. Plus, they have a Rome program to travel to a different country is exhilerating. Although it is expensive they do give you a financial aid package that covers most of your costs to attend the University of Dallas. The staff do really care about you and your existence is definitely fulfilling its needs as a valued college school."
Freshman,4,"It's a very nice college, with a root in classical education. There's a large workload, though, so if you aren't prepared for that, it may not be best for you."
Senior,4,"UD is a place where you can decide who you want to be.  I like how students have to take the same core classes, but you get to choose a major, unlike other similar liberal arts colleges .  I love the weird traditions (a lot of them organized by students), the way we read actual texts instead of just textbooks, the way you can get to know people due to the smaller class sizes, and meet inspiring people. 

On the other hand, the cafeteria food isn't amazing and the meal plan is mandatory while you live on campus.  It's hard for commuter students to get involved with events on campus since so many fun events happen at night.  The Cold War style architecture isn't exactly gorgeous (though it's grown on me due to familiarity)."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Dallas is a very small campus but has a huge strong community.   Sports are limited but being right by Dallas, you can do anything."
Sophomore,4,"I have been attending the University of Dallas for almost two complete years now, and it has been a fairly good experience. The school's core consists of many classes that all students (regardless of their major) have to take, which is pretty annoying. But the classes are not too difficult, so that compensates for the amount of classes that are required. The professors are generally very nice and helpful, and each department provides free tutoring for all students. Tuition is a bit pricy, but there are multiple opportunities to receive financial aid. The dormitories are pretty nice as well, especially Clark hall (typically sophomores and juniors live there, and each room has it's own walk in closet and private bathroom). The only thing I really dislike is the community itself. I have encountered many rude and pretentious students, but that is not too much of a setback. The University of Dallas is a great University to attend for the students seeking a liberal arts education."
Senior,4,"I like the strong academics at this university as well as the friendly and fun atmosphere in the community of students. There seems to be a place for everyone. The location of the school is excellent. It is situated in Irving Texas (which I love Irving!) and is 20 minutes outside of Dallas. The school offers a ""once in a lifetime"" study abroad experience in Rome, Italy. I highly recommend this study abroad program- you will not regret going to study and travel in Europe for a semester!"
College Senior,4,"The liberal arts education prepares students to succeed in any field. Learning from a variety of subjects allows students to be able to hold an intellectual conversation with almost anyone.  The Office of Career Development works to bring in quality employers such as Southwest Airlines.  They offer many opportunities for students to participate in recruiting events, mock inerviews, etc."
College Senior,4,"Overall, I feel extremely safe on this campus. There are always students around, so even walking back at night you're not all by yourself. Campus Safety is always driving around campus and responsive to calls."
College Junior,4,"Living on campus means you are close to all your classes and puts you more in the center of the social scene. Freshmen live in the freshmen dormitories, sophomores and juniors live in either the new Clark Hall or student apartments. Freshmen have more of the traditional style rooms with two beds in one room. Sophomores and juniors have the ability to choose between a single, double or triple room in Clark Hall. They each have their own bathrooms and the triples have individual rooms for each resident. Campus housing usually goes by seniority, so getting into the on campus apartments can be a little challenging. Overall, the housing is close to everything you need on campus, the only downside being that you have to purchase the meal plan."
College Senior,4,"They do a great job of impressing upon us how important it is to network and get your name and face out there. Hosting many job fairs, recruitment events, and helping us to understand the opportunities available to us is a great asset."
College Senior,4,I've never felt unsafe on campus. The students and faculty/staff are all really nice and quality people; I've never had a problem.
College Senior,4,"Housing is sufficient for freshman year with the dormitory style, and even better with suite-style housing options for sophomores/juniors. They are conveniently located close to classes, the cafeteria, and the gym. The space you have is definitely good living space."
College Junior,4,"I'm not involved personally in any sports teams, but my friends really enjoy their experiences with sports. We have a pretty decent Fitness Center and a lot of school spirit. We're small, but we're passionate and dedicated to our institution!"
College Junior,4,"I consistently feel comfortable and safe being on campus as a single young female. No matter the time of day, I have confidence in the capability of our security office and confidence in the caliber of my peers' character. I have never been placed in a situation on campus where I felt unreasonably threatened."
College Junior,4,"I am very satisfied with my experience at the University of Dallas. I am challenged by my peers and my professors, and encouraged to venture beyond my comfort zone in both educational opportunities and social activities. I love being near Dallas, TX because the internship and employment opportunities are so plentiful."
College Sophomore,4,"The University of Dallas really prepares students to become a part of the working world, and many majors require internships before graduation. The University works well with students to ensure they are following the best path that will take them to where they want and need to be in order to succeed."
College Sophomore,4,"I have had a bike stolen on campus, however, campus Security can always be found in a short amount of time. They are quick to respond and very personable to students.  One of our officers is know as ""Super Dave""."
College Sophomore,4,"Though relitavely expensive, campus housing is extremely nice compared to an average dorm. Clark Hall, the primary placement for upperclassmen, has dorms with three individual rooms, three sinks, a living area, a toilet room and a shower room. It is perfect for three residents; all it is missing is a kitchen. The freshmen dorms are also spacious. There is a sink in each room, large windows, and a community restroom."
College Sophomore,4,"The University of Dallas is a close-nit university with professors who are passionate about what they teach and work for the success of the students as they too continue to learn and grow. True wisdom,  the how and why are sought with enthusiasm and discussion of class topics are often had around campus. Though the student body is small, it is diverse and true Christian love can be seen and felt all around by students, professors, faculty, and staff. Located only 20 minutes from downtown Dallas, there is always something to see or do. 

The University of Dallas has made itself my home. It has accepted my individuality and passion for Christ with enthusiasm and has unlocked and fed potential I didn't know I had."
College Junior,4,"UD has a small enough campus to make it feel more secluded, but has enough ""green space"" to make it not feel claustrophobic."
College Junior,4,UD challenges me constantly to expand on what I have already learned and each class seems to show different facets of the world that further increase my love for it.
College Sophomore,4,the Campus is pretty safe. There have been many student government panels about ways to increase safety on campus as well as a sexual assault awareness campaign.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are nothing glamorous or luxurious, but the social atmosphere on campus is great."
College Sophomore,4,"The people at the University of Dallas are amazing. The students as well as the teachers are genuine, kind, and brilliant."
College Freshman,4,Each course is extremely challenging but you learn
College Sophomore,4,The school goes to great lengths to ensure the safety and security of the student's
College Sophomore,4,"The University of Dallas is excellent in its post grad job opportunities. In numerous fields UD grads are highly respected and looked at, opportunities always made available to those who work hard and are dedicated while in school"
College Sophomore,4,"It has been a wonderful and fulfilling experience so far to be attending the University of Dallas. It was not my first choice, but when I came here I knew it was where I belonged, the rigorous schooling and unique academic culture I know will help me someday, as a critically thinking, well rounded professional in today's world"
College Junior,4,There is very little theft.
College Junior,4,The career/development office sends lots of emails
College Junior,4,"The courses are challenging, but rewarding"
College Junior,4,"The freshman dorms are great, West hall is the best"
College Freshman,4,"The campus security has a definite presence, and I have no fear for my personal safety."
College Sophomore,4,"I love studying at the University of Dallas! The school's focus is definitely academics and community, and you can see it all over campus. No matter where you go on campus, there are little tables and chairs, big windows and good lighting. I love the discussions I get into on a daily basis with the people around me, whether I know them well or not. The campus is pretty, too. A bit old, having not been seriously renovated since its establishment in 1956, but nonetheless charming. I really like studying here. It suits my personality perfectly-- quiet, studious, and friendly!"
College Junior,4,the professors are amazing. the environment is exactly what i need. liberal arts with diverse opinions and ideas and vivid discussions. students getting into the real classic education.
College Freshman,4,I love the student to teacher ratio and that they are willing to help you when you're struggling. They even know you by name and a little bit about you where else can you find that?
Recent Alumnus,4,"Tons and tons of options being in DFW, but nothing in walking distance."
Recent Alumnus,4,Decent selection. They've made tremendous improvements and continue to make them.
College Freshman,4,If you have a way of transportation you can get just about anywhere and get a decent meal.
College Freshman,4,The Irving/Dallas area has a lot of great food options but some take a while to get to on the DART or require a car to visit.
College Freshman,4,Campus is very strict on things like visiting hours in dorms
College Freshman,4,The school is great about financial aid and works really hard to make students able to attend.
College Freshman,4,Most parties take place off campus in the apartments that most upperclassmen choose to live in instead of the dorms. There's usually stuff going on Fridays and Saturdays and sometimes Thursdays as well.
College Freshman,4,Going to games is great b/c everyone shows spirit.
College Freshman,4,They are very nice and helpful when needed.
College Freshman,4,Here at UD alot of people are athletically involved.
College Freshman,4,great people make for great parties.
College Freshman,4,"The administration is awesome I have had no problems with them, especially the RA's"
College Freshman,4,The rugby team is really big at UD
Junior,2,"The academics are good, but attendance is REQUIRED by almost all professors-most of my professors are willing to drop someone from the course if they have missed more than four classes.There is a two year program of required core courses covering all subjects required to graduate.  This is well rounded, but the courses are often  difficult for required courses and I know students who have lost their scholarships for courses they failed in (that had nothing to do with their major) 
The administration is messy--many I know have been overcharged, undercharged, or otherwise shortchanged by the business office, which struggles to get things done or communicate with itself.  The food is poor.  The internet is also bad quality. Mainly due to the horrendous trouble the business office has put myself and everyone else I know through, when my brother started searching for colleges I advised him to search somewhere else."
College Freshman,2,There isn't any school spirit for sports
College Freshman,2,Housing visitation hours are the earliest I have ever heard of. Even if you are a couple minutes past you will get written up and have to pay the fine.
College Freshman,2,"Not worth the amount of money we have to pay. I would rather not be on the unlimited plan because I eat no more than 2 meals a day in the caf. I rarely even it 1. The menu is the same every week and you can count on it. Except, they do run out of quite a few things and fruit is not always available"
College Freshman,2,The apartments directly off campus are not nice but they are convenient and the low cost of living makes up for it. Many live there junior/senior year.
College Freshman,2,Must drive or take dart to go off campus.
College Freshman,2,"Old Mill is pretty sketchy, but cheap."
College Sophomore,2,Nightlife is sparse. You need to basically host it yourself if you want something fun to happen. Most of the times it's just drinking and talking. People here don't have good taste in music.
College Sophomore,2,It's pretty strict. No girls in dorms with door closed.
College Sophomore,2,"Everything is more than a two mile radius, so it's hard to walk anywhere to get something to eat. If you have a car, it takes about 5 minutes to get to the closest food place."
College Freshman,2,"not many options to choose from. the same thing is generally served everyday.
good news: i lost 20 pounds from starting school here. "
College Freshman,2,"Drinking in your dorm if you are underage will get you a $150 fine (at least) the first time. Getting alcohol write ups also affects your ability to go to Rome for a semester. I don't know what they do for drug use, but I also don't want to find out. Also, open house hours only go til 1 on weekends and 10 during the week, so you can't have people of the opposite gender in your room after that. You also need to bolt open your door  by turning the bolt so the door can't close when people of the opposite gender are in your room. I didn't know about these ridiculous policies before I came here, they are honestly bulls***. As for attendance, if you miss 4 hours of class you can be dropped from that class; you do get a warning first."
College Freshman,2,"To dine off campus you have to drive 5 minutes for McDonalds, Whataburger, and a few other small non-chain places. Driving about 15-20 minutes up MacArthur you have more fastfood like In-n-out and Taco Bell, but also some chain restaurants including Red Hot and Blue. At the same plaza as that there are a few other restaurants including a great steakhouse called the Ranch. Biggest problem with off campus dining is that you have to drive there."
College Freshman,2,You need a car to do anything off campus in Irving. Otherwise you can take the DART into Dallas.
College Junior,2,"Because UD is a private Catholic university, there is little diversity. However, I feel that the student body is open and accepts different cultures and traditions. There will always be those that are eager to introduce these new customs into out society."
College Sophomore,2,"Most people don't come to the school for sports, its more the academics."
College Sophomore,2,"The drug scene is not a big thing here, the school focuses more on academics. Yes, if you want alcohol or weed you can get, like any other college."
College Junior,2,"A majority of students are white so the university is not very diverse. As it is a Catholic University over 80% of students are Catholic, but students of other faiths and denominations are more than welcome. Though not incredibly diverse, you can find people of all different backgrounds here."
College Junior,2,"The nightlife here varies according to your crowd. If you have a car, it's easy to go into Dallas (10-15 minutes away) and go to any number of venues there. If you don't, plan on hanging out or drinking."
College Senior,2,There are no fast food places close by.  You have to drive for a quite a bit before you hit anything close.  Actual restaurants are a little bit farther after that.
College Sophomore,1,It is wholly non existent
College Junior,1,The Roman's destroyed Greek life
College Sophomore,1,"I have one of the hardest majors at UD: Biochemistry. Biology and chemistry. The only way it could be harder is if they added physics into it: Biophysical Chemistry, or something. Gen phys is a requirement for all science majors, so there is no escaping that."
College Sophomore,1,The University of Dallas is actually located in Irving Texas.  Which is strictly a residential city.
College Sophomore,1,The only dinning option on campus is Aramark. It is bad.
College Sophomore,1,"There are small gatherings across the street from campus in the Tower Village apartment complex.  However, I would not call them parties."
College Sophomore,1,We have one gentlemen's club attempting to become an official fraternity. However there are no sororities.
College Sophomore,1,You will be forced to stay on campus until you are a senior or are 21 years of age.  It sucks.
College Freshman,1,"We have one service fraternity, no housing for the ""Greek Life"". They just perform community service and do some other things, but I don't really know what else they do. Some people are trying to bring a chapter of a real fraternity here but the administration is likely to shut it down, as they have several times in the past few years."
College Sophomore,1,There really is not that much and if you want to do it then that is up to you.
College Junior,1,Terrible athletic center- its almost always closed and the hours vary randomly. Hardly any fitness classes offered and the pool is closed during the majority of the year when students are actually on campus but open during school holidays...?
College Freshman,1,"The party scene is limited. Dallas has some clubs. The on-campus parties are at the upperclassmen housing across the street. If you're looking for a party school, this is NOT it."
College Freshman,1,Way Too Strict – the rules are ridiculous.  especially for curfew.  it makes no sense that guys and girls must leave the others' rooms at 10 pm on weeknights.  especially since there are few places you can hang out alone or with a small group privately
College Freshman,1,can never get rides anywhere.  good places downtown dallas but very unlikely to go there.  too expensive and far.  so we just eat at chipotle or chilis but even that is rare

Senior,5,"I took online classes and it went well. They are very fast paced and systematic, so it's very orderly."
Junior,5,"PNW is a good school, with mostly good teachers. I am a first generation college student so I wasn't aware of this until recently, but many of my friends parents went to school in the exact same buildings as we are now learning in. The parents have said that not much has changed for several of the buildings, and that we probably even sat in the same desks as them from 40+ years ago!"
Freshman,5,"I really love this campus! It is not very big and all of the buildings connect to each other so you never have to get rained on! The staff is super supportive and really try to help as much as they can, everyone wants to see you succeed here."

Niche User,5,"I had my first visit at Purdue Northwest a couple weeks ago, which in my opinion was a great experience. I thought the campus was awesome,  but I can't wait to see how it looks in the spring and summer time. Looking at the dorms, I feel that they are very nice and has the perfect amount of room for up to four people."
Freshman,5,I currently go to school for Hospitality and Tourism Management. Purdue University Northwest has a school specifically for my major and its studies. I genuinely love it here and all of my professors have been friendly and personable. One thing I would like to see change is student engagement in after school activities.

Sophomore,5,"Purdue University Northwest is so far the best school to enter for anything involving mathematics, which is why I chose this school. I can’t wait to one day graduate and become a high school math teacher."
Freshman,5,PNW is a great school to commute to if you wanted to stay home for college. Any person enrolling for college can terrifying but PNW makes you feel welcomed and prepared for your education.
Junior,5,"I love the faculty and the student pride. I love the environment and how everyone is striving to make the school and each other better. From the classes, the library staying open extra hours randomly, from the teachers trying to make a personal genuine connection with the students."
Junior,5,I enjoy and feel comfortable being a non-traditional student at Purdue Northwest. They offer a wide variety of classes and they offer lock in tuition. The faculty are all very nice and accommodation
Graduate Student,5,Do I have to type something again? Honestly? I review this campus every month and I still have never won the scholarship. It doesn't feel fair.
Senior,5,"Formally known as Kaplan, Purdue is a great online school for busy individuals. Being a full time employee, mother of 2 and a wife, Purdue has given me the flexibility to tackle work, home and a higher education. 

Teachers and staff are available to assist with any needs students may have. Everyone staff member gives students the confidence they need to push through and make it to the finish line."
Freshman,5,Great people very friendly and eager to help people on whatever area of interest in which they choose to study
Freshman,5,"I enjoy attending Purdue Northwest. The community is very welcoming and comforting. I also enjoy taking my studies here, I can go to class and find a library to study. There is a cafeteria where I can eat and a couple cafes to pick up a snack."
Sophomore,5,"The campus is very diverse. Everyone is helpful and there to support.  Since most of the people at the campus are welcoming and have open arms, I feel more comfortable being there."
Senior,5,"The thing I like best about Purdue University Northwest is that it has such a homey feel. A lot of the people that go there have been around the same area for most of their lives so it feels comfortable and like I know a lot of people. I like how respectful teachers are, and how easy it is to get around campus."
Niche User,5,"I love this campus!! Even though the small size, it feels wide and open with the layout and beautiful landscaping."
Sophomore,5,"Purdue University Northwest is a great school. The teachers and tutoring is beyond helpful. I am one to struggle with school, but these people have helped tremendously. Quite frankly they made me confident in my schoolwork and that is something I have never had."
Freshman,5,Purdue Northwest is very welcoming. I’ve only attended the freshman orientation. At that point just for those few hours I saw a lot and rated Purdue Northwest on that. Purdue is cheerful and exciting the energy that the faculty brought was amazing. There were all smiling faces all participants in the Roar pride. Over all experience was out of this world awesome! They took you through the building and I thought it was very huge campus and was very clean. I even was able to meet some of the professors for business they were very nice. All the presentations were very confident in speaking looked like no nerves! That shows a lot about the school in education and confidence they give the students. Overall my experience with Purdue Northwest was an over the top experience and can not wait to continue all four of my years at the college.
Freshman,5,"The environment at Purdue University Northwest - Westville Campus is outstanding. I have yet to attend a class due to being an incoming freshman, but the environment and social scene is outstanding. Everyone on campus is very helpful and respectful. PNW’s scene is located in Westville between Michigan City and Valparaiso. You don’t have to travel very far to find something fun to do. Going to PNW is the best decision for me as I can commute from home and have a job while going to school. I plan on enjoying my time at PNW."
Sophomore,5,Super easy admission process! The advisors are by far the most helpful I have ever met. There are a ton of class options.
Niche User,5,"I am a transfer student, I attended the NSO and it was amazing. All of the staff was friendly and the environment was just reassuring. I am excited to start my journey at PNW. Roll Pride!!"

Freshman,5,"They are very accommodating to students who need extra help, whether that be in school, or outside factors that hinder your educational experience. If I could give any advice, it would be to use the resources available to you!"
Niche User,5,"It looks like it has a great engineering program. I have not attended this college yet, but I hear great things."
Niche User,5,I love the energy and the campus life the students give to this school. The dance team was absolutely amazing! My junior year in high school I went to a mini camp with the dance team and then came back later with my team to perform a dance at the half time of the girl's basketball game they had going on that day. I do plan in tryimg on the schools dance team when I start in the fall.
Sophomore,5,I first started purdue northwest when it was called purdue calumet in 2009. The school had a great support team. Their was always someone to talk to from your peers to the incredible staff. Purdue have everything you need to succeed in the four years you are there. My first i stayed on campus. The environment was safe and secured. I got a chance to meet so incredible people who i can call my friends. This all happen at my stay in the dorm. Overall my experience was awesome and I wouldn't trade it for any school. If I was to do it all over again i would definitely pick Purdue University Northwest. Thank you!!!
Freshman,5,"My experience at Purdu Northwest is awesome. Their are a lot of people there to help if you ever get stuck. The teachers that O had so far are very helpful. They make sure you have a good understanding of the course so you can successfully pass the class. The basketball team is great very entertaining. But unlike others school, Purdue Northwest doesn't have a football team which is sad. There's not a lot of parties at this college, and everyone seem more to themselves. The dorms are very nice which is made as a apartment very spaced out. Also it has plenty of programs for whatever major your going for. Overall I enjoy this school being a freshman and hopefully I experience more fun opportunities."
Junior,5,"It's a good school, the teachers want you learn and push you to get good grades but some are easy going as well. Student life feels more like community college and there is not much to do around. Overall , I enjoy the people around they are friendly and easy going. I will be join soccer next year and see how it goes. Other than that parties not really because no smoking or drinking are allow, which I hoped they would change it but doubt it."
Senior,5,"Purdue University Northwest is an excellent university for higher education. They rate top notch across the board from professors, wide variety of degree programs, and affordability."
Freshman,5,"My experience as it stand is good.  Going  to school  at 57 years old is not easy  my academic field of study Criminal justice  working on earning   BA degree. 
Purdue Global  University  offers very excellent student support  and I do see me earning  a degree."
Junior,5,"Really enjoy the faculty and the opportunities on and off campus.  The students are all very friendly, and even if you commute you get a real sense of involvement."
Junior,5,As a new student I can already say that I absolutely love the environment and the staff and professors. With any questions or problems I have had they have been the most helpful they could be and directed me into the right path. It is an honor to be able to attend this university and get the degree I want.
Freshman,5,"What I like about the Purdue Northwest  the most is that there are different people and resources you can go to in case you need help. Whether it's personal things about your student loans or class schedule, you always have someone to guide you the correct you. Your roommates are able to help you find your classes quickly and there's always different options in case your plan doesnt work out. I love how I can feel safe on a big campus and if you get lost one day, there's always someone around to help you."
Sophomore,5,Awesome study environment and awesome opportunities to grow as a community leader and a student as well
Junior,5,"I love attending Purdue University Northwest. I love that I can continue my education while still maintaining a job and having my own home. PNW makes it possible for anyone with a will to better themselves to do just that. The only thing that I wish was a little different is the way scheduling is run, since we have 2 campuses an hour apart from each other."
Junior,5,"I'd initially been apprehensive about PNW, for it hadn't been my first choice to attend, yet upon the start of my freshman year, I grew to love  the university and its quality of education. With class sizes ranging on the smaller side, students are granted a more personalized experience, allowing for better comprehension of subject material and more attentive professors. Coursework, albeit sometimes challenging, really prepares students for their majors and future careers while simultaneously expanding one's horizons. As an English Writing major, my courses are obviously comprised of a lot of writing; however, the curriculum extends into other areas of writing, other possible career paths pertinent to my major, that I'd never before considered. Thus, it opens up a myriad of new opportunities for me later on. Overall, PNW upholds exemplary educational standards and fully develops students for their desired professions."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely truly admire Purdue Northwest. I was an incoming freshman and could not have been more terrified to start my college career. With that being said, making friends was a breeze and everyone was willing to help me when I had questions. The professors whole heartedly want to see you succeed and will help you every step of the way if you let them."
Freshman,5,"I love the diversity. I love how everyone is so helpful. I feel safe there and I especially love all the variety of classes that you can take. Also, the staff is amazing!!"
Junior,5,"PNW has given me nothing but amazing experiences as well great knowledge from my exquisite professors. In high school I was told that professors do not care about you as an individual. I was shown otherwise at PNW, I was beyond amazed on how much the professors are on top of their students to succeed. PNW provides so many free programs so a student can succeed  such as free tutoring in every subject. PNW is a college where students are actually listened to, we are constantly getting emails about out options on things to better campus and etc. Although, one thing I wish to be changed is putting the name “Purdue Northwest Calumet” more to the public. In doing so their can be more advantages for the campus its self, bringing in more recognition, more opportunities. Overall it is an amazing college, diversity to the max, incredible professors, marvelous programs and free assistance."
Sophomore,5,The campus is great.  It is easy to move from place to place.  The professors I have had so far make it easy to learn.
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at PNW and absolutely love it!  I just moved into my dorm this semester and the set-up is awesome!  My classes last semester were great, the instructors were awesome and approachable.  I love PNW!"
Senior,5,"Purdue univerity northerwest calumet is one of the best school I had never attend. Starting from administrative office to the professors, they are all friendly and accommodating. They know what they are doing. Once you speak up, they will try their best to assist you. There are enough resources for the students to learn."
Sophomore,5,Purdue University Northwest-Calumet is a smaller university and I feel that because of that it provides me personally with a better education. You are able to interact more personally with professors due to smaller class sizes.
Senior,5,Purdue has great diversity. They have Excellent programs and offer a peaceful and safe environment. Needs more activity among students
Niche User,5,Very pleasant experience staff was very helpful and had a lot delightful and well-known information. Talked about a lot of hands-on activities that mad a student like me more interested and excited to become a student to see what purdue has in store for me.
Junior,5,"I've attended this college for 3 years now and have enjoyed every class I've taken both on campus and online.  I have worked on the student newspaper for two years and have spent time on campus during weekends and breaks when no other students were there and I was able to appreciate the beauty of the campus.  Purdue University Calumet is the first school I've attended where I was not bullied, but rather befriended by a variety of different sorts of people and embraced for my contribution to the student life."
Senior,5,"If you want one of the top engineering schools, pick Purdue Northwest. The diversity of the students, the beauty of the campus, and most importantly the dedication of my professors to helping me strengthen my strong points and refine my weak points are only three examples of what makes Purdue phenomenal! I couldn't have made the Dean's List 7 consecutive semesters without the support, guidance and diligence of my professors."
Junior,5,They r very informative and they are very helpful with the enrollment process from registration to financial aid very helpful
Alum,4,"PNW was overall a great college, especially for the price and vast amount of degrees offered! The local area was really the only downfall - not too much for college students to do. But that is just a minor criticism considering that everything else about this campus exceeded my expectations."
Alum,4,"I took a mixture of online and in-person classes, and had a great experience with both. Having the two options made it really easy to plan out my schedule and work part time while also being a full-time student!"
Senior,4,My experience at PNW has been great. Getting involved makes a huge difference. I wish there where more opportunities for research.
Senior,4,"Classes have been the same online as in person, but using zoom and power point presentations. Professors have done a great job transitioning."
Senior,4,"I have taken multiple online classes and in person classes. I prefer the online classes if the professor uses email. Otherwise, it is harder to get into contact with the professor if you have any questions or concerns. When taking online classes, you save money on transportation."
Senior,4,I like how small the college is. You get to know your professors and you also get to know the staff. I work at PNW and I am well known between professors and staff. This helps for networking and an overall feeling of being comfortable. I feel like the student activities need improvement. Many activities are on the Hammond campus but not the Westville campus.
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy PNW and I love going to school there its a great commuter school. For anyone in NWI considering staying home do it! I have saved incredible amount of money
Junior,4,The nursing program focuses on real experience and tries to get its students into labs and clinicals as soon as possible.
Niche User,4,"I have not taken any online classes, but in terms of online communication, they have been very helpful in answering my questions and giving me academic information."
Niche User,4,"I've only communicated with PNW, as I have yet to attend. However, the Purdue Northwest customer service and counseling system is very down to earth and the staff is very helpful, as they've been good at answering my questions regarding the school."
Senior,4,"I liked Purdue Northwests order is how they do things. I liked all of the Professors, the Professors really care about their students."
Junior,4,I like the small classes and how professor can assist me. I do not like that the tuition keeps increasing and the campus has different opportunities.
Senior,4,"As a senior at Purdue I've had my fair share of what It's like to be a student at Purdue Northwest. Truthfully this is the school I've had my sights on ever since I used to ride by on highway 421 and look at all the sculptures when I was really young. Once I was accepted and started classes, it was a whole new world. The programs, facilities, classes, and other items they offered are exceptional for what it costs to go there. Over the past four years I've learned an immense amount of the Construction engineering and Management program that I'm currently enrolled in. They are a smaller based, diverse, hands on college that's truly invested in their students and I'm glad to be apart of the Purdue culture. The only thing I would consider to improve would be the access of classes year round than only ""Spring or Fall"" separations. Otherwise, the Professors get to know you on a name basis and truly focus on the individual when it comes to your progress and success through each degree."
Freshman,4,"For the price you pay, PNW is a good first year school if you're local and plan on transferring in the upcoming years."
Freshman,4,"Since I am on the softball team at PNW, I came in with a lot of great friends! The student life is very diverse and I fit in very well. Something I would change is the city the campus is in."
Junior,4,"Overall good experience, campus is clean.  The computer information tech. degree is good, besides some classes that don't seem to fit the criteria."
Freshman,4,"PNW is a nationally accredited school that students from the region attend for various majors that the school offers. The campus is nice and the professors are good at teaching and helping out students. Overall it is a good school that isn't to expensive, has good programs, and is a nice school to go to."
Freshman,4,"The campus has a lot of resources for students. This includes free tutoring, a writing center to help with papers for free, a free mental health counseling service, lots of activities and opportunities to get together with students, lots of lounges, and even an office of global engagement intended to help international students with adjusting to school and feeling welcome. The staff here are very friendly as well."
Alum,4,"Purdue’s academics have a lot of value for engineers or teachers. I originally started going there for an English degree, with the intent to teach. The community is really involved, and offers fantastic opportunities to grow and get some experience through programs like being a SI in your major. 

But while I was attending, they started cutting back their arts program. This cutback led me to enroll into an arts college to get additional background I needed in my field. They also don’t offer much help to out-of-state students (I live right on the Indiana border)."
Freshman,4,I really like the environment and the people around here. The professors are very helpful and understanding when in comes to my school work and content.
Junior,4,"The academic diversity and opportunity is very good considering the price. For being a commuter college, I feel that I am getting a great education and reputable degree."
Senior,4,"I have had a good experience at Purdue University Northwest - Hammond Campus so far, but I believe the resources are not advocated for properly. There are many things I did not know I could do with my major until I spoke with individuals outside of the college and alum who gave me advice on courses I could take."
Junior,4,I am transferring in from Kaplan. So far so good. They wait to give you your financial aid award notification until  after the term starts.
Sophomore,4,"I like all the free and available services that they have, such as the writing center. The only problem I was having is the parking, but it's expected with the construction going on."
Sophomore,4,"Not too big of a school. Smaller classroom sizes so teachers are able to work one on one with the students. There are so many resources on campus to use as well. Everyone is helpful and friendly. There are also a lot of opportunities to get involved on campus. The only thing is, sometimes getting the information out there is challenging. Every professor I have had has worked one on one with me and has told me more learning opportunities to take. You get what you put in at the school."
Junior,4,Purdue Northwest has a great College of Business program that I am currently in for accounting and finance.
Freshman,4,Purdue University has a lively and diverse campus. There are a lot of clubs and organizations available for students to join. There is also free tutoring for all students. Overall great university for anyone to attend.
Junior,4,"Friendly staff! have never been to the actual campus since i am on online student rn-bsn program. the program is good and affordable, has good advisors but okay teacher. I am a chicago resident so time difference when turning in assignment is not the best."
Senior,4,"Purdue is what I consider to be a commuter school. PNW is a college in Northwest Indiana. The nightlife isn't crazy, but the education is good. I wish it was more of a University feel like Purdue West Lafayette, but overall I like this school. It's in the works of being revamped after unifying with the North Central campus."
Freshman,4,"Purdue Northwest recently changed their diploma to no longer say Purdue University so for new students this may be an issue. Otherwise, the campus is pretty nice and they are always doing some new renovations."
Freshman,4,"Although I do not know much about the school at this moment, I have visited it often. My only gripe with the school is that they don't have enough parking for the busiest school days."
Sophomore,4,I very much enjoy the campus. The food as well as the amenities that they have to offer are very conducive to a study enviroment.
Freshman,4,"Everything is decent, honestly. Campus is large, but small enough for you to easily get from point A to B on foot, buildings look nice, teachers are helpful, the food is good, and the dorms are okay."
Junior,4,Purdue Northwest is a great school. Working to get a degree so close to home is amazing as well as not having to pay the price of the main campus while still earning the same degree.
Junior,4,Overall a good college. The professors that I have had so far are all helpful and understanding. The college community is a family based and very respectful to the students.
Niche User,4,What I like about Purdue University Northwest-Hammond Campus was the organizations recruiting people to be apart of things. There are more people helping each other out with courses that those people had previous year or now. What needs to change about the school are the sororities and fraternities that are known to come out.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy this Campus. They have great professors and are updating and making positive changes. They are also proactive, always asking what they could do better. Another thing I like is how the head of my degree field always sends emails about job bulletins. It is really helpful and appreciated."
Freshman,4,"Overall, the campus I very appealing.  It is a lot bigger than I expected.  The instructors make my time enjoyable and feel quick.  I can't see much change being made because it isn't much change needed.  The campus is big, but simple to understand.  The atmosphere is very nice as well.  Overall, I feel very welcome."
Junior,4,The staff has helped me every single time I've needed them. I feel like I am getting the knowledge I need to be productive in my career.
Sophomore,4,Purdue Northwest Is a great school for those that olderstudents looking to continue their education or for younger students who are leary about going away for the first time.  They have small classes and wonderful professors .
Junior,4,"What I like most about the campus is how easy it was to maneuver and seek out classes during the day. I was hardly ever late for this reason. Another thing I loved was how spacious the dorms were. I felt as if I was in an actual apartment. However, one thing I disliked was the lack of teachers for some subjects. For example, they only had one computer science class, and I in the math department I had no choice but to take a class with a professor who was all over the place for two different courses. This made it difficult to find a teacher to connect with and actually learn."
Sophomore,4,"Purdue University Northwest is an excellent school that provides an abundance of helpful resources. The professors and tutors are of good quality. Most of the classes are smaller in size, which makes it easier interact and participate."
Junior,4,"Honestly, there could be better security at the university. There is constantly a crime going on in and around the campus. The food is good but way to high priced. The professors are amazing and help anyone who asks for it."
Junior,4,This school needs more teachers that are fluent in English. They also need to renovate their gym area because right now it is the smallest gym possible.
Senior,4,I love that Purdue offers an RN- BSN program exclusively online.  There are no clinical hours and I can be a Purdue student in my own home.  The nursing advisors are excellent and very helpful.   Each class is 5 weeks and the program is 15 months long.
Sophomore,4,"The teachers here are friendly and give students the push they need to strive for A's and B's. Every building has nice, spacious lounges where students can meet, talk, play, and discuss various projects for their respective classes. Campus grounds are designed expertly; nothing feels too far away. The only real gripe I have is that online resources and campus computers can cause frustration at times, but that's about it."
Sophomore,4,I liked that you could have one on one time with professors and ask questions. I wish more professors made the homework questions up themselves instead of just using the questions that are in the back of the book. It makes the class too easy and the answers are all online. Overall though all professors have been helpful and friendly. Some professors could be a bit more engaging.
Niche User,4,I was able to take classes in high school for Purdue credits and have been a part of this school since even before then.
Junior,4,"For being a small school, you definitely get a sense of campus while here. There is such a diverse range of students, and the professors are nice and very helpful. The only thing I wish there was more of is recycling bins. They are very hard to find sometimes."
Sophomore,4,The overall administration is good. The registrar and financial aid offices are especially helpful and effective. Some of the facilities are old and worn but bearable. The teachers of the education department are amazing and create a great environment for us to learn in. Top notch!
Junior,4,"Their business department and advisors are very good. The only trouble I had was when classes were full at the Hammond campus and I had to commute to the westville campus every week, then rushing back to the Hammond campus in 40 minutes."
Junior,4,"I love it here at Purdue Northwest, Westville! The professors and staff are great, always willing to help you, and it seems like they actually want to be there!"
Sophomore,4,"Purdue Northwest is a good school in a small community. With 15,000 students we are ranked as 5th largest in Indiana. Me personally, I like it alot. It's comfortale, clean, and challenging. They offer a variety of programs and have highly qualified professors. Academically is somewhat challenging, but what is there to expect. Life at Purdue there is calm and easy to engage into a class. The adversity there is broad, everyone is pretty friendly. Also class room sizes are fairly proportioned. No class to big, so you get to work alot with your professors."
Freshman,4,Pretty good school. Really cares about students and wants them succeed in all aspects of life. Good environment and teachers and makes receiving help easy.
Freshman,4,"While attending Purdue University Northwest, I consider myself a more cultured individual. The campus is widely diverse and the opportunities for self-expression are endless. The education I have received has led me to broaden my scope of employment after graduation. I have been exposed to networking opportunities, and the extracurricular activities have supported me academically. However, the safety issues pose a problem for students. The location has a relatively high crime rate, and there has been attempted robberies near the area. The on-campus police do a great job at offsetting the surrounding crime. It is a secure, safe campus. Nevertheless, I would not recommend walking alone at night in Hammond, Indiana without sufficient protection. Even so, Purdue University Northwest is a great campus  to cultivate one's future. There are opportunities unlike any university I have visited."
Sophomore,4,Very good school with a nice campus and mostly good teachers. Some of the teachers really care for the students while some just don't care. A lot of the teachers are foreign and are hard to understand but know their subject well.
Sophomore,4,"The teachers there are good, but the campus feels old. They are doing repairs on it so it isn't like they are trying, but that's about it. They are constantly updating something and the library has really old books compared to new fresh ones."
Freshman,4,"It's a really nice school. People are very friendly. The student life is awesome. The dorms are nice. They're all types of clubs, groups, and people around the world. Going to events are free. They have free food at fun activities."
Junior,4,I like the small class sizes at Purdue Northwest. There is a lot of one on one interaction with the professors. There is also free tutoring in many subjects if needed. The campus is very nice and they have built a new gym. I would like to see more diverse professors.
Freshman,4,"I am just coming in as a Freshman, and I have not had a lot of experience on the campus yet. So far, the counselors and upper classmen have been very helpful in my transition."
Junior,2,"I enrolled in an online program. It was a program for adult learners, specifically RN to BSN. The professors started the class by sending a long email regarding all the things that you should NOT contact them about.  Student financial aide staff were rude and do not do their job. I have to make repeated phone calls to get them to submit I formation correctly so that I could qualify for aide. I ended up withdrawing and enrolling at WGU. I got my ADN at Purdue in West Lafayette and I LOVE Purdue. NW campus does not eve come close  to main campus"
Sophomore,2,"I like how Purdue northwest is compact and the teacher to student ratio is small. However, that ratio is also bad because some of the teachers are not doing a goos job teaching and it’s hard for students to learn. I end up having to teach myself, but thank god for google amiright?"
Senior,2,"Not quite the experience I expected. Advisors do not pay attention like they should to helping you schedule things. My whole plan of study got pushed back a year for three classes because of it. Professors don't tend to explain things well, then act like you're stupid when you don't get it."
Junior,2,I would like to see more consistency of the nursing program since there has been changes with combining with the two campuses
Alum,2,I felt like PNW doesn't care about their students. I have asked multipule times for career options and they left me with nothing. The merge between calumet and westville campuses was a total disaster. I would not recommend this college. I am now having to get a different degree because the one I obtained from PNW is useless.
College Freshman,2,There's about 2 fraternities that I know about. Not many people want to join because it is a commuter school.
College Freshman,2,this school doesn't have anything I want
College Freshman,2,"The athletic facility is not great at all. Whenever I go and workout, all I want to do is get out and workout on my own because it is dirty and not a lot is offered."
College Sophomore,2,don't really know anything about our athletic program
College Sophomore,2,There are only aparments to choose from. It is a commuter campus so most people live with parents.
College Senior,2,There basically aren't any parties.
College Sophomore,2,"They took away my scholarship even though I received good grades, a solid GPA, and more credits than I need per year."
College Freshman,2,it takes  a long time
College Freshman,2,Lots of people get arrested for underage drinking
College Senior,2,I do not know about Purdue Calumet's party scene since I am taking online courses.  It is a small school though and I have not heard any excitement about their party scene.
College Senior,2,"Nursing is very competitive today because although there is a ""high"" demand for nurses, there is a shortage of instructors.  Therefore it is difficult and requires hard work to get into the program."
College Senior,2,This is not a campus where students go to play sports therefore it is not a focus here.
College Freshman,2,for the cost of schooling there should be many more scholarship opportunities
College Junior,2,Too much local crime for my liking
College Junior,2,"pretty safe neighborhood. Not to many recreation, shopping, or other areas of attractions. attitude towards students is positive"
College Sophomore,2,This past winter was torture! The Midwest has spontaneous weather making transportation difficult over the winter but the campus handled it well and had the student's safety in mind
College Sophomore,2,"The school provides an abundance of labs and computers, but they are so slow that often when using them you have to wait fifteen minutes just for the computer to log in the student and then another fifteen for it to allow approval of printing a document."
College Freshman,2,"We are not that good at sports, our school has them but they're not important. Me and all my friends focus on our studies because at the end of the day that is what is important, not going to sporting events wishing you could be on the court or field."
College Freshman,2,PNC is located in the middle of the country north of the toll road. So since its in the country there isn't too much to do in West ville but in the cities nearby there is
College Freshman,2,We have one apartment complex on campus since PNC is a commuter college but the parties there are pretty sick. They just get busted by cops a lot
College Freshman,2,Well I attend a community college called Purdue North Central so being in a frat or sorority is not a big thing around our campus. Other campuses though like Purdue West Lafayette that is a big deal.
College Sophomore,2,Snow has been a big issue this semster. Sometimes it is too dangerous to attend classes.
College Student,2,"The atmosphere during the day is fine, but at night it is not up to par."
College Sophomore,2,There's nothing very unique or cool about our campus life. Kind of just a place to come and go for classes.
College Sophomore,2,"The buildings smell sometimes, the air always breaks."
College Sophomore,2,The computers load much too slow and most of the time are full.
College Sophomore,2,Most students just come and go. Not much goes on around campus.
College Sophomore,2,"The lab facilities and professors at the college of science wasn't what I expected. They need to upgrade both.
"
College Sophomore,2,"I don't think there are many unique opportunities at the school. some student research assistant positions are open, though, which is nice."
College Freshman,2,"I've really only made one good friend here, and I was already dating someone when I began school here, and he doesn't go to college yet. I dont really think a lot of the students here are attractive."
College Freshman,2,"We do have a lot of international and students from other states here on sports scholarships. They are trying to build the programs but its at a rough starting point at the moment.
"
College Freshman,2,"We're located in Hammond, Indiana off Idiana 152. It's kind of in the ghetto but the campus is nice and relatively modern. "
College Freshman,2,The food is just gross. Definitely even worse than highschool. Not many options.
College Freshman,2,I drive to school which if there's traffic it takes about an hour. There's basically only two main roads to take from my direction and they are both terribly busy. For people living on campus they just walk across the street. 
College Sophomore,2,I think they balance the as far as strictness and policy goes I think it is pretty average.
College Sophomore,2,"I have not had an internship, so I really don't know much about the information. I do plan on having on to help with my resume as well as help get hands-on experience. "
College Sophomore,2,The wireless internet goes in and out. There is plenty of computer labs and helpful tech support.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't know much about off-campus housing, but I do believe its difficult to find decent off-campus housing in Hammond, Indiana."
College Sophomore,2,They really do attempt to help it is just a matter of students making appointments and finding time in order to figure out their student finances
College Sophomore,2,"The majority of the student body commutes so there is a lot of parking, in various places."
College Sophomore,2,"Hammond Indiana has some shops and restaurants but not much, so there is not a lot of student activities off-campus.   "
College Junior,2,"If you are willing to drive 15 minutes away, you can grab a variety of different foods including italian, authentic Mexican, Indian, and even Mediterranean."
College Junior,2,"PNC is located in Westville but is really located between Westville and Michigan City.  This makes it hard to just grab something to eat or meet at a coffee shop.  However, there is a nice dining facility and coffee shop located on campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,"If Purdue did a major system upgrade, added more actual computers for the amount of students that they house, it would be much better."
College Senior,2,I really do not attend any athletic events since we are a smaller school there is not much interest for me.
College Senior,2,"Im older and therefore I dont mingle at the school,."
College Sophomore,2,"Average, haven't heard of too many people getting them."
College Freshman,2,"It's alright, but it could have more places to study."
College Freshman,2,"It's alright, but not anything too fancy or anything"
College Senior,2,"There is diversity at this school, even among the professors. There is very little of it, however."
College Senior,2,"There is no 'on-campus' housing. The apartment complex across from the school is convenient but not worth the prices. You could get a more reasonable rate in any of the three cities surrounding the school, and still only have a ten minute drive."
College Senior,2,"The school is mostly commuter, so most students live at home.  As for those coming from out of town, it is difficult to find a reasonably priced place to live that is safe."
College Junior,2,"The seating is really nice, but the selection is pretty limited. It's pretty much the same stuff every day."
College Junior,2,"Parking lot can be a little hectic because there so many students and space fill up quickly. Also, you have to remember where you parked."
College Junior,2,I would say that the strictness is average for a university. There are no restrictions that I am aware of for freshman or any other grades. Other than the no smoking policy. They have security officers and they do hand out tickets for certain things.
Senior,1,"There are a lot of good professors there, but the people at the top of this for-profit college really throw the students and the professors under the bus when it comes to a quality education. There were at least 3 classes where we relearned the same first-year course, and some classes that didn't get the funding they needed, so they taught a completely different course in-place without informing any students of this change. I could REALLY go on a huge list of other grievances, but I'll let you think about this: A lot of the students that attend the northwest branches of the Purdue 'brand', do it specifically to have the Purdue name on their diploma. The Northwest campuses are far more affordable and geographically available, and with the Purdue name tacked on, that lets people look past the awful standards and money-grubbing."
Senior,1,"Biggest waste of my money. This school merged with another. I was told we would not have to take classes at the other campus (over 40 miles away) to find that this was a lie (across all majors.) If you are literally trapped in Northwest Indiana, go to IUN or IUSB. If not, go elsewhere. Literally attend ANYWHERE else."
College Junior,1,We don't have the option to live on campus
College Junior,1,We don't have greek life here on Campus
College Student,1,"My main reason for attending this school was because it was close to home so I didn't even look at other schools. Once I had my mind set, that was it. Upon arriving, the students were very unfriendly and my campus life was not even existent. No activities going on around campus, very boring. Never felt welcomed and was not the college experience I was looking for and now im screwed."
College Junior,1,"It's the worst, because of the RA's who break the rules themselves. A lot of the rules are too strict and extreme. The little fees, like taking the trash out and coming back in the same door, are ridiculous."
College Junior,1,"It's the worse for me, because I am easily annoyed by most of the fraternities and sororities that I know. They are very immature and horrible people to be around. They rarely do anything for the community or even have parties. They just hangout, gossip, and bully. They seem like junior high students. I have turned down being in a sorority multiple times due to the kind of people they were. I do know a minority of fraternities and sororities that actually make a good name for Greek life at Purdue Calumet."
College Sophomore,1,There is no party scene.
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life
College Senior,1,"Nursing internships are not common in this area.  While I would have liked to partake in one, I wanted to stay close to home to keep my living expenses at a minimal."
College Senior,1,Indiana gets the worst weather! We always get the mots snow and hard weather conditions.
College Sophomore,1,Hot and humid in the fall and freezing in spring!
College Sophomore,1,There is not enough public transportation in these areas.
College Freshman,1,There is no nightlife in westville.
College Freshman,1,"There is literally only subway, dairy queen, and mcdonalds."
College Freshman,1,"I never hear anything about any sports teams other than our baseball team, and even they are rare to hear about."
College Freshman,1,"I don't really feel like there is a ""Greek life"" at pnc. There is nothing special, there aren't really any frats or sororities. I wish there was because I would actually like to join. "
College Freshman,1,"There is almost nothing to do in westville, you literally have to drive all the way to michigan city or valparaiso to even be able to do anything fun or go shopping anywhere other than dollar general."
College Freshman,1,PUC does not have many scholarships for international students like me. 
College Sophomore,1,"No parties, its a dry campus, and no places close enough to party. "
College Sophomore,1,"I would like to see more from the Greek system on campus, I think that it could make student body more interactive "
College Sophomore,1,"Hammond, Indiana is a small town with not much variety of healthy or organic options."
Recent Alumnus,1,"We have 1 food exchange, its not a dining hall like other universities. The food isnt horrible, but the selection doesn't vary at all."
College Senior,1,"Either have a car, bicycle, or motorized bike. There is absolutely no public transportation."
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking is a bit of a nightmare. There are students on social sites in the labs all day or people who park in two spots. I usually have to park on the far end of the lot.
College Junior,1,PNC is located 15 minutes from a larger town. There is nothing within walkling distance.
College Freshman,1,There are really no greek organizations on this campus so if you are interested in greek life especially the D9 they are not really there only alpha phi alpha and sigma gamma rho
College Student,1,"I have my sister and friends telling me that parking is so hard to find, they said that they had to go at least 30 minutes earler just to find a spot to park the car and run to class on time. I think this is a problem that Purdue should take action to it."
College Senior,1,There are never enough spots close to the buildings and students can not purchase parking permits to park in A parking
College Junior,1,There are no transportation options available since the school is located out of city limits
College Sophomore,1,"Nothing on the campus has anything to do with Greek or the Greek descent. This is not a complaint but for having Greek houses and Greek alliances on the big campus of Lafayette, then why doesn't the smaller school of PNC carry any of those aspects. Greek housing on PNC is not even an option to any student being that student housing is very limited on the capacity of the building. The difference between Greek and non-Greek is not an issue on the Campus of Purdue North Central"
College Freshman,1,"Not a lot of sit down places, just a lot of fast food or gas station stops."
College Sophomore,1,"It's in a really rural small town with not much to do. There are off campus houses across the street, but they're not great."
College Freshman,1,If you are even a couple minutes after 8:00 good luck finding a spot
College Junior,1,"There is no public transportation that goes to the school and its very far away from most students coming from cities all over since it is in the middle of nowhere. I heard they are working on a solution, but have seen no action"
College Senior,1,There is no other transportation option other than driving yourself or finding a ride with another student.
College Senior,1,"Hard to Find a Computer – I have always found it easier to bring my own laptop because there are not enough available computers.  Also, the amount of money you get per semester for printing information you need is very poor.  If you are a biology major, you intend to print a lot more material than a communications major."
College Senior,1,"Public transportation is not as easy as it should be, the lines are hard to follow- the schedule is hard to catch on to, but it always goes where you need to go, just a matter of how long you have to wait to get back where you need to be."
College Freshman,1,Housing Is Expensive – i dont stay on campus but i seen the dorms they are small and my friend pays way to much to stay in that little room.
College Freshman,1,"Could Be Better – The ONLY time to get a good parking spot, is early in the morning before eight. Any other time after that, you could be driving around for ten minutes looking for a good spot."

Sophomore,5,Criswell is an amazing school. I have learned so much in the two years I have been at Criswell. The professors are absolutely incredible and loving. I want to spend as much time as I can here!
Sophomore,5,"From the very first minute on campus, staff and existing students have been very friendly and welcoming.  The registrar has been very helpful and encouraging.   She spent a considerable amount of time visiting with me in order for us to establish long and short term goals.  I am very happy that I have begun school with Criswell."
Freshman,5,"Criswell College has made a huge impact on my life, both mentally and spiritually. If I had to choose all over again I would definitely choose this school."
Freshman,5,"Croswell College is an awesome place if you're looking to learn about God and his Word, the Bible. It is also a great community and atmosphere."
Sophomore,5,"Criswell college is awesome! Great classes! Great professors! Classes are small, usually less than 30 people. The professors really care about you. Top notch education."
College Junior,5,The academics are the best part of Criswell. They push you to understand the Word of God and ask questions.
College Junior,5,The school is very strict about alcohol and drug use. Most of the student body feels the same as the school on its policies (however many students do not think that a ban on alcohol is needed)
College Junior,5,"We have a fantastic head of security who patrols and interacts with students. I have never seen, heard of or suspected any harm done to a student on campus. Part of this is due to the fact that our student body is not likely to be violent or aggressive in anyway. The campus is located in a area of Dallas that is not that good but the campus itself is very safe."
College Junior,5,"No other school offers a better undergraduate in Biblical studies. Also the professors actually care about each student, they desire to see you mature and do well."
College Junior,5,Criswell College is a Biblical Studies School and the surrounding reflect Christian standards.
College Junior,5,The school is located in the Center of Dallas.
College Junior,4,"There is a lot of racial and ethnic diversity. There are a good number of African and Asian international students. They are actually look at with high esteem, knowing that after they graduate, they will go back to service in harsher contexts."
College Junior,4,"Criswell is small school in an old building but the teaching and theology and practice of the school is so good. As we grow we will have the aesthetics get better but that which is most important for a college, the education, is fantastic at Criswell."
College Junior,2,"It is a bible college, not Animal House. If you want to have fun go play some board games with friends, play at an open mic or go to a movie."
College Junior,2,"Its a Bible College, what do you expect? If you want to have fun go with some people to a coffee shop or play a board game"
Alum,1,"Prior coming to Criswell, it looked to be a community that one would feel loved and accepted in. The only good experience at the school was a portion of the student body. After a few years, I started to realize that it was a ""church school."" Their ties to the Baptist church are too strong and because of that, they will never be anything than a church. If you are wanting to graduate from a school that was founded by a racist and a school that holds on to bigotry, Criswell is the school for you"
Alum,1,I did not experience online learning at Criswell. They do have have two online master programs. They do not nor will ever offer online for the undergraduates.
College Sophomore,1,We do not have sports

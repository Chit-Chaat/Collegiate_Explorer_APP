Alum,5,"I loved the classes, professors and friends I made. I had two children while I was in school and they made it so easy to take time off."
Sophomore,5,"I love the community and how diverse Spalding University is, which brings together everyone and their unique personalities and interests."
Niche User,5,I am a high school senior who recently visited Spalding University and the atmosphere of the university was excellent. Everyone from the students to the faculty treated me with the utmost kindness and generosity. I am looking forward to attending Spalding when I graduate.
Graduate Student,5,The faculty treats you like family! They want to see you move forward with your education and they are willing to do just about anything to get you there.
Sophomore,5,"Spalding is a good school its very diverse, the professors are very attentive you can email them about anything. The financial aid office works with you with your school bill. The whole staff is friendly and helpful. The location is in a nice bus routed area. Its a private school that doesn't cost a lot, I believe the prices are fair."
Sophomore,5,I love Spalding. I was concerned about how the classes were at first. But once I got the hang of it I started to enjoy it. I don't think I could handle taking more than 1 or 2 classes at a time.
Freshman,5,"I love my college! Staff is amazing, so many resources to strive and help your education, students are all friendly and helpful. campus is beautiful!"
Niche User,5,I love how everything is close on campus. The dorms are amazing and they offer so many opportunities
Niche User,5,I've only been on a campus visit and it made me feel at home. It wasn't overwhelming the staff that I talked to was very welcoming.
Freshman,5,I love the schedule breaks mainly the 6 weeks on then a week break . I also love the campus it’s not huge but it’s big enough not to get lost . Also the staff is very helpful and outgoing. I would like to see the cafe and pod be open for breakfast . Because it is the most important meal of the day!
Sophomore,5,I love the way that Spaldings academics are set up. The breaks between each six weeks of classes allows students to catch up and relax. The faculty at Spalding are so helpful and friendly; they want to see students succeed. The thing I would possibly change about Spalding is school spirit. Not a lot of kids are involved in Spaldings sports.
Niche User,5,"Spalding has been an incredible university. Being an adult who is working full-time while also being a full-time student, I am never afraid of missing class or being unable to complete something due to their adult FLEX program. The class set up during 6 week periods is incredible."
Senior,5,I appreciate the small class sizes and the attentive faculty and staff. Anytime I have a question about financial aid or about a class I can walk in and talk with a counselor or advisor.
Senior,5,Spalding University strives to better themselves through student and faculty involvement! This private university offers small class sizes and a diverse group of students. The professors care about their students and help to create a better learning environment. Student accommodations are available for those needing extra academic help.
Freshman,5,It has always been my dream to attend Spalding University. So far it has been wonderful. Everyone on campus is friendly. The location is perfect for me. The best decision I've made so far in applying and attending Spalding.
Niche User,5,I was drawn to the accelerated nursing program for a multitude of reasons. Spalding University didn't make me take extra classes or jump through hoops for admittance!
Junior,5,Every school has its ups and downs but I wouldn't have gone to no other school in Louisville but spalding to compete my nursing degree.
Sophomore,5,"The students are VERY diverse, especially when it comes to sexuality. Everyone, including the faculty, are friendly and willing to help in any way they can. The unique 6 week scheduling make classes and homework assignments easier to manage. As for improvements, I believe more art-related programs should be added, like theater!"
Graduate Student,5,"Spalding University is the best school around.  The staff is amazing and dedicated to our success.  I am a non traditional student and they couldn't have made things easier for me.  Applying was easy, getting an appointment with an adviser was easy, and so was getting a hold of my professors.  They have received an award for being a compassionate college.  I am know in the OT masters program and feel like I made the very best choice I could in picking Spalding as my school."
Junior,5,Great school. Everybody knows everybody. The staff is willing to work with you and make sure you are successful.
Junior,5,staff focuses on your success! every staff member i have came across want you to succeed. You put the effort in and they will work with you
College Freshman,5,The security is everywhere and you can called them anytime you want and they are very helpful to the student and stuff and they are kind and very nice.
College Freshman,5,All of my professors are nice and i love the size of my class because it small and easy to learn and the classmate are nice and helpful .
College Freshman,5,student work on campus when they don't have class and it helpful to the stuff.
College Freshman,5,I love it even tho i don't live in campus
College Junior,5,During orientation they had speakers from different hospitals already coming and asking us to work for them.
College Freshman,5,The program sets you up to succeed if you put in the work.
College Freshman,5,The professors are experts in their field and helpful. They want you to succeed.
College Freshman,5,Everyone has been welcoming and helpful since I started. The faculty really want their students to succeed.
College Freshman,5,"Each and every staff member and student I have encountered from Spalding has been beyond helpful. Not only that but you can tell they truly care about your self and want to get to know you on a personal level. They ask about you and want to get to know more about you. Even when speaking with staff, whether it's through email or in person, they are friendly. They don't speak to you as if you're just a young kid and as if they are better than you. They talk to you in a way that makes you feel as if you are more like a friend to them rather than a student. Everyone is easy to talk to and easy to get along with. Making friends was easier than expected which means a lot coming from someone who is as shy as I am."
College Sophomore,5,"I have liked most of my professors. They all made class engaging and learning fun. Some of the classes I thought I would hate going to, actually turned out to be great experiences. I actually liked one of my professors so much, that I decided to take another course by her. All of my classes have been pretty small, compared to what other colleges are used to. But that is good for me because the professors actually know you by name and actually help when you ask. Some of my classes have just been the professor lecturing and asking a few questions, but the classes I have enjoyed the most are the ones that are completely discussion. At first, I did not like that I had to participate to make a good grade, but by the end of my first class like that, it was easy for me to be apart of the discussion."
College Sophomore,5,I have absolutely loved Spalding University! The class schedules are so easy to work with. I have classes Monday-Thursday and only take one or two classes for six weeks. This allows me to fully focus on the classes I have and fully engage myself in the work.
College Junior,5,"As far as I am aware there is no problem, though I am only there to take my classes and to go home, I live off campus."
College Sophomore,5,Most are geared toward your field of study but it really gives you a feel for what career you are going into.
College Sophomore,5,This scoop has one of the best nursing schools in the country.
College Sophomore,5,Perfect place for any student that doesn't like classes for 300+
College Sophomore,5,"The Spalding Suites are great they come with full kitchens, flat screens, couches, table and chairs, not to mention one bathroom for 4 people instead of the whole floor."
College Sophomore,5,"It's the perfect school for me, while the price is high it's definitely worth every minute. To have professors that care about you and will do anything to help you succeed is amazing."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love Spalding University! It's the only school I have applied to and I it's a great honor to be apart of the community. They have amazing programs and the classes are small in size with pretty laid back professors. Everyone is so polite and they have some amazing quesadillas!
College Freshman,5,"The people are awesome, they are very open and welcome to help. The teachers are very laid back but professional. Overall this has been a great experience for me so far. I'm in the accelerated program and I love the 6 week sessions, especially sense I work full time during the day. I am a returning student at the age of 48, so it has been challenging to say the least. I am extremely excited. I love the  fact the the school is based on Christian values."
College Sophomore,5,"Louisville has some of the best restaurants around. There are so many options, including variety of foods and costs. We are a very organic/vegan/veg friendly community, so there are many places to offer this."
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love living and going to school in Louisville. There are so many things to do, and something is always going on downtown or in the highlands. Nightlife is excellent, if you are 21+."
College Senior,5,Just like highschool they are never in class
College Senior,5,I hate it but they do their job..
College Senior,5,"They work good to me.. You have to pay for printing, at least I do, some students don't and I still haven't figured out why."
College Senior,5,I live in Louisville so I think all the food is great.. restaurant wise because I do not eat fast food
College Senior,5,Campus food is cheap and self satisfying. Im a very picky eater but spalding dinning is worth eating !
College Senior,5,"My school is very diverse, I have had classes and met some pretty cool people from all around the world. I lov the fact that this school is so welcoming."
College Sophomore,5,I work with really talented and helpful staff and students who make the program worthwhile.
College Sophomore,5,I love the low-residency program that meets internationally and allows me to travel and write.
College Sophomore,5,I really like the low-residency type program I'm in.  It fits my travel lifestyle and I can also get a master's degree that will further my writing career.
College Sophomore,5,"The application process is standard, with a partial manuscript or essay submission and essays from specific questions.  No GRE is required."
College Sophomore,5,"We have people from all walks of life here at Spalding. It's amazing because of how small of a school it is, but how diverse it is as well."
College Sophomore,5,Most if not all of the classes very well prepare every student for the major they're in and even for graduate school.
College Sophomore,5,I really love my program.
College Senior,5,"I don't spend much time on campus but I don't hear many stories about drug use, of any kind."
College Junior,5,"Great! Yes, I would do it all over again but I am so thankful I don't have to! I plan to go on to the Masters program in Applied Behavior Analysis and I can't wait!!"
College Junior,5,There is not a need for a car on campus. Everything is within walking distance. Cost of parking permit is very reasonable and covers you for a year. They are very serious about not allowing people without a permit park in school parking lots which I think is good!
College Junior,5,"I have never felt more accepted. They have booths set up at different times throughout the year, walks etc supporting gay rights etc. Very diverse and accepting. "
College Junior,5,Weather is not a major problem. We do have to do some outside walking to get to different buildings but it is not a far walk at all. 
Graduate Student,4,I really love this program and the teachers. They care sooo much about we do as students. They want you to succeed and do well. The teachers give out cell phone numbers and encourage you to use them.
Junior,4,"I really enjoy the small class sizes. It makes it very easy to navigate and I feel I get a higher quality education. I think that some of the classrooms could be updated and the safety isn't the best, but those are the only problems."
Senior,4,I love this school. The facility and staff treat you like family and we treat them as family. It's a great community and it was the best decision I ever made going there.
Sophomore,4,It is a good school for the education and the professors are good and the local area is great. Campus security is very good with our safety.
Sophomore,4,"I’ve been in college for two years now and it’s safe to say it’s been the best choice I could of ever made. The community is amazing with so many people, the staff and students are so accepting and caring."
Sophomore,4,Spalding University works hard to make an environment for student of all walks of life. This school is diverse and has a community of people that are committed to education whether it be their own or a students. They include an intro class for freshman which is a great asset to help student acclimate to the new learning environment. There is something for everyone here and the on campus events are always well organized and fun to attend. Spalding is a great school and I would suggest it to anyone who is looking for a private education with small classes. They offer an individualized educational experience versus the blanket treatment that is often present at larger Kentucky universities.
Junior,4,I have only been attending Spalding for a semester but I have already fallen in love with the school. The professors actually care about you and go out of their way to make you feel like your education is important and make sure that you are doing okay.
Freshman,4,It has a very familiar atmosphere. Its very comfortable and the teachers help with whatever you are struggling to make it easier and better for you. It can also be pretty easy and enjoyable to learn there.
College Junior,4,I have never felt unsafe or uncomfortable on campus. I feel that if I needed help or support they would be there.
College Junior,4,I just transferred from the University of Louisville to join the Nursing program at Spalding University. I chose Spalding because it is a small private school. I knew I was going to get a better learning experience. I didn't know much about the school but as soon as I came in contact with the faculty and staff I couldn't  have been more impressed. They were extremely helpful when it came to getting everything transferred and in on time. They worked with me and most importantly made me extremely important. You can tell that the staff really does care about you and your education. I feel excited to be there and I know the staff and faculty are cheering me on!
College Freshman,4,The school and community strive to be accepting.
Recent Alumnus,4,New housing but I commuted
Recent Alumnus,4,Good food & friendly staff members
College Freshman,4,The school is very welcoming. I can ask them any question I have about the school
College Sophomore,4,"I play volleyball for my University, so I know first-hand about the athletics. Our weight room is one of the best I have seen. We also have the absolutely greatest weightlifting and conditioning coach. She has transformed the teams tremendously. Our gym is a little outdated though and we don't have the best equipment for our nets. The school spirit is high for all sports team around the first and the second games, but after that attendance is usually very low from students."
College Freshman,4,I know a few of the girls on the volleyball team and they love it.
College Freshman,4,Spalding's academic advisors are extremely helpful and hey strive to put you in classes that will go toward your major.
College Freshman,4,Class challenges you to learn more and think critically about information.
College Freshman,4,Everyone is open to diversity.
College Freshman,4,I love that classes are very small.
College Junior,4,The MFA in creative writing program is wonderful.
College Junior,4,"I'm a grad student in the low-residency creative writing program and absolutely love it. That said, I'm only on campus for ten days twice a year and know nothing about the undergrad experience at Spalding."
College Freshman,4,we always have emergency contact if we need to get it right away.
College Freshman,4,Everyone is pretty chill but we do have rules to follow
College Sophomore,4,"Many homeless people are on or around our campus but I have never felt unsafe, almost all are very friendly and have become part of our everyday life at Spalding."
College Sophomore,4,We have one fraternity and one sorority but with my experience of sororities they do a lot of great things for the school and community.
College Sophomore,4,They look great but I never have the time to use the free gym.
College Sophomore,4,Even though the campus is in downtown Louisville it is a realivley safe campus.
College Sophomore,4,The quality of this education is really good.
College Sophomore,4,The classes are very small and the professors and usually very helpful. There is a wide variety of classes offered some fill up fast since class size is small.
College Sophomore,4,Nice dorms and close to campus.
College Sophomore,4,So far Spalding University had been a really great college experience and it is an overall great school.
College Sophomore,4,"It has a really great environment for it's students with great teachers who really get to know the students and build a relationship with them. I love it here! It is pretty pricey but the education received is top notch! It has majors that some schools in the area does not, so that makes it unique. Also, our schedules are on a 6 week session schedule year round instead of full semesters. I really enjoy the way the classes are set up! I would not choose to do it over again, I'm very happy with the education I am receiving!"
College Junior,4,I am a graduate student in the Low-Residency MFA Writing program. I'm in the middle of my first year at Spalding and love it. I cannot speak to the undergrad experience at Spalding but I do know that it's a special place full of special people and educators who care about their students.
College Freshman,4,"So far the people are awesome, they are very open and welcome to help. The teachers are very laid back but professional. Overall a great experience so far and I can't wait for more."
College Sophomore,4,"There are plenty of places to choose from when trying to decide where to eat.  However, not many of the restaurants recognize student discounts."
College Sophomore,4,"There are plenty of things to do in downtown Louisville nearly every night.  I never find myself bored.  There are plenty of sporting events, attractions such as museums and architecture, and shopping malls.  All of these things are easily accessible as well."
College Sophomore,4,"I have never attended a sporting event personally, but I know that student athletes get out of class on game days or early for practice. A lot of people play sports and it is widely talked about on campus."
College Sophomore,4,Everything is easy going but at the same time its strict.
College Senior,4,"Sessions, again and the frequent breaks we get. we get a week off after every 6 weeks, its love. especially if you work and pay your own tuition like myself, that week off helps get some extra cash. its like as soon as you get annoyed with your professor, BAM your out on a break. Just stay focused."
College Senior,4,"Overall I love my school. I love being a student at spalding I take pride in saying im a spalding student. I love the sessions and how welcoming everyone is on campus, the campus itself is nice and open. So peaceful, teachers are very caring."
College Senior,4,"Professors are n ice, most of them, and willing to help whenever you need it. Workload might be tough, we have sessions instead of semesters so a lot of work is crammed in every week. Too much homework at times, some teachers expect too much when they probably couldn't get all the assigned work done in the matter of time we have an still be able to work to pay tuition and have at least a little bit of free time. Study options are nice. Students always set up study groups or help one another out."
College Senior,4,I haven't really gotten in to my psy classes unfortunately which is crazy because I have been in school for three years and im still working on pre recs. I still don't understand why I need an art class to be a successful psychology worker. They just find ways to keep you longer and take more of your money instead of focusing on helping you learn more about your future career.
College Sophomore,4,All teachers offer help to students who ask for it or will point them in a direction. There are some common outdoor study areas and few inside study areas.
College Sophomore,4,The dorms are pretty strict.
College Sophomore,4,"There is a wide diversity on campus, as a mater of fact the minorities and slightly different are more accepted than the typical whie teenager."
College Sophomore,4,"The acedimics are strict, they stick with their rules. The visitations and smoking have rules but are lenient."

College Student,4,A brand new athletic facility and gym was just built and it is fantastic. 
College Student,4,"The guys are very nice, southern and attractive and the girls are typical southern belles. "
College Student,4,"Computers are available in multiple places throughout campus, but it is important to bring your own computer also "
College Student,4,I am currently in the graduate program at Spalding University and it is wonderful. The faculty and staff are very welcoming and have an open door policy.  The campus is quaint but very nice and maintained.  
College Student,4,"Louisville is known for their incredible food scene, but some of the restaurants located near campus are downtown and those restaurants tend to be more expensive than others due to their location. "
College Student,4,"Spalding is located in the middle of downtown Louisville, KY so at times it may be more difficult to get around due to the traffic. "
College Senior,4,The parking lots normally have plenty of spots and are close to buildings.
College Senior,4,There are students from all over the world with many different belief systems.
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy my program which is the reason I am in it to begin with. Some teaachers and professors seem a little unsure as to what their duties are.
College Sophomore,4,"It seems as if there is always something to do, no matter what time of the year it is."
College Sophomore,4,"All of the biuldings are withing a couple block radius, so cars are not needed to get around."
College Freshman,2,There were too many different papers required. I was very confused.
College Sophomore,2,cost of living near our school is extremely high for college students
College Sophomore,2,prices have continued to go up on food the past few years and the hours these dining options are opened have also decreased so you cannot even use your full amount on the meal plan. They also got rid of the breakfast option so it isn't available anywhere on campus
College Sophomore,2,There is not much to do unless you are 21 or have money.
College Sophomore,2,"Parking lots are small but that is all we need for a small school. They are not very protected, mine and others cars have been broken into. My car was the only one in the parking lot on one day over break week yet my cars widows got smashed during the day without the security even noticing until later that night."
College Sophomore,2,"On campus there is no night life, off campus there are bars and clubs, but that only benefits you if you are 21+"
College Senior,2,"The new athletic lounge is great, but it is in a downtown location with little green space. Again, the campus is expanding."
College Sophomore,2,School spirit doesn't seem to be high. I have never persoonally been to any games.
College Sophomore,2,"There is no fitness center, which is one thing I would be very interested in. Also not many hangout spots."
College Freshman,2,I have seen some shady looking people walking through campus or on the outskirts of campus. Someone even got arrested (not a student) on the edge of campus six months ago. My boyfriend got me a stun gun...it is downtown Louisville!
College Sophomore,2,"At Spalding we currently have 1 dorm, they are supposed to be suites and while the kitchens are nice some people don't have a kitchen at all and share 1 bathroom with 4-5 suite mates. Also, the rooms are entirely closterphobic! I do not stay on campus because of this before attending when they said suites, I thought they would compare to UofL housing The Bellamy or the Providence but I was extremely underwhelmed!"
College Freshman,2,Spalding University sits in the middle of downtown Louisville. Our campus is tiny and is not like other colleges. There is not much to do on campus unless you are involved in sports or clubs.
College Freshman,2,Night Life – There's not many parties at Spalding. There are a few clubs around the area. Some 21 or over clubs and some 18 or over clubs.
College Sophomore,2,Being in the heart of downtown there are not many place in walking distance for a student to dine.
College Freshman,2,Labs Only Get Crowded During Finals – Spalding University's computers need a big upgrade. Sometimes the computers won't get on the internet. The monitors don't always turn on.
Alum,1,"Did not take classes online, I completed my degree through in person classes. I enjoyed the 6-week sessions because they were flexible"
Niche User,1,"Absolutely horrible.  The BSN program is terrible.  Staff turnover is never ending.  The program is pretty much self-taught.  We were lied to about the success rate on passing the nclex exam.  No support from the administration.  Tori’s Murden McClure seems uninterested, and disconnected.  Professors send threatening emails to students, very negative, scary environment for a student.   Clinicals provide little practical experience and class is cancelled so often, I don’t know why Spalding doesn’t fess up and call it an online program.  Go to Bellarmine or Galen ... anyplace but Spalding."
College Student,1,There are very few options at Spalding & they are not very diverse.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I just graduated from Spalding with my master's in education. It was HORRIBLE!!! I had to fight and argue with the school so many times, and even go above everyone's head to the dean because they kept loosing all of my work and saying suddenly my classes didn't count towards my degree or even saying I did not take them! They people do not communicate with you and you have to keep bugging them everyday until they finally do. I've had to go in there everyday just to get things straightened out! This is the worst, most unorganized school I have ever been too and heard of. So many people I know who went there had the same problems and most transferred out. If you want to argue and fight with people just to graduate, then go here! If you can I would choose ANY OTHER school possible!! IF you do go here, try and get out and remember to KEEP EVERY EMAIL AND PAPER YOU HAVE EVER HAD FOR ALL CLASSES, AND ANYTHING THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOUR SCHOOL WORK! I promise you will need it to prove to them that they are wrong and need to get their S*** straightened out!"
College Freshman,1,I barely recieve financial aid from Spalding. Students really have to keep an eye on their financial aid status and frequently check fees and dues.

Alum,5,"The professors I studied under were very helpful and knowledgeable, yet demanding. I can not stress how much I learned"
Sophomore,5,"I took classes online due to COVID-19. Some professors adapted well, others didn't. Professors are accustomed to teaching classes in person, and some professors cannot effectively make use of the technology."
Freshman,5,Nice community and tries to immerse students into campus immediately. Love it!  Professors look to help students and even students try to help students. Safe night life and lots of opportunity for involvement on campus whether it is clubs or events.
Senior,5,"Deciding to come to Central Connecticut state university was one of the best decisions of my life.   I am living on campus and the people here are very kind and helpful.  Especially since they know i do not have any family members here, they are extra attentive and for that i am really grateful.  I love most of the professors that i have encountered, and along the way i have met incredible an talented individuals from all walks of life."
Junior,5,Everyone has been helpful and responsive to all my needs. I feel welcomed and appreciated. Professors are very happy to answer questions and a re very clear about what is expected from the material.
Freshman,5,At CCSU I love the dining halls and devil's den. There is a lot of seating and you have the ability to do your work at all those locations. I think that the starbucks location in the library is very beneficial especially when you need a boost.
Sophomore,5,"My experience has been amazing so far. Central is diverse, has number groups to fit any students interests, and every professor I’ve had is amazing."
Freshman,5,The best part about CCSU is the tutoring  center. The tutors will do everything they can to help you feel more confident with your work. I have been going almost every day since I started at CCSU and i have been getting the grades I wanted because I work really hard with my tutor!
Freshman,5,my experience as a student at CCSU is being so excellent I got to know a lot of people. the people there treat you so good they make you get comfortable. I won't change anything because for right now the college being so great. get to know more people has been the best thing ever because now I got a lot more people that I could reach if I ever need something I god people that will help me even the people that work on campus they so nice they make you welcome.
Niche User,5,"I am a transfer student to Central Connecticut State University. So far in my experience I have felt welcomed, academically challenged, and like I belong here. There is a great party scene here too to help you blow off steam and relax after a long day."
Niche User,5,The campus is really nice and the people there are very welcoming and kind. I have been involved in many programs in the past and working with students there has been helpful to me.
Niche User,5,There really is not anything that I can say that I like or dislike or that I would like to see changed about Central Connecticut State.
Freshman,5,"Central is a very good school, there seems to be a place for everyone here and the only thing I would change is maybe having more campus events so there is always something to do"
Freshman,5,"The whole atmosphere is so welcoming and exciting. during orientation, it gave such a welcoming family aspect. It felt like a big family that we are entering. The first day I was able to make friends who have the potential to be forever friends. everyone on campus has a friendly"
Junior,5,They made my transfer experience here a smoothe one. All the professor and advisors i met are really nice and they listen to you very well. They are well invested in you and your academic needs.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely loved CCSU's Dorms, Food, academics and overall size of the campus. The size made it easy to get anywhere on campus in under 15 minutes walking and everyone there is so nice. However, on the weekends the campus is very quite due to it being a very heavy commuter school."
Freshman,5,"I am just now entering as an incoming freshman here at Central Connecticut State University as a student athlete. Since the first day of coming in contact with this University at the age of 14, I knew this was where I wanted to spend my four years  of college. I first came in contact with this University while playing baseball. I was playing a tournament over in Connecticut and the championship game was a Central. I probably played the game of my life there and I fell in love with the facilities, buildings, fields and just the atmosphere of the students attending there. The vibe there is one like no other."
Senior,5,00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Freshman,5,"Central Connecticut is a great college for incoming freshman. The application process is very simple, they send acceptance letters fairly quick, and they send your financial aid package quickly as well."
Sophomore,5,"What I liked about central Connecticut state university is that despite all of my hardships with doing track/field at the college and have some academic trouble they keep helping me so much with giving me resources and helping me be the best that I can be. They provide so much help for me. Especially my coaches and teammates they have got my back no matter what and vice versa, I like how CCSU treats each other like a family because that is definitely what I need."
Freshman,5,"Very informative when inquiring about what the school has to offer, Staff was very informative, a very pleasant experience, made me feel welcome."
Freshman,5,"As an incoming Freshman, I feel like a have a lot of amazing experiences that I am heading towards as a nursing student"
Senior,5,"Amazing professors and a lovely campus, terrible food and dorms were okay but it was the only school I liked out of three different campuses."
Sophomore,5,"I like that CCSU offers a wide variety of majors. From which, I chose nursing and have succeeded through their very new nursing lab and dedicated teachers!"
Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere at ccsu. It is clean, family oriented and friendly, it is easy to find work opportunities on campus and I love it here"
Graduate Student,5,Coming back as a graduate student I can say that CCSU is a great college. In my experience CCSU's professors are more then willing to go the extra mile if you are. There are plenty of classes for different schedules at an affordable tuition.
Alum,5,This school is under rated.  I graduated and have found I compete very well with others who graduated from more prestigious schools.  (I paid much less)  I now earn more than many of my peers in the same field and I credit that to the work ethic I developed at CCSU.
Junior,5,I transferred from Georgia up to Connecticut and I currently I have enrolled as a transfer student. Overall my experience with CCSU has been life changing. The faulty to the staff and the people have truly made it an experience.
Sophomore,5,"Central Connecticut State University has professor’s that are working in there field. This allows the student to have firsthand knowledge of real world experiences. It is a very interactive campus. Classes are big and the course load is manageable. There are many clubs for socializing, making new friends and exploring new interests. It would help a lot, as a student, to reach out and talk to different people. Making friends is easy. I do not have anything negative to say about the university. It is worth attending, you will not be disappointed."
Sophomore,5,My first year at Central was one I'll remember and I still have three more years to make great memories. While being at Central there are plenty of cool events happening and very easy to join a club which I recommend you doing because you can make friends that way. There isn't much I would change at Central besides for the food and the parking.
Junior,5,At Central they are very accepting of their students and they ensure that all students have the best experience possible. The faculty does what they can for their students and helps the progress to success.
Alum,5,It was refreshing to have the majority of professors be passionate about what they were teaching! I graduated with high honors and had an easier transition to the workplace than many peers who went to private institutions.
Junior,5,I think Central Connecticut has the best Robotic Engineering program. The professors are outstanding and are very helpful for you to achieve your best!
Freshman,5,It is a great school and it is close to where I live so I don't have to commute very far. It is also affordable.
Senior,5,Central Connecticut State University is a great college I fully utilize all of the academic resources within the campus and love the cultural diversity that the campus illustrates. I am not apart of the party scene and i am very motivated and determined to achieve success.
Sophomore,5,Its a very good school for the money you get exactly what you pay for also college in general is all about what you make it.  If you want to do something you can do that thing at any college and the great thing about CCSU is that the school encourages things like this.
Freshman,5,I feel welcomed. The classes are engaging & thought triggering. The ccsu environment is exciting & hopeful!
Sophomore,5,"I just recently transfered to Central Connecticut State University from a community college. Coming from a community college, I was a little intimidated to attend a university. However, CCSU was an easy transition. The campus is clean and inviting. All of the professors are intelligent and helpful. Transferring to CCSU was the best decision I have made in my life. I see a great future ahead thanks to the knowledge I will gain from CCSU."
Sophomore,5,"Central has a very warm feeling to the school that makes the adjustment from high school to college seem very easy. The school is on the relatively small size making it easy to get from point a to point b, but when you're on campus it doesn't feel like you are constrained in anyway. The staff and professors I had were excellent. They provided informative lectures and were personable and accommodating to any student that asked questions and needed help. There are plenty of clubs and activities going on from day to day so there is always something to be doing for the times you need a break from homework. Coming to CCSU for college was the best choice I have made and I am looking forward to pursing my degree to become a teacher here."
Freshman,5,As I am an incoming freshman for CCSU when I toured it I was extremely pleased with the amount of diversity I viewed there. The campus was bustling with different activities and clubs ready to take in new people. I am really excited to become a Blue Devil and soon alum.
Freshman,5,"I will be an incoming freshman at CCSU, but so far from the orientations and open houses the school seems very welcoming and an overall fun campus. The class sizes is one of the reasons I chose the school because they would give the teacher and students a better advantage to interact and get noticed."
Junior,5,"Central has been great to me. My friends and I all agree that this school was definitely a good choice. Professors are fair, and the school is lit"
Junior,5,"I've been loving attending he university. Great professors and a lovely campus environment. My friends and I frequent the bar Elmers right off campus, and also find it very easy to hangout in the dorms. I wish I could stay here longer"
Niche User,5,"These kids really made CCSU great again. I go to SCSU and I went up to a frat party at Central and it was an absolute rager. Dudes really be screaming make Ccsu great again, like it was do it for state or something"
Sophomore,5,"CCSU is a great school to attend because it is a community of amazing people, professors, and administrators that want to see you succeed. It's an overall positive and warming environment! CCSU is a family."
Alum,5,CCSU was devoted to ensuring you started with a dream and ended with a future. The professors of the Biomolecular Science program went above and beyond all expectations to help their students.
Freshman,5,"The university has several different aspects to look at and all of them are excellent. The school has an amazing school ground, good food, excellent study space, and everything that you need to keep you busy on the weekend. From studying to jobs, the university has a vast and open selection of choices to do in your free time."
Sophomore,5,"I like Central Connecticut State University because of the opportunities offered. I transferred from the University of New Haven because I did not feel safe, happy, or successful there.  At Central, I am beyond happy. The faculty are truly helpful, I feel incredibly safe on campus, and I'm not afraid to go around and make friends just by sitting on a bench on campus. The classes can be challenging, but I know that the education is worth it because the professors really push you to be the best you can be. Central is a wonderful school at an affordable price."
Sophomore,5,I like it. There is always something going on and there is always willing to help you out. I would recommend attending.
Alum,5,I'm a vet most issues I've had have been with the va.  The va is an issue that they have not found a resolve for.
Junior,5,"I have only attended Central for a short year, however my time spent their has been wonderful. I attended a state school  in Vermont and a community collage and while at Central I have noticed a lot of resources, the facility is clean, and the campus is safe. The professors really care about their students, individually. This must be so hard considering how many students they each must have. While attending Central  you really feel like your not alone and you always have someone to  turn too."
Freshman,5,I am currently Freshman a Central Connecticut State University and so far the experience has been awesome! The professor I've so far really care about their students and help you if you need it. The campus is huge but easy to get around because of the maps located on the campus. But I would love to see more diversity on campus.
Freshman,5,I love my college. The campus is not too big or too small. The professors are all so wonderful. They are very accommodating to students with disabilities and really want each student to succeed.
Niche User,5,"This University's on campus life is the center hub of socialization. Most people who go home after classes are missing out on a fantastic opportunity to meet life long friends and create amazing experiences. The campus is extremely clean and beautiful, just don't veer too far away from it if you don't know how to navigate the New Britain streets. The campus is constantly expanding and being updated to help keep this place looking amazing. The teachers generally have vast knowledge of their field, and are willing to help you if you are struggling in the class. There are so many opportunities for employment and involvement especially if you live on campus.  "
College Sophomore,5,"We have great teams with a great athletic environment for division one, club, and intramurals."
College Senior,5,"When I came to CCSU, I had to take a mini-course made by students. The course's main topics were alcohol abuse and sexual assaults. I think we, as a school, care about the sex problems."
College Senior,5,"I love this school. I do wish, however, that we had more sections for the engineering classes. Sometimes it's hard to get into them."
College Senior,5,The athletic programs are great in our school and it is a lot of fun. I enjoy all the announcements that they send out to all the students
College Senior,5,The school is great especially with adult learners they accommodate well with children in the classroom
College Sophomore,5,Wide variety of parties considering the amount of clubs that are offered on campus. It is important to get involved.
Freshman,4,What I like about Central is how everyone on campus is nice and are cooperating with COVID guidelines. I like how even during the pandemic that they are still organizing events whether they are online or in person but social distancing. There is not much that I would change about the school I haven't really been around the campus that much.
Sophomore,4,"The online experiences were very good. Like every other school adjusting to the new norm, we had our moments of confusion. However, after a few trial runs and mess ups, we were very for the rest of the semester. Classes ran very smoothly."
Junior,4,"Online classes are not too bad. It is like anywhere else, as long as you stay on top of your work there is no problem."
Sophomore,4,"I like the resources available and the cheap cost compared to other schools. I don't feel that autonomous however, and it seems students are somewhat micromanaged. For example, you need a code given by your advisor to register for classes the next semester."
Junior,4,I enjoy taking classes online. I have learned a lot more than I anticipated. The only down side is that have yet to have a online lecture with an opportunity to ask teachers question about the material in real time.
Junior,4,"I enjoy classes here at Central. However, I had to change Majors because the Major I really wanted did not offer the classes for evenings and weekends need to complete my degree in a reasonable amount of time. I switched to Psychology and there are plenty of opportunities to register for classes that fit within my schedule."
Senior,4,Professors put in the extra effort to make online learning feel just as real as sitting in the classroom physically. Great experience.
Junior,4,"I think CCSU is an accepting and fun school. The people I've met have been incredibly kind, many of the teachers have been nice and one of them is one of my favorite teachers ever. Campus is super nice albeit a bit small (which isn't necessarily a problem.) 

I was working and taking classes at the same time so I didn't get to fully experience life on campus an I didn't stay on campus after classes for long, however when I did I always had a relaxing time sitting in the student center, studying in one of the buildings or going to my friends dorm to hang out."
Graduate Student,4,"I like the size of the campus, it is easy to get to each building so you won't be late to class. It is easy to get around. I also like that since it is a smaller school the class sizes aren't as big, so it's easier to form a relationship with your professor so they can help you if needed."
Alum,4,When I attended Central Connecticut State University there were so many great things. The professors in the Education Department were amazing. They truly loved what they did and wanted to help us all be the best teachers we could be.
Junior,4,"I love this school, despite only being a commuter. The teachers are usually very chill, and incredibly willing to work out issues with students. The campus is gorgeous, and the diversity in events is always fascinating. The only bad thing I would have to say is that the online systems can glitch often, but these problems are normally fixed withing 24-48 hours."
Junior,4,Very good experience for me so far. Central Connecticut State University is a solid school for most majors in CT.
Alum,4,"Great value for the relatively low tuition. I didn’t graduate with crippling student debt and was offered a job in my field out of college. I was a commuter, but I still felt like there was plenty to do on campus. Between classes, I would often attend yoga classes, swim laps, hang out in the student center. My biggest dissatisfaction with the school is the career center was not helpful. They gave me advise that ended up being counterproductive. The internships through the school are scarce. After graduation, I tried to offer an internship through the school and the process was a lot more difficult then neighboring schools like UHart, or Quinnipiac."
Niche User,4,I like their communication but they lack staying with deadlines. I have had positive experiences with getting in touch with the staff which I enjoy.
Freshman,4,CCSU is a fairly good University.  It has a nice campus with plenty to do and plenty to see.  They are constantly building new spaces and renovating certain places on campus to increase the experience of attendance.  The professors for the most part are very nice and resourceful when you need them.
Niche User,4,"I love that there's always something to do. I have so far had a very mediocre professor, but everyone else was friendly and welcoming."
Niche User,4,"I admire the location of Central Connecticut State University. In my opinion, it is not to far but not too close and has everything you need right around the New Britain area. In addition, they are known for their fantastic Business program that they acquire, as well as, their athletics. They are a phenomenal DI school. In my opinion, I do not think it can get better than Central Connecticut State University!"
Junior,4,The campus is very up to date. Started a gaming center on campus. Plenty of food options to choose from and many clubs and activities to be part of.  Easy to get to and get around without a shuttle bus. A large university with a small town feel. Many options for degrees and help with any class you may need. The staff is helpful and accessible when needed. Some of the dorms are up to date while others are not so updated as they could be. There are some form that are still just as they were 20 years ago. The student center has a lot going on both food and activities. There is plenty of parking available to students.
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at CCSU. So far my experience has been great. It has taken a little bit of time to get acclimated to the large campus and the schedule (not as structured as high school), but I feel ready. Attending orientation at CCSU was very helpful. It prepared me and I was made aware of the different programs, resources, and clubs that were at my disposal as a matriculated student. The location is not the greatest, but that is easily overlooked by the beautiful campus. I am looking forward to the next few years there."
Senior,4,"I like Central Connecticut State University, however they do not act on student feedback regarding professors, so if you feel that one is not up to par, they are very unlikely to do anything about it."
Freshman,4,"I love Central Connecticut State University. It is fulfilling all of my views about what being a college freshman is all about. I really love all the professors I have had so far and everyone, in general, is very helpful and accessible, making me feel very comfortable at this school. The environment on this campus is really great and I love spending time here as a full time student."
Niche User,4,"They offer very good opportunities for honor students, and clubs for stuents to connect with each other."
Niche User,4,"Central Connecticut State University is a good school with a large selection of course subjects. The school has a great campus life with many different activities such as sporting events, performances, etc... all across campus. Highly recommend CCSU."
Freshman,4,"Only just starting, I am really enjoying my start at Central Connecticut State University. The campus activities are nice and the people are friendly and nice. I look forward to how my 4 years will span out at this school."
Sophomore,4,"I like it a lot. I have a lot of friends here, the teachers for the most part get the job done, and i feel very comfortable being here."
Sophomore,4,"So far my experience with CCSU has been a great one. I have not had this problem personally, but I am close with various people who have had issues transferring credits while entering CCSU and I would love to see that change. People work hard and pay lots of money to attend, and it is only fair to them to honor their academic work by transferring their credits."
Freshman,4,"My freshman year at Central was a pretty good one. There are many resources for a student to seek help in nearly every subject. Out of the teachers I have had, they are all very understanding and work with you for help in their class. I would like it if there were more clubs available on campus, there are not that many and I would really love it if I could join one that actually fit my interests both academically and socially. I also wish there were more events on Campus as well of the few that we've had I had so much fun attending and really wish we could have more."
Freshman,4,"After spending a full year of college there, I have seen some ups and downs. The ups I have seen so far are how my professors have taught, how well the college is structured, and the local area you're in. There is sadly one downside that needs to change and it's about how they handle certain situations. The biggest situations would have to be the weed smoking and the way they handle suicidal students. I have to say that both situations , in my eyes, have not been handled very well. For example, sometimes you can never go to a certain floor in a dorm building without smelling weed. Why hasn't Central cracked down on that? I can only hope that Central fixes its mistakes at this point"
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Central Connecticut State University has been wonderful. I absolutely adore this university. It is not too expensive, the campus is beautiful, and the students and professors are kind."
Junior,4,"I do appreciate what Central provides for their students and the level of diversity in terms of students, classes. I feel this school is is good for what you pay for and can help you elevate your career and advance you into the field you would like to pursue."
Senior,4,"Great about disbursing financial aid.
Parking is trash.
Interesting once you get to upper levels.
Worth it for the price tag."
Sophomore,4,"Its a cool school, not a party scene anymore, but really good professors, and they have funds for students who dont have the fund to lower their balance. Nice campus, and a lot of construction just recently was done."
Junior,4,I just recently transferred to the University and so far so good. I had trouble registering for classes before the semester started and an advisor immediately met with me and helped me register for classes which was a huge relief. The professors and all staff at the University care for the students. Lots of resources and who doesn't like a Starbucks on campus? This was a great choice for  me to transfer to!
Junior,4,"CCSU students have a lot of Blue Devil spirit, which I love. Also, they have a very good Criminology/Criminal Justice program here."
Junior,4,"Student Life is amazing, the professor are horrible and don't care, there's only a select few that care f a student passes their class, the food is good the first month of school."
Sophomore,4,"Central was very well put together . As a basketball player we had support coming from everywhere . I enjoyed the clubs and activities for student life . I lived in the newest dorms which was suites, so enjoyed my living arrangements really well. They had many of places on campus so you would never be bored or lonely"
Junior,4,I love the programs offered here.  The ease of registration is a big help too and there are so many staff and counselors available to answer any questions.
Sophomore,4,Central Connecticut State University has a diverse faculty that is willing to work with you in order to help you accomplish your goals.
Senior,4,"After nearly four years at Central I can genuinely say that I enjoyed my time here. Tons of opportunities to work on campus, cool events happen every week, and it's easy to find a club to join and make friends"
Sophomore,4,"I started my journey to  higher learning here in 2009. This school will definitely grow you into a better student and individual. I am now a mother and wife who has chosen to pick up where I've left off and Central Connecticut State University was there to welcome me with open arms. Their curriculum is designed so that the courses, no matter which one, reflect/reference one another. This makes the coursework easier to retain. The advisors for the School of Business  are easy to access for assistance and/ or appointments. There professors that I have had all have been willing to assist and seem to have their best interest in their students. I am forever grateful to have gained knowledge from this institution."
Graduate Student,4,"Overall I had a very good undergraduate experience at CCSU. I enjoyed the nightlife around the campus, as well as my program of study, and it is very close to where I live. I liked it so much that I will be returning in the fall for my graduate studies."
Senior,4,"I chose central for the inexpensive price, but I have never regretted it. There are so many opportunities to get involved and you're exposed to all different lifestyles. I've learned so much here in 4 years."
Freshman,4,Overall I have had a pleasant experience at CCSU. There are a lot of resources for help and lots of people to help you along the college journey. There is also many ways to reach out and get involved at any point in time. Every week there are events going on and chances to meet new people.
Sophomore,4,CCSU classes really help me see what it means to be a future teacher.  I am able to learn about why we teach not just how to teach.  I would love to see CCSU grow more programs for commuters!
Sophomore,4,"The school is very quiet since everyone goes home all the time. Not a lot of people live on campus, but overall is not that bad. The food is okay and the people are cool, i guess."
Junior,4,"CCSU is a very open and accepting community, and the people and professors here are great for the most part. There is not a lot to do on the weekends for campus life, so a lot of students who live on campus go home on the weekends because there's more to do at home. The dining halls also have weird hours and it's hard to eat there on the weekends."
Sophomore,4,"Central is very sociable, afforadable, and very close to home for me. I live in Southington, so the campus is only 20 minutes away, if that. The campus seems to always have something going on for the students to stay busy when they are not already busy studying. The student center provides and cool place for students to kick back and relax, study, do homework, or even play games. In the game room, there is a variety of games to choose from. From billiards, to ping pong, to video games, air hockey, and many more. I would say that the only down side to Central Connecticut is that a slim few of the professors are not the nicest. In addition to that, the wifi is spotty but that is life, not everything is going to be 100% perfect."
Alum,4,"I attended Central Connecticut State University (CCSU) for two and a half years. During this time, I acquired my Bachelor of Arts in Social Work while receiving a  minor in Psychological Science. One thing I noticed while enrolled at the university is that the teachers were very proactive in ensuring the best learning environment for their students. I found that the professors made themselves available to students who needed extra time outside of classroom time to process materials being taught in class. As a young African American Woman, I was further impressed by not only the diversity of the university's  faculty but also their students. Overall, my experience at CCSU was positive. The only thing I would change is for the university to be as considerate to traditional students as they are to non-traditional students as it relates to class availablity."
Sophomore,4,CCSU is a great school. For me I am a hour away from home so it's just far enough. The campus is gorgeous and they maintain the property very well. It is an easy campus to navigate. You have plenty of help around if you get lost you just ask someone everybody is friendly. My fist year was tough since I have ADHD and it took a while to get my services in place. Once that happen It was much better. Professors are great. The food they need to work on! Made friends quickly!
Freshman,4,Central Connecticut State University is a very good university for the price and academics available. I also really enjoy the housing on campus. The dining halls have good food choices.
Junior,4,"Central has an unique campus and great family atmosphere. There’s isn’t much that i would change about the University other than maybe an increase in the food quality. The selection can be very repetitive and that’s not very fond of the students. While this shouldn’t be a deal breaker when looking for a school, it is something that can take Central Connecticut State from being good to outstanding."
Freshman,4,"I liked the professors at CCSU. They are very welcoming, fair, and great teachers. It is clear that they care a lot about their students.  There are great services provided, and the atmosphere of the school is very comforting. My only concern is that there isn't more study areas."
Senior,4,The faculty members are so nice and willing to help. The facilities are well kept. The curriculum is very good.
Senior,4,Best fit for a small local school. Gen-eds are not the best but once you get your major courses its great.
Junior,4,"I would like to see more of a change in the educational system. Where more teachers are involved and helpful to students. 
I would like to see more programs or internship opportunities in the campus and not just remodeling the physical buildings."
Junior,4,"While I can't speak to the on-campus experience at CCSU, I will say that I've been really impressed by the rigor of academics the school provided.

I transferred last year from a private liberal arts school, and the experiences I've had at Central have completely surpassed my expectations going in. 

Since enrolling, I've had publication opportunities, I've been given the chance to speak at conferences, and I've gotten an internship--this is much more than I can say about my prior college.

All that said, you do have to search for it. Career services seem pretty hands off, but if you're motivated and show an interest, it'll come to you. 

Great English department, as well."
Junior,4,I enjoy the fact that the campus is large and the people are helpful. The financial aid office works on your paper work automatically no stress about that. The food is well mad and delicious. The professors respond to your emails efficiently.
Niche User,4,"I never attended CCSU but my cousin did and I loved it. The dorm was alittle tight but that's how all traditionals are. I met so many friendly people upperclassmen included. The first couple of days I kept forgetting where my cousin dorm room was, there was always someone to help me. I really enjoyed the food. There was always something going such as extracurricular activities or events and parties. If I wanted to live in Connecticut I would've definitely attended Central. My cousin also said this school was great educationally wise. I do recommend this school. I just don't really care for the area the school is in."
Senior,4,"I have had a great experience at Central so far. My advisor has been extremely helpful for the past couple of years, and I've had some great professors who were able to gauge my interest in classes I wouldn't normally enjoy, and they really care about their students. The campus is also beautiful!"
Sophomore,4,"Great College with great teachers, Besides one math teacher that I had. The faculty is very nice and understanding. I would not want to go anywhere else for college. I enjoy the environment."
Junior,2,I had a horrible  experience transferring from the University of Nevada Las Vegas. Most credits did not transfer and the music department did not allow me to take placement exams to place out of classes that I had already taken.
Freshman,2,This is a eh for me  it literally looks like highschool in the engineering department. You’re surrounded with a bunch of idiots knowing that central accepts literally everyone. The dorms all stink and not to mention it smells like pure weed in dorms. If you wanna be a nurse they have good nursing program. I would recommend to go here  if you didn’t get accepted to uconn nursing program. Also the parties are caca
College Junior,2,"There are very few organizations on campus, so there's not much choice or variety. Greeks don't have that much of an impact on the social scene."
College Junior,2,"i would ave rather went to a different university, i made some great friends but not worth it"
College Junior,2,this school's general ed requirements are pointless and professors think they're super important at an 100 lvl and we should have more focus on our majors and minors. they get in the way and some even though we try hard get c's and c+'s and it effects our g.p.a and it's not even related to the major.
College Freshman,2,"Too expensive, not enjoyable. I have a suite and we were promised TVs that never showed up. Uncomfortable furniture. Room sizes are nice though. Literally no community, and the campus events are quick and lame. Defiantly a commuter campus."
College Freshman,2,"Not the right school for my major, which is digital media. hard to get involved in clubs, intro class full of unmotivated students. boring surroundings. wouldn't choose school if I had another chance to pick, as I believe I don't fit in here."
College Sophomore,2,"The career center that is available is only for freshman students. This has been aggravating for me on many occasions as I have had a hard time deciding a major. I would have liked to go to the center and get advising on what I may be good at, but it is only available for freshmen. I have only seen one employer recruiting on campus and most of the majors do not have internship prospects other than for education (student teaching). It is expected that students find those on their own."
College Sophomore,2,"There are a few sports on campus that are very good. The women's lacrosse, and swimming are known to do well. There is not a lot of school spirit and that is something I wish there was more of. It is not important for most students to attend football games or cheer on the team. The facilities are available, so my only guess is that it is coaching that creates a lack in skill for us to win."
College Freshman,2,"Central students are there for the wrong reasons. They are not there for their degree, only to party. The teachers are amazing so far but the students and the environment not so amazing."
College Sophomore,2,We don't have strong Greeks and are not a big frat school
College Junior,2,Our teams aren't very good. It's my first semester here and I haven't attended any games for any sport.
College Freshman,2,I did not get any financial aid.
College Freshman,2,"The campus is a dry campus, but that doesn't stop anyone from drinking. My Resident Assistant's rarely write anyone up for alcohol usage, when they are well and clear someone is in possession of it."
College Freshman,2,"The University encourages students to apply for the school scholarship, but there were none for students in my major, and none applied to me."
College Sophomore,2,"The food is too basic, with a barely any type of options or accommodations."
College Junior,2,"It's a bit of a process to apply for scholarships. they have no option that i can find to learn more about each scholarship, and if you click one you're not eligible for, you're disqualified."
College Freshman,2,I am a part of the marching band that plays at football games and there is hardly ever a crowd to play for.
College Freshman,2,I did not receive financial aid and am paying for college out of pocket.
College Freshman,2,"Parties get shut down quickly, and most people leave campus on the weekends."
College Freshman,2,Many teams are D1 but school is lacking in spirit.
College Sophomore,2,I went to one athletic event and decided not to attend anymore. It was embarrassing.
College Junior,2,"There is Chinese, Dominos, Dunkin Donuts, Frozen Yogurt, and one nice pizza restaurant. The pizza restaurant is the best option."
College Junior,2,When I was late for class and had to park closer to the building I would get multiple tickets.
College Junior,2,"Due to people who are uninformed I was misguided on a few occasions and had to pay for school out of my pocket which I had a hard time affording. I had to take a semester off due to the hold on my record so I could pay my monthly payments. Due to this fact, I was unable to earn the credits I needed to receive a pay increase in my district."
College Senior,2,A lot of people have issues with registration and how often and how many classes are offered.
College Senior,2,We had zip cars but for some reason the university cancelled the program. One public bus route which is inconvenient and no campus shuttle.
College Senior,2,Division one school but you wouldn't know it by watching our teams so not a lot of people attend the games.
College Senior,2,Campus is a wind tunnel and always floods when it rains.
College Senior,2,Big residential community of older individuals.
College Sophomore,2,There's just McDonald's and Dunkin Donuts nearby.
College Sophomore,2,"It costs me a lot in gas to get to school. Because I live at home, I do not receive financial aid but that would greatly help my transportation costs."
College Sophomore,2,DO NOT LIVE IN VANCE. It is literally hell. The rooms are smaller than a jail cell and there is no AC so you will melt in the beginning of fall semster
College Sophomore,2,Oh my lanta. The weather is horrible. It's super hot when you first get here and then gets so cold in the winter that you don't want to walk to your classes that are in other buildings. If it snows you better get your skis out because these people suck at putting down salt.
College Freshman,2,"The off-campus housing is pretty dumpy.  Plus this is where all of the parties happen, so only live there if that's what you want.  Most students live at home and commute.  About 1/4 of the students at CCSU live on campus."
College Sophomore,2,I'm not even sure if we have greek life so that basically says it all. We might...maybe.
College Senior,2,"The campus is in New Britain, nothing special and not very exciting. The area doesn't always seem very safe either. "
College Sophomore,2,I don't know about any transportation around campus except for taxis.
College Sophomore,2,It's hard being in New England because it ranges from extremely cold to very hot so you have to dress for the weather but if it's cold outside then the classrooms are very warm.
College Junior,2,Options to live in the city or country.  Cars are necessities.
College Junior,2,"Engineering, computer science, psychology are the biggest majors I come across."
College Junior,2,"High expectations, constrained to one to two buildings"
College Junior,2,"Not the biggest school, class registration is simple.  Programs fluctuate, and requirements aren't consistent."
College Junior,2,"There is a wide variety of teachers, primarily foreign, difficult to understand.  Program requirements fluctuate, no consistency."
College Junior,2,"Never noticed drug abuse, but alcohol is prominent even with strict campus safety"
College Junior,2,"Lots of parking garages placed around campus, reasonable walks to classes and dorms"
College Junior,2,"Use an apple at home, and on PC based computers on campus."
College Junior,2,this school has no life.  No body socializes.  It is very much like high school where everyone sticks to their own groups and cliques.  kind of sad.
College Freshman,2,"Not many options, but Tony's is my recommendation!"
College Sophomore,2,There are a few places to go eat off campus but other than that there really isn't anything to do
College Junior,2,There really isnt much Greek life going on @ CCSU. I wish that there was alot more Greek life on Campus because i would be inclined to join one or become more involved
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's cold in CT in the winter
but spring, summer and fall are great"
College Sophomore,2,CCSU is in a suburb so the transportation is really inconvenient.
College Sophomore,2,"Depends on who you hand out with. If you wanted drugs, you can find it."
College Sophomore,2,"It can be very cold and when it rains/snows the campus gets ""flooded."""
College Sophomore,2,Its average. Nothing over the top. The shows don't get alot of attention like they do down south.
College Freshman,2,"At Central, frat life is present, but it isn't over taking campus life. It's advertised all over the place, but every student doesn't feel the need to join these groups in order to connect with others."
College Sophomore,2,"CCSU is a dry campus so there aren't very many parties on campus, and alchohol is not allowed on campus. However, Elmer's Place (a bar) is a minute walk from the school, but for clubs/nightlife you'd have to drive somewhere off campus. It isn't too bad, but school is for learning."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life at CCSU is mostly about partying. I haven't seen the sororities or fraternities do any special work for the school or for the community. It's disappointing so see, because they should be working with the community more. Instead of working on campus based activities or community service, they are too busy planning their own parties."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Some public transportation exists in the city busses. They can get you to different places around town, or to Boston, but I do not believe that they are at all convenient. Other modes of transportation do not really exist. Since everyone is allowed to have a car on campus, a vehicle is your best choice."
College Freshman,1,Football team is the worst
College Freshman,1,"The greek life at CCSU is non existent. There aren't even houses on campus, they are down the road. Nobody really knows about them unless you are apart of them."
College Sophomore,1,I know good greek life and this school has the worst. It is pretty pathetic. I would feel embarrassed to be a part of this greek life.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no off-campus in close proximity to campus. There is one junky place  by campus that ""everyone"" lives in. I personally had to live multiple towns away and had to buy a car to live off-campus."
College Sophomore,1,"You have to have a car to get any ""off campus"" food. The mall area is close, but not open very late. The bus is not safe, although it does go from the university straight to the mall area."
College Junior,1,"I have had so many issues to getting my financial aid, not because I don't qualify but because the school has held to my financial aid, student loans and put holds on my account. I can't even buy my books for summer semester because I have not received my financial aid yet! It has been the worst experience."
College Junior,1,There isn't much of Greek culture at the school. I have only heard of one female sorority.
College Sophomore,1,There isn't a large Greek life at my school so it doesn't affect me.
College Junior,1,"Limited options, quiet campus shuts down early.  Not the greatest selections."
College Junior,1,Wasn't a fan.  Dorms aren't comfortable.  Suite style.  Cramped.
College Junior,1,Not much of a selection besides chain restaurants and mall food. Limited within walking distance.
College Senior,1,"It's in one of the worst cities in the State.  If you travel more than 1,500 feet in the wrong direction, you might end up in a bad part of town..."
Recent Alumnus,1,There was no transportation besides taxi or public bus.
College Senior,1,There is not much opportunity for internships and there is not much information available about them. You would have to be a 4.0 student and really close with a specific professor to possibly be lucky enough to stumble upon the opportunity of one. They are pretty much unheard of.
College Senior,1,HEALTH CENTER – I WAS FEELING UNWELL AND WENT TO THE HEALTH CENTER WHERE THERE WAS HARDLY ANY PATIENTS BUT THE APRN TURNED ME AWAY STATING I SHOULD GO TO THE COMMUNITY CLINIC. DID NOT HAVE TRANSPORTATION AND I ENDED UP CALLING 911. WAS TRANSPORTED TO ER FOR AN ISSUE THAT SCHOOL APRN COULD HAVE TAKEN CARE OF
College Sophomore,1,"Not So Great – Out of the four State Schools, I'd say central is one of the top two next to Eastern. But, scheduling is horrific, they school changes requirements and class schedules too much, if you want to graduate in 4 years, Good Luck if you go here. The advisors aren't very helpful and they don't have enough professors and staff that can help you choose a career. You are just a number, not a student."
College Sophomore,1,"There are not a lot of parking lots at CCSU. Tere is one open lot parkings and it is pretty good, but all the other ones are not very convinient. You have to use the parking lot at certain times, usually between 5pm -6pm so its very inconvinient for those who are taking morning classes. I would change the times to maybe 12 pm or even 11am, so that other students will have access to the parking."
College Sophomore,1,Not Enough – There is only one dining hall on CCSU campus. The food is repetitive and the same thing is served weekly which leads to ordering fast food. The food is tasteless and either overcooked or under cooked I wish there was something that the food services people will do about the food. I use my guest meals so I dont have to eat in the Dining Hall.
College Freshman,1,Greek Holds Little Effect on Campus Life – There are about 6 Greek groups on campus. Greek life is not big on campus and if often overlooked.
College Freshman,1,the nightlife is not good at ccsu. mostly because people go home every weekend.

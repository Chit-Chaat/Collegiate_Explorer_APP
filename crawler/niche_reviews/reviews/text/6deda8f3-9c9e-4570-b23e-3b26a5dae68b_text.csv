Sophomore,5,Love it! The facilities are amazing. Everything you would want from a small liberal arts college. It is really nice to be a student here.
Sophomore,5,There are currently a hybrid of in-person classes and online classes at the moment. The professors are amazing at adapting to this new world we are living in.
Junior,5,"Great Professors, research readily available. Campus is not very diverse though - largely conservative, rich white constituency. Still an enjoyable time, plenty of work and things to do outside of class."
Junior,5,Good transition to online. Professors worked hard to facilitate online courses and labs alike. Good communication from faculty as well on reopening plans.
Sophomore,5,"Biology: No live, mandatory classes, there were power points posted online almost every MWF. T/Th she would have 2 review sessions and then had 2 additional review sessions the class PLAs held. We watched more crash course than any person ever needed to see.

Chemistry: Amazing transition 10/10. Live classes held MWF at normal class time that weren't mandatory and were posted online later. At least 2 review sessions a week. The work load like homework and exams all stayed consistent before and after transitioning. 

Calc 2: Live classes at normal class times and posted online after. Exams were online and were open note and we had 12-24 hours to take them. I think I might have done better online than I would have done in person which makes no sense but...

Psych 1: A literal joke. Powerpoints with the prof's lecture recorded were posted every 4ish chapters. Didn’t watch a single one and still aced every exam. Didn't learn anything before and definitely didn’t learn anything after."
Alum,5,"Recently graduated from Gettysburg during the pandemic, while my time there was cut short I can’t wait to get back on campus and say an official farewell. The professors and students of Gettysburg are some of the most inquisitive but welcoming people I have had the pleasure of meeting.
Campus life is wonderful. As a student unaffiliated with Greek Life I never felt that I was left out or missing anything as many of my friends were in Greek Life and were very welcoming. Theme houses and campus organizations do a very good job of providing alternative activities and you’ll always find people who share your interests. 
Prepare to be challenged at Gettysburg. You’ll learn more in four years than you ever thought possible not only in the classroom but also about yourself and the world around you. 
Also Servo and Bullet are unbeatable when it comes to campus dining."
Freshman,5,"One of my favorite things about Gettysburg is its size. With 2600 students, it's small enough that you are constantly running into people you know on campus, yet there's still plenty that you don't. More importantly, as a student, you're not just a number. Gettysburg is much more personal than that. Profs know your name, notice when you're not in class and are very available to help students, as opposed to larger research universities. All classes are taught by profs and not TAs. Furthermore, as an all undergrad liberal arts college, undergrads get all the opportunities usually given to graduate students, such as research opportunities and teaching assistantships. I also love the friendly tone of the campus. On my first visit to Gettysburg as a high school senior, I chose Gettysburg because of the friendly and welcoming vibe radiating from the campus and students. It simply gave me ""that feeling"" that I would fit-in well."
Freshman,5,"Gettysburg College is an incredible school and I would absolutely recommend attending if you're accepted. It's such a welcoming and caring community, and the professor student relationship you'll find here is unlike any other college."
Niche User,5,"I like Gettysburg because it is an international university, with a lot of opportunities for all the students. In Gettysburg all the students fit and can become to the next generation of leaders. Proffesors in Gettysburg always care about their students, and help them not just in academics, also in their personal life. Gettysburg is one of the best colleges of this great nation."
Sophomore,5,"There have been some issues with the presidential turn over, but overall I couldn’t imagine being anywhere else. The conservatory is a huge asset, and all the faculty seems more than qualified to teach in their respective areas"
Niche User,5,"I met with many of the teachers, coaches, and students currently at Gettysburg and all of them seem down-to-earth and reliable. I value the tight-knit community at Gettysburg and seems like a prime location for a prospective political science major like myself. Hopefully, Gettysburg is the college where I can further pursue my academic career."
Alum,5,I loved my experience at Gettysburg. Courses and Professors were wonderful. I learned how to think critically and I became inspired to make a difference in the world.
Sophomore,5,"It feels like there's enough knowledge, activities, and opportunities on campus to support an active 20 year education.  The opportunity is overwhelming.  There's never a dull moment.  Besides name recognition, ivy league schools have no advantage over Gettysburg College.  Looking from the outside, you wouldn't think that the small school in rural Pennsylvania would harbor a strong party scene, but it absolutely does."
Junior,5,"Transferred to GC after attending a large, southern university. Making this switch was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Certainly a wealthy demographic, but most kids are not flashy and are generally very friendly and approachable."
Freshman,5,"The opportunities for connections, internships, and experiences are limitless and the professors are extremely helpful. The campus is beautiful and very inclusive."
Freshman,5,"I love it here! The classes I've taken so far have been really engaging, and I've had plenty of fun with friends that doesn't involve partying or drinking. Frats/sororities take up a lot of the social scene, but you can find your group of friends just as easily through joining a club. That's what I did, and I have a great group of friends now! I also find that there's plenty to do in town. There are a lot of shops, the battlefield is nice for taking walks, and there always seems to be events going on on campus. The food, while sometimes repetitive, tastes great. Freshmen dorms leave a lot to be desired, but I'm planning on moving into a college house next year (which are a lot nicer than the dorms.) One of my very few complaints is the CYC credit system- rather than the housing lottery being based on GPA, it's based on the amount of campus events you attend."
Freshman,5,"I think Gettysburg College is an awesome school and student life seems really great. However, Gettysburg is not a very diverse school and I would like to see that change. It is one of the top 50 liberal arts colleges in the country and has a great selection of minors and majors for students to pick from. The local area has a nice selection of restaurants and activities to choose from and Gettysburg has an amazing tour that you can go on to view the battlefield and all the different historical sights."
Senior,5,Great school! Teacher's typically care about all their students who put in the effort. Clean environment with many new facilties.
Alum,5,"I honestly loveddd going here! I graduated recently and I already miss it so much! I have friends that are juniors and seniors that want me to come back and visit and I hope to soon! I made so many friends here, gained confidence, and had SO MUCH FUN. It’s a work hard/play hard school, but everyone likes to party. If you don’t like to go out, this probably isn’t the place for you, because going out to frats is the main thing to do over the weekends. I had a job before graduation, and I really love what I do now. The food is great, the people are great, the professors are great. If I was a high school student again, I would absolutely pick to go to this school for college. I have no regrets about going here at all, and I truly got everything I could have ever wanted out of my college experience by going to Gettysburg. I know it sounds cheesy, but it’s really true. Would recommend Gettysburg to anyone!"
Alum,5,"Gettysburg College shaped me into the person I am today!  While the cost is high, professors truly care about their students' success; my professors allowed me to chart my own course in my academic endeavors.  Student life was also strong; working in Residence Life provided much professional development, and my involvement in clubs allowed for a vibrant social life.
Campus dining was absolutely amazing; the food was excellent and the staff warm and welcoming.  A beautiful community to be a part of."
Sophomore,5,I applied to Gettysburg College through early decision and I haven't regretted it. There are a ton of opportunities to be involved in the history/Civil War community here and a plethora of internships for the major. They are very accommodating with financial aide. The professors are overall very approachable.
Sophomore,5,"Gettysburg College is a great place for someone of any culture or background.  The science programs are amazing and really allow for some great internships and involvement.  All the foreign languages have a strong academics as well. Being a liberal arts school, you have to take a lot of classes and even if they have nothing to do with your major, you learn a lot and meet different people outside your major that you normally would not."
Junior,5,"I haven't had a professor that I didn't like.  The faculty are very friendly and try to get to know every student in the class.  Class sizes are small, and personal connections are highly valued.  Research positions are readily available as well.  The administration is also very receptive to student needs."
Junior,5,I absolutely love Gettysburg! Every time I go home for breaks I can't wait to be back on campus. First of all the campus is so beautiful and the downtown area is fun to explore. The academics and professors are top notch. The small class sizes really make a difference in your learning experience. The professors encourage you to attend their office hours and they are very approachable. Furthermore the students work together and help one another (its not like those super competitive atmospheres where everyone is only looking out for themselves). There is a huge variety of extracurricular activities students can get involved with too. In terms of the social scene greek life is a huge component. However being non-greek has not made my experience in Gettysburg any less enjoyable.
Niche User,5,"It's a fantastic school. Its gorgeous at all times of the year. It has a very friendly faculty and student body. It's academic are also top notch. 

My only complaint would be most of the social scene revolves around the fraternities on campus."
Alum,5,I really liked Gettysburg.  The health sciences program was great.  Offers nice campus housing and amenities.  There's a pretty strong greek life culture that might not be for everyone though.
Freshman,5,"Gettysburg is a beautiful campus. The academics are rigorous but not unmanageable. You will find some people who are very competitive and others who are more relaxed about grades. The professors are all dedicated to their students and willing to go the extra mile. Diversity on campus is ok, we have socioeconomic and racial diversity but less international diversity. We have a great gym and intramural/club sports program. We're division 3 so our collegiate sports programs are only okay (not a lot of fans watch the games). Depending on what dorm you live in, it can either be really nice or subpar. For freshmen the best dorms are Huber and Hanson. There's a great party scene thanks to the fraternities. However, if you don't participate you can still have fun. The local area is cute and we get lots of tourists but overall there's not much on offer. Campus food is better than most places but it gets repetitive. There's lots of fun clubs on campus and things to do, never a dull moment!"
College Sophomore,5,"Class sizes are small and professors make lectures engaging. There are so many courses offered, it is easy to take a class outside of your major."
College Sophomore,5,"Gettysburg offers many connections for internships and job opportunities through its extensive alumni network. Additionally, Gettysburg is a highly accredited institution and a degree earned here is well received."
College Sophomore,5,"There have been very few incidents during my time on campus. It is well lit at night, and I feel safe walking alone across campus in the dark. DPS is also provides rides for those who feel uncomfortable walking alone across campus or for those who feel unsafe."
College Sophomore,5,"Gettysburg is a D3 school, but students and staff still love to go out and see sporting events. The athletic facilities are excellent and open to everyone."
College Sophomore,5,"Gettysburg is a tightly knit community that offers numerous opportunities to each and every student. Professors are passionate about their fields and many do their best to help students succeed in not only their classes, but in their career goals as well. Students represent varied states and countries and come from all walks of life. Our campus may be small but our students and professors are dedicated to making our school 'Gettysburg Great.'"
College Freshman,5,It's academically challenging but so rewarding.
College Sophomore,5,"There are a ton of on-campus activities if you are not a partier, but plenty of parties if you are.  A few frat houses are right across the street from the freshman dorms, so is convenient for both freshman and upperclassmen."
College Sophomore,5,"The parties are pretty great and a lot of fun.  While they are pretty prevalent, again, you don't have to get involved in that scene to have a great time at the school."
College Sophomore,5,Incredible.  Everything is incredible.  I don't have a single bad thing to say about it.
College Sophomore,5,"I have yet to not like a professor or a class.  Even in classes in which I have little to no interest, I have found that my interest continually grows because of the passion and interest of the professors and other students in the class.  The classes are never more than 35 students, and can be smaller than 10.  The intimacy of the classes allows for bonds to form between students and the professor, and the small campus allows for easy communication both inside and outside of the classroom."
College Sophomore,5,"The job rate six months after graduation is 96%.  The alumni are highly involved in campus and hiring new graduates, as well as giving internship opportunities to students."
College Sophomore,5,"We have very  little crime and safety issues.  When issues arise, all students are notified as soon as possible and, if necessary, specific measures to address the issues are taken."
College Sophomore,5,"I have yet to have a serious issue with housing.  Even though my housing option feel through for next year due to the fact I am bringing a service dog with me to school, res life has been extremely helpful, understanding, and supportive in trying to find me another housing option.  All of the facilities are spacious and amazing!"
College Sophomore,5,"I never thought I would join Greek life, even though the majority of students are in at least one Greek organization; however, I ended up joining the music fraternity on campus.  If anyone is interested in Greek life, there are plenty of options, including those outside of a strictly social, party-type of group.  Even if you choose to not join, this does not divide you.  I have plenty of friends outside of Greek life, and plenty part of a fraternity or sorority as well.  Greek life does not divide campus; if anything, it brings it together."
College Sophomore,5,"I wouldn't change my choice ever.  It is an amazing school with immense opportunities.  The professors and students are open and welcoming, and I have yet to meet a professor who does not do his or her best to help their students if asked.  Both academically and socially, Gettysburg is a welcoming and incredible school."
College Senior,5,"Rock climbing, Jacob's ladder, great treadmills, and awesome lifting equipment."
College Freshman,5,The Department of Public Safety always has a presence making me feel secure. The police department is also close by and an ambulance is usually on standby.
College Freshman,5,There are plenty of opportunities to do externships with alumni. The college has active connections in many countries and states. Each professor cares and has lots of knowledge in their degree field. The career center is also excellent in helping with future plans.
College Freshman,5,Professors are more than willing to help students in need and offer a variety of programs to assist students struggling with subject material. The small class sizes make it possible to get the on-on-one attention needed to excel.
College Freshman,5,Our Career Center on campus is so helpful in assisting students in finding job and internship opportunities.
College Freshman,5,Gettysburg College is really good at making each of its students fee like an important individual. There is no such thing as having too many interests or being too curious here. The nurturing and friendly atmosphere paired with the vst opportunities make this environment a place to thrive.
College Sophomore,5,"I feel very safe on campus. There are dangerous things going on though. Sexual assault is a problem here, but it's a problem at most universities. At least here the administrators are dedicated helping victims."
College Freshman,5,"I made friends within a day or so, and nearly everyone is super friendly. I love how small the campus is. The staff are really nice, and the professors are almost always available for extra help, whether it be during office hours or emailing."
College Freshman,5,I have never felt unsafe.
College Sophomore,5,"From the amazing people and fascinating classes to the incomparable opportunities and beautiful setting, it's hard to complain about Gettysburg College."
College Sophomore,5,The Alumni network is absolutely amazing when it comes to making conenctions!
College Sophomore,5,I've absolutely adored the Gettysburg experience!
College Junior,5,I haven't seen it. But I know it's there. Not causing much of an issue.
College Junior,5,"I've love most of my classes and professors! The majority of professors are passionate about not only what they teach but also about the success and growth of their students. There isn't a wide variety of courses offered, but what we have is solid."
College Freshman,5,"Campus crime is very rare, and I have heard of no issues by students on campus. Personal safety is excellent on campus. The security on campus works hard to prevent any safety issues and often educates the students on ways to combat and prevent safety issues. I feel extremely safe on campus and have had no issues whatsoever."
College Freshman,5,"After experiencing my first semester at my school, I am completely in love. Gettysburg College is everything I could've dreamed of and more!! The school has some of the best food on campus and are fourth in the number of students who study abroad in all liberal arts schools in the country! These are just a few of the many things that make Gettysburg unique and amazing. The surrounding town and battlefield is gorgeous, and it's the perfect place to go to school. Gettysburg is a small and quaint town, and that's reflected directly to the college. I would without a doubt choose my school all over again. It envelops the ideas of a perfect ""college experience"" while also offering a challenging academic path and amazing professors. Gettysburg feels like home to me, and I would choose to attend the college a million times over."
College Junior,5,"I ended up choosing Gettysburg because of the merit scholarship I was offered, being the only school out of the 16 to which I applied which I did not tour, interview with, or have any communication whatsoever with admissions. I have never once regretted my decision!"
College Sophomore,5,"Our only dining hall Servo is amazing, it has so many food choices for even the most demanding hungry students. The only problem about Servo is that it's very crowded and sometimes there are even no seats for some students during the lunch rush time and dinner rush time, which makes lots of students wait standing before one table gets empty. Apart from that, I would give 100 out of 100 for Gettysburg food options and places to eat. The only disadvantage is that fruits and  sushi are ridiculously expensive, which I never eat."
Sophomore,4,"There are so many amazing opportunities at Gettysburg, from hands on student faculty research in the stem field, hundreds of study abroad programs, to political internships/ programs free of charge through the Eisenhower Institute. Gettysburg really does give you the experience you're paying for. And for those not like the stereotypical rich white kids, financial aid does absolutely everything they can to make the college as affordable as it can be. The professors and other faculty members are all so amazing. These professors genuinely care about us as humans. At such a small school, we aren't just numbers in a huge lecture hall. We get to create actual relationships with staff members, to the point where some of your professors know your schedule and check in with you on how you’re doing as a person-not just as a student. But the biggest downside: the rich preppy white kids. They are ten times worse than you’re imagining."
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love the academic integrity and atmosphere of this college! The vast majority of the professors and students are very friendly and welcoming. There are a lot of opportunities to get involved with community service, and a lot of the sports team here are very talented. The food here is very good at Servo and the Bullet Hole complexes. I really like how the track and field is open to all students rather than just the varsity sports teams. 
However, I would like to see a girls soccer club, and that the soccer clubs would be recognized as intercollegiate clubs to the school. I would also like to see more funding towards the science departments for equipment for research.  I was not really happy for the over 3% increase of tuition for this coming school year. But overall, a very lovely school."
Alum,4,"The professors took the switch to online courses in stride and really made the experience as comparable to the in person classroom as possible, but it couldn’t quite compare to the face-to-face interactions that are a cornerstone of Gettysburg."
Freshman,4,"Like all schools, this college is not for everyone. Personally for me, I had a great academic life. I was given opportunities that I dont think I could have had at other schools. I formed great relationships with my professors. My classes opened my eyes to different worldviews and ideologies. I grew as a person and a scholar. However, there are things to keep in mind. Depending on your personality, the enviornment can feel high pressured. At times it seems like everyone is involved in a million things. I do really well in this type of environment but not everyone does. Greek life is a large portion on campus.  Gettysburg is located in a small town setting. The town itself is very nice but it is a small town with not a lot to do. Just keep that in mind. Gettysburg's diversity is slowly rising but it is something that the college is working on improving. Resident halls could be better."
Senior,4,"I would not trade my undergraduate experience for anything. The knowledge that I have gained from Gettysburg College is something that I will take with me wherever I go. I have grown as an individual academically and have also gained a stronger sense of self confidence. The community at Gettysburg College is something very special, tightly knit, and genuine."
Freshman,4,"I really like the college. The campus is beautiful, the food at servo is great, and the professors really care about the students. The campus is also very safe at night and because it’s a small school, everyone looks out for eachother. Greek life RULES this campus and the social scene. I will definitely be rushing next year."
Alum,4,Academically it was amazing. Great financial resources! Great professors. Pretty conservative and homogeneous student body. Was hard as an LGBTQ student.
Freshman,4,"My first semester at Gettysburg College has been an interesting ride. There are so many amazing people, but if you don't get involved in activities as soon as you get on campus you'll struggle to get a solid group of friends.Partying is big on campus but you are able to find people who don't do it if you give it some time. While there isn't a huge number of clubs and organizations, find something you might be interested in and try it out!
The professors are absolutely amazing, even if you've never gone to their office hours they will often know your name and how you're doing straight away. They are so helpful and encouraging, and are truly willing to go the extra mile for students. 
Also, the food is amazing! While many of my vegan friends have very limited options, there's a good gluten free section, and many options (healthy and not-so-healthy) that are quality. The dining  staff is also incredibly friendly!"
Sophomore,4,"I had a great first year really connecting with the staff and professors. As long as you put in the work, your professors will see that, and acknowledge that. Professors are always willing to help, and even just chat if they have the time. Gettysburg has many resources too use as well, such as the Counseling Center with a driven team who all truly care for each student."
Alum,4,"I truly enjoyed my time at Gettysburg College. As a part of Greek life and a collegiate athlete, I really feel like I got Gettysburg's best. The classes were hard, but they were manageable for sure. Campus life improved over my 4 years there. Would recommend."
Sophomore,4,"I liked the small community that Gettyburg College had to offer. The ability to create relationships with professors and obtain opportunities that typically graduate students would be offered is utterly amazing. However, something I would like to see in Gettysburg's future is more diversity on the campus."
Alum,4,"Gettysburg (locals actually pronounce it “Gett-iss-burg”, so that’s a thing) is a Very Preppy school, & it can feel like an overgrown “good ole boy’s club” sometimes.  
Gburg isn’t always honest with prospies about greek life on campus. They’ll tell you that only 30% of students are greek, but will conveniently neglect to mention that freshman can’t “rush”, so that 30% is a diluted figure. Among upperclassmen, closer to 50% are greek.
Frat parties are really the only kind of consistent nightlife here. A lack of a diverse social scene is an issue the school talks about changing but doesn’t actually do much about. 
As for the frats, there were ones I always felt safe in & there were some that were rancid, coked out, groping pits of despair. But even with the better frats, a lot of the safety issues (sex.assault, hazing, etc.) that’ve come under serious societal scrutiny over the last few years are still very present."
Freshman,4,"I love this school. The unity I have experienced on campus is unlike any other. As a student you are inspired by doctors and professors as well as other students on campus. There is a mutual genuine appreciation that the individuals, wether it be professors, facility worker, or students, have for each other."
Freshman,4,"Gettysburg is incredibly inclusive if you are white and middle class, but it is going through considerable improvements currently to make it much more inclusive for all students. The professors really want the best for you and many get to know you well. The campus and town are beautiful and have plenty to do if you are from a suburb or small town, it is a harder transition for students coming from a city. There are plenty of great places to study or relax on campus. Some First Year dorms have air-conditioning, some don't but as someone who didn't have it, it was very manageable. There's also every club imaginable and if we don't have something, you can always make a club. Almost every student is incredibly nice and respectful towards everyone, too."
Freshman,4,"The students are friendly and relaxed. It's not common to see people walking alone, they are usually with friends, and it is easy to meet new people. The academics are excellent. Some of the larger departments focus on finding professors with an outstanding record of research and are well-known in their fields, but the smaller departments typically search for people who are exceptional teachers. Basically, what I'm saying is that a student can learn a lot and have a good experience no matter what major they choose. In addition, the dining services are the best! I can't talk about Gettysburg College without mentioning the food."
Niche User,4,"Gettysburg College gave me a homey feel. Everyone around the campus was very nice and my experience is what truly made me consider going to this college. Moreover, the connection that The Academy group has with given me more confidence in pursuing a spot within this school. Also, Gettysburg was one of the only our of state colleges that truly peaked my interests and I felt more than comfortable there. Finally, I was really happy that they have a program that will help me keep up with my mental health. Overall Gettysburg is a college that I know will be a great fit for me; the distance is the only barrier that I have but I feel that the distance will grow on me."
Niche User,4,"When I went to visit Gettysburg college the only bad thing was the weather. It was cold and raining. Everything that they could do to make my experience a good one is what they did. Their cookies are the best, the food wasn't too bad."
Freshman,4,Wonderful experience. My professors love what they teach and they always have the doors open. The food is amazing and there is always something to do.
Sophomore,4,"Gettysburg is a wonderful school. The campus is clean and beautiful and the professors really care about your growth and development. The Sunderman conservatory was a wonderful place to grow as a musician and an individual. This is a very small school so it sometimes feels as if you know everybody, and Servo, the dining center has delicious food and the staff members are very welcoming and friendly."
Freshman,4,"I think that going to Gettysburg College at first was a challenge because of the majority of students are White and I'm Asian. It was difficult to make friends at first but I'm really grateful that there is a department that is for international students. The professors are really nice and dedicated. They actually care about my academic process and there are many resources that help me survive my freshman year. Students are friendly and pretty cool. Not only they are ambitious, passionate and competitive in their studies but are also party people. The downside is the campus is located where there aren't that many things to do on the weekends besides going to parties. If you don't know how to drive like I am or you are a freshman, be aware that Gettysburg's public transportation is not that great. Most of the time you will walk. Buses and shuttles take a while and closed during weekends You may use Uber or Lyft but it's very limited."
Senior,4,"I've had some really dedicated teachers who make me passionate about my field of study. However, there have some problems with the faculty and staff, since they sometimes don't seem to care about the health of the students. There was black mold in one of the first year dorm buildings, and they likely knew there was some there, but didn't do anything about it until it became too bad to ignore. Despite this, I have had many great experiences at this school with professors and students alike, and had a great undergraduate career."
Junior,4,Gettysburg College is a fine academic institution with a great alumni network. Do great work here. The social life is amazing too. My experience so far has been really good.
Junior,4,"Gettysburg College is a liberal arts school, that is highly involved in the students career and well being. The teachers make the effort to get to know the students and help them succeed by all means possible. However, some teachers see the need to push certain ideas and beliefs on the students, though the students have expressed difference, which is highly inappropriate."
Freshman,4,"I'm a freshman at Gettysburg and I have to say that I really like it. I have a great group of friends and I like all of my classes. Some of my professors are really bad, but they were for an entry level class so it doesn't really matter that much. I have learned a lot so far and my good professors are always willing to help. There a re a lot of clubs on campus, but the school is starting to crack down on fraternities, as they don't really like them which I think is dumb. Greek life is really big on campus and a majority of people rush. The party scene is sometimes hit or miss it just depends on what you think is fun."
Alum,4,"Gettysburg is a wonderful little school if you like smaller campuses.  The campus is beautiful, and many of the buildings are newly rennovated.  Getting anywhere urban is a long drive however, as the nearest city is Harrisburg, PA, and is almost an hour away."
Freshman,4,I love the location of Gettysburg college and the students that attend. There is a family type brotherhood that is built with the people you meet and you make friends and relationships that will last a life time. If there was one one thing that could change at Gettysburg is the diversity. The school needs to have a more diverse group of students.
College Sophomore,4,"Completely amazing school in a picturesque location. A little isolated, but there are always a variety of things to do on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Freshman housing usually sucks but it is in an ideal location, whereas upperclassman housing is pretty nice (for the most part....looking at you, Muss) but usually a pretty far walk from classes"
College Sophomore,4,"While Greek life is extremely prevalent on campus, people who are not in Greek life are not looked down upon or isolated. People who are in Greek life are not judged based on their affiliation."
College Sophomore,4,"We have great athletic facilities and our teams usually do pretty well. The athletes aren't very clique-y, which is good."
College Sophomore,4,"Amazing people, amazing sports, and most importantly, AMAZING FOOD. Not a lot of diversity, but it really seems like the administration is trying to rectify that."
College Sophomore,4,"Housing for freshmen can be hit or miss, some dorms have fairly small rooms. Upperclass housing is much better, with several converted motels, theme houses, and apartment options. As long as one roommate's GPA is relatively high, the housing lottery system will work out in your favor."
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life plays an important role in the social scene, but with that said, being a member of a sorority or fraternity doesn't help or hinder anyone both in terms of getting into parties and how Greeks are viewed by non-Greeks. There are no sorority houses on campus, only fraternity houses."
College Sophomore,4,"While there are occasional, very very rare cases of discrimination, there is overall a diverse and open attitude towards most."
College Sophomore,4,"We have great school spirit, support, and facilities; however, they are not necessarily a huge part of campus life (though they can be for you if you make them so).  As in most things at Gettysburg, everyone is supportive of student involvement in athletics."
College Junior,4,Working out is easy and the equipment's great.
College Senior,4,"DPS is always available, at all hours of the day. They will come walk you home at any point of the day/night, any day/night whenever you feel like you need it. They are thorough with investigations and reports, even when things happen in town."
College Senior,4,Students from Gettysburg are usually held highly amongst employers and grad school programs. The career development center was great in helping with resumes and practicing interviews.
College Senior,4,"Professors are almost always willing to help when you are clear that you will put in the effort. Professors are experts in their field and offer classes that teach us the best education and most up to date data possible. Classes are usually pretty small. The biggest I've ever had was like 45 students. We don't have TAs at all, but we have Peer learning assistants. Professors teach every single class- not the PLAs. I love that. Styles vary with each professor, but most are lectures and some discussion."
College Senior,4,"I have had a pretty good experience at Gettysburg. I did not join Greek life, and I am very happy that I did not. I found that most people who did, did not do as well academically as I did. I did do a varsity sport, and it was manageable because I never stopped working. I think I am doing well and got into the grad schools that I got into mainly because of my work ethic. However, the school provided me with many resources and great connections that I needed as well. My favorite experience was working with athletic coaches (that were not in my sport) because they were great mentors and actually had many resources for me. I earned an internship from one of the people that they put me in contact with, and I am certain that I would not gotten into grad school without that life changing experience. My school is unique because we have the small classroom size and personal connections with professors, but at the same time, we still have a recognizable name and great research opportunities that big universities have. I would choose Gettysburg over again in a heart beat, but I would like to get involved in a few of the many organizations and clubs that they have to offer (but I would still stick with the no-Greek decision)."
College Freshman,4,Great academics but sooooo hard to do well and have fun
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone here goes to the gym multiple times a week, some even multiple times a day.  There is a huge focus on fitness at this school, especially considering that it is D3.  It is ranked third in the country for most number of students to be involved in intramural athletics, and many students are also involved in a club or varsity sport of some kind.  The fields are well maintained, and the gym is modern and beautiful."
College Freshman,4,The professors here actually care about how well you do in their class. They will get to know you by name if you put in at least a little effort. Many courses for various majors and minors are available.
College Freshman,4,The gym here is one of the newest buildings here and it is magnificent. Many people here either play on the college team or are in some sort of club sport. There are always people wearing college related sport attire.
College Freshman,4,"This college has a lot of opportunities to advance my self including study abroad, summer research, and research during the school year. I feel like I'm getting prepared for my future in this college. I would choose this school again because at the start I didn't know what I was going to do with my life, but now I have a good idea."
College Freshman,4,"The Department of Public Safety officers are around 24/7, and the campus blue-light system always makes me feel safe."
College Freshman,4,"It really depends on where you're living on campus, but the First-Year Residence Halls are very conveniently located and create a very healthy and productive community atmosphere."
College Freshman,4,"Greek Life is a pretty big part of Gettysburg's campus, but it is a great outlet to network, make new friends, and volunteer and give back to different organizations."
College Freshman,4,Gettysburg is a great college. It has a large variety of activities for students to participate in and teachers are very involved. Everyone on campus wants you to succeed and will help in any way that they can to ensure that success.
College Sophomore,4,The network is great here. The people at career services are pretty bad you're better off looking for jobs on your own and asking them for connections. There are great employers at the job fairs such as ATT. Opportunities are out there if you look for them.
College Sophomore,4,"I've had some amazing professors. They really do care about you as a person. I even went to one of their houses for Thanksgiving. However, I've also had some bad professors, who grade unfairly and are useless in the classroom, which is pretty average for most schools. What you don't get at most schools are the good ones. Honestly just get to know your professors and you'll be better off for it."
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life is pretty big here. The Greeks are a lot of fun and they have great events and parties. Fraternities are great here and fairly easy to get into. As long as you like to party you will get a bid. Sororities are done a little differently due to the strict rules set by the Panhellenic council. You don't rush until the fall of your sophomore year. The school wants students to experience a year without it to show students the other things they can do. This is good and bad. It's good because students really do see what it's like to do other things. However, due to the delayed rush most pledge classes are pre chosen, so get to know the greeks your first year if you want to receive a bid from the organization you want. I personally love greek life and encourage everyone to be involved."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm on the women's golf team and it's great. We are almost always undefeated and we play at one of the best courses in the area. We also have a top of the line golf simulator by Trackman (I believe we are the only D3 school to own one). We have great coaches for all of our athletic teams. Fan support is not the best, but all of our teams have great school spirit. Our gym is beautiful as well. We have a great soccer pitch (field hockey and lacrosse play there as well). Our track and football field is also very nice. The trainers are great and make sure everyone is taken care of right."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the people and I've had some pretty great classes. We have a great party scene, but the professors can be unfair and ineffective."
College Freshman,4,"We have ""DPS"", our own police force, and the town's police are always patrolling."
College Freshman,4,The courses are diverse and the professors who teach them love their jobs and their topics and are generally very enthusiastic about everything. Class sizes are small to medium... my largest lecture was 38 people! I love how the professors actually know my name.. and sometimes I am the only one in office hours! Things like that just cannot happen in a larger school.
College Freshman,4,My boyfriend was accepted to a one day internship as a freshman; the opportunities are bountiful and no one is excluded regardless of your year or major.
College Freshman,4,"My room is huge, thankfully! I got placed in the basement (the only all girls floor in the entire college... I didn't ask to be put down there!), so I don't get a lot of natural light, unfortunately. I have a large, walk-in closet, a dresser, bookshelf, and desk (and under-bed storage) so all of my things have a home. Housing is random, however, and you may get a hall with air conditioning and a big room... or you might get one of the halls with no AC and a tiny closet."
College Freshman,4,"Only had 4 classes, liked 2 very much and found 2 very challenging and not all that enjoyable.  There was grade favoritism in one of my classes, with the prof advisees getting much better grades than the rest of the class.   Taking Italian was very demanding, difficult and not all that enjoyable  I loved my freshman seminar but the grading at the end of the class was slightly confusing.  There are so many transitions in the first semester, I look forward to the second semester and knowing more."
College Freshman,4,"The residence hall I am in is not one of the nicest, but it has one of the nicest location, so you give up a little in quality for the proximity to the dining hall and athletic facilities.  I really like my hallmates and my dorm this year overall"
Niche User,2,"I honestly do not recommend Gettysburg. It can be especially challenging getting into the classes you need. As a health science major I had an extremely difficult time get into a chemistry class due to limited class times and space. Popular classes are almost impossible to get into unless you are really lucky. Housing is pretty bad until you are a junior or senior. Some days it’s very difficult to get a seat at the library especially during final or midterm season. There really isn’t that much to do in the surrounding areas so it can get very boring. Nightlife gets old very very fast because there are only 6 pretty small frats on the whole campus and it’s like the only thing to do on the weekends for partying. Also they are very strict on freshman drinking.  Greek life very big (but not emphasized at all on tours) but kind of lame because sororities do not have houses. Also the counseling center is not good, I know many people who struggled to get appointments."
Freshman,2,"academics are sometimes very and almost too challenging. social life on campus sucks especially if you are a freshman or don't belong to a Greek organization. nothing to do ever- very boring. everyone is a clone of each other, no diversity in student body at all."
Freshman,2,"Gettysburg Campus is gorgeous and it can't be beaten. This campus has basically no diversity. It is made up of upper-class white kids you believe they are entitled to everything. The Department of Public Safety is also a joke!
They don't do anything and practically endorse drinking. I'm sure the food is very good for most people but if you have dietary restrictions they serve practically the same meal every week. It gets old really fast. The biggest issue with the campus is that everything revolves around frats. If your not into partying you will have practically nothing to do on the weekends. There are some very good people here but as I said, no frats=no friends past 10 pm."
College Junior,2,"Unfortunately, students don't typically treat the housing facilities with care, and it shows. Bathrooms can get gross, furniture can get destroyed when people get rowdy, and even ceiling tiles get damaged. To make it worse, people not only forget to look after the building, but they forget to look after each other."
College Freshman,2,"Have to join greek life to have fun. If you do, it's great. If you don't, transfer"
College Sophomore,2,"There is not an abundance of diversity on campus.  When Black Lives Matter had a protest here in the beginning of the year, students vandalized their posters to say Black Lives ""Don't"" Matter, for example.  There have been other instances of tension between race, although things have settled throughout the year."
College Sophomore,2,"There's a lot of drug use throughout the whole school, with some frats even requiring pledges to buy/use.  It's a heavy presence, and it's well known.  DPS doesn't seem to mind too much."
College Freshman,2,"Lots of people participate in varsity and intramural/club sports but no students attend games. Mostly parents are the people in the stands. The teams' performances are pretty average, for a D3 school anyway. Besides sports, school spirit is pretty good. Everyone is always wearing Gettysburg clothing, etc. Everyone talks up the school and seems to like it here. Athletic facilities are great-- the gym is new and really nice. No teams are really looked down on at all, everyone has their place and not many people feel the need to put down other teams at all."
College Freshman,2,"You have to apply to live off campus, and usually only seniors do it. There are pros and cons to it. Living on campus all 4 years is nice because you're close to everything, but it can be irritating that you can't really grow up any and live on your own. Gettysburg has a lot of housing that's a little farther from campus than main dorms are though."
College Sophomore,2,"Not given enough money for the amount of money my parents make. ALWAYS submit your SAT scores, even if they're bad, you'll get more money."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is predominately wealthy white students, with very little diversity."
College Freshman,2,"I think we have too much Greek Life. Also, being someone who is anti-Greek Life to begin with I could care less about Greek Life."
College Freshman,2,"Several people use marijuana and the frats are opened almost every weekend and college law says that the Department of Public Safety cannot break up a frat party, so......."
College Freshman,2,does not have much to help get around.
College Freshman,2,"But not the bad, you could still go to class."
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you go out to the frats, (which most people do), chances are you are drinking, and 95% of the people around you are drinking. But some frats are trying to limit the availability of alcohol for minors because the school is cracking down on them. If you choose not to drink, I didn't feel much peer pressure to drink- no one every said ""You're not drinking! Drink drink drink!"""
College Freshman,2,"There isn't really a reason to live off campus, on campus housing is guaranteed all four years and the options are very good on campus. Almost everyone lives on campus"
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is all-encompassing; if you don't want to go to a frat (no sorority houses), you're out of luck in the social scene."
College Freshman,2,"If it isn't the spring or early fall, the weather sucks."
College Junior,2,"There are outlet shops which are fun to go to on weekends. There are also many good restaurants around, and there are two movie theaters, one within walking distance that shows older films and another that is within driving distance that shows movies that are currently in theaters. The town is quaint and cute. I personally wish I lived in a more metropolitan area, since I come from a rather busier suburb, but many students come from rural areas and view Gettysburg as a busy city. Objectively, it is not a busy city in the least, but there are certainly things to do, and the college offers many activities for its students to enjoy."
Niche User,1,I did not take online classes at Gettysburg and am glad I did not. I think to pay so much for online classes would be insane.
Freshman,1,"This school looks great on paper and when you tour. They do a really good job of hiding what really goes on. First and foremost, there is absolutely NOTHING to do in within an hour radius of Gettysburg. The nearest Walmart is 20 minutes away. The only thing to do at Gettysburg is waiting until the weekend and go to the frats and get blackout drunk, which gets old fast. If you're a guy, good luck getting in. Also, the frats open at midnight, so you can't do anything until then. If you don't join greek life, you'll be isolated for your entire college career at Gettysburg, which is really sad. The school has virtually no diversity, with at least 90% of the school being rich white kids from New England. This school has been a huge letdown. On the other hand, the academics are pretty rigorous and the professors seem to really care about your success. The food is good, but lots of carbs. The dorms are terrible until junior year. Gettysburg has been a dissapointment."
College Freshman,1,Freshman dorms are okay. Sophomore housing absolutely sucks. Upper class housing is okay
College Freshman,1,"The prevalence of the partying on campus is slightly atrocious, which isn't something that they tell you when you walk in the door. It's mostly the frats that cause people to be stumbling across the halls at 2 in the morning, as well as all the screaming at night. I personally didn't come to this college for those things, so it is very frustrating. However, if you want to have a ""good time"", then Gettysburg is the place to be!"
College Sophomore,1,You have to apply to be allowed to live off campus so very few people do so.
College Senior,1,Its windy and holy s*** it seems to never stop raining
College Senior,1,"Im rating diversity strictly on political views...Its disgusting how liberal the teachers, administration, and students are.  I believe that the conservatives are truly the ""silent majority"" but the amount of liberal bullshit this school feeds is terrible."
College Senior,1,DPS ruins everything.  More importantly there is no such thing as freedom of speech on this campus.
College Senior,1,"gbcwifi is the bane to my existence, its slow, unreliable, and is always down."
College Freshman,1,"There are a lot of frat parties and there is a lot of nightlife and my school, but I do not like or participate in the kind of activities that occur."
College Freshman,1,"Most kids here come from wealthy, white Republican families. There's very  little diversity on campus. The most diversity we have is the multitude of international students we attract."
College Freshman,1,"If you are looking for diversity, don't come to Gettysburg. If you don't care, it isn't a problem. The population is mainly middle-upper class white people."
College Freshman,1,Very few people that are not white. There isn't much Hispanics in the college or other races.
College Freshman,1,"Guys are rude and completely immersed in Greek life, as are girls. Students are almost entirely upper class white students with extremely wealthy parents. They are snotty and arrogant. This creates a rather unfriendly environment. Students drink continuously from Wednesday to Sunday. Students are entirely preppy or hipster."
College Freshman,1,"Disciplinary action involves receiving points for each violation. The amount of points you receive depends on the severity of the violation received. When you reach the maximum of ten points, you are required to leave school for a semester leave or you are subject to explusion.

In other words, it's pretty strict. Being discrete is the key."
College Freshman,1,"Gettysburg is not very diverse. Economically, somewhat, but not so much culturally. There is only a handful of minorities on campus."
College Junior,1,"The absolute dearth of singles on campus makes life difficult.  Sometimes, people just don't play well with others, and would prefer a single.  Don't get your hopes up, not until senior year will you be able to find a single, and even then you'd better hope you're in the top 100 for room selection (and that's based off your academics).  
Freshmen dorms are SMALL SMALL SMALL."
College Junior,1,"Summed up on one word: Rain.  But really, Gettysburg is: too hot in the summer, too rainy/windy in the spring, like a frozen tundra in the winter, and a disgustingly miserable mix of all three previous season in the fall."
College Junior,1,"If you are physically handicapped, either temporarily or permanently, Gettysburg is NOT the place for you.  The sidewalks are uneven, absolutely no dorms have elevators, and several buildings on campus are completely inaccessible to the disabled."
College Junior,1,"Tickets, Tickets, Tickets – Out of the 60% of campus that has cars, probably 90-99% of them have gotten a ticket.  The parking here is limited.  Parking spaces are highly competitive.  Handicap spaces are extremely rare... and seems to me, to be a pending lawsuit.  DPS (Department of Public Safety) is ridiculously strict about ticketing, so watch out... and I know what you're thinking ""I won't get a ticket!  I don't park illegally!"" Well, after coming here and witnessing the competitiveness of parking, you'll get it."

For the world, it is an international school with, again, alumni found in nearly every country and in every industry. The Howard network is broad and deep. Howard excellence is pervasive at the school and extends well beyond its hallowed halls."

The yard (main campus) is beautiful during the spring/summer time and an amazing place where all the students gather to kick back and relax. There is a strong sense of union at Howard and belonging. The campus food was OKAY, I heard its a lot updated now lol. My professors for the most part were nurturing, intelligent and pushed me to excel."

Freshman,5,Best Decision I’ve made in my life. The culture is great and the amount of opportunities is endless. I would recommend this school to anyone.
Junior,5,My experience at Howard University has been nothing short of amazing. This institution prepares you to not only find opportunities but to make opportunities where there are not any.
Freshman,5,I love Howard University because it's a place where people can be themselves and not get judged for it. There is a big community of people who go to Howard or went to Howard and they look out for each other because they want everyone to do well.
Niche User,5,I loved the campus life on Howard! I attended Howard for their homecoming and summer learning programs and knew that it was the college for me! It is my number one choice and I would love to be accepted into it!

Alum,5,"Howard University is a great school overall. The staff and student body population are very open and inviting. Each person makes sure all students, alum, and future students are able to feel as if they belong. The campus is beautiful and has something to offer for every type of student. Everything from sports, to Greek life, to actual classes all introduced new ideas to me and made me more open to joining clubs and groups."
Niche User,5,It was AMAZING. The best choice I ever made was applying. I learned so much and created livelong memories that I will cherish forever.

Sophomore,5,"I am personally loving my time at Howard University. The people I meet here teach me something new everyday, and I honestly do feel as if I am here for a reason of more than just academics, but it’s important for my life path. I will say though, that come to howard, everyone’s experience is different. You will go through some hard times and nonsense with this school, but there are way more gems than problems in this school if you look in the right places."
Sophomore,5,Visiting the Howard University campus was an overall great experience. The vibe and atmosphere is definitely what drew me to chose this school as my #1.
Freshman,5,I love Howard. You are surround by so many different types of people from all over the place. Everyone around you wants to do just as well as you. All of the competition that you see ad encounter at the school just pushes you to be the best you you can be.
Sophomore,5,"IT HAS BEEN MY DREAM TO ATTEND HOWARD UNIVERSITY, MY FAMILY HAS NOTICED A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN MYSELF AS I AM POSITIVLY STRIVING, AND GROWING THERE EVERYDAY.   THIS EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE.  I AM TRULY HAPPY THAT I HAVE MADE THIS CHOICE TO ATTEND HOWARD UNIVERSITY.  THE YEAR HAS JUST BEGUN AND WE HAVE ALREADY HELPED AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WITH PROJECTS AS WELL.  THE CAMPUS IS VERY DIVERSE, AND CLOSE TO NEARBY SHOPS AS WELL.  I HOPE TO FINISH OUT WITH A BA IN CRIMINOLOGY WHEN I GRADUATE."
Alum,5,Really enjoyed the atmosphere on campus during my visit. I appreciate the faculty-to-student interaction.
Junior,5,"I transferred to Howard University last year and it was the best decision I've ever made. Despite the many positive experiences I had at my old school, UC Santa Barbara, I knew that I wasn’t receiving the intellectual stimulation I needed and at the end of my second year decided to transfer.  After only two weeks at Howard, I learned more than I had during my two years at UC Santa Barbara, and it was not only academic knowledge but social and psychological knowledge as well.  I learned how important it is to have idols that look like you and to be surrounded by people that not only look like you, but share the same drive, ambition, and goals as you. Being Black in the United States means constantly being a minority, so to be able to step outside of that and see how we all function and operate outside of racial boundaries is an experience I will never take for granted."
Sophomore,5,Great school both educationally and culturally. This school is an HBCU and growing up as an African American in predominantly white schools I really wanted this experience and Howard succeeded what I was expecting. The surrounding area can be a little sketchy but as long as you stay with someone else at all times you should be safe. It is also nice to go to a school that is in the nations capital and only about 20 minutes from the national mall. There is a lot of culture to be sucked up around the school.
Junior,5,"I   love the home feel of Howard University. When I came to visit Howard, I had many other universities to choose from. But, once I stepped on Howard's campus I  knew that this was where I wanted to spend my next 4 years of schooling. The only thing that I think should change is some of the professor's attitudes. Some of the older professors have attitudes with the students and make it harder for you to learn from them. I feel like if they do not like their job anymore, they should just retire or get a TA to help them out."
Sophomore,5,This is an amazing school. They provide all the academics and culture that new students want. As an HBCU it provides an amazing experience for Black students and it is a pleasure to attend this school.
Junior,5,My experience at Howard University is nothing like I never experienced before. The whole campus just seems so loving and caring for every single student. The teachers actually care and want you to come talk to them because they are so willing to help out. Even the area around campus is very nice and there are so many things you could do that is in walking distance.
Sophomore,5,Its the best university there is. I love it here. I wouldn't go to an college. The campus life is amazing. The dorms are very comfortable. The Greek life is very exciting. The food is very amazing. I will be going into my freshman  year in the fall. I love it here at Howard. I love you the campus and I love all the fun activities you can do in Washington and the surrounding cities. The professors are very interested in our learning and helping us graduate. I am a psychology major and I plan on being a pediatric neurosurgeon.
Senior,5,"Howard University is a beautiful campus with a large diverse student body and staff.  It is located in Washington, DC and had something for everyone."
Freshman,5,"Howard University is what you make it. Your experience is developed based on the kind of energy you put into it. I had a blast my only complaint is that the administration moves ways to slow and no one does their job right the first time. Once the administration stops ""Howarding"" in that context, Howard will thrive like never before."
Sophomore,5,Howard University is an amazing place. Howard only spits out successful people. The university will allow you to learn about yourself within a safe environment
Freshman,5,Howard is one of the best HBCU's out there. Its location and academic rigor makes it stand out. I major civil engineering so that meant my classes were much smaller than usual and I was able to enjoy a much closer experience with my professors.
Junior,5,"Howard culture is unmatched! However, your success here really depends on how well you can navigate the administration and poor professors."
Senior,5,"Based off of my experience just like everything in life I believe things comes with its ups and downs. Howard university has opened my eyes to new aspects of life that I never really considered. This insight from my experiences have help me to grow into the person I am today. Having to endure my personal trials and tribulations and ultimately moving in victory. Knowing that I am capable of more as I discover more in myself. Yes Howard’s has many amenities and features that is pleasing and offer many aesthetics for our image. However, after venturing through the past several years I see that it’s more beyond the surface which makes this school that much more amazing. Through all of my complaining I honestly couldn’t see my self anywhere else."
Niche User,5,I'm an incoming freshman. I haven't had any problems and I've visited the school several time. I love it.
Junior,4,"I enjoy the culture that Howard has and continues to uphold within its student body. I would say that overall our students and a small percentage of our professors are really there to see everyone prosper and want to actually help you excel in life knowing the struggles of going to an HBC you in general. However, the things I would like to see change would be within the Howard administration. Now moving to my third year at Howard it is clear that I am ministration has a lack of empathy for its students and is only concerned with the money that it’s receiving and not taking into consideration its student body or even it’s faculty members in some cases. I feel as though if Howard wasn’t so focused on trying to make a profit and actually make prodigies it would notBe in such a financial strain that it is in because at this point they are practically robbing their students. We are in the middle of a pandemic and the uncertainty of the future is evident."
Freshman,4,My online learning experience has been unexpected but it was a good change. It got easier the longer we at home. The teachers were a very  big help
Freshman,4,"Howard isn't for everyone, but if you're looking for an hbcu experience that you will always remember, come here!"
Freshman,4,"Although our lives have been affected by the pandemic, Howard tried enough to make us feel better about the whole experience. They gave us incentives. It is definitely not as good as face to face learning, but it was great."
Freshman,4,What needs to change is communication between the student body and faculty. But what I like is the student poulation.
Sophomore,4,"My online classes were not by choice but because of Covid-19.  At first it was awkward but as time passed it became easier.  Professors were concerned about students continuing to get the education they paid for.  I feel that they did their best, but some classes are better in the classroom."
Sophomore,4,"For me HU is close to family, my Mother is ill.  To get to classes, market, social events, I can use Uber, bus, train, or Lyft.  We are in Downtown DC.  Tons of history. Howard takes very good care of freshmen and sophomores as far as housing.HU Alumni are the best. This wasn't my first choice but I'm very happy to be here."
Niche User,4,"I am a parent of a junior currently attending Howard University. And no matter how much  I want her to transfer her answer is God told me to come to this school it is by faith alone she is still here. And because of her faith in this university, I give it 4 stars. Each semester we go thru the game of scholarship our gone and then when they get tired of me writing everyone to the newspaper a scholarship magically appears I will say that they are trying to improve for the student with disabilities and why because we as a family stay on there heads about the piss poor conditions. My daughter is excelling and for that reason I allow her to stay there WHen she graduates I'm going to do the electric slide Dr. Fredicks is trying to get better at communications and for that, I say it about Dam time  Overall this school is preparing her for the world she had the PWI experience and now she has the black experience they are anot ready for this one"
Sophomore,4,It was an interesting experience. It got better over time. The professors where also considerate about how the Corona virus impacted our lives.
Sophomore,4,"Howard it's a great school. The social life is simply amazing. Nonetheless, the school administration could be worked on more."
Sophomore,4,"Despite the ups and downs that I have experienced here at Howard University, I still call this campus home."
Junior,4,There are many opportunities that you will get from going to Howard and many amazing people you will meet. Majority of the issues are administrative but hopefully they will change.
Sophomore,4,"Howard University has been one of the best decisions I have ever made. It has transformed me into the woman I am today. It has taught me to be responsible, self-sufficient, and to be myself. I've received an education like no other. All my professors do everything in their power to see me succeed. I also just love being in the city of D.C.."
Senior,4,My experience at Howard University was made through experiences and student life. The administration and professors do not care for the needs of their students as much as they should.
Senior,4,"The atmosphere is GREAT! The enriching culture is unmatched. It is wonderful to be surrounded with intelligent minorities like myself, both peers and professors. The only down fall is the administration and some non teaching faculty (i.e: financial aid, registar, etc). The sometimes seem like they do not care or know what they are doing, which can hinder a student's experience at Howard (especially academically)."
Alum,4,"My experience at Howard University was overall great. I was a student-athlete, so I didn't get the full experience of just being a student but I still had a lot of fun. The party life was great my freshman year and the professors I had were very relatable. I mainly hung around my track teammates and would spend a good chunk of my time at practice, getting treatment, or traveling for meets. This would be tough to balance with school at times, but I was able to maintain a stellar GPA during my matriculation. Some weekends, I would go to parties, kickbacks, or just explore DC. Homecoming was always the best time of the year; I'll definitely come back as am alum! Most of all, my favorite part about Howard was the camaraderie and diversity. I was surrounded by bright, ambitious people who looked just like me. I was inspired by students here because their aspirations and goals in life were high, just like mine. I made so many connections and friendships that I know will last a lifetime."
Niche User,4,"Not much to say. Seems like a fantastic college to attend. I haven't actually attended the college just yet, but from what I've seen, almost everything seems great. Sure, the dorms could be a bit better, but the overall campus is great and the academics are absolutely fantastic."
Sophomore,4,It's a community of smart and excelling African American individuals and the faculty is very caring. Sometimes you have to be very persistent to receive the help that you need in terms of sorting things out like transferred credits or guidance on anything in that matter.
Freshman,4,"After spending one year at Howard, I have learned a lot. We have amazing professors who seem to truly care about our education as much as we do. The classes are extremely informative and enjoyable. The campus life is just as good if not better. You meet a plethera of new people and you get to interact with them on a daily basis."
Junior,4,"Pros: Academics are good. Good Investment in research as well. School of Business and CEA students are dominating across the United States. Great Alumni. Good Scholarships.

Cons: Administration sucks, Doesn't care about international students in terms of providing financial aid. Dorms are expensive, No security camera on Dormitories floor levels that frequently results in robbery on campus. Campus police is not effective. Cafeterias are below average."
Junior,4,"Howard University is ""The Mecca"" for a reason. At the peak of HBCU education Howard University has everything. Athletics, academics, and a variety of student activities and organizations. As a junior, I could not imagine going to any other university."
Sophomore,4,"Howard University is a great place to attend for undergraduate studies. The demographic is largely African American so if you are also African-American, you will feel welcome and have a lot of fun connecting and learning with those who look like you."
Junior,4,"Howard University is an amazing university overall. It is a safe space for African American or Black students to learn about their culture, as well as a great space for all students to find themselves."
Graduate Student,4,HBCU filled with a rich history and leaders dedicated to educating young African American students. I've enjoyed my time here as a student and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
Freshman,4,"It is my first year at college at Howard University. Within the first months, I learned college is not easy, but it is important to ask for help. There are numerous staff members and fellow students there to help you out. In the end, they want you to succeed the best you can."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Howard University has just been amazing so far. As a business marketing major, and only halfway through my sophomore year I have been having opportunities left and right for me. Dorms are good, except for freshman, food is edible, professors are great(except for math) and the people here are the best part."
Freshman,4,"Being a Howard student makes me feel like there are no limits to what I can do. From the support of the professors, to the social and professional network among students and alumni, Howard has allowed me to explore my potential in so many ways - and I’ve only been here for a semester! :)"
Freshman,4,Academics at Howard University are stellar as well as the culture experience. In addition the Howard social sphere has taught me to always look for ways to improve myself and evolve.
Freshman,4,"Love Howard but the financial aid program needs to be improved. It's a great institution, just slow in progress."
Freshman,4,"It can have some communication issues. You can have a hard time reaching people over the phone, more specifically the bursar's office and registration. The food is bad but edible. Overall, it's a good school, especially academically. Expect to be challenged. The math department sucks, so you may want to get some help on the side. A good experience for african-american students."
Freshman,4,"Howard is a great place. I would not have wanted to pursue my college education anywhere else. The pros outweigh the cons by far, the sense of unity I feel within my class and the numerous opportunities I get from various external sources is one of my favorite parts of Howard."
Junior,4,You have to make your own experience at this school. you will have as much fun as you let yourself. you will also be as successful as you let yourself be. I'm a student athlete and balancing work school and play isn't tough for me but it can be challenging. things need to change here. for the culture.
Freshman,4,"Overall, Howard University is a great institution with students who are made to succeed. However, it is often they put their students last when they need their support the most. Financial aid and Reslife are two major issues at Howard that need to be resolved for anyone warranted improvement. It is shameful that thousands of students that attend all have a common issue with the same two departments."
Alum,4,"Howard is a very cultured university with a rich history. It's a place where you can feel seen and find your people in a vast amount of clubs, teams, and orgs. While it is an HBCU (Historically Black College or University) it does not lack diversity. You will meet people from all walks of life and backgrounds. The students are the heart of Howard and their pride runs deep. They know how to dress, how to party, and how to stand up for their beliefs. Expect to be educated by more than just your professors, many of which are iconic beyond the Howard community. Take advantage of all the opportunities Howard offers. It is no coincidence that many great authors, actresses, politicians, etc. are Howard alum."
Junior,4,"Howard is an amazing school. Students get the black experience hear. It teaches student how to be confident and expressive in his or her own space. They teach you have to be yourself in a space that was not created for us. In terms of education, Howard is top tier in teach African American history and setting people up for success.

There are downfalls to the administration but it truly is worth the hassle. The reward out weighs the bad."
Junior,4,I like Howard a lot. The food in the cafeteria is not good though. It is nice to see so many different types of black people all in one place. I like Howard a lot.

Freshman,4,"Howard wasn’t my first choice, at all! But now that I am here and I am experiencing it. I’m glad that I decided to go here. Howard not only surpassed my expectations but also gave me a new insight into hbcu’s. Yes there’s certain areas Howard’s administration could approve on but for the amount of student here Howard is doing a pretty decent job. I am proud to be apart of this institute and can’t wait to be an alum. Class of 2023"
Sophomore,4,"Howard is one of the greatest institutions on the planet. I wouldn’t trade my time here for anything in the world, in spite of the low maintenance and infrastructural issues. Howard creates culture, feeds brilliance, and inspires dreams in a way no other University possibly could."
Freshman,4,"Attending Howard University has forced me to undergo trials and tribulations, sure. In my personal opinion, there were many obstacles that could have easily been avoided had administration and financial services been more organized and devoted to the overall student experience. However, Howard has given me an amazing education since I arrived on campus. During my time here, I have created many friendships, relationships with educators and staff, and developed many sources pertaining to systematic networking of various kinds."
Graduate Student,4,I loved this school because it was in Maryland and Virginia so I had acces to both states. Love this school
Senior,4,Howard University is located in D.C. which offers amazing opportunities to explore and sightsee. there are many restaurants in D.C. which are of different ethnic foods. Howard University's professors are very helpful and are willing to go the extra mile for there students. Ask lots of questions! There are many research opportunities to be had as well.
Freshman,4,"Howard University is my home away from home now.It’s been really hard for me to adapt to changes all my life. One thing that I learnt as soon as I stepped foot on this campus was that change is inevitable and some changes can be great. Howard is one of those changes. The culture and diversity of this school is never ending, the bustling campus life is extreme and let’s not forget the amazing family we have at the Real Hu. I’m yet to experience the full life at Howard but I’m in store for an amazing time and I wouldn’t want to spend it anywhere else in the world. Maybe my expectations are too high? Or others want them to be too low ? I’m not sure. But as I embark on a new journey, I’m happy that I get to enjoy what there is to offer at the Illustrious Howard University."
Sophomore,4,"I wish that the administration in financial aid and housing were more organized and open to helping the students. I love my relationships with new friends and professors, though!"
Niche User,4,"Howard is a wonderful institution. I recently visited the campus on a set of college visits, as I am hoping to attend Howard University next year. It is an excellent HBCU with great academics, culture and student environment."
Freshman,4,"Howard is a great school with amazing opportunities for African-American students. Howard stands on the frontier as a beacon of hope for the worldwide advancement of colored people. HU is a family and the moment you step on campus you are a part of that family. HU isn't going to be easy there will be times, like at any other school, where you have to make hard decisions based on your priorities. I gave the school 4 stars out of 5 because although there are opportunities abundant it can be very difficult contacting the people that you need to get in contact with."
Niche User,4,The campus is beautiful with a friendly environment. The hospital works pretty slow but it’s still an overall good place. They have many organizations and groups open to everyone of all ages. Just great over there.
Senior,4,"Overall, Howard University is what you make of it. Howard University is where I discovered my self, my abilities, and my capabilities to push far beyond my self imposed limits to experience growth. Things are not always easy, as the structure of the campus was designed to make you work for what it is you truly desire. But that is the beauty of it, because once you do receive it, you will appreciate it that much more. Get involved, network, form meaningful bonds and keep and open mind."
Sophomore,4,"Howard University is one of the top HBCU school.  Overall my brief experience of Howard has been an exciting one.  There's  always something for you to do and explore.  Main problem with the infrastructure lies on Financial Aid and the different Administrative department.  The dormitories are average, however culture of the school is one to behold."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed the academic and social atmosphere. The dining options need improvement and creativity.  Some of the facilities are lackluster, however the University is currently in its second or third year of a 5-year facility improvement plan for the entire campus."
Sophomore,4,"Attending Howard University has been a blessing. The atmosphere is incredible. You would be impressed by the excellence that is displayed all throughout campus. But what really makes Howard stay out is its outstanding drive for its students to be great being themselves. There are so many who have started their own school organizations or have just brought change through the city and nationwide. I've become so much more involved with political, environmental, and personal issues that I would usually just pass over. However, there are a few areas that Howard needs improvement, such as, freshman housing, admission/financial  availability, and their disbursement of money. The experience would be even better if students weren't so stressed out due to the poor university to student relationship. Let's not talk down on them too much. I'm happy I choose to attend Howard University."
Sophomore,4,"What I love about Howard University is that it is an HBCU whose student body is dedicated to their educational and academic success. The motto is ""Excellent in truth and service"" for a reason because that's truly what the students here embody. Mostly everyone who attends this university made this their first choice. With the student body being predominantly Black, that's also a reason most of the students are here to be able to connect with someone who relates to them because a lot of students didn't have that opportunities in high school. Howard, however, does have its faults when it comes to taking their time to process information, and so on. However, it is based in its community. Through outreach, networking, and forming alliances with one another to stay connected and make this a better experience with one another, that makes an even better college experience."
Freshman,4,"I love Howard 'til the death of me. I wouldn't change my experience there as it has made me into the woman I am today, However, I do believe that there is major work to be done in regards to their office organization and student services. These kids need their college to be understanding, organized, and efficient. They need stability and I think if Howard were to work on that, they'd be even more powerful."
Freshman,4,Great atmosphere. One of the best HBCU’s ! Only issue is the Financial Aid Office. Academics are challenging yet still informative. Classmates are very helpful. It’s like a family.
Sophomore,4,"As a rising sophomore, my first year at Howard was a success. The courses are challenging depending on what you major in but there are various you may use that will help you pass. The campus is beautiful, where it’s not too big or too small. The Howard community is a family"
Junior,4,Howard is a University. It is an HBCU (historically Black College). This is much history behind the school. There is always an event happening of Howard's campus and students are very welcoming and willing to have fun. everyone always has a positive attitude.
Junior,4,"Howhhhard University is highly favorite in diversity of African culture. My first experience was the long application and just to be accepted was a challenge in itself. Within time everything has a way of balancing out within life lessons and rewards. In learning, it's great to have great professors that care about your well being and the fortunate of being taught for our tomorrow's future is in their hands. I'm passionate and proud to walk the walk amongst this campus th"
Freshman,4,"loved meeting new people from around the world. since Howard is in DC, I feel that I have an opportunity to pursue my career."
Sophomore,4,"Overall my experience at Howard University was great, however I would like to see a change in the academic advisors."
Sophomore,4,They are a really good school with lots of culture. But the administration building is not the best.
Freshman,4,It is a good school with great culture and students who are always willing to help you and encourage you.
Alum,2,"There was not much of an online learning experience in 1993-1996 at Howard University at that time, if any."
Junior,2,"Since the pandemic hit I started taking online courses towards the end of my sophomore year. I would have to say that the overall experience was excruciating. There was a lack of intimacy and I feel as though I didn’t get the best out of the last portion of my classes. Although it is nice to wake up in your bed and go straight into class it also has its faults in the same sentence because there is a lack of discipline that I feel is felt throughout the student body because we are not required to actually go and attend a class in person. However, I will say that my professors that were required to start doing online classes did to the best of their abilities and tried to make the working experience as tactical as possible and for that I am grateful.  On the contrary, I do think that the online system is flawed and things could be better. I also feel like students should not have to pay extra and tuition should indeed be reduced tremendously due to the circumstances at hand."
Senior,2,Howard Experience is great but the administration sucks like really sucks. Financial aid lines are always long and you have to go everyday to get simple issues solved
Junior,2,"Howard University has various fields of study that relate to the Black experience with great faculty, unfortunately administration and financial aid are wildly dysfunctional and inefficient."
Freshman,2,"I love being at an HBCU surrounded by intelligent and high-achieving Black students. However, Howard is not the ""illustrious"" institution that it claims to be. The education and experience is not worth the student loans that many are taking out to be here. Many professors here don't teach and use their lectures to spread their own ideas, administration is horrible and neglectful, the dorms (especially Drew) are falling apart."
Senior,2,"They don't no the left from right!. they will wait until 2 days before graduation, to tell you that you were not CLEARED!!! but took your graduation fee of $100 that no one still has explained what it is for.They are rude,the professor are unwilling,to help!.. they allowed ppl to get signed diplomas ahead of time, without even being completed with the semester, thry were involved in embezzlement,that forced students to leave. yeah the homecoming is cool...but this school is an over priced ,rip off!"
Freshman,2,"At my first year at Howard University, it has been a series of ups and downs, and none of the ups have to do with the school itself. The academics are such that you can cheat through everything and are rewarded for it. The professors are very unprepared and non helpful. It has gotten so bad that I need to go to YouTube in order to understand any of the course material covered in class. The food is not healthy for the most part (coming from a nutrition major). There is most likely a bunch of salt and oil in everything,as well as meat and cheese in every dish. 

The best parts of going to school here are the party life (if you are into that) and the friends you will make. Once you find a group of people with your interests, you can get by with all of the terrible things going on at Howard. I would recommend not going to Howard unless you cannot afford college otherwise."
Freshman,2,"Socially Howard is great but so far in my experience besides that, I have lots of problems. Financial aid is slow. SO slow that the school year can start and students will not have the packages they need to pay their balance so that they can register for classes without getting dropped. Housing is inadequate and in many places unsafe. There are lots of places on campus that don't have sufficient temperature control. You would think with how much money tuition is there would be fewer problems that will directly impact the students. Although admittedly Howard's tuition is not the part that really might get you. Because the gag is there are so many different things to pay for that are not encompassed in the base tuition that the number that should really be considered is the even more outrageous total cost of attendance which is mostly fees. The wifi is deplorable for the simple fact that good 75%-80% of the time you can't even use it. The food is gross. This is only my first semester."
Senior,2,"Going to be honest and cut through the BS. If you're looking for a party school with good looking and fashionable people and lots of events this school might be for you. If you're actually looking to get your education and not play any games, AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Every person here has a story of how the Administration tried to screw them out of financial aid, classes, etc. I'm convinced at this point the administration does not care about the students well being (looking for that paycheck). The buildings are run down and in disrepair, the internet never works and when it does it so slow it makes you want to gouge your own eyes out. The only reason I even gave this 2 stars is because the students save it. The culture is amazing, unfortunately the actual school itself has become so god awful it survives on name and federal funding only. If any of these seem like a no-go to you, then you probably will have a love-hate relationship with this school like most."
College Sophomore,2,Definitely not a big football type school
College Junior,2,Howard doesn't have the best reputation for sports
College Sophomore,2,Athletics at Howard University definitely does not come first on the list of priorities for the school. It doesn't really come second or third either. Academics are a lot bigger as well as Greek life. I think that Greek life and athletics are definitely switched in terms of importance at other schools.
College Freshman,2,Our athletics department could be significantly better.
College Freshman,2,You're going to have to fend for yourself
College Freshman,2,"While violent assaults (i.e. robberies, muggings, shootings) are rare, the amount of sexual assault on campus is scary. I, nor no one I am close to, have been a victim, but I have heard of many stories. Majority of the time it is guys getting girls drunk on the intent of ""loosening them up"" to have sex with them."
College Freshman,2,Our teams suck because we're broke and can't recruit the best. We don't have anything flashy. The games are fun because of the band and dance teams.
College Freshman,2,"We've had a couple of incidents with sexual assault on our campus and the school handled it very badly. We had a girl who was raped by her RA, and instead of penalizing the RA, they fired the girl from her job, kicked her off of campus, and moved the RA to another dorm."
College Freshman,2,Sexual Assault crimes are present on our campus. We have emergency blue lights on our campus that don't work.
College Freshman,2,Campus police needs to get it together. ResLife is quick to throw someone out for drugs or alcohol but a rape is swept under the rug and ignored.
College Freshman,2,Not very clean at all. Always having issues.
College Senior,2,People are more focused on greek life than school
College Junior,2,"Howard puts so much money into the program. However, i do mot believe the athletes they recruit understand this. They take advantage of the system and hardly win games."
College Freshman,2,The football team is not very good.
College Freshman,2,"Visitation is pretty dumb, and they treat us like little kids. Punishing everybody for one person's mistake doesn't make sense at this age."
College Junior,2,I have lost a friend on campus and have a friend who was brutally beaten.  Honestly I wouldn't know what to do if it came down to a life threatening situation because campus police do not make me feel comfortable enough to put my .life in their hands.  Seems like a bunch of random unqualified civilians in a uniform.
College Freshman,2,Howard needs to get different professors in the math department. All the professors are hard to understand and make no effort to aid students in the math department.
College Freshman,2,It's not worth the price. The university is making steps to upgrade the dorms but there is still a long way to go.
College Freshman,2,The administration is horrible. The financial aid office is not helpful. It is difficult to get registered for classes. Many students end up dropping out.
College Sophomore,2,Howards sports teams suck. they always lose. Its not a big part of campus life at all. the only time people care is for homecoming and HU vs Hampton U games. otherwise its nothing to write home about.
College Junior,2,"Living on campus can be very difficult at times because many of the buildings are older. The best option for freshmen is Cook Hall for males and College Hall North (CHN) for females in terms of the facility. If you are looking for the traditional Howard experience the best option is Drew for guys and the Quad for girls. While the facility may be better in Cook and CHN the social atmosphere is definitely going to be better in Drew and the Quad. They both have a lot more residents as well. 

 

For sophomore and upper-classmen your best option is East Towers and College Hall South. The housing selection process is based off points accumulated from how far you are from home, GPA, and community service. The best advise I can give is to make sure you pay your deposit on time! Finding an apartment in DC that is affordable is nearly impossible,."
College Junior,2,Typically students go to athletic events for the social aspect rather than the actual game being played.
College Sophomore,2,It's not so much the dorms even though they are very old but more the people living in them that are nasty and lose their home training.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Howard's athletic facilities are worse than most high school's I've seen. Mant athletes complain about the resources they are given to work with. Students complain about the PE facilities. Sure, we've changed our logo and began to give the sports department a better name, but Howard is definitely not a school centered around sports. Most people who play on campus do so for financial help."
College Freshman,2,"The school's administration is the worst I have ever seen/ experienced. They mixed up and messed up my transfer credits 1 day before classes started, which caused me to be behind in my classes. The workers of the registration office where incredibly unsympathetic, and unhelpfully. I'am considering transferring to a different university, so I don't waste any more time and money at this institution."
College Sophomore,2,I felt like I was in the 13th grade at community college
College Senior,2,"It is important to handle all financial aid issues in person because you will get more feedback than over the phone. However, it does not mean you will get you issues handled."
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the older dorms don't have basic amenities such as air conditioning. The dorm I stayed this past year (Slowe Hall) in didn't have elevators, so it was a hassle moving in and out of the building. There were also always constant issues with hot water, heat in the colder months, and a/c in the warmer ones. The bathrooms were also almost always filthy and disgusting and the carpeting throughout the building always smelled of mold/mildew."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't think the security alert services around campus even work. I've always been told they don't. If you call campus police they take literally an 1 1/2 to get there. (I know from experience) If they don't get the call from campus faculty or the hospital, they take forever."
College Sophomore,2,"The food selection could be considerably better compared to other universities.  Everything they cook here will make you gassy and regretful of even having a meal plan.  But unless you have a kitchen or an unlimited budget for eating out, you just have to deal with it and learn what to eat and what not to eat."
College Sophomore,2,The professors are inconsiderate and stubborn.
College Sophomore,2,You have to be careful when walking around campus at night. The surrounding environment is not kind to Howard students.
College Sophomore,2,most of the rules set  do more harm then good.
College Sophomore,2,Make friends in the financial aid office.
College Sophomore,2,Not really much to eat that is actually good
College Sophomore,2,"The buildings for the most part, are old and need to be updated."
College Freshman,2,You rarely find anything worth eating and when you do it still gives you food poisoning.
College Sophomore,2,It is HARD. The office is ALWAYS busy! I have not recieved a response from the email I sent 2 weeks ago. Looks like I might have to go up there.
College Freshman,2,"One of the worst things is visitation hours. Even juniors are sometimes not granted visitation. As college students, I don't understand the strictness of visitation, especially since it is usually being taken away. I believe in an ethic code. If both roommates are fine with it then why not?"
College Freshman,2,"I'm one that believes on having faith and pursuing. Upon being accepted, I did not receive sufficient financial aid. After emailing, writing letters, and calling I finally got what I needed for my first year. It's ashamed that I will have to do this all over next year. It's scary. I still have faith."
College Freshman,2,"While away at school, students want to be reminded of a home-cooked meal. The closest thing we have is Soul food Thursdays, but that finished by 2 p.m. My first class ends at 2 p.m. I do not make in time for Soul food Thursdays ever any more."
College Freshman,2,I wish my class experience could've been far more challenging. I also expected a more organized setting unlike high school.
College Freshman,2,Everything thing is prolonged and disorganized here. No clear system of direction.
College Junior,2,The A-Building is worse than A on pretty little liars.
College Junior,2,"I only ate in the cafe freshmen, year after that I got employed and ate as I pleased. But if you are trying to save money a meal plan is the way to go."
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid help is not very helpful unless you visit several times, which should not be necessary."
College Sophomore,2,Athletics at Howard outside of tennis and soccer are not good and strides are being made to improve them.
College Senior,2,Horrible they don't care and when they do there is only so much they can do to help you unless there is something in it for them. Best advice: prayer.
College Junior,2,"We have a new president, so it is getting better. However, it is notorious for having a poor administration."
College Junior,2,"The Financial Aid office is everyone's right of passage. I have a scholarship, but still need financial aid. My advice is to get outside scholarships so you don't have to deal with the A building. If you don't have scholarships, just make sure that you deal with Financial Aid early, and keep records of all interactions."
College Student,2,"I personally did not receive financial aid and I am still struggling to fill my gap. If you did not receive a scholarship with your acceptance letter, it is going to be very hard to find money within the school. There are opportunities  out there for extra money but YOU have to look through the financial  website and inquire  about these opportunities  yourself. There are some things I did not find out until the end of my first semester.  Howard Univeesity is a great school, but do not expect to excel with self motivation."
Niche User,1,"Fellow students are what makes Howard tolerable. As far as the staff is concerned they will screw you over every single chance they get and they cover for each other and lie to your face.  Professors never face repercussions for their wrong doings. They treat disabled students like they are stupid. And financial aid and the bursars office are professional thieves. Everyone pretends they are on your side and then nothing gets done
 If you are a poor black student or a disabled student Howard University is not for you. And steer clear of the world culture and language department specifically the Spanish and French departments. If I could give them 0 stars I would."
Alum,1,"Howard is a great place to be if you were raised as, or to aspire to be a wealthy Black person. It is the elite HBCU and heavily pushes the politics of assimilation, Black buying power, and colorism. The ideal student will be wealthy enough to not have to contend with the Office of Financial Aid. Late disbursements, retroactive reversals, and removing of student aid funds is all too common for students and is the cause for very low retention rates. If you are poor and Black seeking an education, and hoping to make a difference for your community stay away from this institution."
Freshman,1,"My experience with Howard University was difficult and disappointing. Although it is easy and fun to get swept up in the social activities the university has to offer, the academic programs leave much to be desired. During my first semester I went two whole months without a teacher in my math class. I felt like my time was being wasted, especially as a first time college student."
Niche User,1,Its been very difficult working with the financial office. I think they need more experienced people that can follow through
College Junior,1,"The athletic side of Howard is one that I wish would have been different in terms of my ""college experience."" No one cares about sports like they do at big state schools. The gym is not impressive, and the tiny space that is open for students is only open from 5pm-9pm, which works in virtually no ones schedule if you do anything outside of classes."
College Sophomore,1,Sports teams suck besides girls soccer
College Junior,1,"Outdated buildings, rude staff members"
College Senior,1,Housing is atrocious and overpriced. You will see critters!
College Freshman,1,Howard is very unorganized. I was very unsatisfied. I ended up transferring and going to the University of Hartford.
College Junior,1,"I have had some good professors and a lot of bad ones.  Some professors do not seem comfortable with the content they are teaching, and many seem confused, or cannot accurately answer questions because of language barriers. Some classes are way too big and some classes are way too small."
College Junior,1,"Although we have a new freshmen and sophomore dorm, there are still dorms around campus that have mold, and other infestation, such as mice and roaches. 

Of course the new dorms are the best! The social atmosphere is constantly improving, of course the cost is super high and complicated to get. There is definitely not enough housing."
College Sophomore,1,"for school of C majors looking for a challenge its not worth the money or the time. Some professors don't show up/don't care. One of my professors cancelled class for over a month, that was a deal breaker. facilities need to be upgraded."
College Sophomore,1,"Honestly if you're a communications major looking for stimulating, challenging classes this is not the place for you. Everything is an easy A and the teachers are laughable. I'm sure the course work in other majors is more difficult and worth the money. but the School of communications building itself is sorry. The School of C building has closed multiple times throughout the year because it was too cold and they didn't have heat. In the summer/warmer months the classrooms can get hot beyond belief. Comm. teachers sometimes don't show up and waste your time and money or disappear for weeks at a time to go to ""conferences."" What's so important about a conference that you have to cancel over a month worth of classes? Oh, wait they don't care because they get paid either way. Communications majors: please don't waste your time or MONEY here unless you want to breeze through college and learn little to nothing."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I am an older student so I have no experienced the new dorms on our campus. My housing experience was terrible. Freshman year was decent, but it went downhill from there. Filthy, moldy, rodent infested dorms are the norm at howard. They say they will renovate, but no one knows when. I was forced to move off-campus when they did not give me housing my junior year."
College Junior,1,"Overall, the school is not great for someone who is persistent in achieving goals.  There is a long list of amazing teachers but the administration's lack of professionalism, integrity and character has created the overwhelming amount of flaws."
College Sophomore,1,the care for students needs is at an all time low.
College Sophomore,1,"The A building is an absolute mess.  Most of the employees do not have the correct information and will send you on a wild goose chase for what you need.  Although Howard is good with giving out aid your freshman year, they are also good with taking it away and leaving you stranded with no choice but to transfer to a cheaper school.  It would be a great help if all the employees would just be on the same page and know the correct information for students."
College Sophomore,1,They do not have choices for vegetarians
College Freshman,1,"They need more active, friendlier employees who are dedicated to finding solutions"
College Freshman,1,"From what I know, off campus housing is not ideal for most students"
College Sophomore,1,"The school has no money therefor they avoid any type of problem or lawsuit of any sort. There has been numerous sexual assault reports that people hear about on campus but the school has no invested interest in handling them because they want to avoid bad press. To stay safe you should use the ""buddy system"" and take Uber instead of walking around the area late at night because there are also a lot of armed robberies both on and off campus."
College Sophomore,1,Freshman year they give out great scholarships but now it is harder and the Financial aid office tends to lose .
Recent Alumnus,1,"I hate, hate, hate , hate the financial process. There has not been one semester where my account was paid. They do a terrible job on helping students with aid. TERRIBLE"
Recent Alumnus,1,Their visitation rules are ridiculous.
College Sophomore,1,The weather during the winter stinks. DC is extremely cold in the winter and the winter season lasts 6 months. Because it snowed so much we were out of classes a lot and when we did have class It was a nightmare walking in the snow.
College Sophomore,1,Financial aid at Howard is the ultimate struggle it took me an entire semester to get my financial aid straitened out. What you learn from it being such a hassle is to always stay on top of your money. Dealing with Howard and financial aid encouraged me to seek outside scholarships as well.
College Freshman,1,Financial aid process is long and unhelpful
College Freshman,1,The only way to even get a school scholarship is to have a high gpa.
College Sophomore,1,Everybody smokes marijuana on campus.
College Freshman,1,"Diversity on campus is very limited due to the fact that it is an HBCU. Most people fall under very similar categories as far as background, with the occasional diverse person here and there."
College Senior,1,I hate parking in DC. To be guaranteed a spot you will definitely pay for it
College Freshman,1,The food is HORRIBLE !
College Freshman,1,Could be SO much better .
College Junior,1,"Very superficial, materialistic and focused on the wrong things."
College Freshman,1,UGH! no effort whatsoever to ensure that we are eating healthy. TO MUCH OILY PRODUCTS 
College Freshman,1,Dont do it. You're in the city so there are trained pros at getting and hot wiring your vehicle if left alone. PLUS DC SECURITY IS A JOKE.
College Sophomore,1,THe doors need to be rennovated. I am not very happy with them.
College Sophomore,1,the local atmosphere is full of dC natives who stir up trouble
College Sophomore,1,I refuse to bring my car to school because there are no places to park
College Sophomore,1,THere needs to be more options that walking in the freezing cold to get from place to place
College Sophomore,1,The buildings the bathrooms everything is a monstrousity i wish i had chosen a nicer school for all of the money i am paying
College Sophomore,1,THere is not a whole lot of activities to participate in contrary to popular belief of the great city of DC
College Sophomore,1,"The only thing harder than getting in, is staying in"
College Sophomore,1,WE NEED NEW ONES PLEASE HEWLP USSISSISISIISIS
College Junior,1,I applied so many times for financial aid and got nothing! I know so many people who are rich and have financial aid while the poor people have no financial aid at all despite having good grades! People celebrate when they get anything at all and the day you get your refund check is treated like a national holiday on campus!
College Freshman,1,Howard has terrible wifi connection. My connection drops at least 4 times a day. It's best to bring an ethernet cord.
College Sophomore,1,Seeing as I'm going through the hassle of trying to find money now the competitiveness for scholarships at Howard is extreme. Like I said to go to Howard you have to have money.
College Sophomore,1,"Living off campus is definitely economically not savvy. DC is a very expensive area to live in, especially if you don't have any room mates. Parking is disgustingly horrible, and you will definitely pay a heap of amount in parking tickets, or just to get a parking decal. To go to Howard, you have to have money whether you live on or off campus."
College Sophomore,1,It is great the first day but after that it sucks
College Sophomore,1,Its hard to find parking
College Sophomore,1,"Shuttle services are very inconsistent and unreliable if you live off campus. It's always safest to wait for the shuttle 40 minutes before you need to be somewhere because of DC traffic, shuttle drivers taking impromptu breaks, and the wait for a shuttle in general."
College Sophomore,1,"The dorms are terrible. Some of them have not been updated in decades. Some dorms do not have air-conditioning. There are unused computer labs in the dorms. The exercise rooms in the dorms are a poor excuse for a joke. The labs are shabby in the bio and chem depts. The UGL has been closed for 3+ years so students have to use founders (which is kinda musty) or medical library (where undergrads do not belong). WE HAVE CHALKBOARDS!! Some buildings do not have air conditioning. Most do not have windows, so it feels like you are sitting in a jail. WiFi goes in and out a lot. WE DO NOT HAVE A STUDENT UNION OR A PLACE WHERE STUDENTS CAN RELAX BESIDES THE LUNCH ROOM, WHICH I HAVE SEEN A RAT IN! HU is a great place but the facilities are HORRIBLE."
College Sophomore,1,"Make Sure to have extra copies of every document you turn in, Howard University administration is notorious for the ""we don't know"" or ""I cant help you"" answer. Make sure you cross your t's and dot your i's with this school, or you will NOT have a great first year experience. Just be prepared for all possibilities."
College Junior,1,Howard is located where there is a history of violence in the community
College Sophomore,1,Crime is increasing and Campus police doesn't care.
College Sophomore,1,Either Football or Basketball is the only thing people attend. Mostly Basketball.
College Sophomore,1,"Since Howard is a HBCU, diversity when it comes to race is hard to find, but that doesn't stop everyone from being extremely different from each other. At Howard people from both ends of the spectrum on any topic are accepted. We are all a family."
College Senior,1,The scholarships at Howard for graduate students is almost non existent
College Sophomore,1,When it's warm everything is GREAT. Sadly it's freezing cold majority of the fall and spring semester.
College Junior,1,"Finding housing around Howard University is a very unpleasant and expensive process. There are little to none available living spaces that meet a proper living standard. The cost of living in DC is very expensive as well. Howard has done a terrible job of providing housing conditions for their students. They have plenty of opportunities to provide space for the students, but still refuse to do so."

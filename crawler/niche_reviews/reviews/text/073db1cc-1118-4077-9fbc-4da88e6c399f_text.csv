Senior,5,I love online classes as NSU. It’s convenient not having to report to class but still getting your work done.
Senior,5,"This is my 4th year at NSU. I am a senior baseball player and I was blessed with the opportunity to come to this school. It’s awesome great school, good atmosphere. I recommend so many people to come to school here."
Junior,5,So far the format is not bad but I think it just depends in what type of learner your are and how much you study on your own
Junior,5,it's a good overall experience just wish there was a wider variety of professors for my field. but it's understandable since it's a rather small university
Freshman,5,"Yes, I have been taking all of my classes online, and the experience has been great. Professors are very understanding of the given situation and are able to help all of us students adjust to the online environment. Being online makes me very eager to start attending classes on campus."
Freshman,5,"Although I have not attended nova on campus, and doing it virtually through Zoom, the experience has been amazing so far. It makes me very excited to attend during the next semester where I can receive the full on University experience. I am looking forward to spending my next 4 years at Nova."
Freshman,5,NSU was very accommodating and knew what they were doing. They handled the transition to online very well and we were able to transition smoothly
Graduate Student,5,"Online classes were good. Most professors don’t leave you to learn yourself, they have weekly meetings to go over material"
Junior,5,The online learning experience was very manageable at Nova Southeastern University. There was fast accommodation for students during COVID-19; professors adapted quickly to the new form of teaching and doubts in lecture were clarified during ZOOM meetings.
Freshman,5,"At Nova Southeastern University, they have adapted all their courses to online classes due to the pandemic and they have done an excellent job. When it comes to the class itself, there is a good dynamic and connection and at times it seems like we are still in the classroom. They use a system called Group Me to do some of the classes."
Freshman,5,"At Nova Southeastern University, you are the priority, everyone is there to help you and guide you in every single step that you take. 
I have had an excellent journey entering Nova, with staff answering all of my questions and helping me 24/7.
They also take care of you and your family in all your career, not only financially but with health care help."
Sophomore,5,I enjoy studying at NSU because I like the environment. Most of the professors are hard-working people that genuinely care about their students and want to see them succeed. I also enjoy it because of how diverse our campus is.
Graduate Student,5,"I would recommend this university to everyone. The library provides great areas to study, quite areas also are available to provide no distractions. You feel at home when your on campus. Many clubs are available that provide the students to either learn more about their desired profession or even extra curricular clubs such as joining a sorority/fraternity in which students can network and make memories that will make their college experience even more memorable."
Graduate Student,5,"The professors provide all materials necessary to do well in each course, they provide powerpoints, condensed notes, recorded lectures. They respond quick to any questions you may have on a lecture and/or homework assignments."
Sophomore,5,"NSU very quickly had Zoom set up and made it easier on students to adapt. Teachers took a week to really learn the Zoom app which was great, because they helped the students learn it. Teachers always made sure students knew their office hours and the resources available to them in the hard times. The teachers quickly developed new ideas to motivate students."
Sophomore,5,The courses are good and the teachers are friendly and qualified. Your academic counselors are always trying to help you and give you resources. NSU is dedicated to its students by supporting them.
Freshman,5,Nova has been amazing thus far and is very well rounded of a school known for its academics. I have only just begun but I cannot wait to spend the next year and a half at nova.
Freshman,5,"I haven't had to take any online classes yet, but Nova is known for having great professors that are always available to help students."
Junior,5,Online Learning is not what Nova is best at and it showed once COVID took over. Many professors have no clue in how to work online learning and many answer to emails weeks later even if its an emergency.
Senior,5,NOVA SouthEastern University has a very diverse campus that wants to see all of their students win and succeed. Nova has a standard of excellence that can be evident in all of their students and alumni.
Senior,5,"Nova SouthEastern University has the technology to adapt to the current pandemic. In these uncertain times with the covid 19, I was very fearful that I would miss out on my college education. Nova made sure that I was still able to finish online."
Junior,5,Classes online are well supported through the canvas system and lockdown browser. The transition face to face learning to online was smooth and labs were still thought through zoom and canvas during COVID -19.
Junior,5,"Safe environment, great campus, and Academic Learning. Excellent for pursuing a pre-medical career. Great Advisor and career support. I highly recommend this University, available scholarships and grants are a plus. The tuition is fair compared to most private universities."
Sophomore,5,I love the classes. The professors are very caring and helpful. The campus is amazing and you can meet a lot of new people there.
Sophomore,5,"Before Covid-19 started, I took all my college classes online. When quarantine began, I had to finish them online."
Sophomore,5,The campus is gorgeous with ducks and birds roaming around. The buildings have very comfortable chairs and up to date technology.
Sophomore,5,"Overall I like Nova. The quality of education is great and there is a multitude of resources available at you fingertips. I like the wide range of classes we are able to pick and choose from. One aspect I don't like about Nova would be the limited teachers for the IT core classes. Most of the teachers are good but, some mandatory classes have only one teacher that teaches it and sometimes they aren't the best. Despite that most departments have many different teachers you can choose from."
Sophomore,5,The Professors have been very attentive and try to make online learning as interactive and fulfilling as possible.
Sophomore,5,"SO in love ! So far, my college experience has been amazing. This school is growing and just becoming better day by day. The staff and professors are amazing and very welcoming."
Freshman,5,NOVA Southeastern University held a very interactive campus where I was able to connect with professors and students very easily and got hold of many opportunities.  The professors genuinely show interest in you since we are such a small campus. This really allowed me to create meaningful connections that supported my future aspirations. Although I am not completely sure about my future career my passion for research is something I can grow in through my university.
Junior,5,Like the professionalism at Nova. The professors truly care about your success. Just wish the tuition was lower.
Junior,5,During the pandemic we had to take online classes and clinical on zoom. So far the experience has been great.
Junior,5,The student life is great. very welcoming from a perspective of an international student. Very diverse
Junior,5,The professors are willing to help with anything. Very understanding. They are very good teachers as well.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Nova has been humbling and mind opening. It has given me a good opportunity to expand my knowledge base with professional and intelligent professors. There are better career opportunities. I know for a fact after my career there will be a lot of secure jobs after I graduate. Nova has made me expand my circle of awareness and to discover my passion. This university has made me challenge myself more due to the fact that the classes are harder then usual. I have grown as a person and this university gave me the experience to meet people that have the same aspirations and goals as me. If i could change anything from Nova, I personally would not change anything at all. I like how everything is right now."
Niche User,5,It was a very nice school. I liked it a lot because of the weather and the welcoming that everyone gave.
Sophomore,5,NSU is a great school pre-health individuals. It is not a party school and mostly oriented towards studies.
Niche User,5,"I've been visiting Nova Southeastern since I was in 6th grade, and I've never had one bad experience. The students are diverse, the staff is incredibly kind, the library is one of the best I've ever been to, and all this adds up to one of best environments to succeed."
Junior,5,"Nova Southeastern University is a great university! During my semesters here at NSU, the professors were very helpful. I was transferring from Broward College and they helped me to navigate online and figure out what internships and research opportunities were available to me on-camps and outside of school. Also, the campus is excellent with public safety. Any time i found myself study late hours they would escort me back to my dorm/apartment which was a little far from campus."
Freshman,5,"My experience at NSU so far has been amazing. There are small class sizes, apartment -style dormitory options, and many great scholar programs. Being a part of the programs has opened many doors for me. My program affiliations allow me to earn my Masters Degree in Elementary Education in just 4 years! Professors at this school get to know YOU. NSU is a private university, whose student body is mostly made up of Biology majors. The diversity on campus reaches a global range. The university is located in Florida, and it is attended by students all the way from California, Brazil, Trinidad and Tobago, Denmark, etc. There are no parties on campus but plenty things to do in the surrounding area of Fort Lauderdale and Miami. Athletics are Division II."
Junior,5,"Amazing feels like I'm at the right place. The environment is definitely safe. The campus is beyond beautiful. The price is a lot, but that's what the scholarships are for."
Freshman,5,I hav.e really enjoyed my time here as a student so far. The professors are all really understanding and fair. I  really am happy I made the decision to come to Nova Southeastern University.
Senior,5,"It is a great school. It provides a wide range of bachelor, masters and doctorate degrees. The professors are great and very engage in the learning process"
Niche User,5,Someone I know goes to this college and by the looks of it they love it. This college is very safe and interactive with their  students and make sure that they they are doing their best and keeping the school a fun and a safe place. This school is big and the money is actually less than expected.
Junior,5,Nova Southeastern University is a great school to attend and creates so many memorable experiences. This facility allows so many opportunities to not just the students but the administration as well.
Senior,5,"Nova Southeastern University is nestled in the heart of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It is a culturally a diverse, centrally located university that offers world class education for future careers. Student life is enhanced by a balance between academics and social life."
Junior,5,One of the reasons i chose Nova Southeastern University is because they have small classes and in my opinion it's easier to learn.
Niche User,5,"When i visited nova southeastern university, it was a great experience to meet students and professors and its located  in a very good place and its safe for students. Dorms arr great and comfortable."
Freshman,5,Getting into Nova Southeastern University was very easy; the application process was very straight forward. The first day I went into Nova I was greeted very nicely by all of the staff in the one-stop shop. If I had any questions the staff would have no problem answering. I was also in constant contact with my undergraduate admissions counselor Ms. Lauren Siwek. She would give me all of the information I needed to make my transition from high school to college an easy one.
Junior,5,Nova Southeastern is a great University that offers diverse courses and is willing to aid students in pursuing their degree.
Junior,5,What I love about Nova Southeastern University is the care that the faculty and staff have to provide for you. I have never felt so comfortable in a university before. The staff is always so helpful and they show that they want you to succeed.
Alum,5,"I fell in love with NSU as soon as I stepped foot on campus. The campus is beautiful, the environment is super collaborative, professors are very supportive and attentive, and NSU offers great opportunities for trips and engagement. The honors college is very inclusive and offers great courses."
Sophomore,5,"I like the beautiful campus that Nova has to offer. Also, I feel that the staff and faculty that works there genuinely cares about how we're doing not only academically but mentally and financially as well. I'm a commuter student so I don't know much about housing but from what I've heard it's average and I believe there are no communal bathrooms, so that's good. Overall a really good university."
Senior,5,"As a Senior at Nova Southeastern University (NSU), and a student that will be graduating this fall, I have loved the entire experience. From the professors to the coursework to the opportunities I have had. I was able to conduct research alongside my professor and even got the opportunity to present at our school's undergraduate symposium! It was a great and wonderful experience! The University has done a great job with safety and security and I have felt very safe on campus, even when I took a class at night. As far as attaining education is concerned, the environment of the school has been conducive to my overall learning; as I've adapted the skills to learn and study more effectively throughout the semester and for the designed coursework. All in all, a great school and a great environment for learning!"
Freshman,5,"I attend Nova and I would say it is an excellent university. The university is spacious with all the needs of a college student. It is well kept and the atmosphere is always lively and positive. I am a freshman at Nova Southeastern, so far the work has been trivial but not too hard for someone that just came into the school. The teachers explain lectures properly, going over every detail, but not spoon feeding any of the classmates letting us do research at home as well as little activities. Testing procedures online can be a little tricky sometimes due to the wifi but overall it is convenient."
Graduate Student,5,I am attending the Occupational Therapy program. The school is super reputable and well established. The campus is beautiful!
Freshman,5,"Nova has a great campus. I love that classes are in small groups, you get to know the professors and they know who you are. They have a lot of extracurricular activities and sports. The only thing I would say it could be better is the food choices. I love Nova!"
Junior,5,"I like the unity the school has. Students and advisors are very welcoming. When I received an invite from the soccer coach I was very excited to go. Players on the team were very nice and consistently answered my questions and were always positive when talking about the school, coaches, or professors they had during their time at the school. Hearing this from the student athletes made me want to attend the school even more then before when I had applied in the past."
Junior,5,"Nova Southeastern University is a great, private university. Like every school, it has its ups and downs. Due to the small undergraduate size, unfortunately, many students have ""big school"" expectations for NSU, which can lead to negative reviews. With Nova Southeastern University, and like any other school, the experience is what you make it to be. The academic part is amazing; extremely hands on. The social part is also excellent, once you find your group of friends and have positive thoughts, the time spent at NSU will fly by through laughter, memories, and hard-work."
Freshman,5,"The college I was originally going to go to (for soccer and academics) misled me to believe that they had a nursing program. When I went to set  up my classes, I was told they had nothing for nursing. Nova Southeastern has helped through this whole situation; including the soccer coach who is willing to come watch me play even so late in the recruiting season. Admissions have been amazing and I am so excited to start."
Junior,4,The class sizes are different from most universities and this is a great thing because you can actually get one on one time with the professors.
Alum,4,Online experience was good. Mainly consisted of discussion board posts and participation on replying to other students' posts. One can do well on quizzes and tests if they study efficiently.
Alum,4,My experience was good overall. It presented me with various opportunities to get connected and stay connected to professionals in my field of interest. NSU also provided numerous resources for one to succeed in their courses and to build one's resume for the work world and professional school.
Junior,4,Very hands-on learning from the business classes! I love how all the business teachers have personal experience owning or managing a business in the past
Junior,4,"Since Covid-19 affected the entire school experience, I found that Nova teachers have adjusted well to online learning and didn't feel behind at all."
Junior,4,"It’s my first time taking online classes here, but so far I like it. It’s not complicated and it’s simple."
Graduate Student,4,What I like about Nova Southeastern University is the many resources available to us such as the library which counts with extensive resources in every subject. I however do not like how they have managed their online classes and would like to see them improve.
Junior,4,"When it came to online classes, NSU tried their best. I don’t blame anyone for technical difficulties that may occur but what matters is that Nova tries."
Graduate Student,4,My online classes was cool learned a lot! Teachers work with you and want to teach so that is amazing.
Sophomore,4,"NSU has a lot of clubs, extracurriculars, leadership, and research opportunities for students to engage in. It is a lovely atmosphere and its small campus allows you to connect with students! I like that the classrooms are smaller and you get to know your class and professor."
Freshman,4,I did not take my courses online so I cannot say how it is. NSU has a good reputation in Broward so they probably for the most part did okay with the transition.
Freshman,4,"Does anyone ACTUALLY follow through with their dual admission programs and move on to their grad schools?? I always hear of people getting into the programs, but I never hear of anyone following through and meeting the requirements to go to their grad school. If anyone is seeing this, please respond!"
Niche User,4,All of my online courses were finely paced and monitored. Professors were available as often as possible to aid in the success of students. Multiple resources like zoom calls and canvas boards made outreach very easy.
Sophomore,4,"It was pretty good depending on the professor you had. The switch over to online classes due to corona wasn't bad they did it as seamless as possible, however, they refused to make classes pass/fail claiming that one semester would not ruin your entire GPA. Therefore some students were up a creek."
Sophomore,4,"Online learning with NSU is quite effective and convenient. Fully online classes are conducted through Canvas which is simple to use and navigate. These courses are also great as they allow students a bit of freedom to work at their own pace. Workloads typically aren't much different from regular classes. However, this is not ideal for hands-on courses, such as art. Instructors are limited in their ability to guide student's use of material given they cannot fully supervise their use of materials."
Sophomore,4,"Nova Southeastern University has a very clean and modern main campus, small class sizes, professional staff, and provides an outstanding amount of academic resources available to students. However, communication among departments has proven to be a bit of an issue. As a student, I feel the staff at NSU have struggled to communicate about issues effectively, leaving students in the dark about how, when, or if issues will be at all resolved. NSU has also made me feel there is a large disconnect between high administrative staff and students. This makes the student body feel isolated from and unheard by the officials who responsible for making decisions that will directly impact the student population. In the future, I hope to see NSU's staff partake in more personal engagements with the students, listen to our concerns, and employ more proficient communication."
Junior,4,NSU has a wonderful and reliable staff. their communication skills a one of a kind and they work one in this institute unlike others. Their staff always update individuals on anything and everything. NSU has a. beautiful campus and organization.
Junior,4,Nova has a very complex learning system for online course. The course that I have recently taken was by far the best one possible. The professor were reasonable when it came deadline for assignments but was also very attentive when came to response and communication. I would recommend some to take online class only if one has patience.
Sophomore,4,I’ve done some classes online. The teachers are very accommodating and are very helpful when you have any questions.
Sophomore,4,"Nova's online classes are great. Though they can sometimes be a little tedious or challenging when you have an issue or have to get certain programs to do a class. This problem is countered with professors having office hours; but, the times may not be favorable to you so that is where the challenge comes in. Despite that most questions can be answered with a simple email and serious issues rarely arise. Professors are attentive and willing to work with you."
Junior,4,"I love this University! It is a private 4 year university found in the Fort Lauderdale -Miami area. Personally, my most favorite thing about the university is the small community feel. It just goes to show that even though you can be in the middle of a huge city, you can still receive that support you need. There are many resources on campus and various internship opportunities that students can take advantage of."
Junior,4,"Taking an online class is a great opportunity for students to gain responsibility and the discipline they will need to succeed in college. However, it does become difficult to communicate with the professors, as they have to communicate through email."
Freshman,4,"My professors are very clear and provide timings for their office hours. They are good with reaching out to us with information through email. I think the online learning is effective in my school, although it could be improved."
Sophomore,4,"Nova Southeastern University is a decent school. In my specific program, I feel as the professors really support and know about how to teach. I have friends in other majors that take more science-based courses and have professors that have not gone to college or have any experience with teaching and only how to do their subject-specific domain. This creates a lot of issues due to the fact that there's a lack of cooperative learning and more emphasis on a teacher-centered classroom instead of student-centered. Besides that, I feel as Nova, as a whole, does their best to engage all students and support them. Nova also has peer-roles on campus such as student-student tutoring, student supplemental instruction leaders, and other systems in place to better feel connectivity and support academically and socially. This differs from a lot of campuses and I feel like that's something very unique about Nova."
Sophomore,4,I plan on transferring to Nova Southeastern University fall of 2020. I enjoy the diversity that this school provides. I feel as all the student support each other and are willing to help each other at all cost. All of the teachers are supportive and thoughtful to all of there students.
Senior,4,"Nova Southeastern University is a great school. Tuition is quite expensive though, which is why scholarships are essential."
Freshman,4,Just starting there and I don't know much but I get a good feeling from the people and it's very welcoming to a wide assortment of people
Freshman,4,"I like the environment and people I have encountered, as well as the resources provided to me and my peers."
Niche User,4,Nova Southeastern University is a great school! it's crazy the number of alums I see here still in Broward! My ophthalmologist graduated from here the same with my dentist and the school is also in a great neighborhood and there's a lot of cool places nearby.
Sophomore,4,"There isn’t enough diversity amongst nova southeastern. The school should focus on appealing to a larger demographic in order for different types of students to feel more welcomed and settle in at the university. The food could also improve, as there are about 10 unhealthy meals readily available for every 1 healthy meal readily available."
Niche User,4,I liked the inside and outside of the campus.  It is really far away from where I live. They communicate a lot through email.
Sophomore,4,"I go to Nova Southeastern University and only attend the classes. I do not live on campus but that is not the fault of the University. I have made many friends so far and think that any other student could adapt to the lifestyle here. There are enough nearby restaurants and the campus food is not bad, healthy ingredients and recipes make it cost more. The campus provides bus rides to a nearby plaza that contains a Walmart. The professors are lenient in how they pay attention to the students."
Senior,4,"Throughout my undergraduate career I joined multiple organizations and took on leadership positions that allowed me to demonstrate benevolence to my community, whether it was participating in Relay for Life to raise money and awareness for the American Cancer Society or becoming an Ambassador for Change the Culture. These positions have reinforced that I aspire to continue with community outreach in my career and provide aid to those in need. Nova Southeastern University provides many opportunities to join organizations on campus. There is also the dual admission program at Nova Southeastern University which allows students to be on the fastest and most direct track for multiple medical professions, such as optometry and nursing."
Graduate Student,4,"The staff and professors at the University are prompt to respond to and assist with student's needs and request for assistance. As an online student, that is very important to me. They are knowledgeable, professional, and an excellent resource and wealth of information. However, many of the professors do not update their course curriculum materials. As a result some of the materials are outdated and really need to be updated. As a student, when I know the materials are outdated, I don't feel like I'm always getting the best education I could be getting for the amount of money I have paid for it."
Freshman,4,"As a student at Nova Southeastern University, my experience was nice. I have made a few friends and the professors are there when you need them."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Nova so far has been a great experience. I have access to many good professors, tutors, and tools to help me succeed. The school also gives me many chances to make connections with companies through internships and interviews from its many events such as Recruit-A-Shark. If you can get past the pricing, it's a good school."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Nova Southeastern University so far has been great! The staff are very friendly have demonstrate outstanding care and consideration for their students. The only down side that I have experienced so far is the variety of food.
Alum,4,Nova has a wonderful motivated atmosphere with lots of socialization and places to study. It is enjoyable to be there on campus and the faculty is very supportive.
Sophomore,4,"The interaction with faculty is incredible. From the business classes I have taken, all the teachers are very experienced and understand real life business versus textbook curriculum."
Freshman,4,"I’m a first year student at Nova, and this school has a lot of perks and is very beneficial. The faculty is very helpful. The students a really nice. This school has great resources.It’s just really expensive."
Sophomore,4,"I like how NSU provides a variety of different opportunities to get into your career field, and has an abundant amount of resources to help guide students on where they want to be. Tuition could be lower seeing as how there are a few minor problems here and there, and how the graduation rate is low. Overall, the college is great and small for those who are scared of getting lost in a big campus setting. You do have to drive places if you wanna go out and have fun but it’s not to far of a drive."
Junior,4,"My experience at Nova Southeastern University was unique because I was a transfer student. But despite the transition my experience at NSU has been a very good one. Like any other college it has its positives and negatives. I enjoyed how passionate the teachers at NSU are. All of the professors at NSU love what they’re teaching and are more than qualified to teach the subject they’re teaching. If there’s one thing that I would like to see change at NSU it would have to be the competitive nature of the school. The slogan for NSU is ""be a shark"", ""don't graduate, dominate"" and I believe it's perpetuating this idea that students are meant to compete with one another. Instead, we should be uplifting one another."
Freshman,4,Very friendly campus with many opportunities.  Highly medical and biology orientated school .  There are many professional opportunities and areas on campus which promote the building of my own professional self.  There are events and giveaways on campus everyday that are not only fun but frequently educational.  Positive body of students as well.
Freshman,4,"The campus is small and beautiful overall, so it's easy to go to classes on campus without being late. The teachers are average, but class sizes are small so you do have the opportunity to associate with your professors on a personal level compared to public universities."
Junior,4,"The school is a very safe place. It has an amazing professors who truly know their fields. However, the security system at NSU needs changing ASAP. Not all students get the notifications, which is a HUGE issue. The school is great, but security needs upgrades."
Freshman,4,"I am originally from Toledo, OH, so when I was looking for colleges, I thought it might be nice to look somewhere warmer. I absolutely fell in love with the campus and the beautiful scenery. The gorgeous palm trees are an eloquent accent to the overall stunning appearance of the brand new buildings. When I was touring the school, I knew that the school would be an 'up and coming' school, because of the lovely construction of all of the new buildings.  
I am on the NSU rowing team, and everyone who I have met on my team, and the entire athletic department, has been so helpful and welcoming. I believe that these are the qualities of having a strong foundation on any team, and in any school!"
Freshman,4,The professors are very nice ans helpful. The only recommendation I would have is to make clear what textbook is being used and how often it will be used.
Freshman,4,Nova Southeastern University has shown me how diverse a community can be. This university has many different activities you can participate in that allows you to familiarize yourself with the area around and the people around. I like Nova because of the campus and how beautiful and easy to navigate it is.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy this school, it really care about its students. NSU wants us to get involved here on campus and they go out of their way to allow us to do so."
Freshman,4,Nova Southeastern University is a very warm and welcoming school. They try to get you to become a social butterfly and have so many opportunities on campus to bring you out of your shell. The campus is beautiful. They are very good at helping you with anything you need.
Sophomore,4,I have completed my freshman year at Nova and have nothing really negative to say. The facilities are clean and up to date. Most of the reachers really do try to help you succeed.
Sophomore,4,"This campus has fantastic pre-professional programs, like the 3+4 Dual Admission for Dentistry program that I am in. The campus is beautiful and the dorms are the best and biggest I've ever seen. You can't beat going to school in South Florida, minutes away from Fort Lauderdale Beach and only a 30 minute drive from Miami. I do not think we as students get an incredible amount of support from professors and advisers, but I hope to see that change as I continue on at my time here. Overall, I am happy with the university and the program I am in and it definitely was the best choice for me."
Freshman,4,I am excited to attend NSU this fall and have had a decent experience in the getting reading for school process.
Niche User,4,Nova Southeastern University was my choice when going to college. I spent two nights over there when I went. It is a very nice place to be.
Junior,4,My favorite part about Nova is the small class sizes. It is very nice to be able to be on a name-to-name basis with your professors and for them to want you to succeed both personally and professionally.
Sophomore,4,"Great school overall!  The location is close enough to stores, the beach, airport and downtown Ft Lauderdale!  The academics are pretty good as well, and just like any school where what you put in is what you can get out.  There are a lot of clubs and sports, however if there NSU had a little more to offer including a football team I feel it would be more enjoyable.  The food options aren't the best either but 24 hour Starbucks is fantastic.  Also, there are loads of scholarship opportunities if you look into them."
Graduate Student,4,"NSU features a state-of-the-art campus built to keep students ahead of the game when it comes to technology. As a student of osteopathic medicine, our campus is filled with incredible simulators and models that enrich the learning process. The only drawback is the expensive tuition."
Senior,4,"I love the diverse amount of clubs and organizations that NSU has to offer. I took part and still currently engage in the clubs I became involved in. There are also many events that NSU holds where clubs and organizations can advertise themselves and have fun, engaging events with other students. Aside from club events, there are also many events that are designed simply for students to wind down and relax during stressful times such as midterms or finals week."
Freshman,4,Nova Southeastern University is a good school if you take your academics seriously. The students there are very nice and the professors are very helpful. I am proud of being a shark and look forward to my future years here.
Junior,4,I love the overall atmosphere of Nova but it’s definitely an academic school. It’s great if you’re serious about your career but that also means don’t expect a lot of parties or school spirit. They do have pretty cool events though.
Sophomore,2,I am in my second year and so far my college experience has been absolute crap I had a professor fail me on purpose after going online for COVID. My academic advisor is always cancelling appointments. The teachers just suck when it comes to grading and class work. The only good thing as a marine bio major is you get to actually take courses related to your major as a freshmen instead of waiting till your gen ed is done. I'm seriously thinking about transferring. This school isn't worth it. Find a better one.
Graduate Student,2,I have been taking online classes due to the Covid-19 pandemic and have been disappointed with the quality of the classes. The teachers do not coordinate with each other and our schedules are very full.
Junior,2,"This school has very few redeeming qualities. The food is abysmal, and when you can find some, it is absolutely gut wrenching. There is only one main mess hall available for students, and the pricing is so astounding that I often found myself with no money left on my ID card months before the semester even ended. And I do not eat much, I eat the regular three meals per day (which is normal, might I add). Meals often times break the $10 or even $15 mark for the simplest of things. 
Next, the bureaucracy. Oh boy do I have some stuff to say here. The administration is impossible to deal with. I once tried to promote a local business around campus, by getting clearance from the admins. I got sent to six different people, all of whom gave conflicting answers, before I was finally told no. I normally would've been ok with the rejection, had I not spent countless hours trying to figure out the absolutely pinheaded hierarchy of this school.
Not all is bad though, the apartments are ok."
Sophomore,2,NOVA is a private university which means it is extremely expensive to attend. I'm still paying off debt from student loans and will be for the rest of my life. With no degree to show for it. South Florida is fun I would recommend going to a more affordable school in the area if you do not have the funds.
Niche User,2,"Nova is a diverse school with many different educational options as far as hundreds of majors and minors. There are many different organizations to get involved in as well as great on-campus job options. Sadly, the school has terrible housing and food options and is far overpriced for what they provide. The graduate medical students are quite clearly favored over any other students and the funding is greatly directed towards them making other students feel undervalued. The science labs are in desperate need of updating, the IT department has poor reaction time to problems, and the advising and One-Stop Shop departments are normally very unpleasant to deal with and clearly only care about getting money out of the students instead of helping them. Trying to contact these departments either by email or phone call is unpleasant as well and you do not feel like the staff is happy to help."
Freshman,2,"NSU is notorious for making promises to their students to trick them into attending but they are not good at following up with their promises.  There are a lot of classless people attending the university.  Greek life is a large part of campus life; if you are not involved in greek life, you will likely feel left out."
Senior,2,Could've hired better professors. A lot of cheating. Didn't realize my potential while in attendance
College Junior,2,These athletes SWEAR they're good but they suck. The type of kids who would play in high school and only play in college because it's NSU.
College Freshman,2,I feel that the housing is not worth the price that I have to pay to live here.
College Senior,2,Not jmpressed with academic affairs . The school just takes your money and leaves the student to figure everything out
College Sophomore,2,"NSU is way too expensive, and the money is not worth the mediocre education it offers."
College Freshman,2,I was under the impression I would qualify for a merit scholarship but they took into account my lowest GPA and I did not get it. I was disappointed so I browsed a list of the scholarships the school posted on their website and there were very few you could actually apply for. The Admissions Office awards most scholarships so it is a hassle trying to find your own scholarships.
College Student,2,"I have never used financial aid before. Most of the people at the school that I speak to over the phone are helpful. However, I did not receive enough financial aid to pay for all of my classes this semester."
Recent Alumnus,2,No one can give me answers!
College Freshman,2,It's more of an academic school rather than partying.
College Freshman,2,"No football team. Basketball is okay and soccer is more popular in the South, but not many people attend the games."
College Junior,2,In the Kendall campus there is barely any athletic life and it is hard to participate in them. They rarely offer any athletic events which is unfair.
College Freshman,2,Mess you up a lot when you are trying to go to school at night
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is a joke. no houses for any of the frats/sororities. they throw parties for themselves basically because everyone else is in downtown fort Lauderdale or miami
College Sophomore,2,The restaurant style food court becomes repetitive and less appealing as the year goes on.
College Junior,2,It is bad. Getting any financial assistant is a nightmare.
College Junior,2,Sports aren't really the focus of the university.
College Student,2,"I love football and NSU has never had a college team. Also, their basketball team is not very popular either. I would not say sports is a big focus of this institution."
Recent Alumnus,2,they don't have any good teams.
Recent Alumnus,2,I didnt have much contact.
Recent Alumnus,2,they don't really care and the food quickly gets old.
Recent Alumnus,2,"greeks were small groups and full of themselves, gave it a high school feel."
College Freshman,2,Snobby girls and boys wanting to feel loved
College Freshman,2,Everyone is unfriendly and hard to reach out to
College Sophomore,2,This is not really a party school nobody ever goes out but when we do we come together and have fun 
College Sophomore,2,The food options on campus are very limited and expensive 
College Sophomore,2,Finding parking is fairly easy to do and the distance is not that bad. 
College Senior,2,Campus dining is very expensive and price is not worth the quality that is prepared
College Senior,2,"The nightlife is lacking on campus at NSU. But you are close to downtown Fort Lauderdale and MIAMI, so there is no shortage of nightlife and clubs. "
Recent Alumnus,2,Campus police mainly patrol campus for parking violations. The student health center is great because the majority of our professors are licensed practitioners that work there. Wait times can be a little long though.
Recent Alumnus,2,Wireless availability varies on where you are on campus. School supplies every student with $75 worth of printing for the academic year ($0.05 for black and white/$0.10 for color). There is at least one computer lab per building; some buildings have one per floor.
Recent Alumnus,2,The buildings around campus vary in construction; some are fairly new while others are 20 years old. Prices are particularly high but still less expensive than living on campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are no permit costs for students, faculty, or staff. Parking garages get filled up rather quickly from 8-10 am and then again from 12-1pm. The parking is good after 6pm."
College Junior,2,The main campus is far away from my house.
College Senior,2,"There are no houses - only a ""Greek Village"" in one of the dorms on campus."
College Student,2,I really never thought about the strictness of the campus.  I had no reason to think bad of it and also no reason to think well of it.  I give it a C.
College Senior,2,"We have about 4-6 bus routes. In order to get from the health professions side of campus to the university center, you will wait anywhere from 10-20 minutes for a bus. The buses travel to the dorms and to the graduate housing apartments. However, they do not take you to off-campus locations. The bank, walgreens, and small cafes are within walking distance, but you will need a bike or car to get to the grocery store. The other option would be to explore public transportation, which has stops near campus. Ft. Lauderdale airport is 10-20 min away, depending on traffic."
College Sophomore,2,"There is only one entrance into the dorms, which is extremely annoying, in which you have to scan in every time. If you have a friend or family visiting you, they need a parking pass and you have to sign them in every day."
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid advisors are not very helpful. I have gone to them for guidance multiple times, but would never get any more help than what I had found researching myself."
College Sophomore,2,"There are shopping plazas in the area, however, it is more for family style or older retires. There isn't much in the area for collegiates without having to drive."
College Freshman,2,"Not the best types of foods that are my interest, but it's acceptable if you're really hungry and you must eat."
College Sophomore,2,"Sports are available, however it isn't the main focus on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Nova offers a lot of scholarships but they are hard to get even if you do qualify on every aspect. I currently have two jobs as well as my parents paying my schooling, that should tell you how much work it is to pay. My recommendation is that you work hard in your grades to get scholarships for good grades as well as apply for as many scholarships as you can."
College Sophomore,2,"They have shark shuttles going around all the time. I see them everywhere, but I have no idea the different bus routes or how to get a hold of the bus routes."
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, it's a very quiet environment. If you want the true college experience, then Nova isn't for you. However, Nova does get the job done. If you are interested in pre-med or dental, then it's the perfect place since they really help you get into medical school. Campus wise, they have lots of entertainments such as movie night, different authors and guest speakers come visit and lecture.They events like sharkapoolza, A Day for Children, and Shark fest. Pepsi actually sponsored for Shark fest so that was cool. Basically, Nova has events but you have to participate to the college experience whereas other colleges such as UF and UCF are college towns,so you don't need to try as hard for a social life."
College Student,2,The computers do the job but the printers are not very reliable
College Freshman,2,i havent had the opportunity as yet to go out on an internship.
College Freshman,2,"If you want anything you can find it if you know the right people. I know there is drug use on campus but its kept on the down low, but since there is no longer any smoking on campus that may have had an effect. As for alcohol our campus is wet so you can drink and alcohol is obviously the easiest thing to get a hold of. I would say that weed would follow that, and I hear its easy to get some molly as well."
College Sophomore,2,Unfortunately the best times to find a great parking spot is very early in the morning or later in the afternoon when everyone is leaving. The only place that I have found for commuters to park is in the parking garage and that can be a nightmare.
College Sophomore,2,"I got a nice amount of financial aid, but it wasn't enough & it's hard receiving more money here."
College Junior,2,There are many apartment buildings near the campus but the thing about Florida is that it is expensive to live here. Therefore if you are going to get one you should get a couple roommates to decrease stress. The good thing about it is that you do not have to pay the on campus housing and the fee to be an on campus student. You only have to worry about the commuter price. Most of them are safe and of good quality too.
College Freshman,2,"There is rarely anything going on that is worth going to happening on campus after 5pm. BUT off campus is awesome of you're 21. The only good 18+ club to go to is Mekka and they're strict about club rules. As far as transportation goes, you better have a car or be friends with someone with a car. Hardly anything fun is within walking distance."
College Senior,2,"Disappointed Nursing Student – When I first began NSU's nursing program I knew that it was a little expensive compared to other nursing schools but I felt like I was getting my money's worth because of the outstanding education I was receiving.  The workload was intense but I was learning a lot.  I was very satisfied with my professors at that time and my peers are great.  But during my last year of NSU's nursing school, I have been disappointed with the professors and their teaching skills and the overall education provided."
College Senior,2,"Very Unorganized – My experienced in getting help or guidance with the financial aid process through Nova Southeastern University's was very stressful, annoying and disappointing.  Administration there is generally unorganized because they lost some of my forms.  Nothing can be accomplished through the phone so don't waste your time by phone and make an appointment with someone in person to get anything done but be prepared to spend many hours with them."
College Junior,2,"Not So Bad – you can pretty much do what you want, but have respect."
Niche User,1,Poor to say the least. There is no direction and the modules appear to be thrown together last minute.
Niche User,1,Stay away from this university. The professors are sub par and the university does not have adequate materials for students to conduct labs... The administration staff are Typically  less than helpful and disregard timelines.  There’s no help from this school in any aspect.
Freshman,1,Fall of 2019 I decided to start my future career at Nova Southeastern University. I cannot stress enough how much of a mistake this was. First reason being the cost of the school does not reflect in its programs or academics. While the class sizes are small the teachers clearly only care about getting paid. The dorms are also dirty with paper thin walls and way too much control to the point where a college experience is not even possible. I would not recommend going here if you want to get the best of both worlds of what college is supposed to be because chances are you’ll be sitting in your dorm all day with nothing to do.
Freshman,1,Teachers just did not care once the school went to online. They slacked off and barely taught over zoom.
Sophomore,1,"Going to Nova is like being a small fish in an aquarium giving it your all while the head of the school takes your money and feeds you to the sharks. They showed their true colors when the pandemic hit. They left everything to the last minute leaving international students stuck on campus if their county closed its borders. More concerned about profits than undergraduates students. Maybe good for grad students, however, it's high over priced with nothing to show for it."
Junior,1,"I cannot even begin to describe how disappointed I was with online learning. I understand that it was new for everyone, but Jesus Christ it was like this school had never taught anything in it's entire existence. Two different learning platforms, neither of them fully reliable, missing lectures, terrible exam structures, absolutely inexcusable for a University that claims to be ""Top in the Country""."
Senior,1,professors try to make classes more difficult than ever. Seems impossible to do well.  They do not care if we succeed
Senior,1,This school is the worst. The don't care about the students only how the school appears on the outside. Several professors try to fail classes all the time and the administration supports the behavior. Toxic environment. Wish I never went here. I hate it here
Freshman,1,"Absolutely terrible university and poorly run. The school has no regard for students and only care about money. You are much better off going to a community college or any other state university. Don’t let them fool you into going to the school over some scholarship they offer. They give scholarships to everyone!!! As a student, I strongly advise you choose a different university."
Senior,1,went to school here. now that I've graduated i can't get a job or go to another school. the professors are good. they are not diverse. they are racists even in their faculty.
Niche User,1,This university hires racist security. As a black woman walking a puppy is considered a threatening event to the security guard. Really? Was rudely demanded to leave public property.  This is an institution of higher learning and walking a puppy at 7:30 in the morning is considered a threatening event to your security guard.  Shame on you!! Just imagine how he treats potential students.
Graduate Student,1,"After completing my dissertation, and completing nearly 10 years worth of coursework and practicums, pushed me out of the program.  The school is only interested in taking your money.  If you can, find a school with better integrity and reputation!"
Niche User,1,"STAY AWAY!!!! They are either 1) COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT or 2) SCAMMING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STUDENTS to make more money.  

Check the reviews on Google - they have MULTIPLE horrible reviews for several similar issues.

I attended with 100% GI Bill plus yellow ribbon, so 100% funded.  Got in constant arguments about funding - they claimed I owed $1,600 AFTER they returned some funding to the VA.  I thought that was resolved.  Now 5 YEARS after leaving the school, I get a letter saying I owe them over $3,800.  The bursar says their VA office made an adjustment of $2,600 in Feb 2019.  Three calls to their VA office have gone unanswered.  The Dept. of Veteran’s Affairs and they said it had something to do with an adjustment from 2013, and they’re even confused why the are claiming I owe them.

This is on top of screwing me out of training  back in 2014 which stuck me with non-refundable airline tickets."
Niche User,1,"I honestly don't know where to start on how much I hated this school. The squeezed three people in a room meant for two people because of the schools bad planning, little to no food options, and the ones they did have were awful and overpriced. The financial aid office completely would lie to your face and never knew what they were talking about. No wonder this school has a 70% transfer rate!! I barely made it a year before I transferred the hell out."
Graduate Student,1,"Money hungry. They take on way too many students for what they can offer for space. Libraries are packed, cafeterias are packed, and classrooms are packed. Money obviously is their first priority ahead of the value of education for students."
Junior,1,"The school is a collection agency, they only care if you have paid your semesters tuition. Guidance is a joke, they change my curriculum twice while attending adding to the amount of classes/credits needing to graduate $$$.. Multiple times they messed up my paperwork for financial aid. What is worse they fired my guidance counselor and never notified me while I waited onr a response for registration suggestions. Oh and did I mention how expressive the tuition is?? I traveled down to the school (3 hrs from my home) to take an exam only to find out the labs computer system was down? Now I've decided to transfer to another university to finish up my degree but will have to pay a huge bill for mediocre education. The work given by most teachers is busy work and you will write about 100 papers for some classes good luck if your stick it out."
College Junior,1,JOKE. It is a joke... like this entire school.
College Junior,1,"DON'T EVER ATTEND EVER. There are very few teachers that you will gain anything worthwhile from. Seriously. You pay way more than what you get out of it. I wouldn't call the student body bright, focused, or motivated. Do yourself a favor and just don't."
College Senior,1,The school does not work with the students. We are left do figure things like schedules and relevant class on our own.
College Freshman,1,"I hate the school that i went to, the people there were terrible and when I had gotten injured on campus the University did noting to accommodate me."
College Freshman,1,Give way too many presidents scholarships and not enough for students with lower GPA's.
College Student,1,Very nice and they are not available at the moment
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid department is not the best equipped and do not seem to know how to handle situations.
College Freshman,1,"They have very limited space for people to park especially guests. If a guest wants to stay in the dorms, they have to park pretty far away from the dorms, which makes it very inconvenient."
Recent Alumnus,1,"without connections it's difficult, the financial aid office is extremely rude."
College Senior,1,"Very limited guys, overly populated with females. not really much guys to look at"
College Freshman,1,"Campus has Einstein's bagel, Subway, Dennys, Starbucks, Papa johns. After a semester the food really begins to suck if your living on campus, not to mention that the school does not start you out with enough money on your meal plan and you finish using it before the end of the semester."
College Freshman,1,"How I Would Never Join a Sorority. I would never join a sorority. When I first got to Nova I was excited about the possibility of becoming part of a sorority, but after I went to the first meeting, I decided against it. 
I didn't want to be a part of a group of girls that kept looking down at other girls and acting like they are better than anyone else. There was a lot of gossiping and prententiousness. I'm a very low key kind of person who wants to make friends and do well at college, but at the same time I want to stay true to who I am and to myself. 
I don't want a bunch of girls telling me what to do, what to say or telling me who my friends should be. I'm free of making my own choices. 
Greek life at Nova is not great. If you have nothing better to do and want to run in heels all day and bake cookies then greek life is the best option for you. It was not for me, I want to be president some day."
College Junior,1,There are no athletics at the kendall campus in Miami.
College Junior,1,Not That Great. This is not the school you want to go to for college sports. There are barely any students that attend the games and is not very good with athletics.
College Freshman,1,"not worth the money – the professor are confuse and lost of what is really going on with student. I had a full time job and went to school at night, in addition to taking care of my son. the professor didnt care to understand nor do they care to provide comprehensive information about their subject. they mostly spoke about their own personal life and expect you to pass the exam. one student was so bored and pissed at the professor, that he took out his phone and started to watch porn. the professor asked the student what he was doing, and the student shouted ""Im watch boldporn"". he stood up left and we all were shook at what just happen."
College Senior,1,"At Nova, parking can be pretty ridiculous it was once a small university and now that its expanding at a rapid rate the availability to park should as well, we have so many visitors and a public library on campus so its not the best situation for those who commute. The ticketing can be pretty annoying, it seems as though the guards have nothing better to do but to issue tickets to people..."
College Junior,1,"Worth Reading – Diverse, accessible, and affordable dining is crucial in a student's satisfaction at a college

You will get get chubby. You will hate the food. You will continue to get fat. You will complain that all dining except Starbucks and Subway closes at 8pm (exceptions close at 10pm though). You will pay over 10 dollars for a meal you could prepare at home for 2. You will despise the poorly trained, unqualified, and possibly retarded personnel who prepare your food. You will be shocked that somehow these people go to your school and don't have to pay (working in dining get free tuition plus hourly wages). You will realize that these people are actually retarded when you get food poisoning the ninth time this month. You will cry, when you look at your mountainous piles of student loans that you accrued paying for an overpriced, ""non-profit"" school that someone who made you a chicken sandwich that sent you to the emergency room will never have to pay for."
College Junior,1,"Fort Knox – This place is sealed tighter than Guantanamo Bay and about as much fun to live at. If your caught drinking twice you are kicked out of housing. If you plan on ever smoking pot again don't come here because there is a zero tolerance policy that is extremely strictly enforced. Resident Advisors are never cool to anyone because the only ones who occupy that position at Nova are the scum of the earth. They're like cops who try to be your friend five minutes after they kick you real best friends out of their dorms for an empty beer can left in a trash can. The area coordinator of Goodwin Hall (freshman dorms) is the worst of them all. She will tell you to your face that she cares about the community and student happiness. This wretched creature is determined to suck any chance of enjoyment, sex, or even basic friendship out of your college experience."
College Junior,1,School spirit sucks. The only teams that win are Women's Golf and Rowing. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW ANYONE CARE? I go here and it was for one fleeting moment when a girl on the golf team gave me a free t-shirt. She gave it to me for walking by their stand and making eye contact with the poor girl. She was begging people to attend her next match and attempting to bribe them with free clothes.
College Junior,1,"At Nova Southeastern University, I have always had plenty of time to study. Teachers are 50% tools and 50% tolerable. The social scene is terrible. Greeks are the laughingstock of campus. Housing will catch you drinking and smoking because thats fun for them. School spirit is so appalling that it has driven me to write this awful review. The food menu hasn't changed since 1997. Everyone commutes. Security is atrocious if you actually need their help with something stolen and are only good at preventing people from riding skateboards. It is expensive as hell for a second-rate education. Parking is good though."
College Junior,1,"As someone who enjoys frat house parties, school sporting events, and a rousing local nightlife, I was quickly disappointed at what Nova Southeastern had to offer. First off, frat houses are illegal at Nova so there is no frat row for undergrads to rely on for a house party on Friday night. Secondly, my high school, of less than 2000 with a poorly funded sports department, had more school spirit in one game than I have seen at all of Nova's events. Lastly, without a bulletproof fake ID no boy is going to get into any decent clubs which turns every poorly-organized and ""too f-ing dry"" house party into a sausage fest. Want Florida parties? Go to U Miami or UF."
College Freshman,1,"Great on the Outside – If you were to visit Nova Southeastern University, you would be blown away.  However attending the school is a completely different story... no one here is happy. This is a commuter school.  There is 40% retention rate.  There is nothing to do on campus and it has the feel almost of a big high school.  There is no school spirit.  People come here before they transfer elsewhere."
College Freshman,1,You Get Away With Nothing. This is a dry campus.  Everyone has given up on having parties.  People snitch on each other all the time.  Loud Music or any loud noise and you can get in trouble.
College Freshman,1,We Have Frats? Frats and Soroitys appear non exisitent...  and they are the typical kind of kids you would see in other frats.

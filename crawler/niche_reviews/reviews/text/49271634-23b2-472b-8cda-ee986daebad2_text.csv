Junior,5,"One of eastern Oregon University's claim to fame is their online courses and I can tell you that this is true. While online learning is not for everyone, in these hard times there is not always the option. I have found that their classes are comprehensive, their platform easy to access  and has easy to navigate resources. The professors are always available and ready to help if you have any problems, just ask. If you need tech help the IT department is very knowledgable and easy to reach. If you are having to take online college because of the pandemic I would highly recommend Eastern Oregon University."
Junior,5,when COVID-19 hit and classes transferred online Eastern Oregon University's transition was really smooth. While having to change plans a switch to online was no fun being able to quickly get back to school and reach a hint of normalcy was really helpful. their living situation while more expensive is well worth it to have your own bedroom and shared kitchenette. while all colleges have flaws I find that most of them have to do with student teacher interactions. I do know that there are some professors that don't click but student teacher relations are a two way street and much can be resolved by letting the teacher or someone in student services know. EOU staff is so helpful and their doors are always open if you need any help. I love this school.
Junior,5,I take all of my classes online and all of the professors are professional and easy to communicate with concerning assignments and questions.
Sophomore,5,"I have really enjoyed my time at Eastern Oregon University so far. It is very student-oriented and all the faculty and staff members all want to see you achieve your dreams. Not only are there small class sizes for a close and personal relationship with each professor, but also there is a small community where you get to know everyone around you and supporting you. One thing that I would like to see change at EOU is the mindset. A lot of the students believe that all the University wants is their money, even though that might be true I believe by having the mindset of the students and allowing them to thrive will create a more beneficial campus and learning area. I also would like to see EOU become more eco-friendly with more recycling bins and trash cans around campus as well as finding ways to conserve water and electricity. By those aspects I believe EOU will become one of the finest Universities in the country."
Freshman,5,"the college is a small town feel and everyone is friendly! Easy to adapt here, they have a lot of courses that you can find what's right for you. They have a partnership with Oregon State that you can get their education for a cheaper price."
Freshman,5,"The campus is beautiful. All the buildings are well taken care of, clean, and designed wonderfully. The entire campus is filled with friendly staff and students. Everyone is always eager to help."
Junior,5,I am an online student and my experience has been incredible. The professors and staff are supportive and easy to work with and want you to be successful. The tuition is affordable.  There is always support when you need it.
Freshman,5,"So far I have experienced the dorm life of this college and it is five-star worthy. The dorms are equipped with nice furniture and amenities, the food is fantastic, and the campus is beautiful. The town of La Grande is family orientated creating a picturesque college town."
Sophomore,5,I have been studying for my Business Degree online through Eastern Oregon. The staff are amazing and so helpful. The online systems are user-friendly making it very comfortable to study online from anywhere in the world.
Sophomore,5,I have greatly enjoyed the flexible learning options provided by Eastern Oregon University. I have been able to take classes online while continuing the job I love. The online professors are easy to communicate with and quick to answer questions.
Junior,5,"I have had excellent customer service with EOU, from the first day contacting them to get started with enrollment to working with all of my teachers. I love this school."
Freshman,5,The campus is so beautiful and the faculty is so nice and helpful. The classes are small so you get a lot of one on one with professors. Also the academics are very good.
Junior,5,"This is my first time attending a college or a school in the U.S. I love the weather, I'm getting used to the cold. There is always something to do here. There is a library, gym, football field, and theater. If I want to study or just want to have a quiet time, I will go to the library. If I have free time, I go to the gym and workout or play basketball or volleyball. There are always games every week in the gym or the football field. Every semester there are shows or play that happen in the theater and they are really great shows. The professors, faculty, and staffs are always there for their students. When I need help, they reach out and help me in any way possible. It is a small campus so almost everyone knows everyone. The environment around this campus is so clean and it makes me feel good walking to class. I like everything about this campus and the people in it."
Sophomore,5,"I have been at Eastern Oregon University for over a year now and I absolutely love it! From the staff to the teachers, everyone has been extremely helpful. All of my issues have been resolved quickly. I am doing the online program because I prefer a self paced environment. I would highly recommend this school to anyone."
Junior,5,Attending Eastern was one of the best decisions I've made. The atmosphere is unlike any other and the professors genuinely care about the success of their students. The buildings are clean and well kept and the classes are not over packed.
Junior,5,"I've been taking college classes part time online while working full time for years. Eastern Oregon U is the first 4 year institution that offered an online English program for continuing education students like me. I know they're one of the few, I've done the leg work. The classes offered are unique, the administration and advisors are quick to respond, and overall it is one of the friendliest and most welcoming institutions I've been a part of."
Junior,5,Great experience at this school so far. I love the weather during Spring and there is so much outdoor activity to do.
Senior,5,Eastern Oregon is located in La Grande Oregon. This university offers online classes for a reasonable price. It's classes are small where professors are able to help you more.
Niche User,5,I am an incoming freshman this coming fall. I have toured twice around the campus and really like the location and the dorm rooms. I havenâ€™t tried the food yet but I have heard great things.
Junior,5,"I like how EOU is very diversed, I see a lot of Pacific Islanders at the school, Latinos, Asians, Americans, and others. The teachers, staff, and faculty members are very welcoming and nice towards me in terms if academics and social life. EOU is a peaceful school and I feel like I'm at home."
Junior,5,"Eastern Oregon University is located in La Grande, Oregon a small city with a great sense of community and togetherness. My school has a great environment with well managed facilities. Faculty and staff enjoy their job and the opportunity they have to impact the lives of their students. The staff and students rally together to create fun and educational activities for both the community at large and the school. The quality of education is superb, for the classes I am taking this fall, all my professors try to lecture with different forms of teaching in other to reach every student. The schools ""Safe Zone"" program emphasizes zero tolerance to discrimination whether sexual orientation, race or belief. If I can change anything about my school, it will be the weather of La Grande, Oregon but since I can't change that I will attest to how welcoming my college is and how anyone can find their niche in my school, Eastern Oregon University."
Senior,5,Eastern Oregon University is a wonderful college that is home to a spectacular team of professors that constantly push their students to excel above and beyond what they imagined.
Alum,5,"Eastern Oregon University is a wonderful rural-town university.  It's definitely a college town, but has that small town feel. There's also plenty of areas surrounding the campus to get out for some hiking, fishing, or other recreational activities.  The professors are of good quality, and it's very reasonably priced for a university.  The athletics are some of the best you can get in the NAIA division."
Sophomore,5,"This is a beautiful area with lots of things to do. Not only is it a small town but there is skiing and snow boarding near by, there are lots of downtown shop sand places to eat. There is a great outdoor activity program on campus where you can check out anything from skis to a bike to a kayak. The campus is very family orientated. The sports here on campus are extremely fun to be involved in whether you are participating or just going to watch. I wouldn't have gone to school anywhere else and I am not even from Oregon!"
Freshman,5,"It's an awesome school. I enjoy going to EOU for many reasons. I feel safe. I feel welcomed. I feel connected. Everyone is so helpful, especially the faculty. I can't see myself going anywhere else. I highly recommend students to go to EOU because it's like home to me and I'm positive others will feel that way too."
Senior,5,"Eastern Oregon University is an excellent choice if you are considering pursing a college degree. I am currently in my Senior year at EOU and they have been more than accommodating to me. The advisors are excellent. The general education requirements are reasonable, and the staff is phenomenal. "
College Freshman,5,I attend online so I am not sure.  I do receive email with security updates.  Just the location of this school makes it a safe place.  It is very peaceful and beautiful area.
College Freshman,5,I'm on the soccer team. Amazing squad and program
College Freshman,5,They do very well and stuff

Recent Alumnus,5,My education professor where amazing.
Recent Alumnus,5,The police station is right across the street!
College Sophomore,5,I loved how immediate the responses were and how everyone made you feel welcome.
College Junior,5,The gym facilities at eastern are very good for such a small campus. The sports teams have scheduled times when they are at the gym so during those times it can get pretty crowded. When the teams are not in I have never had to wait to use a machine and there are always available spots on the mats.
College Junior,5,I have never had an issue with Financial Aid. They are always quick and there to help. I even receive e-mails helping me with financial aid.
College Senior,5,"I'm an Anthropology major and the professors are all so amazing. They tell us stories about what we are suppose to do and we go out and observe people. We do a lot of work, but we also get very close to the professors and sometimes help with their studies as well."
College Junior,5,"I love it , very friendly staff"
College Sophomore,5,The faculty is the best and very prompt to assist in any issues you may have.
College Sophomore,5,From my experience the academics are one of the best in the country. The faculty are prompt and very informational when asked a question.
College Freshman,5,The English department is really good.
College Freshman,5,The program is easy to get into.
College Sophomore,5,"There is a GSA. From what I've experienced myself, there is no blatant discrimination. There is also a mandatory course all students must take regarding Diversity, which I believe is helpful and wise!"
College Sophomore,5,"So far, it's everything I wanted. I'm a 52 year old, in college for the first time. The staff and faculty have made it a pleasant experience for me. I plan to continue past my B.S. degree onto a PhD in Social Psychology elsewhere, and this is a good starting point."
College Sophomore,5,I did not have any problems. I followed directions and the school answered all my questions.
College Sophomore,5,"The major enforcement, I believe, is the threat of expulsion for plagiarism. As it should be! I am a distance learner, so not involved in on-campus activities."
College Sophomore,5,I am a part of the athletic department for the school. I love the athletic building and the facilities. The students are mostly made up of athletes here because of the school's size. Everyone attends the athletic events.
College Sophomore,5,"The campus supplies many computer labs. Although I do own a laptop, I have used the campus labs a few times for educational purposes. I have never had any problems and there is always tech support available."
College Senior,5,I ran track for EOU. We had the best school spirit for our sports. every athlete went to each others events.
College Sophomore,5,There is lots of parking around campus for people with permits or not.  
College Student,5,everything here is great for me because i don't break the law so i have no worries
College Sophomore,5,"Im a online student and so far love it, I wish I could attend the actual college but do not have the funds"
Recent Alumnus,5,"I did not have any difficulty getting into my program at EOU.  It has been a learning experience for me, knowing what documents to fill out and send."
Recent Alumnus,5,So far I like the availability of the program classes
Recent Alumnus,5,"For me, EOU had exactly what I was looking for both for a major and the option of attending."
College Senior,5,"I am very happy with my program, and my minors, I was very happy at having the option of taking a double minor. It allows me to take a broad range of classes that I am very personally interested in."
College Senior,5,"I love Eastern Oregon University. I have learned so much in the little time I have been here. Every single class has been challenging and rewarding, some more than others. Professors are great, I am online and I honestly feel that Eastern Oregon university probably has one of the best Online programs in the country."
Junior,4,I love the way the online classes are easy to navigate. The only issue I've had with this school is figuring out loans.
Senior,4,Most professors are great at communicating and outlining their classes in a way that allows for a consistent learning experience.
Senior,4,Eastern Oregon represents being able to live in a small town while getting a big city education. There are lots of outdoor activities to do and see. It's a great place to live and go to college.
Sophomore,4,"I am Taking all my classes online, Everything is very easy to follow and if you have question they are always there to help you when you need it."
Sophomore,4,They are very helpful if you have been out of school for a few years and are wanting to go back and get a degree.
Sophomore,4,"Due to COVID-19, EOU turned their final term of the 2019-2020 school year online. Now, as a student who prefers on campus classes, I have to say this transition was not the easiest. However, EOU faculty was flexible and were willing to work with me to better understand the systems and allowed me to ask questions whenever I needed. The professors made each course online easy enough to follow but challenging enough that we still got to learn like we did if we were on campus. I have enjoyed my online schooling a lot! It honestly has changed how I view online courses and might even take more."
Freshman,4,EOU is a great university with a small town atmosphere.  Everyone is very close and the faculty really care about the individual students.
Junior,4,"I was looking for an online school that was affordable.  I found that in my state, it was EOU.  Registration was never easier.  Sending books were a little expensive, but at least an ebook was on Amazon Prime Kindle.  That was useful."
Alum,4,Great professors at Eastern Oregon University. La Grande is a very small town and a long ways away from large cities.
Niche User,4,I like the small school atmosphere. Their science program for pre-med students is also very good. The campus is beautiful as well as the surrounding scenery.
Senior,4,"I really enjoyed the small feel of the campus, town, and classes. They had activities that were for all students and they did a good job of being inclusive."
Niche User,4,Ive been there to summer camps since I haven't graduated from high school yet. Very nice school located in a nice location.
Junior,4,"This college is very small, yet so diverse. The teachers are so helpful, and the classes tend to be a decent size. There is a diverse amount of classes available, and there is even an outdoor adventure program that allows students to rent, and encourage going out into the outdoors. This college is great for anyone interested in all the basic majors & minors, as well as outdoor recs. The campus is beautiful. The students are usually engaged throughout the campus, and it definitely feels like home."
Alum,4,"Online programs are good. Professors are typically great. I had one horrible, one borderline horrible, and one really pompous professors in 4 years, not bad."
Niche User,4,"Eastern Oregon is a beautiful campus that has a close-knit community. They have many different programs and also have a superior outdoor program that really helps students be part of the environment. The classes are small, and you are able to connect with the professors.  Additionally, this college provides affordable accommodations. All in all, EOU is a perfect option for those who want to find a smaller reasonable college, bustling with activities and clubs."
Junior,4,I like Eastern Oregon University because the class sizes are smaller than they would be at larger universities like Oregon State University. There is a lot of great staff who are willing to help when you need it and if you just ask.
Senior,4,"So far i have loved my experience. There are faculty who are set knowledgable in their field, and I have learnt a lot from them. A negative is that there isnâ€™t many scholarship opportunities."
Freshman,4,"As I have almost come to an end of my first year at EOU, I have enjoyed it. I have enjoyed all of my professors and have met some awesome people. There are great opportunities on campus and in La Grande."
Junior,4,"The small campus is great for being able to interact with instructors more. The classes offered aren't varied as well because of its size, but they are quality classes."
Junior,4,"It is a small, quaint college. The access to food and drinks is available breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The faculty members are extremely helpful and patient. They are also very nice. The online facets of the school are set up well so we students do not have trouble accessing course materials and submitting due assignments. The bookstore has several versions of required reading materials along with leisurely reading materials. Clothing and snacks are available there as well. Purchases can be made with cash or credit, or digital money on any one student's account. Diversity is also a large concern with the school. Many students from many backgrounds attend Eastern Oregon University because of the school's persistent work in recruitment."
Junior,4,"Eastern Oregon University has an on-site location in Ontario, Oregon where I am continuing my education. I have great instructors, and I have been provided an opportunity to continue my education because of this school."
Niche User,4,It is a great campus and has a lot of activities. The sports are excellent and the community is wonderful.
Niche User,4,"Eastern Oregon University is a promising college with many opportunities for many students. However, there seems to be a problem where the staff has difficulties working with you if you have any name difficulties or FAFSA errors in the system. I would definitely like to see that changed. Mostly because I went through a whole fiasco with trying to get my unaccompanied youth status approved at the college, only for me to fill out a bunch of papers that were then useless when the gentlemen that tried to tell us there was a problem with the paperwork found out they had to agree with whatever the High School said anyway based on their handbook."
Senior,4,I came to Eastern Oregon University in the fall of 2013. My original plan was to major in Exercise Science. I soon changed my mind and decided to take on a double major. I enrolled into the Agriculture Science program that Oregon State University offered through Eastern. I also picked up a major in Business Administration with an emphasis in Accounting. My favorite aspect of Eastern is the small class sizes and the friendly staff. I'm glad I can still walk into my old professor's office and strike up a conversation.
Freshman,4,I am a freshman at EOU and I absolutely love being here. The professors and instructors are very nice and very willing to help with any questions you have about the work in class.
Senior,4,Great location for the adventurous. Not a great connection to the community. Many clubs for all kinds of interests. Small! Hardworking club leaders. Personal attentions from professors. 
College Freshman,4,Everyone whom I have spoken with has been very helpful.
College Freshman,4,I chose this school because I know family and friends who are attending or have attended it and recommended it as a good school.  I am attending online.  I enjoy college very much!
College Freshman,4,Class are fairly same and you get to know your professors on a personal basis
College Freshman,4,The dorms are amazing here
College Freshman,4,The meal plans are over priced for what you are getting. But the dorms themselves are awesome. We have our own showers and bathrooms as well a small storage space. I would rate food average and the dorms excellent
College Freshman,4,The support of the community is awesome for athletics. The home sporting events are largely packed. Most of the school teams are ranked on a national level.
College Freshman,4,"The school is very unique. Most people here are motivated to do well. Some people are local students that are looking to earn credits and then transfer to another school. The school has a large variety of students. There are people from Vail, Oregon to Barbados. I would choose the school again. The classes are straight forward. The professors really know there feild."
College Freshman,4,"Campus is safe, and we know what happens"
College Freshman,4,"EOU is a great school, I would recommend it"
College Freshman,4,"EOU is the perfect fit for me, I love it there."
Recent Alumnus,4,The newer facilities are amazing! The older ones need work however.
Recent Alumnus,4,"My college experience at eastern was great. I made several life long friends, and gained work experience during my time there!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"Eastern athletics are an important part of the institution. Basketball and football games are always fun to attend. It would be exciting to see all the athletic teams support each other. Eastern's track team is at every home game showing their gold and blue pride, however, other athletes do not attend the various sporting events of their peers."
College Junior,4,Its small and everyone is friendly and willing to help you.  Its also close to home and affordable.
College Sophomore,4,very fast and easy to get responses and access to information
College Junior,4,I personally know little about the housing off campus in this area because I live with a family member. From what I do know the housing prices in this area are on the lower end for a college town. There are houses and apartments which range between 400 - 800$.
College Junior,4,Although the local restaurants for the most part are not very healthy they are very tasty. The majority of places offer a 10% discount to students if you present your student ID. The prices are not overpriced.
College Freshman,4,"The Resident Life at Eastern Oregon University is very nice, there is plenty of room for all the things you need to live there for your schooling. The dorms have two bedrooms, a kitchenette, living room, a closet, a shower room and 1/2 bathrooms. The bedrooms each hold two residents, so in total a suite holds up to four students. The commons in the Halls have a full kitchen equiped with a oven with a stove top for cooking. Although there are many rules to abide by when living on campus (for safety reasons), there are still many possibilities and things to do."
College Freshman,4,"EOU is a very safe school, there is a security group that is always on duty, as well as the Resident Assistants who are constantly on call for any residents who need help. There is also a faculty member living in the dorms to be there incase of emergencies. EOU has emergency call phones located throughout campus incase of emergencies. There are also security cameras in the newer buildings for safety reasons."
College Freshman,4,"The professors are very kind to the students and will easily go out of their way to assist in any ways possible. The program offers many different ways of involving theatre into your working life after school, such as stage management, acting, and design. Being in the Theatre Arts program at EOU allows even the freshman to have a chance at large productions the university puts on, where as other colleges only upperclassmen are allowed to audition."
College Senior,4,"We strive to have people transfer to our school from all over the world, and most of the money goes to these students too so that is a problem for me."
College Sophomore,4,I receive my financial aid with almost no issues during the application and receiving process.
College Sophomore,4,Diversity is great on the campus and for the most part there is no racism.
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy my major and my professors.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of good places to go to.
College Freshman,4,There is very little pressure with drugs and alcohol
College Freshman,4,Everybody is really nice and friendly.
College Freshman,4,"The community nice, but it's expensive."
College Freshman,4,The campus is very diverse.
College Freshman,4,I think that EOU has some pretty good programs.
College Freshman,4,the dorms that I live in are new and the one I want to live in next year is nearing completion
College Freshman,4,There is wide variety of classes to take and explore
College Freshman,4,"The small class size is what I like, the professors are helpful and there is a wide variety of classes for me to try."
College Freshman,4,"They have seasons here, all 4 of them"
College Junior,2,"No student sections at any event! This leads to very little student involvement. Also the gym hours are sporadic and suck, the teams frequently use the weight room which is tiny. They drive all the students out of the gym, and many like me are forced to pay for anytime fitness because of the limited hours and equipment."
College Senior,2,Mac's is the only late night option and the prices are sky high!
College Senior,2,"There is literally nothing to do, besides go to the same bars and hear the same bands, that gets old fast"
College Senior,2,"I hated living in the ""residence halls"" since they hate being called dorms. When they can enter our rooms I say it's a dorm."
College Freshman,2,The meal plan is really expensive and too much.
College Sophomore,2,Financial aid was a headache for me overall
College Sophomore,2,It's horrible.  There is only neighborhood around the campus.  It is too cold to walk anywhere.  You'd have to have a car to know off campus dining experiences.
College Sophomore,2,It was hard applying for Financial Aid because i had to figure it out on my own.  I wish the financial aid office would have been more helpful with the overall process.  
College Sophomore,2,I feel that the dining for our small town is average.  I wish that there was more options for late night eating besides McDonald's and Denny's. 
College Sophomore,2,"We have a pretty good variety including Chinese, Mexican, Greek, American and Fast Foods.   "
College Sophomore,2,"I really like my school, because this is where i have lived my whole life so i feel very comfortable.  "
College Sophomore,2,"The admission process into nursing is pretty extreme.  They look at grades, work experience, background, classes, references, and also interview you. The advice i have is give it your all. "
College Sophomore,2,There is a shuttle available at certain time of the day. 
College Sophomore,2,"It cost $75 annually.  I think that parking should be free, plus it is so hard to find a parking spot.  They really needed to expand available parking. "
College Sophomore,2,The library just got remodeled it's pretty nice. It's a popular spot for student's to study and do homeowner.  
College Sophomore,2,The student's dress pretty casual.  
College Junior,2,"At Eastern Oregon, the weather is bi-polar. It's not unheard of to have snow, rain, sunshine, a windstorm, and clouds all in the same day. The summers are extremely warm and the winters are uncomfortably cold. The weather at Eastern Oregon is very unpredictable and more than half time, the weatherman gets our weather wrong."
College Sophomore,2,Hard to Find Housing â€“ Lagrande is a great college town.But it is very difficult to find housing you have to apply a year in advance.Thanks to my cousin he rents me a room for $350.00 a month.I tried to find apartments but they are all taken in advance.
College Junior,2,"The town is not college friendly.  It's a college town, but people around here tend to be very conservative, so finding property owners willing to rent to college students can be difficult.  The Campus housing offices are the best bet for finding off campus living, if you can find the housing office itself."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are only two places where you can eat here on campus. There's Mac's Grill and the school's cafe. Mac's grill is not bad, but the school's cafe is.... well i'd say okay. When you first eat at the cafe it's like ""Whoa, they have good variety"" but let me tell you, you'd get tired of it. It has different foods everyday but they taste the same. I'd recommend for you newcomers to get the lowest meal plan there is if you want to eat on campus."
College Junior,1,"I wouldn't recommend this University at this time. There are alot of big changes happening at our university and is scaring the students. The University just found out that many of our BS degree and our OSU degree programs were not actually meeting the Oregon standards for many years, this invalidated many degrees that were handed out between 2004 and 2014. Kinda scary not knowing if my degree I've paid $30,000+ for is worth the paper its written on. 

Cheating is wide spread throughout the campus. This is because of a few reasons, first off is that many courses are online and do not require proctoring for tests and exams. Many courses are online only because EOU does not have enough students on campus. This has lead professors to get lazy and only use test bank answers. If you google the questions on any exam, you will find a word for word question and answer online. 

Limited hours!!! Want to take night classes? Well you cant at EOU. Want to cram all night in the library before your tests? You can't because the library has terrible hours. Want to go to the gym at 8pm? You cant because the gym closes super early. Want to grab dinner at the cafe on campus? You cant because it closes super early. EOU has cut hours everywhere and has ruined the on campus environment. EOU please if you are reading this please make the Library and gym 24 hours a day. I pay over fifteen thousand a year for a sub par education, can I please go into the library to study whenever I want?

The housing on campus is really good and clean. If you are looking to socialize though you are at the wrong college. There are no events worth going to and the dorm layouts are set up like a retirement home. You will meet your roommates and not many other students. If I could do it again, I would not have came to Eastern Oregon University, my advice is to look towards OSU or WOU."
College Senior,1,"I personally hate how much money is spent on the sports programs here, everyone else gets to lack everything they want or need just so sports can have all the money and facilities"
College Senior,1,"They say you have everything in order then what do you know, they need some sort of paper work, again. They make you file the same paper work that will get denied year after year, which results in getting my aid about a month late"
College Sophomore,1,I feel that more support is needed by the community and school. 
College Sophomore,1,"There are a couple of bars, that is about it for nightlife."
College Sophomore,1,"There isn't really one. Maybe there are parties, and I'm just not being invited, but not a lot seems to go on here. There is no where in town to go after 6 o'clock, except maybe the movie theater and walmart."
College Freshman,1,nothing is very healthy except for the salad which is not good half the time.
Recent Alumnus,1,The food on campus is not very good because it is all provided by Aramark and their attempts at international food is really pathetic. There are no late night options on campus or any other providers. The only option to use flex dollars on is at Bear Mountain Pizza and their pizza is disgusting. Not worth it at all!
College Junior,1,"Unless a student is living in the dorms, I can't say Eastern Oregon is strict, if anything they aren't strict enough. Students living in the dorms have strict policies when it comes to noise violation, parking, and having a meal plan. Students in the dorms that have committed these violations are subject to fines and termination. One example on how the school could be more strict on is being tobacco free. It bothers me that I have to walk around campus and breath in other peoples smoke. I believe there should be designated smoking areas. Chewing tobacco is also another large problem in our school. There are plenty of times where I had approached a water fountain, and found chew in the drain. It's a disgusting habit, and needs more regulation."
College Junior,1,"Hardly any parking, and the free parking is a long way away. If you want to park at your dorm, you have to pay for it, and there is usually never a spot."
College Junior,1,"Public Transportation in La Grande is almost non existant.  There is a small taxi company, which is very costly, and a bus system, that has only 1 bus, and 1 route."
College Sophomore,1,"The library is old, smells funny, and is super hot. The gym is small with little equiptment. There are campus activtes, but no one goes, ever. No one goes to sporting events either, which is lame. Basically the school just sucks."
College Sophomore,1,"So the weather here is so boring, cold and ugly!
Expect to never swim or go sledding, but maybe once or twice the whole year. It snowed during sprink break. It seems to snow a lot, but it never sticks! Also, the wind blows, literally, if you weigh under a 100 and go outside you might fly away.
No heat, no sun, no snow, just wind. Iw"
College Sophomore,1,"Religion Is Poop. If you're a religious person with standars and morals, don't come here. There's nothing to do here but drink and smoke (marijuana) like every day of the week.

As for the white people, they are hicks, with no culture other than their own. If you dress weird, are gay, religious, or any extreme form, don't come here. It's full of cowboys and Hawaiins."

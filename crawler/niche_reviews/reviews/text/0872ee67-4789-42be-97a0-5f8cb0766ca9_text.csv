Alum,5,Berea college offers you work experience while getting a high quality education. It allowed me to meet so many great people and introduced me to futures i never thought possible for myself.
Junior,5,"I've learned so many things at Berea. Not just academically but in religion and how I view the world and country I live in. I've learned about people, responsibility, diversity, and a lot about U.S-Japan foreign relations."
Junior,5,"Berea College, while I wasn't the most enthusiastic about it as a freshman has really come through for me. The people there are amazing and have been invested in seeing me become successful after my time there. Going to Berea has taught me that just because I come from a poor back ground that doesn't mean I shouldn't have nice things and be successful."
Sophomore,5,"Like all students, Berea Students love to complain about Berea, it's one of our favorite things to do. Berea is in the middle of nowhere, the nearest mall being 40 minutes away, and because parking is so limited almost no-one has a car to get anywhere. Berea has no party scene and alcohol isn't allowed on campus. The food in the lunchroom isn't great and we all have to work on top of our crazy hard school work. 
But despite how much we complain about the school, we all love it. Berea is the place that had hope in us, that saw us as more than poor sad kids doomed for nothing, they took a risk and with their help, we are going to succeed."
Sophomore,5,"I'm going into my fourth semester here, and I can say I absolutely love it! I admire how Berea provides free tuition for low-income students who would otherwise not have the funds to pay for college. Attending Berea has helped me understand the world better and learn more about myself. I would recommend anyone to attend, however I suggest they be very determined because Berea is very academic driven."
Freshman,5,"You're looking at free college. You're looking at debt-free graduation. You're getting an education that doesn't cripple you for the next 20 years. 

Diversity is amazing. 

That said, there are no real parties aside from the ones you put on with your friends. At Berea, you make your own fun (we're working on being more fun though). 

We have a Walmart. The local area is small and freshmen cannot have cars on campus. Be prepared to walk everywhere for at least a semester or two.

As part of the work-study program, students are responsible for much of the work on campus. That includes dining. The students, who have no idea how to season eggs, are responsible for your nutritional intake. Not good. 

Don't expect anything special related to athletics. 

But hey, free college."
Freshman,5,Berea College is a very nice college. Here I feel lie I fit in very well and the community is really nice. I enjoy the small amount of students in classes because you develop great relationships with the Professors. I also enjoy the variety of classes that Berea has to offer.
Niche User,5,"Berea College was rank as one most leading private liberal arts college in the United States, fact that I personally love. This college also support students with financial problems and give them the opportunity to continue their education. There are numerous clubs and organizations to join, students of Berea College are really involve with the institution. The teacher have a good relationships with students. They also have a beautiful Campus, small but spectacular."
Sophomore,5,"Everyone is kind. You would think after living with my parents my whole life and loving them immensely would make me sad, but Berea is a second home. Your professors all help you and you supervisors are all there for you. The fresh air and warm enviroment helps fill any void. I also made many great friends."
Alum,5,"Berea College is absolutely amazing. It is truly a special place. I don't know where I would be without Berea and all that it has given  me. From the full tuition scholarship that I received, to being able to study abroad with 33% of the cost being covered by Berea, to my fully funded internship in my field of study , and last but  not least graduating from an accredited institute of higher education with no debt I could not be more grateful for my experience at Berea."
Freshman,5,"The best opportunity for any student of color, has great professors that love to see students succeed, great centers for students of any intersection to relax, and also teaches students about cultural issues and gives students tools on how to use them."
Junior,5,"Berea College is a wonderful place to obtain your education. With the wide variety of majors and educational opportunities, it is impossible to not have a worthwhile experience while making many friends along the way. I would definitely recommend Berea College to anyone looking for a valuable education."
Alum,5,"At Berea, you engage in the labor program and have the opportunity to gain 4 years of work experience- a unique model of gaining academic and field experience. Berea's community is a place where you can celebrate all aspects of diversity and engage in growth-promoting social justice dialogues. Great for students who are willing to work hard for a meaningful undergraduate college experience. Very convenient for international students who are looking for a tight-knit community to live and learn in. In brief Berea not only extremely affordable, but also full of opportunities to grow, serve and receive life-changing mentorship and training."
Sophomore,5,"There has been a lot of opportunities come to me just from being college.  However, one of the best things about Berea is that students have the option to apply to study abroad.  Also, since I am in the music department (music minor), I get to see amazing professionals perform in front of my very eyes! I am so blessed by this and encouraged by these talented people every day to improve at the piano and singing.  I suppose one thing that I would like to see change here at Berea is everyone taking advantage of what they have.  Berea College has a lot to offer, and it would do my heart well if people could really understand how blessed they are.  Other than that, I have enjoyed being a student here and being a part of this community very much."
Junior,5,Berea has been absolutely amazing. My favorite thing about the school is the care that the professors have for the students and their availability. If a student is struggling the professor will notice and try to engage and try to help as best they can because the professors genuinely want to see all of us succeed.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely LOVE Berea College! I love the campus, I love the diversity, I love my international friends (I mean I never would have imagined to best friends with a Somalian, Iranian, Nepali, and Texan, let alone be in the same breath all at once), I love my roommate, I love my classes, I love my professors, and I love myself even more than I did before I came to college! It's hard, but it is worth the tears!"
Freshman,5,Berea College is an amazing college that cares about it's students and is an amazing community. I would definitely recommend going there because you will learn a lot.
Freshman,5,Everyone at this college truly cares about your success and if they see that you are struggling they will provide any extra attention that you need in order to suceed
Junior,5,Very prestigious institution. Not a party school but you can still have fun. If you get into this school you are a special person.
College Junior,5,Our internship center administration provides plenty of information along with our academic advisors of internships best for us.
College Junior,5,Our internship center administration provides plenty of information along with our academic advisors of internships best for us.
College Junior,5,Our dorms are fairly new and come with great amenities.
College Senior,5,"Tell any job employer, etc. that you are a Berea student (graduate) they instantly put your worth up a few notches. The Career Center is super helpful from looking to applying and everything in between."
College Senior,5,Berea is the best because we get the opportunity to lean through work and study. The teachers and staff care so much about us and work to help us in any way they can.
College Junior,5,"I love Berea College! The administrators and academic advisers really care about the students.  They are involved in their students' lives and get to know them. To them we are not just a number on a piece of paper, we are people. Out of all of the schools I read about and visited, only Berea College made me feel as though not only my education but my personal well-being also mattered to them!"
College Sophomore,5,Berea is great. The teachers are interested in your education. The school is very difficult but I am really earning my education.
College Freshman,5,Berea College is a great value and I love it because it is very liberal.
College Senior,5,"Financial Aid did what they could for me, they helped me pay for books when I couldn't. I also had my braces paid for. I never thought that I could get braces until I myself got a decent job after graduation. My parents could not afford them and I was okay with that. Being chosen by FA to receive financial assistance with getting braces was the best day of my life. They even helped me get a loan to pay for my surgery, which I needed before I could get braces."
College Freshman,5,"I believe it's the best. It's newly renovated. It's spacious and clean, especially compared to some of the other dorms."
College Freshman,5,"If you are from a low-income family then it is as simple as, you will get everything covered. Even if you still have a term bill it will usually be under 1000 dollars. I just got through my first year and I am still debt free."
College Senior,5,"There are so many international students on campus as well as organizations to accompany them. There is a center for interracial education as well as a Campus Christian Center that urges students to have interfaith dialogue that enhances the understandings of cultural as well as religious ideologies of every student's differing perspectives. The college wants this diversity and these dialogues to foster and find a common ground of understanding as we are all of ""one blood."""
College Junior,5,"Every student receives a full tuition scholarship valued at $25,500 per year."
College Sophomore,5,We dont have greek life.
College Sophomore,5,We have about 48 different states and 50 different countries that make up our school.
College Sophomore,5,We are one of the best Colleges in the South! The professors are very flexible with your work and other academics
College Sophomore,5,"This is one of the Best Colleges in the south. We have great professors and we are required to work. For that reason, we are very high on the rador once we graduate and people see Berea College on our transcripts1"
Recent Alumnus,5,Every admitted student receives a FULL-TUITION scholarship!
College Freshman,5,"Berea is not like most college's. We have to work here at Berea, but I like that aspect."
College Freshman,5,A simple walk to the office can be a simple task with getting all the financial help you need to know and get
College Freshman,5,Computer Labs Are Great – The computers are amazing and the laptops are just as great as well.
Alum,4,"Berea does not normally offer online classes, however with the state of education right now, the college has learned to take everything tot he web and done so very effectively."
Junior,4,"This is a great school with many oppurtunities. It's small but has a big reputation with its No Tution Promise Scholarship which helps low-income students have a chance at an education. With everything going on with this ""pandemic"" they are having a hard time answering and getting info out to students. Nonetheless, this school overall is one of the best out there."
Freshman,4,Great professors! The campus is beautiful and has a variety of spaces for students to study. I miss it!
Senior,4,"Great college, a remarkable environment to grow and learn. I received a quality education at no cost and all four years, I made life-long friendships and memories. The only drawback I can think of is how major recruiters ignore Berea College."
Senior,4,I am a senior currently. Berea has definetly tried me with my mental health but overall its a good place to be. I've never been out of the U.S. until Berea so I definetly will cherish this college and all the amazing opportunities they give you ❤
Junior,4,I like that it is diverse and it is small which I like a lot. I wish they had more food options on campus.
Freshman,4,"This college is a blessing for those unable to afford higher education. Berea college offers a no tuition promise to students who come from lower income households. They offer a ton of financial aid in forms of scholarships, loans, and grants. Berea is extremely helpful in any way they can be. However, communication on campus and between departments is nonexistent, in order to obtain any help they offer you often must jump through several hoops to get to where you need to be. 
My favorite part about Berea College is the academic opportunities provided. The professors who work at Berea are extremely qualified and are incredible instructors. I have yet to meet a professor who has not been extremely helpful and friendly."
Sophomore,4,"The small campus allows for intimate and genuine relationships to form between the students with each other and with the professors, faculty, and staff. It offers an abundant variety of resources to aid students develop and strengthen their skills and experience."
Senior,4,"I like learning for the sake of learning. Berea provides many opportunities with its tuition free promise and diverse student body. While Berea's dorms are not great, and food service is awful (and required) I have received funding to travel abroad and take an 8 week internship. I have had to take out loans for 6,000 dollars, but it is worth it for my two abroad experiences and the funding for my internship."
Freshman,4,I enjoy having a small classroom setting so I am able to meet with my professor one on one if I am struggling with the material.
Freshman,4,"Considering it's free, it doesn't get much better than that. The professors are hard on you but will also help you if you are willing to help yourself. You're pushed to the best of your abilities."
Sophomore,4,"It is a very welcoming school. If you are a potential athlete things may get a little tough because it is also a working school. You will have to work a minimum of 10 hours weekly, attend classes, and on top of that go to practice and study! Berea is really demanding and although the professors there care for the students, anyone can easily fall a little off course."
Alum,4,"Very good experience.  Academically challenging.  Professors really care about the students.  There is a big push for diversity, but only from a liberal viewpoint... it seems to be hard to be a conservative here on campus.  There are lots of opportunities for social engagement, but this is not the school to go to if you want to party."
Sophomore,4,"Berea is not for the faint of heart. It is very rigorous. Although academics and facilities are wonderful, the school greatly lacks in the area of student safety. There is a serious problem regarding rape on this campus."
Freshman,4,Berea College is a pretty and the diversity here makes everything much nicer. The class sizes and the overall college size is small which makes it easier to get one-on-one help from professors.
Sophomore,4,I love all of the professors I know here. They are always available to help students no matter what trouble students might have. The only thing I do not really enjoy in my  college is food from dining services
Niche User,4,"Caring, engaging professors; beautiful campus in the middle of the quaint town; college community involvement; and no tuition!"
Freshman,4,"Berea College is strenuous but very supportive. They are strict which can be aggravating but there are various helpful resources on campus that well make up for that.  From the vast library to the free Campus Counseling, Berea College is a beautiful and structured environment for learning."
College Junior,4,Berea college administrators make it known that they are there fore their students if they need to report or just talk.
College Junior,4,Our sports are only because Berea care more about the students education than sports.
College Junior,4,Berea college is amazing and liberating . My school allows for self growth both intellectual and mentally. My school prepares their students for the real world and open the door for new opportunities.
College Senior,4,All of the professor care so much about their subject and most are deeply invested in their students. With the exception of GSTR there is only one section of each course offered at a time. The variety is great in some subjects and very poor in others. The classes are really small and involve a lot of interaction and discussions.
College Senior,4,"Students have access to free health care and free counseling, but the school is not always great about taking assaults (of any kind) seriously."
College Junior,4,This is a small campus with virtually no safety issues found in the community. The only issue is the lack of quality safety officers.
College Junior,4,"Courses are vigorous and professors are great mentors, friends, and teachers."
College Sophomore,4,"While extremely challenging academically, I am so very grateful that I decided to go to Berea College. Some of my favorite experiences include the labor program, my undergraduate study I did this summer, and joining Berea College Country Dancers. To be completely honest, it is a dash from beginning to end. It can become very stressful and overwhelming, but the opportunities available to students are abundant, so it's definitely worth the struggle. Berea has an atmosphere of progress and deep concern. I am thankful for my academic adviser and my labor supervisor, they have given me encouragement to follow my dreams and are always there when I need them. If I had it to do over, I would definitely choose Berea again."
College Junior,4,"Berea College has been a good fit for me in terms of size and the strength of the academics. There are many aspects of the campus and administration that are not favorable, but I have enjoyed it thus far. I do believe that the academics are at times ridiculous in the nursing program, as if the college feels they needs to overcompensate for its small size. Though there are disagreeable aspects, in all I am happy I chose Berea and am proud to be graduating debt free. I also feel as though the labor program has bettered me as a person and is a strong aspect of the college."
College Senior,4,"Berea College is a great school, and I highly suggest looking into it. Graduating debt free is no joke, and leaves you with unlimited options. You will have to work hard, and a lot is expected out of you, but the payoff is well worth it."
College Sophomore,4,"I've only been to a few of the off campus restaurants. One was a really delicious and decently priced hometown sort of place. Yummy catfish! But other than that, it's been mostly fast food stuff: McDonalds, Arby's, Taco Bell, etc. Oh! And they just opened up this great Italian place that's pretty affordable (especially compared to other Italian places in other towns) and SUPER delicious! The Mexican place was okay, but I've had way better. I'm not vegan or vegetarian and I'm not overly concerned with organic foods and stuff, so I don't much pay attention to those options when I'm out."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus does a good job of sticking to their word and enforcing the law, so to speak."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't like food service, simply because their hours aren't convenient for me and because I ate so much my first semester that I grew sick of it. But honestly, they have a great variety of lines, including Sandwhich/Wrap, Soup, Pizza, Burger/Grilled or Fried Chicken Sandwhiches, Salad, Hot Line, Dessert, Breakfast, Pasta, and ""Fire and Ice"" which is a nice Asian on rice line. There are abundant drink options and very efficient cleaning up processes. The main cafe takes meal plan dollars and serves some very popular items. I prefer to eat there or cook my own food. There are also a few other cafe's small restaurants on the corner of the campus that many people eat at, but they aren't on the meal plan."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a tight-knit community, which is really nice. The dorms are currently being renovated, one at a time, so things are a little cramped in the meantime, but the renovations are very nice and eco-friendly. My dorm is literally right next to the building that most of my classes and secondary labor position are in, which is awesome. The rooms are small, but hey, it's a dorm room. The ""janitors"" are all students, so it depends on who you get as to how well they do. Usually freshman aren't as enthusiastic, and I can see why, but the dorm coordinators do a great job of motivating them kindly. Then, everyone is happy! The housing processes is done by lottery number. Since I'm staying in the same room next year, I got the choice before the lottery ran, and it was super easy since they've converted it to an online process."
College Freshman,4,"It's pretty cheap to live in Berea off campus. Usually, people can save money if they have roommates and get on food stamps."
College Freshman,4,"Although strict with certain things, they tend to be very understanding. Even if you get caught and get a violation you can go to J-Board and explain the whole situation and get off with just making an informative poster or something. However, they are very strict with labor and academics."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are not too crowded and most of the people are friendly. There are FA's (facilities assistant) that clean daily. Relatively nice dorms, maybe not the nicest but nice. No co-ed dorms though, so if that is what you're looking for, keep on looking."
College Sophomore,4,"My college focuses a lot of Appalachian studies, and is based on Christian values. However, I have never felt as though these views had to be shared by every student on campus. We have several international students on campus, some of whom I have become great friends with. As it is a college for primarily low-income students, we do not have a lot of diversity in economic background, but we are all focused on helping less fortunate people and families when we graduate."
College Junior,4,We honestly have some of the best staff for the money this country has to offer.
College Freshman,4,The students that go to Berea College are very diverse! We have a large number of international students and have a wide variety of different ethnicity groups.
College Freshman,4,The school provides laptops to all their students which makes it very affordable and easy for students. There is also printers all throughout campus that are available for student use at little cost. The network is mostly reliable and is fast.
College Freshman,4,"The drug scene is very low profile, you do not see it on campus and do not hear much about the usage. When it is found there is a strict no tolerance policy enforced."
College Freshman,4,Berea will even pay for some of the off campus rent
College Freshman,4,There are good independent labs and research opportunities
College Sophomore,4,"The gym is small but good. Student hangout spots are new and nice. The library is great, due to the fact that it offers convenient study rooms. "
College Sophomore,4,"This is another ""Berea plus"". It is great that there is so much tolerance, but at times it gets annoying. Some feminists have to correct you every time they have a conversation with you, and if you do not have liberal beliefs, you are a minority (congratulations). Sexual orientation is pushed so much, they even have a club for it if you are interested. Berea has a Black Cultural Center that is very nice. Berea attempts to cultivate a world of tolerance, and it can be a hit or miss. No one is really economically diverse."
College Freshman,4,I am an agriculture major and all the professors are great
College Freshman,4,Every professor is willing to help
College Freshman,4,Everyone here are extremely nice people
College Sophomore,4,"It's great to live of campus, but the school definitely makes it a hassle to get off-campus housing. If you're willing to go through the process, it will be worth it. In the summer is the only exception. Just about everyone can live off campus during summer terms."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I assume they are very strict. I didn't get into trouble, so I don't know how strict they are."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I enjoyed the parties, especially the dorm parties."
College Junior,4,"Berea College is one of 7 work colleges in the United States, and our program is special.  Every student, when accepted their first year, is assigned a job on campus.  These jobs include working at dining services, the college farm, the college bookstore, as a TA, in the library, in the financial aid office, at facilities management, and many other jobs.  You are expected to work at least 10 hours a week, and you get a part of your earnings, while the rest goes into funding your tuition.  Every spring you have to find a job for the next year, and you have the chance to go up a pay grade.  It is this program that is partly responsible for allowing Berea College to provide a tuition free education to all of its students."
College Junior,4,"Every Student is issued a laptop computer their freshman year, and they are expected to keep it in good condition.  Our tech center will fix any problems that occur with your computer, and should they need to keep it for a longer period of time, you will be issued a loaner computer.  Because everyone has access to a laptop, we do not a an abundance of desk top computers for student use.  Of course, you are allowed to have your personal computers as well, but the tech center will only be minimally helpful if you run into problems."
College Sophomore,4,"Berea College is a charming small college town. It feels welcoming, and there are cute small stores the students can go in and look or hang out in. The college gives an overall relaxed feeling."
College Sophomore,4,"Though the tuition is guaranteed to be payed for all students who get accepted, students still have to pay for logging, books, food, and any other extra supplies. Berea does offer scholarships as well, there are somewhat hard to find."
College Sophomore,4,"The academic is the best thing of this college. The professors are really hard, you have to learn a lot to pass the class, and it is very hard to get a good GPA, unless you study like a horse."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a number of sports in Berea College, except we do not have football. The students are pretty supporting of one another, and have a fun time. The college also has a nice gym that is easily accessible."
College Sophomore,4,We have great facilities. Sometimes I wish that we had another gym for when they have to close it for events.
College Freshman,4,"The Theatre program at Berea helps its students a lot. There are many opportunities given for internships, conferences, and possible jobs. Having a labor position in the theater is a plus."
College Junior,4,"Drug scene is very minimal, this is a dry city so there is no access to alcohol."
College Freshman,4,Berea's campus is very nice and everything is in easy wakling distance. The buildings are are kept up very nicely.
Sophomore,2,"The only thing this college has going for them is the no-tuition promise. The professors are okay; the dorm life is terrible. There is not much to do since they do not allow cars on campus unless there is a particular circumstance. If I am honest, the only reason I decided to attend was that I am poor and could not afford anywhere else."
Freshman,2,"Definitely not your average college. It's a great bang for your buck and education is great for the most part, but they force you to take classes that go against christianity and tell lies about history such as saying black people were the only ones to ever be enslaved, which is a lie. If you're white, male, and a conservative Christian they will try so hard to kick you out. Their Christian center is not at all Christian. The college itself is very occultish and harasses people with beliefs contrary to the ones they push on you. From the outside it looks great, but the hierarchy of the college doesn't care about its students. Much corruption. Please take my warning and don't come here"
Junior,2,"The College has done nothing to create an inclusive environment where various thoughts and beliefs are tolerated. The College from the administrators to students has a strong progressive leaning that it does not tolerate other political thoughts and religious beliefs. My friends and I were fiercely attacked by students who disagreed with our political and religious views. It is hard to freely exchange ideas and thoughts at Berea, as most of the progressives only value diversity in terms of skin color, but not thoughts and ideas. Berea is a very difficult place for free-thinkers and anyone who is not a leftist."
Sophomore,2,"I appreciate Berea for giving me an opportunity to higher education at very little cost, and I respect Berea's mission. However, I applied to Berea on a whim, didn't realize that academics here is lousy and is not real learning. Most of the students here only strive hard in their classes for the grade, not the desire to actually learn. While there are a few good professors here, most of the professors received their PhDs from University of Kentucky, EKU, or other second to third tier schools. Classes are extremely boring; I barely learned anything new here despite having excelled in most of my classes. A degree from Berea is not worthy of four years of your life because the average income of Berea grads is around $30,000 or less. Unless you want to have a minimum wage job after graduation, I strongly don't recommend you to apply and attend Berea College. I am transferring after this semester."
College Junior,2,At Berea college we do not have Greek life at all.
College Sophomore,2,Anything around the Tavern costs too much. It's a hassle to try to get to places like McDonalds or Taco Bell which are the only two late night options. If you go to Richmond there are plenty of more options for food and for late night. To get to all of the decent food you need a vehicle to get there.
College Sophomore,2,"The alcohol and drug use not being allowed is very understandable. I do not think you should be punished for having alcohol if you are 21 or older. Visitation is somewhat understandable because Berea wants to keep its image. But it is a new day. They are treating us like children with the visitation policy. They could at least extend the hours or let the hours start sooner. Instead of starting at 5, they should start around noon and end around midnight. They could even end at 10 because some people keep their boyfriends or girlfriends in the room from the time visitation starts to the time it ends. This can be very disrespectful to their roommate as well. The attendance rule is too strict. It should be up to the students if they want to show up or not. They will only be hurting themselves if they choose not to show up. Berea definitely treats us like we are in middle school."
College Senior,2,Nothing is relatively that close enough to campus. You can walk but it's far.
College Senior,2,The new kitchen appliances should help this situation we have some pretty good cooks.
College Freshman,2,"I like to make my own fun, but sometimes I wish we had one of those huge parties you see in movies. If not one a week, then maybe once a month."
College Freshman,2,If it's not a party being held by the wanna-be fraternity then a party consists of some people in a dorm room drinking. Berea is not a school for partying.
College Senior,2,"There are few parties and if there is one, very few people are aware of it. Berea is a historically dry town with no alcohol being sold in the area. Since the school is academically rigorous, it is not really necessary to have a bunch of parties, but I do think it would help stressed students blow off some steam."
College Senior,2,"For the amount of international students and students from other places, having the Cracker Barrel and McDonald's just doesn't cut it. I wish there were more diverse and fresh options available in the community. The one Thai/Chinese place in town is horrible and I would rather drive 20 minutes up to Richmond for fresh, real, and tasty Thai food."
College Freshman,2,"Berea College does not allow for many students to live off campus unless they have children, are married, or are older than 23."
College Sophomore,2,"The Deep Green dorm is new and it is for girls. It prides itself on being eco-friendly, and it is very nice. Thats about all folks. Berea is small, and it helps when you think about class sizes, but that is one of the few positives. No football team, no school spirit, academics and extracurriculars such as debate could probably compete with other schools, but nothing else. We also have a lot of trees and squirrels. We would probably rank #1 in that. "
College Sophomore,2,"Public Safety is a joke. I do not really feel safe with people who are smaller and skinnier than me. I feel more safe walking with people I work out with. Public safety is a nuisance, and they would probably rather give a parking ticket than save someone who is having a heart attack. "
College Sophomore,2,"Thoughts of transferring often lingered in my mind, but many credits will not transfer to other schools. Berea is also by far the cheapest option. Without the Delta Sigma Gamma society, however, I would probably transfer. This is the first time that I have had fun with a group of guys on campus. There is no organization on campus that can give you the amount of resources and tools you need to survive later in life. I have the opportunity to network, gain friendships, and I have opportunity to become a leader. And also because....bingo nights and dorm parties… aren’t that cool. This school does a good job in diversity, but it get annoying at times. Feminist, liberals, and hippies often approach you and shove their opinions down your throat. Through all the freshman orientation and other meetings, i wish the school would have told me that I would basically get paid upwards to $170...a month. The average is about $150 for freshmen.
"
College Freshman,2,Only a few students have cars due to school policies.
College Sophomore,2,"Off campus housing is ok. However, it is really tiring for students to walk to campus if he or she doesn't have a bike or a car."
College Sophomore,2,"There are only two really known place to go and eat within the campus. Both are good to eat at, but there isn't much variety."
College Junior,2,"Transportation at Berea is minimal. Unless you have a car or a friend with a car, there aren't many opportunities to get off campus that aren't somehow school related."
College Junior,2,They are pretty much average. The buildings are a bit older so it makes it hard to enjoy as a freshman considering the dorms have no air conditioning.  The cost is fantastic because most students don't have to pay anything but otherwise it's average.  There are many different cultures and people from all over so it makes for a nice variety of backgrounds.
College Junior,2,"Its incredible hard to get off campus, landlords aren't student friendly. Rent is an avg. $300-600 and that could be for an apt. or a house. Hard to find available  places to rent"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Off-campus housing is fine, but its easier to live on campus. You have to live on campus unless you are age 23 or older, have a child, or are married. Occasionally, if there is a housing shortage, they will open an off campus housing lottery to seniors."
College Freshman,2,"Berea only had fast food, which is either a mile or mile and a half walk since students are not allowed to have their cars on campus. There is Boone Tavern right by campus, but is it pricy. The Main Street Cafe and Papa Leno's are by campus and are the only sit down restaurants in the town that aren't pricey."
College Senior,2,"No Excuses – While Berea's weather is relatively mild most of the time, there are times where the whole campus side walks are covered with ice and slush, and yet we are required to go to class. The fact that the Health Services is at a considerable walking distance does not encourage me to brave treacherous weather conditions."
College Sophomore,2,"In the hot seasons it gets really humid. Overall, it doesn't get super cold. However, when it rains, it usually rains a few days in a row before it really stops."
College Sophomore,2,"You are not allowed to have a car on campus unless you are an upperclassmen or live 8 or more hours away. Even most upperclassmen don't have cars. You don't need them to get around campus, though."
College Junior,2,"The Craziness – The weather in Berea is Bipolar. You never know what it will be sometimes, but you should expect long winters with plenty of snow. You will have to go to class, regardless of the weather and you will get an email telling you to watch out for falling trees and slippery side walks."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Mixed Reviews Honestly – The academic programs are challenging.  I will give credit for that.

The social scene is average.  While most of the students are very bright, they are still very dumb.  They don't know about climate at all.  They think it's not normal for it to be snowing one minute and sunny the next.  It's called snow showers.  There are a lot of cliques.  There is a lot of liberal indoctrination.  That is evident at the college convocations when every speaker is crazy liberal and spends time defaming those who are conservative.  Conservatives have to worry about liberal students ganging up on them.  Many students can't mind their own business.

The college does give great opportunities as far as study abroad.  I don't feel sorry for anyone who claims they can't afford it when they very well can.  There are scholarships, grants, and loans that are quite available to students.  

Half the problems of the college are the college and the other half is created by the students who are too stubborn."
College Junior,2,Car Trouble – The permits costs $50 and students cannot bring cars until their sophomore year. The fines are not too bad and parking space is limited.
College Junior,2,There is no Greek life at Berea College.
College Junior,2,Few Singles and Furnishing for Upperclassman Dorms – There are few well-furnished and study-friendly upperclassman dorms and a few singles.
College Sophomore,2,The student parking lot is too far away for Public Safety to be as strict as they are.
College Sophomore,2,"Needs Improvement – There are two active Public Safety officers at night, and oftentimes you'll see the two officers together. Although I take safety precautions while walking on campus at night, it is pretty scary because of the poor lighting in certain spots. Also, I have heard many complaints about sexual harassment and sexual assault cases that are either never really resolved or swept under the rug. That is something that I feel needs to be improved in order for people to feel more safe."
College Sophomore,2,"Not really an option unless married – There are many apartments in Berea but the problem is that you cannot stay in them unless you are married, have a kid, or you are a fifth-year senior. The school makes you live on campus and there is a pretty strict visitation policy."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Although there is a shuttle, it does not run very often or even often enough. Also, it only goes to Wal-Mart and on Fridays to the theater. I think that if we allocated more jobs toward this, we may be able to fix the problem. Also, public transportation provided by the city is unheard of. I have been attending this college for four years and I was just informed three days ago that there was even an available city bus. The college needs to advertise this more."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Dorms need work – The dorms are in need of renovation. They have slowly renovated one or two but all of them truly need renovation. The freshman dorm halls need the most work out of all. When you visit the college, you get to stay at the Kentucky-Talcott dorm or James Hall or one of the more appealing dorms. However, when you come in as a freshman, your dorm is nothing like what you expected. The college should, at least, improve the freshman dorms so that they enter with a good feeling about adjusting to life in a dorm."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Generally accepting, but big issues – I think the local community that deals with the College is very receptive and helpful to students. Things like the farmers' market, different festivals, etc., love college students. But the community outside of that is still a bit stuck in the 1800s. Racism is rampant in the town of Berea."
College Junior,2,No Alcohol Policy – Alcohol consumption is not allowed because the college is located in a dry county.
Senior,1,"No net connections at all. Not only that, most professors take ""no connections"" as ""excuses"". Some get failed for this."
Alum,1,"It  was horrible. Net connection is sporadic. It's not because of anyone, but the department is incompetent. It usually takes days to get everything back online. But the time, assignments were missed. Despite knowing all this, most professors won't accommodate you. I have seen some people get failed based on this: completely out of their control."
Sophomore,1,"Berea does not offer online learning so I did not have to worry about that. We did, however, get switched to online because of COVID-19. I did not learn anything during that time."
Niche User,1,Worst school ever! We trusted these people with our daughter and several bad experiences took place on campus! Daughter has not been the same since she attended there!
College Junior,1,We have no real greek life recognized by the college.
College Sophomore,1,"Off-campus housing is the worst because they hardly give anyone that privilege. And during the sumner is the worst because it is too expensive to stay on campus, but hardly anyone does a 3month lease."
College Junior,1,Imagine the smallest town you know and then think smaller. We're in the middle of the mountains.
College Sophomore,1,"Many people who find the nice good-looking girl or guy tend to get into a relationship. They have the term "" Berea Goggles"" for a reason. You will not see the girls you see in the movies, at big named colleges, or even your little brother's high school. Most people wear jeans and not many are preppy or even know what it means. Most girls do not want to party or have a good time with other people. Most just find two or three other girls to associate with, and they have dorm parties or just go home on the weekends. "
College Sophomore,1,"Wait what is our mascot?? It is probably a daunting task for a coach to recruit any student-athlete to a school like Berea. I do not see how they landed such good students in the first place. Most students do not even know when sporting events are going to be held. The atmosphere for sports is worse than high school if you went to a decently sized high school. Students at Berea are just not that receptive of sports. Your make up of fans include freshman who want to bring school spirit to campus, and very few upperclassmen. Students have even been seen to study during the games! Its a sad sight. "
College Sophomore,1,"Wait you're doing something other than studying?? That's not right. Berea night life is terrible. A university's Monday is better than a Berea Friday or Saturday. No tailgating, no good after parties, and Berea is a dry town. You have to drive 15-45 minutes to a good spot to party and drink unless you want to throw a party off campus in Berea. The off campus party will probably get shutdown by the police. But not many people at Berea want to have this kind of fun anyway. Most would probably like to play video games, a game of cards, read, get started on that 10 pg paper, or watch Netflix for their Friday night fun."
College Sophomore,1,"Attendance policies suck. At many schools students get around 6 before anything happens, but many teachers at Berea have a 3-day absentee policy. Not all teachers are like this, but many have something similar to this. It is also a bad situation for student-athletes. Berea probably cares more about ""students expressing themselves"" and protesting rather than its sports program. Visitation is not allowed for 1st semester freshman and alcohol is not allowed in the dorms. Creating new student organizations is not that bad, but keep in mind that it cannot discriminate against any one or anything. The school does not have Greek life because they do not want the women separated from the men in clubs, and the founder did not want a caste system to be created where people would be separated from other people. Parking tickets are given out almost everyday, and instead of creating more parking for students, they create more tickets. Anything social created outside of Berea Colleges control is frowned upon. "
College Sophomore,1,"McDonald's and Taco Bell. Fits a college students budget, and also a drunk college students stomach. But these are the two that are open late. Pizza is another option. Most pizza establishments closes after 1am, but it is also another choice. Berea does not have college discounts for these surrounding restaurants. "
College Sophomore,1,Berea has horrible parking. It is sad. Trustees might want to look at spending money on something students need such as....PARKING. You are also not allowed to have a car on campus unless you live so many hours away. Students try to bring their car anyway because its hard to operate under such strict rules.
College Sophomore,1,"This is a tourist town. Old people, churches, and families find themselves infatuated with Berea's campus, but they do not have to live here. They take a few pictures, eat, and leave. As a student, things get pretty old. If you like outdoor activities, you might be slightly interested, but still nothing special. Many colleges have party strips and areas on campus most students can relieve their stress and have a great time, but Berea does not. Students are forced to either have dorm parties or off campus parties, which both get shut down for being too loud. Many stores around the school close early (except for McDonalds and Taco Bell). Berea is a dry town, and this is very unattractive for food chains such as Applebees' (who use their liquor license). There are also no shopping districts. Walmart is the only one, and c'mon... its Walmart. You need to drive at least 15 minutes before reaching any kind of fun."
College Freshman,1,It is a private school is all I gotta say
College Sophomore,1,"There are not many parking spots available as of now. So, there is competition for parking spaces, and not every student are allowed to bring their cars. The parking area for students is also far away, so it is a small walk."
College Sophomore,1,"The freshmen dorms for guys are dirty, for girls is ok. But for both the space is very limited the worst thing of all is the visitation law. The guys can't stay over night in the girls dorm and there is am extremely small chance for you to have a single room."
College Sophomore,1,"There are few restaurants off campus, those within the walking distance are all selling hamburgers and juice and coffee, there is no Chinese restaurants around and sandwiches in the restaurants don't taste good."
College Sophomore,1,It's not just Berea it's all of Kentucky! Our weather is very moody
College Junior,1,Only because there is very little space for parking seeing as freshman you aren't allowed to have a car.
College Freshman,1,Not the Freshmen – Not everyone can have a car on campus. I think that the parking is a bad situation.
College Freshman,1,"Not a party school. Sure, some people drive to different counties and bring back booze and party, but mostly you will always be too busy with academics I promise ;D Maybe twice a month, there will be school dances but they are pretty tame. Don't come here if you are looking for party school"
College Junior,1,"The campus is very overbearing as far as academic and social involvement.  Being put on academic probation is ridiculously easy, as well as getting trouble for parking in an incorrect spot, if even for a couple minutes."
College Junior,1,"Fan Base – You rarely, if ever hear about the activities of sports teams at Berea College.  It's definitely strange to me because basketball was basically the building block of my high school.  Since attending Berea, I've basically had no idea what was going on in the world of Berea sports."
College Junior,1,"Senior Citizen Town – There are plenty of things to do in Berea, if you are a senior citizen.  The town is full of antique and pottery shops which have their own strange, eclectic charm, but really only to appeal to an older generation.  As far as attractions for the college-aged or younger, there are none.  There are fast food restaurants, a Wal-Mart, and a skating rink.  The only good thing about Berea is its proximity to larger cities such as Richmond and Lexington, which have lots of activities for young people."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Public Safety Is Incompetent – I just recently graduated the other day.  Personal experience tells me that they really don't care about student safety. Short term Senior Year in 2010, I had to do work at the music building because that was my labor.  I absentmindedly left my headlights on for two hours.  My battery then died.  I was the only person in the music building and couldn't contact my other friends who had cars.  So I called public safety to see if they could jump start me.  The lady on the phone said that they couldn't because it was against policy.  I replied and asked how they expected me to move the car back to student parking where it should have been parked once my battery was jump started.  They replied to call my friends and they hung up.  I eventually walked to Elizabeth Rogers and a person came down and helped me.  

The timing belt on my car broke Spring my sophomore year in Spring 08.  A friend and I were at A&W and the workers helped us push it to radio shack.  We spent a few hours until the Berea cops came and helped us out and identified the problem and told me to write a note and put it in my car.  He said he'd contact all the other officers doing their routes not to write me a ticket or have my car towed.  He then took my friend and me back to campus.  In Spring of 09 during my junior year, my car over heated after a tornado which had me stranded in Richmond.  I finally got to the McDonalds near Madison Southern and called public safety to see if I could get a ride back to campus.  It was against policy.  McDonalds was of more assistance as they took my phone number, plate number, model, make, and car color and told me they'd keep an eye on it and make sure it wasn't towed.

For a staff called public safety they do a poor job of keep ing their students safe."
College Sophomore,1,"Berea is a dry town. That means no alcohol is sold in Berea. But Richmond is not a dry town. If you have an older friend with a car, you can be very popular. Berea encourages you to do other things than drink. If you just have to do it, well my advice is to do it off campus in a hotel. You can get kicked out of the hotel, but often there really won't be any major consequences."
College Sophomore,1,"Needs to Be More Consistent – At the beginning of the fall semester, there are plenty of shuttle runs. However, as the year progresses, the shuttle runs become very rare."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Too Far for Everyone – Parking on campus can be quite exhausting. It is pretty much too far for everyone. It lessens the entire college experience. I often find people choosing whether or not to go out at night based off of whether or not they want to walk all the way to student parking. Although the lot is big, it's just too far for everyone. Also, it is horribly lit. Some people are scared to go there at night because the lighting is just that bad. One time, my girlfriend's car got vandalized and although it was on tape, the footage on the tape was so poor that you could not make out who or what did it. We need to allow students to also park in front of dorms and behind them. Facilities does not use those spots and the collegium only needs one to two spaces. The experience could be much better."
College Junior,1,"This is a small town with very little to do. If you want to have any kind of fun, you have to drive to neighboring cities."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Rain, rain, wait did I mention rain? It rains a lot. If it is not raining anywhere else, you can be assured it is raining in Berea. It gets really hot during the summer and really cold during the winter."
College Senior,1,"Always and Forever, Visitation – The fact that we even have a visitation policy is bothersome to many, and what the school says are its reasonings behind it seem to contradict some other things. Also, there is no consistency from hall to hall with visitation and how it is enforced.  Some RAs will pursue you if you violate visitation, while others will simply turn a blind eye."
College Junior,1,"It is like a cult. The college appears to be a nice place, but then the college appears to be different upon arrival and it is difficult to leave the college in good standings."
College Junior,1,It Sucks – Simple: it sucks!!!
College Junior,1,"There is not a lot to do in Berea; instead, you will want to leave Berea to go out."
College Sophomore,1,It's Ok I Guess – It's okay.
College Junior,1,"Scrict as HELL – The contract we sign says we can't have sex while a student at this college. On top of that, our visitation hours are from like 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. That's really short and it gets even shorter around the end of the term or near finals."
College Sophomore,1,"Not a Lot of Options – There aren't many place around except Taco Bell, McDonald's, a pizzeria called Papaleno's, and the Cafe."
College Senior,1,Parking Decals and Faraway Lots – The parking lots are miles from your dorm. There needs to be assigned parking for designated dorms. I feel unsafe walking from my car in the far parking lot at night or in the cold winter. The decals prevent you from parking in certain lots and they are pretty expensive as well.
College Senior,1,"Very Little – Berea College was around before cars, so there is limited space for students to have cars. The campus is not made for cars to drive through but primarily for foot traffic. This school has a commitment to being eco-friendly, so I don't think the parking available will likely increase dramatically in the future because of the school wanting to reduce its carbon footprint."

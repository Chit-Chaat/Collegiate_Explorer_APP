Freshman,5,The Maine College of Art is an excellent school. The classes and the teachers are wonderful. The classes are extremely educational and have taught me more about art and the world in one year than I have learned throughout my whole life. The learning process is exciting and everyone is very inclusive and friendly.
Freshman,5,At Maine College of Art I am constantly learning and being challenged. In the classes I am always sucking up new information. I'm always being pushed in my academics. I can go to work on projects whenever I want. You as a student at MECA are allowed 24/7 access to the main building Porteous and others to work on projects. This is big especially when your an art student. I also like the dorms at MECA. The dorms are well taken care of and are all in the vicinity of the main MECA building. They are all helpful people with stuff like financial aid and getting information on majors. I have had great experiences at MECA Inside and outside the classroom. One of the great things about MECA the art displayed around the campus. I always feel inspired walking around at MECA. The food and cafe at MECA is very good also. Always plenty of food to go around. At MECA  first year students are to participate in a final to review all the work that the student has done all semester.
Junior,5,"As a small school it's a very welcoming and friendly community. All the teachers I have had have been knowledgeable, helpful and available."
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman at MECA, and I am surprised at how low the rating is on this site. This school is full of diverse and creative minds. The professors are passionate, the students are hard working, and I have not had a bad experience. I feel as if I am learning so much and discovering myself as an artist. Portland itself is an amazing area to discover myself. I have made new friends and I am already growing as an artist. I love this school with every ounce of me."
Sophomore,5,I  like the people and the community. Portland is a lively and vibrant city perfect for any artists who is craving inspiration. MECA is located right in the center of it all placed by the great tourist spots and perfect for finding hidden gems.
Sophomore,5,I think that the school overall is excellent! I am in the Painting program and am so impressed with my professors. They care about me as a student and encourage me as an artist.
Freshman,5,"The faculty truly care about their students and simply want to watch them succeed in their own field. Because it is small, the students and faculty become a close nit community and work together to create."
Freshman,5,"Being a Freshmen it was a busy year. You do all of your foundations classes for the first two years before actually doing anything for your intended major. Classwork is reasonable, depends on the Professor. For dorm living you are about 50/50. Sometimes you and your roommate(s) could get along or they could ask you to move out then proceed to try to push you out of your room. Heading into the second semester is looking bright.  Your grades depend on how you participate in class and whether or not you care about your grades and classes."
Junior,5,"I've really enjoyed my time at MECA so far. The staff and professors are really helpful. The campus is very  beautiful, along with the city of Portland!"
College Freshman,5,"At first I was unsure about this school, but as I got through the admissions process and learned more, I realized this was the best school for me. Everyone is really helpful and will do their best to help you out if you reach out to them! Classes are fun, the teachers are great and I couldn't have gotten into a better school."
College Freshman,5,"So far, all of the professors I've met are wonderful. I ask a lot of questions, and they are really helpful in answering them. The courses, although at first make me want to pull my hair out, are extremely helpful. The foundation courses force students to think in an entirely new way and I can see my own improvement from project to project. I recently went home and saw my art from senior year of high school that I was once so proud of, and wanted to shove it in the back of the closet. I never imagined I would come so far so fast."
College Freshman,5,"As somebody who's well behaved, I haven't even thought about the fact that these policies exist nor have I heard anyone say anything negative about the policies or enforcement."
Recent Alumnus,5,There are so many great options many of which are privately owned and decently priced. The best part is that it is really hard to pick a bad place.
College Sophomore,5,There's no self entitled professors here and if there are I haven't met them. Very considerate and care about your success. Fashion and textiles major needs to develop more. A lot more. But its in the works.
College Sophomore,5,Very great scholarships. Helps with the cost.
College Sophomore,5,"Very accommodating, and always clean. Library is great to get studying or Art History homework done."
College Sophomore,5,Very accepting. Even has gender neutral housing.
College Freshman,5,"The teachers at MECA are all really fantastic! They usually have interesting assignments, and the boring ones still really help you improve your work. The workload tends to be heavy but if you manage your time well it won't be a problem! I currently have an extra class and an on campus job and I'm keeping up with my work fine (but that leaves me without too much free time)"
College Freshman,5,"New Media at MECA is a really fantastic program. The in major classes are focused on animation and film but you can take classes outside of the major.  Many students within the major like it because its really easy to take it in the direction you want! Some people do experimental film, some do video games, one even did puppets. The major space is brand new and it is fantastic!"
College Sophomore,5,"The facilities are impressive. state of the art digital labs with ridiulous printers, band new wood shop, photo lab, welding studio, some special type of ceramic firing thing that only two schools have... you get the point"
Freshman,4,"Once the Maine College of Art switched their classes online, things changed drastically. It was very sudden and rushed but I know that the teachers and staff have done the best that they could. With the little time to prepare for the switch, it's understandable for there to be some complications. As a first-year going onto my second year, there are a few core classes that I missed out on because there was no simple way to integrate it in our home based studying."
Freshman,4,I am a non traditional student. I was very nervous about starting but everyone has been helpful and friendly. I love my classes and Portland is a great small city.
Freshman,4,"I personally thinks its hard to get along with students here, but the academic portion of the school is very nice"
Freshman,4,I love the diversity here at Maine College of Art. It is such a great enviornment to study and create in. Portland Maine is such a great spot for this school.
Freshman,4,Highly artistic environment and friendly atmosphere set in the gorgeous town of Portland. Be wary of the cold weather since the area is right near water. 24/7 Access to amazing facilities. Ton of class choices to really figure out what you like to do. Since its a art college there isn't really any majoro sports teams or sport events which is a bit of a bummer. Also its in the city so theirs no campus area to stay within. I've Only heard good things about the college and area.
Senior,4,"Very small college that has its pros and cons. Overall I think its a good school, especially in the Arts."
Freshman,4,"Awesome school for diversity in arts, quality of professors.  Cost and the financial aid office is the problem.  Errors, I was left with a HUGE amount due to even begin because they said I was awarded something then they took it away. I may have to quit after the first semester. Art is my life and this crushes me"
College Senior,4,"Maine College of Art is constantly expanding and strengthening its faculty. Thus far, I have enjoyed basically every professor. MECA is on a first name basis with students and teachers, allowing the atmosphere to be friendly and mutual. As far as courses go, I love the majority of required courses and have learned so much from them. Elective type courses are almost like I'm not even in school. Getting to use the art studio spaces and unlimited tools and supplies has helped me so much as an artist and individual."
College Senior,4,"MECA is equipped with a service called Artists at Work. It's a student and alumni center offering a constant job board of local and international internships and grants. If you are ever worried about getting hired for the summer or after graduation, they are the people to see! Other than that, I think my school is really encouraging and has enough to get you motivated to work within the real world. It just takes a determined student to do so."
College Senior,4,"I think the dorm environment at my school is very nice. Whether you are located in a single, double, or apartment style dormitory, you are given a clean, warm home to reside in! Plus, the RA's are always very polite and Residency officials are really flexible with whom you live with."
College Senior,4,"For a small, unique college Maine College of Art really stands out to me. Each department does its best to serve every student with experience, knowledge, and support. Each year I climb I am always anticipating things to become more stressful, but I seem to be proving myself otherwise. I can only see positive changes within my education at Maine College of Art! As I look back, I am so grateful that my first three years of college were as helpful as they were, and I can certainly say that I learn something new everyday."
College Sophomore,4,"Much of the population is LGBTQ. Most students are not religious, but some are. Most students are liberal. There is a lot of diversity in economic background. Most of the school is White."
College Sophomore,4,"There are constant emails about usage. Only one dorm building is allowed to have alcohol. RA's are strict about smoking in the dorms. The school does not permit smoking on campus. Nobody cares if you do or don't drink or smoke, everyone minds their business unless they think it's a safety issue."
College Sophomore,4,There are a good amount of electives to choose from. The professors are all highly skilled in what they teach. The classes are small and the professors know everyone by name.
College Sophomore,4,"You must sign in and out after hours. There is always a security guard at the front desk since you have studio access 24/7. You get campus safety alerts sent to your phone and e-mail, as well as alerts about what is going on in Portland. It is easy to get hold of someone when you feel unsafe, there is always somebody on duty to help with personal emergencies as well."
College Sophomore,4,The percentage of MECA students who work in art careers is higher than the national average. Advisors and professors work hard in helping you get into internships and residencies. Each student has a mentor of their choosing that will help them work toward their career goals.
College Sophomore,4,"MECA is very small and the community is great. It's in the heart of the art's district in Portland, Maine. The professors know everybody in their department and become fast friends and mentors with their students. They are very supportive and encouraging."
College Sophomore,4,Maine College of Art has given me a place to be accepted and most of all be my self. This is a place the wants you to strive to be who you are and always gives you that opportunity.
College Sophomore,4,"Apartments in Portland are everywhere -- especially on Congress St, which is convenient. I live with friends of the family in the next town over, and they drop me off at school every morning."
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of variety, good quality food and wonderful service at every place we've visited. Many of the restaurants have student discounts available that make it affordable to grab something to eat."
College Sophomore,4,"The financial aid department is always helpful with answering questions and assisting in finding additional scholarships to apply for. The school doesn't have an excess amount of funds, so outside scholarships really help."
College Freshman,4,"Being an international student, I needed quite the amount of scholarship to cover my educational expenses, and the process went smoothly and they were really considerate of my situation. If you need more money, ASK THEM. They'll understand and help you out to the best of their abilities!!"
College Freshman,4,I love the fact that you're allowed to live in an apartment-style residence hall in your first year of college. It's pretty cheap when compared to other universities. They're spacious and well-lit!
College Freshman,4,"I live off campus and I've had people ask me how far the commute is. I laugh, because I'm closer than one of the dorms. The low cost places can be a little bit sketchy but in the long run, I've saved money from living off campus. The only con is not having a meal plan and that adding it gets a bit expensive."
College Freshman,4,"There's a decent number of options. As a vegetarian, in most towns I feel extremely limited. (Meat-eaters don't realize how much of it they're actually eating, apparently.) Here, there's at least one strictly vegetarian/vegan restaurant and a lot of places offer separate menus so that I don't have to weed through everything."
College Freshman,4,"I feel like everybody has issues with the FAFSA. There's just so much. Being a small school, I wonder if there could be some assistance offered. But then again, I wonder if anybody would take advantage of it . . ."
Recent Alumnus,4,The rooms are large and comfortable and you will never need to share a bathroom with more than three other people.
Recent Alumnus,4,Its a big city with a small town feel.
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy it here. The classes are nice and small and your known by your name not a number. Your teachers will approach you if your falling behind to see what's up. Very caring and considering of your future. The social life could be a bit better, but in the end your not there to party 24/7. Very rigorous program, usually up well past 12 doing homework. Could use some more housing due to an increase in students, and defiantly needs a gym. Really wish the fashion and textiles major was more developed, and had more teachers. But granted it is a brand new major. Besides all the tiny cons its a great school."
College Sophomore,4,"The school and housing buildings are very safe. When walking home at late hours you do get the occasional crazy person talking to himself/herself on the street, but they usually don't bother you. Homeless individuals are actually very nice most of the time. I usually give them my left over food from restaurants. Overall I feel safe."
College Sophomore,4,"Loved getting an apartment my freshman year, which is usually uncommon in other colleges. A little outdated, but it gives character. Bathroom and Kitchen could use some TLC."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Not sure, I was only there during the summer when BFAs were not present."
Recent Alumnus,4,They seemed up to date and functional
Recent Alumnus,4,"There is a guard stationed at the front desk at all hours. Doors lock after hours, students have keys to enter and must sign in at front desk.  It is quite safe."
Recent Alumnus,4,"It was easy to get the financial aid I needed.  Although, I have some serious issues with how inflated the cost of education has become.  Be frugal, only borrow what you absolutely need."
Recent Alumnus,4,Since I am a MFA student here I am only on campus for two months during the summer.   But I get the impression that there is diversity of all kinds.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I am a grad student so the curriculum is totally different than the undergrad.  The low residency program is really great for me.  I find it a realistic model for developing a studio practice that meshes with your other responsibilities such as, work and family."
Recent Alumnus,4,A lot of bars and quite a few places to see live music.
Recent Alumnus,4,Portland is a great city for artistic adventures.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of labs at MECA but the wifi in the dorms is always a problem and the printers at the school aren't reliable.
College Freshman,4,The Amtrack station is only a bus ride or taxi away. Trains are very inexpensive.
College Freshman,4,Off Campus housing is very affordable in portland.
College Freshman,4,Because MECA is a private school they give out a lot of money which is very helpful.
College Freshman,4,People here are really respectful to people who do not take part in the consumption of drugs. There is very little peer pressure. A lot of kids do use hard drugs though and even more drink and smoke.
College Freshman,4,There are plenty of students living off campus and quite a few nearby options.
College Freshman,4,"There are both normal suite style dorms on campus and apartments. The Oak dorms are suite style and house the most students. Here there is a great community feeling and there is a nice lobby and video game lounge. I live Shepley, which is an apartment building containing double and quad apartments. The building is older but the spaces are really nice. The quad apartment has 2 bedrooms, a living room, a small bathroom with a tub and shower, and a small kitchen with a fridge, stove, and a lot of cabinet space. There's also the Miles Standish apartments and those have 1 bedroom, a nicely sized living room, and a bathroom and kitchen similar to Shepley's. All of the buildings are within a block of the school"
College Freshman,4,I work in student engagement and we run several events every week in addition to the events that the RAs run in the resident halls. There's almost always something to do!
College Freshman,4,"Being in the middle of downtown there is occasionally a crime near the school, but students rarely have problems with the Portlanders or other students."
College Freshman,4,Not very many people do drugs or drink. I've never encountered any peer pressure and don't know anyone who has.
College Freshman,4,"I commute so I do not live on campus or experience much of the dorm life, but it seems that everything is lively and exciting and that everyone enjoys their time."
College Freshman,4,"I am constantly told that Portland is one of the most affordable cities. Many students who go to my school live off campus in apartments, I plan on looking for somewhere off campus to live next year."
College Sophomore,4,"The meal plan at Maine college of Art is excellent. There are tons of daily vegetarian/vegan options and ethnic foods. The coffee bar is always available and the staff is great. 
There are dozens of restaurants around Maine college of art, too."
College Sophomore,4,"Portland has an endless amount of thrft shops, used book stores, galleies, coffeeshops, restaurants and bars.  There are also extremely cheap ferries to the Casco Bay islands."
College Freshman,4,"Home Like Atmosphere – I have just started at MECA but I felt completly welcomed from day one. The staff is friendly and the students are just like family. Everyone helps out everyone and at the end of the day game night by the TV is not unheard of. Overall, I enjoy MECA and hope AI can afford to stay all 4 years!"
College Sophomore,4,"Lot's to Do – There is almost always something going on whether it's with the school a city function or adventuring on your own you wont be bored if you have an imagination. The school hosts functions through out the week and especially on weekends with the R.A.'s and big events for special days through out the year. If nothings happening with them, then go out side. You will most likely find a local venue is having a concert, there is a play/performance going on, and there is always the first friday art walk which is held every month where venders sell and trade art and crafts. If none of that tickles your fancy then you could go to a local park, check out the beach, get some awesome food, or just sit in the park. And dont forget the museums!"
College Sophomore,4,"It's Pretty Sweet – Portland is pretty fun, even though i'm not a city girl. MECA is awesome and i have so much fun there. It's tough and i get supper tired sometimes but it's cool when everyone else knows exactly what your going through. You have to stay on your school work but if you can balance it having a fun social life with great people is easy."
College Sophomore,4,"People Are Pretty Chill – The guys are attractive the girls are attractive, most of the people there are really awesome, down to earth and fun to be around. However some people are still stuck in high school and are dramatic and somewhat childish."
College Sophomore,4,"Small Community – We have about 300 students and a lot of one on one time with teachers. 24/7 access to school facilities, and each junior and senior has their own studio space."
College Sophomore,4,"The computer labs at Maine College of Art are open 24 hours for student use so there is always access. The library is also a great place to go if you need to do research or use the computer. During finals week at the end of the term, the lab can definitely get a bit crowded. Having your own computer is beneficial, but you could survive without a laptop."
College Freshman,4,"Cheap and Delicious – There are many affordable and yummy places to eat all around Portland. Wild Burritos has just about the best pulled pork you can get, and places like Otto's, Binga's, Five Guys, and Simple Sandwich have decent hours so you can get a good late-night meal."
Sophomore,2,"This school could be a lot better, but this is probably due to the way that they allocate the funding to the various departments. Besides that, faculty is severely understaffed and they are trying to lower their acceptance rate but that is not going to raise the quality of education. Certain faculty have a particular agenda throughout their teaching and the fine art idealism is what dictates a lot of how instructors run the show. If you are coming here to learn real design skills and real world techniques that are relevant today, this school is not for you. Also, as a minority, there is low diversity, and high diversity in LGBTQI, not in race or creed. The school attempts to make up for this but even in things like student life this is underdeveloped and biased."
College Freshman,2,"I enjoyed the people I met and the professors, but the art department was not strong enough for me."
Recent Alumnus,2,It is near impossible to get a straight answer and the different departments don't talk to each others.
College Sophomore,2,"There's a running club but if your not into running there's nothing else as far as sports go. Really wish we had a gym at school. Granted we get discounts at YMCA, but you still have to pay monthly. A lot of other colleges have gyms for free, so it kind of stinks that we don't have one."
College Freshman,2,The RAs here let bad things slide like people staying in the dorms when they're not supposed to but are very aware of how you're doing in school and sometimes they check in on you.
College Freshman,2,There is a guard at the front desk of the building and the doors are locked at night. At the dorms there is limited security and no guard or front desk. Someone could easily walk in. There is no health department at MECA. They have some therapists here but they are very unapproachable.
College Freshman,2,The photography department is lacking in equipment and inspiration. The teachers are talented photographers but don't make the best teachers. There is also a very distinct Meca style and if you don't fit into that style it is harder to succeed.
College Freshman,2,There are no parking lots available for free for students of MECA. Since it is in the middle of the city I am forced to pay for parking in local parking garages.
College Sophomore,2,"So, finding a way to get somewhere in portland is easy. We have the metro which has pretty good hours and is affordable, however it is almost packed. And the people you find or meet on the bus are usually crazy people, homeless people, or creepers. There is also lots of different cab companies. This is very expensive and i dont recommend this as an everyday means of transportation. Plus half the cab drivers are creeps and you never know who is going to be sitting behind the wheel."
College Sophomore,2,"Living in a City – Given the fact that Maine college of Art is located in the heart of a city (Portland) There isn't an available parking lot, and you probably wont find a close spot unless you want to run to the meter every 2 hrs. However, there are other options such as getting a parking pass that allows you to park in certain areas for free, and there are plenty of public parking lots but that can get expensive...honestly, if you are going to live in an apartment or in the dorm you don't even need a car."
College Freshman,2,The school officials and RAs are really strict with their policies. You don't want to get caught doing anything that isn't allowed or you'll be in some serious trouble.
College Freshman,2,"Smoke Weed Everyday – Although my ""crowd"" isn't into doing drugs, I know that quite a few people do. You can bet that when a lot of students get out of class for the day, they're going to go smoke a bowl, but they're not into pressuring people to do drugs, so that's a plus."
College Junior,2,"Dont Bother With a Car – Cars are not needed, and finding and paying for parking is extremely difficult as it is right downtown in the busiest area of town. Also Portland loves ticketing and towing so it tends to be super expensive"
College Freshman,2,"Cold and Bitter – The school isn't far from the dorms so it's not a far walk but since we are so close to the water, it does get very cold and bitter. I've lived in Maine my whole life and have never experienced such windy weather."
Alum,1,Expensive.  Just don’t do it.  As an artist you should go to business school to learn business skills in order to market yourself.  If you are such a great artist you should not really need art school.  Still digging myself out of the debt from this school.  There are so many better options.  As a former graduate I beg you not to waste your money or time!  A lot of the classes were a freakin joke and there are nearly no extracurricular activities.  Go in state. Don’t go private.  I have no idea where they get off charging so much money.  Seven years later and I’m still fuming at the thought of this place.
College Freshman,1,"Out of all the programs on campus, public safety is one of the main places people should feel safe going but that is not the case. There is a racism problem within public safety that needs to be fixed."
Recent Alumnus,1,There are only two things to participate in: the running club and the indoor soccer club and neither of which are part of a league. There is also no student center or gym.
College Freshman,1,"It's a city so having a car isn't necessary but if you do have a car it is a hassle. There are never any parking spots, the snow gets in the way, and parking tickets are expensive."
College Freshman,1,"There are no varsity sports at my school, but their are ski clubs and running clubs and intramural soccer team"
College Sophomore,1,"The thing about this school is that its very small, and it is in the heart of the city so if you want to attend you pretty much have to live in the city. There are no transportation options that are specific to Maine college of art, but there is public transportation. The public transit(bus) it is not free for Students attending MECA but it is only one dollar and there is a stop right in front of and accross the street from MECA, there are multiple other stops only a couple of blocks away. The only other options are cabs."
College Freshman,1,"Leave the Car at Home – MECA has absolutely no on-campus parking. I go home each weekend so I bring my car for the week, and finding a parking place sucks. There's an alley by the Holiday Inn that has free parking but other than that you have to pay for a spot in the parking garage or move your car every two hours."
College Freshman,1,"School of Potheads – It's expected at art school that more than three-quarters of the people you know are going to get high after class. You're respected if you don't smoke, though. There isn't a big drinking scene in the dorms because the RA's are very strict. The Old Port is great for students that are 21+ though."

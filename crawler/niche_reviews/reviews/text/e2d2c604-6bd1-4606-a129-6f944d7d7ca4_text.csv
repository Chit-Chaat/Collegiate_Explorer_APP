Sophomore,4,"My high school GPA was very low, and Beacon was the only school I was able to get into. Originally I was only planning to go for a few semesters and then transfer, but I’ve connected really well with the faculty here and am now planning on staying for the full 4 years.
My main criticism would be that the staff tends to infantilize the students. The freshman classes are a joke, assignments are graded super leniently, and the assignments themselves are not challenging at all."
Senior,4,i really like Beacon College. My grades have been excellent. I have so much more confidence in myself. The school i know is working on the internal side of the college. focusing on the mental health and wellness of the students. i would like to see more pride in the school and unity.
Freshman,4,"Good relationship with professors with small classroom settings that is ideal for my personal college experience. I only wish their were more shops/eateries around in the local area that is easily accessible to students. Campus life is very nice especially since it is only made up of apartment complexes compared to traditional dorms. It does add a lot more personality to the living style as not many other colleges obtain apartment complexes. The food is pretty good with a decent selection to choose from in a small cafeteria but i only wish they stayed open later with more flexible hours during the day. Recreation is pretty decent with a gym very close to one of the complexes available during the day with very flexible hours. Student center is a nice place to hang with friends or do some work as i use it the most for playing pool with friends. Overall, i do think it is a good fit for me especially since i personally have a disability being ADD."
Freshman,4,They help with my special disabilities and is a great place to go to school. Books weren't expensive! Great place
Freshman,4,"I am quite satisfied with Beacon College, for the most part. The professors are generally understanding of my processing disorder and take time to explain the directions to me in depth, instead of just giving me the assignment with no explanation."
Sophomore,4,Beacon College is a great school for people who have learning disabilities. This school offers great help especially when it comes to academic work. The classes are fairly easy and each classroom has about 15 or less people which in my opinion makes it easier to learn. 
College Freshman,4,I enjoy all the different that are offered. The teachers are also very helpful to all students. I think it is very helpful that it s a small school as well.
College Freshman,4,The schools policies academic and social are design to develop and support the total student body
College Freshman,4,"Most of the housing on campus or like apartment complex. With full kitchen, washers and dryers in each apartment."
College Junior,4,The weather is really nice in Central Florida.
College Freshman,4,"Mhmmm i have to say I love the weather here for a long time only been here for a year its warm and hot a  at times bipolar.  But just as people grow tired of long winters-you can just as easily grow tired of a 10 MONTH SUMMER year after that I dont beacuse I love to wear my fresh sneaker from j""s, nike, foams, dunks, Lebron, KD, Kobesss man thry be looking like  Holy grails #Yolo"
College Junior,4,"Beacon College is only a couple minutes from Wal-mart and several restaurants.  Also Beacon is about hour and forty minutes to Walt Disney World, Universal, and Sea World.  Leesburg is between Orlando and Ocala there is a lot of things to do.  Also Leesburg has a nice mall that I go occasionally.  If anything happens, there is a hospital down the street.  Behind the school is the Police Station.  If your a church goer there is a lot of churches near by walking distance or driving."
College Freshman,4,Individual assistance is always available when needed. This is a small college.
College Junior,4,Registration is done one semester in advance.which is good.
College Junior,4,Our college is small and individualized attention is always available from our instructors.
College Freshman,4,"So far my experience at Beacon College has been wonderful.  I have learned a ton in my classes, met some great friends, and enjoyed living on campus."
College Freshman,4,Beacon College is wonderfully interactive.  The campus has everything from yoga to performance groups to lectures to study abroad programs.
College Junior,2,The Beacon College apartments aren't really great.  Things tend to fall apart and if you need something fix it takes several weeks for someone to fix it.  The apartments are all spread apart and both at different ends of town.  The cost is to expensive.  The social atmosphere is alright but the parties and stuff our at the other apartments and the apartments that i live in are always left out.  Whenever you need an R.A. you rarely ever get one to come or they will come two hours later.
College Junior,2,there are little choices that are healthy in the dining area. we can only use are meal plans for the food at the school.
College Junior,2,I recieved a fair amout of money but i wish that ther were more options for shcolorships
Sophomore,1,It was so awful. During COVID 3/5 of my teachers just stopped teaching. We’d get a 20-min long assignment every couple of weeks and that would be it. I probably did a total of three hours of schoolwork in the two months of quarantine and got a 4.00 average for the semester.
College Junior,1,The buses look new but they only run on the weekdays and go to  certain places.
College Junior,1,I am having roommate problems and nothing is getting solved.
College Junior,1,"There is no sports at Beacon.  There use to be.  There is talk to bring sports back, but i doubt that will happen."
College Junior,1,"I have received a good amount of Financial aid, but in Beacon College nobody likes to communicate with you.  For my experience, Beacon doesn't give you the right dates when you need to apply for aid or if you need to get on a payment plan they don't tell you when you need to start that until you found out in starts in May when you're in the month of July.  The Financial Aid at Beacon isn't worth it, and work-study is horrible. The process here at Beacon is really bad."

Alum,5,"I LOVE my HBCU!!!!! Has a GREAT CJ Department. We just got a new president so the school is going through a lot of renovations and change. The dorm SUCK but i'm pretty sure they are about to fix those up. The cafeteria has its good day and that's on  tuesday's, but sometimes that can be a hit or miss too."
Alum,5,Wiley is a good school. It has an amazing atmosphere and the school is very welcoming to everyone who steps foot on campus.
Junior,5,I love that Wiley College is a HBCU and very diverse. Wiley College has so much history that needs to be shared and in order to do that we need more advocates willing to talk about Wiley college and HBCU .
Alum,5,"Although it is a small school, the history and culture at Wiley is unmatched. I love that faculty and staff here treat you like family, and professors are always willing to help you no matter the problem."

Sophomore,5,"I love how small Wiley is, which means you can connect and talk with your teachers more. Working with your teachers one on one is great you’ll learn more."
Junior,5,"The college is very small and close-knit so you get a family vibe here. The classes are never too large, you won't have a class over fifty people and the professors do a great job teaching the material. Wiley College is the place where every student can succeed so it's impossible to fail!"
Niche User,5,Well I only went for a week but looking to go back but so far it was a whole different scenarist you would enjoy yourself . I left for family matter reason only but I’m really looking for my gray experience.

College Junior,5,The party scene on campus is beautiful because all the students come out and interact with each other and get to know each other without violence taking place.
College Junior,5,We don't have a nightlife too much at Wiley College other than the campus parties or off campus parties that are thrown by the students on weekends and a 24 hour Walmart.
College Junior,5,Academics that are offered are very top of the line academics and I feel like our professors should get a raise and the recognition that they deserve for challenging the students body academically day in and day out.
College Junior,5,"I love the fact that Wiley College is very diverse and Wiley as a whole accept everyone no matter their race, religion, sexual orientation or political beliefs."
College Junior,5,Wiley as a whole is the best but the criminal justice department at Wiley College is great. The material we use in these classes are great and we are very hands on in this department.
College Junior,5,Job/Internships at Wiley College is great I had the opportunity of doing my internship at a juvenile detention center and it was a great experience and made me value the career path I choose as a criminal justice major.
Recent Alumnus,5,I have known several people that have graduated from Wiley and now are successful.
Recent Alumnus,5,Class size is small and professors are very intelligent.
Recent Alumnus,5,I would choose Wiley again due to the program arranged the classes in order that needs to be taken. It's less worry and hassle and I'm enjoying the program and the school.

College Junior,5,It is the best way of staying
Recent Alumnus,5,Our basketball teams are the absolute best. There is never a dull moment with either teams
Recent Alumnus,5,School is all that you out into it. The professors teach everything you need to know and more. If you are willing to learn than they will be willing to teach...don't waste you money if you don't want to learn
College Freshman,5,My experience was great. The professor was very hands on. Making sure we/I understood everything. The teachers really work with you if you're trying to help yourself.
College Junior,5,"My academics the only reason why I have stayed on this campus. My major is Business Administration with a concentration in Hospitality and Tourism. I am the President for National Society in Minorities in Hospitality for the 2014-2015. This role has opened me up into being able to come more out of my shell as I have been. The unique aspects about being a hospitality student is that you get to enjoy what it is that you will pursue after college and still get paid. The work load is very time consuming and I am thankful for it because I came here to get an education and that is my main goal. Facilities, however need an upgrade as it relates to a rigorous curriculum with appreciative faculty and staff. However, Internships and job opportunities are scarce here in Marshall, TX."
College Freshman,5,Greek life is like another family to be apart of.
College Freshman,5,"it is a great experience, everyone is so friendly."
College Freshman,5,the school spirit could be worked on.

College Junior,5,Student life is wonderful always a helping hand. They also give us a chance to interact with the alums from back in the day it's a great opportunity to see what the college looked like back in the day. Always a place to clear your head and study for finals or a test and midterms.
College Sophomore,5,"I love my HBCU , we are the oldest A- accredited college west of the Mississippi "
College Sophomore,5,"Campus life is the best , to experience a historical black college in its entirety makes me love my school even more"
College Freshman,5,Greek life brings life to the campus and student body.
College Senior,5,"Even though I have always lived in a big city, having a rest from road trafficand long distances to go places is a relief. "
College Senior,5,"Being a Computer Information System major is great, having in mind that our world is all about technology now, imagine the future. Like I mentioned before, some teachers do not really have the enthusiasm to pass their students their knowledge, instead, they just rush through chapters. 
When talking about jobs, everywhere is needed a person with technology/computer knowledge, especially in businesses to keep up with their customer loyalty because when one company has a competitive advantage over other one, customers notice and they might change a business preference because they have a better system that some other one. 
It will be nice to know that you are helping society or at least the business market, to step up to the next level with technology advancement. "
College Senior,5,"College is another step in life, so the place doesn't matter, what matters is the education you obtained and the experience you lived through those years in college. "
College Senior,5,"There is no bad thing about parking, there is plenty of space. There are handicap parking spaces as well, but way to many.  "
College Sophomore,5,Going to Wiley college with it being a HBCU is good for anyone because it's not like big colleges or unversites u won't just be a number in your classes the professors are very helpful with any answer.. It's hard to really fail out of Wiley college unless u just don't go to class
College Sophomore,5,When we have parties they are great and well secured.
College Junior,5,"I have enjoyed my academic college career. I am a double major and I have had some very intense classes, but my professors worked with me and allowed me to become a better student. I love that I have gained so much knowledge in the last 3 years then I have ever learned in my life. I have been on the presidents list the last 2 years. I know that anything is possible if you try in class, participate, and actually put forth effort. My instructors care so much and there dedication shows but the time that they dedicate to the school and the students."
College Junior,5,"I attend Wiley College, Although it is a small school it has allowed me the personal connection with my professors that I need in order to really understand my major and it also allows me to receive experiences that a large school would not provide. The ability to talk to my professor has helped me become the successful student I am today. Also the environment is very open and the people are very supportive when it involves someones goals, dreams, or aspirations."
College Junior,5,"Wiley College is a very diverse school. And it is awesome to interact with different race, and cultures."
College Sophomore,5,The weather is so bipolar. One Day it can be so Hot and the next so cold. It reminds me of the Desert sometimes
College Sophomore,5,Need for a Car – Here at wiley you need a car. Especially if you don'y stay on campus. Your car is everything!
College Sophomore,5,"Days Inn – I don't stay on campus due to the overload ammount of students here so they moved us off campus to Days Inn. Now Days Inn is pretty nice! they pair us in 2 to 1 room, and we get free room service its so wonderful. Hey God is good!"
College Freshman,5,"your going to need a car you staying on campus, because if you don't your going to be messed up because a bus runs but its hard to catch and you don't want to pay anyone gas money to take you to walmart"
Sophomore,4,I like that family aspect of being at an HBCU. As well the student to professor ratio is very good which it easier to learn.
Sophomore,4,Wiley college is a diverse place alone the Faculty and professors are eager to help you learn and grow. Wiley college is a very stimulating place to be for growth determination and success. I take upon tending a while while he coll faculty and professors are eager to help you learn and grow. Wiley college is a very stimulating place to be for growth determination and Success.Upon attending Wiley college I have grown and learned and head very wonderful experience in many subjects.
College Junior,4,Sports are a big deal for the student athletes. Our school has won many championships. We are not the best in Our conference in everything but we sure do try. Some sports have more support than others but the administration and athletic directors try to real in more fans and attendence. Our school lacks school spirit but regardless our teams get their jobs done to their best abilities.
College Junior,4,the safety on Wiley campus is outstanding the security guards do the best they can do to protect us and they are doing an outstanding job.
College Junior,4,I would choose this school again because the teachers are very hands on with the students and our staff really cares about us and our plans after Wiley College.
College Junior,4,"Athletics at Wiley College is simply great. Wiley College has great team spirit, great school spirit and rally around great causes."
College Junior,4,Students on campus are very religious. This is a religious based school.
College Junior,4,I love Wiley College. The teachers are super nice and helpful.
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus was an awesome experience for me. Going in as a freshman I met so many different people. People from around the world including Trinidad and Kenya, and even Mexico. It wasn't the cheapest, but I did enjoy being close with people on campus. The building was build a little difficult. You couldn't have T-moble because the service is bad. The wifi on campus works about fifty percent of the time. It was hard to do online work or to even look online for our assignments for class. Even with all those complaints the campus life was still a great experience. I enjoyed every last bit of it."
College Junior,4,Wiley offers a lot come join us you would be happy
College Junior,4,"They treat you if were their child.  They really look out for you, they are strict but far too"
College Junior,4,Its good for the most part
Recent Alumnus,4,Doing financial aid is always a hassle. Everyone wants their money and or scholarship. Make sure you have done you homework before showing up
Recent Alumnus,4,Hanging in the STUDENT UNION or in the residential dorms is always fun. There is always someone playing music or having a game night
Recent Alumnus,4,There is someone on campus for everyone. You will date at least one person through your four years
Recent Alumnus,4,I was happy because they had Criminal Justice. But they could expand on their majors
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's southern cooking at its best!!! Not much of ""healthy"" food but if you want good BBQ or fried catfish than Marshall is the place for you"
College Freshman,4,I received a scholarship and some of my education was paid for. But still need more schaeship to help out with other educational things.
College Freshman,4,The teachers really care about the students.  Education is left up to the individual to succeed. I try everyday but I can not speak for everyone else.
College Freshman,4,The guys to girls ratio at my school is great. I'm a guy and i rather more girls so that's why i say its great.
College Junior,4,"I have have heard it to be great as many of my fellow classmates have ditched this on campus housing.I would leave too if I could afford the expenses. However, I would not try it though because I do not want to work and go to school too since my major is a full time job."
College Junior,4,"The academics at this college is awesome, however, this university must change its mission statement in order to achieve the level of success needed here at this university. Out of a total of 1389 students, last semester 311 students were recommended for honors. Again, the social scene is more of a concern by students than academics. Therefore, opinion wise, academics offered are great, but what are academics when students are not motivated to learn.  However, professors give 120% to their students education. It is up to the student to do the work rather than lying and excusing their behavior as it relates to prioritizing. The curriculum for my major is designed to get me out here in the next year. the workload is rigorous with time consumption as special study options relates to current events affecting the world. Popular study areas is room or the library quiet room areas."
College Freshman,4,"great dorms to stay in, loving the experience here"
College Freshman,4,the security officers are great at their job.
College Junior,4,MAKE SURE HAVE YOU HAVE YOUR AID DONE IN TIME
College Junior,4,Well the dorms is old but they do have a brand new dorm for upper classes men. The campus is fun there is always something to do. Come join us you would love it.
College Senior,4,"I have enjoyed all of my professors, very helpful"
College Senior,4,We have a great diversity of students
College Senior,4,Enjoy all classes for my major
College Senior,4,Always for the studies at hand.
College Senior,4,The dining is great and a good menu.
College Junior,4,Like I said it's great opportunities at my college different interns you can sign up for. As far as scholarship banquets and student leadership retreats  teaching the student how important it is to be a leader before and after graduation. Campus life and social is good.
College Junior,4,The campus life is great. The dorms are nice and neat clean and very safe
College Junior,4,Safety plays a big part on my campus. Security and the local police are always on alert to handle any and every problem.
College Junior,4,Something's we can and can't do to have fun but we always turn a bad thing to a good on and make sure it's safe and approve through the board.
College Junior,4,We have a couple of schools that's in our area or hours away the interaction with them or good we always down for the parties and social life.  Safety is a big part on our campus the surcuity are always there to help with any problem to make them better.
College Junior,4,Everyone is different like I said we have people from everywhere. They dress different and talk different no one is hood with the things they do around campus. The relationship life is good nobody business every couple is happy. The social life is great on campus the students are all approachable.
College Junior,4,Wiley College is all love no one is treated different as for me I am a proud Lesbian and I have never been treated in a wrongful way. We have people from all over the world to come get an education at Wiley yes they're different and talk different but in Wiley eyes everyone is human and there for a purpose. Wiley is a Methodist school but we also have other religions at first it was different cause I'm baptist but as the years went on it's all the same in certain areas. As far as political beliefs everyone has their own beliefs no one is disrespected.
College Junior,4,I am part of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority Inc (Greek) and also Gamma Elite Community Service Sisterhood (Non-Greek) so as of being apart of both Organizations everyone gets the same respect. There are no Greek housing.  Everyone love the Greeks and have respect the social atmosphere is great the Greeks are always apart of helping out around campus and speaking to the students and outside community.
College Junior,4,The athletics sports on Wiley College campus are a big part of the college. School spirit if heavy from the facilities and staff and alumni are alway there to support! I feel like they get very good students to be apart of a great school and also who can be their best effort in what they love to do.
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe and the nurses are very helpful.
College Sophomore,4,I don't travel long distances.
College Sophomore,4,Im home. So im used to dining at these local diners. I even showed a few students about a family owned diner and they love it.
College Sophomore,4,The strictness is fair. I have no complaints. Drugs and drinking should not take plavce on a campus. We don't have a curfew.
College Sophomore,4,"The Waffle House , IHOP , and subway are a few places I like to enjoy"
College Sophomore,4,The town of Marshall is a great place to experience away from home 
College Sophomore,4,It is very safe to live off campus near our school 
College Freshman,4,Crinimal justice is a excellent major and the degree is attainable. 
College Freshman,4,There is plenty of student support tutorials offered.
College Senior,4,"The good thing is that you might run into someone you know, the bad is that we get bored of the same places and we just opt to organize reunions at my apartment. "
College Senior,4,"Major at school are good, great variety, but maybe some teachers should change their teaching techniques or ideas because reading, lecturing and just following a textbook will not really make us learn, or think outside of the box."
College Senior,4,There are a bunch of academic programs to choose from. 
College Sophomore,4,I really like this college because my proffesors are helping me to learn english   and be a better person every day.! they care about my progress and i am so thankfull to be in a place where theiy help people with language barriers
College Sophomore,4,Not really sure about the other majors but Criminal Justice has a very good program that's also helpful before graduation and after
College Sophomore,4,The advisors are very helpful and make sure that everyone get a fair chance of getting jobs and internships
College Junior,4,"Wiley College is a open admission school and getting accepted is never an issue, it is the staying in school people seem to have a problem with."
College Senior,4,Most of the teachers at Wiley really want to see students succeed so they help in as many ways as they can.
College Sophomore,4,We have police on campus at all times. So I feel very safe to know nothing will happen to me while Im at school.
College Junior,4,Academically Wiley College is the ultimate place to be. EVERY professor is more than willing to work with each and every student. There is never a student left behind. Wiley College has recently opened the Haywood L. Strickland living learning center and are in the process of rebuilding our student union. Wiley College is the FIRST HBCU (historically black colleges and universities) west of the Mississippi. This prestigious institution provides every student with a n opportunity to be involved on campus and throughout the community. Wiley College is the place to be!
College Sophomore,4,"I gave my school an A , because we are family oriented we love one another, and it shows. Even though we do not have a fancy student union 
we still come together in different buildings as one to enjoy planned events. Also if someone sees you stuggling we help that person if they want help. The teachers show that they care and you are not just a number to them, you a adult that wants to better their situation. I love My HBCU."
Senior,2,The bar they set for covid online classes are not realistic. To log in for a class 3 to 4 times a day is not reasonable
Alum,2,I lived on campus so they would not let me take any online classes. The only time I was able to take an online class was when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the transition. I give credit to the professors who were able to adjust accordingly.
Senior,2,"I like Wiley College because it is a historically black college/university (HBCU)  college. I like Wiley College have a mission that committees to the principle of educational access, the College serves traditional and non-traditional students from diverse backgrounds who have expressed a desire and potential for learning in a Christian environment. Also it a lot of history into old Wiley dear. For example, Wiley College opened its doors just south of Marshall with two frame buildings and an overwhelming desire to succeed in a climate fraught with racism and Jim Crow laws. Wiley College became the first Black college west of the Mississippi River. I like it because it a small population and school because I love one on one learning. I think Wiley need to work on many things like professionalism, housing conditions, cafeteria food, scholarships, and informing students more about things on campus."
Senior,2,The thing I liked most about the school is that the professor are really helpful and really understanding. But what the school needs to improve on is setting a priority to the students' needs.
College Junior,2,Majority of the students smoke marijuana
College Junior,2,We do not have a person that assist us in our future.
College Junior,2,The class setting is great when you have students with the onjective to learn. But when you dont and people want to make jokes and distract from the lesson its gets very annoying.
College Junior,2,Because i am a member of a non-Greek organization its more so of the Greeks who feel as though we don't  belong. Although we have made it very clear that if you respect my organization i will respect yours.
College Senior,2,"Some professors don't teach with a passion, only teach from the book."
College Senior,2,There isn't many connections not employers recruiting on campus.
College Senior,2,Rules make housing less attractive.
College Senior,2,The school facilities are old. The school needs new equipment and Better facilities overall.
College Junior,2,Off campus dining is horrible because everything closes at 9 pm and the only college days are on Mondays at Cajun tex which is still expensive.
College Freshman,2,It's a lot of fast food options here. Not a variety for the healthy eating people.
College Freshman,2,The financial to me is horrible. They barley help the none scholarship students.
College Junior,2,"What strictness? Pay cuts are in effect and upon job performance, the staff do not give too much care about issues on campus. It would take a person to die for a care to be given rather than too pay attention to the caution of students who needs attention or discipline."
College Junior,2,"Well considering Wiley College lost a student to an off campus party this year, I would say I have no affiliation to the partying scene here. It is not for me and I do feel that those who participate forget what they came here for. After you do it for a while, you are not forgetting where you came from, you just do not have your priorities in the right place. Therefore, Ive only attended 2 parties here which were held in Pemberton complex and the offcampus gym. If dry humping on someone is partying and sucking off people to get internet famous means partying, I will pass."
College Junior,2,"The strictness at Wiley College could be much better, administration here is way too lenient."
College Freshman,2,the school should work better on financial aid.
College Sophomore,2,its nothing to do off campus
Alum,1,"The only reason I would recommend attending Wiley College is because of its affordability. Apart from that, you have to deal with a corrupt administration that has no regard for the welfare of the students or the quality of education received. Very little money is invested in providing resources for students of various majors, especially science majors. There are much better options elsewhere and I do not recommend spending 4 years of your life at this institution."
Niche User,1,"Leadership, Greek life , security, HBCU student relationships, town, student living, popularity to large fortune 5k companies, future recognized entrepreneurs, clubs and organizations, security, protection and dorm CA’s or overseeing, the institution as a whole accept for the elder proffers Terrible! TERRIBLE!!!!!!"
College Junior,1,Wiley College security is not reliable at all. Especially on the night shift they are never available and if its an emergency they take their time to get on campus to actual defuse the issue.
College Junior,1,"if i knew then what i know now i regret coming to Wiley and not leaving when i had the chance. Simply because my student loans are what is hindering me from doing a lot of things. And because although i take out loans my financial aid is still not enough to cover the schools tuition. So, on top of my student loans i end up having to pay a couple thousand dollars out of pocket after every semester."
College Junior,1,there is no off campus living .
College Junior,1,you can do whatever you want on the campus. And the security might even join you .. The security at WIley is a joke.
College Junior,1,we eat in a elementary cafeteria because the student union currently being built is not paid for or whatever the case may be. So not only are we eating in a tight space but the food is horrible and sometimes not cooked
College Junior,1,"I'm a sophomore going into my junior year and I am already 16,000 deep in loans."
College Junior,1,Students are worth way more than what they're being offered here.
College Junior,1,You wish you could afford off-campus housing because on-campus housing is awful but you can't because Wiley's stolen all of your money.
College Junior,1,"HORRIBLE! They bring students here, as far away as Africa, on scholarships and take them away at the snap of a finger.  They are crooks."
College Junior,1,Barely anything healthy to eat. Very salty and greasy.
College Junior,1,"VERY DIRTY.

Bug infestation, mold, mildew, broken furniture and windows, holes in walls. The hot water either doesn't work or works so well that it burns you every time the toilet flushes.

Just horrible to have to live in."
College Junior,1,"IF YOU'RE READING THIS DO NOT ATTEND THIS INSTITUTION! IT IS A HORRIBLE COLLEGE.

The administration is awful, it's dirty, the food is terrible, no transportation, they lie and steal your money, don't give you any answers."
College Junior,1,"I do not care for athletics here. I have a huge problem with the basketball team here because it is the only noticeable sport here. Wiley College do not have a foot ball team. In reference to the basketball team, I have no respect for them as they have no respect for themselves as of hearing one of the members state how he loves to do drugs. In contract, athletes are to uphold the most of standards on campus as they relate to student leaders. Since when did a weed head become a student leader. Case closed."
College Junior,1,"living on campus is worst and it is not boring. I feel as if it is boring because students here are looking for acceptance rather than value. If it wasnt for my academics and position I have on campus as President of NSMH I would leave this place a second time.  I came here in 2011 and left due to 2012 of what I thought was insecurites on my behalf. Instead I realized I left here because students here come for the wrong things and it affects me if I decided I want success over smoking marijuana in somebody room or attaining a spot on worldstarhiphop.com. The dorms cost too much to stay in with people whom are here for the wrong reasons. The ameneties barely work because when you allow poor quality young people in with no respect towards property, then bad results follow.  I will discontinue on the social atmosphere because it does not pertain to social. Social atmosphere get pertains to as the only care in the world for social acceptance rather than standing out and being successful on campus academically. the cost is too much as the housing process is of no ease at all."
College Junior,1,"I do not support Greek Life on campus because those are the people getting away with important things the most. They are childish and have no affect on doing what is right. my personal experience with fraternity men is that they are child and make up a population that do childish things rather than being responsible adults like all other 1,388 Wiley College students should be. I would never join a Fraternity due to Sping 2012 when students were hazed by the Sigmas Fraternity. Therefore, I would rather succeed another professional rather than a Greek way because they are not the best in my opinion."
College Junior,1,I just trying to finish my career
College Junior,1,yes it is the worst
College Junior,1,there is not strictness only apply for international students whom are discriminated by them
College Freshman,1,I need scholarship help. I wish the school would step in and find some type of emergency funds for me to continue with my education at wiley college.
College Senior,1,My school is the most unsecure campus I've seen. I have totally no idea if security is at campus to socialize or what. 
College Senior,1,"The financial aid directod just moved and the person whos at the moment is in charge, have little knowledge. also the person who is in place of the advisor, who also left, is the worst, disrespectful, and the most ignorant whe talking about communication and professional behavior."
College Junior,1,The network is often inaccessible and many of the computers don't have internet service.
College Sophomore,1,"Horrible, they still working on it but, I think they need to remplace the everything."
College Junior,1,Greek life can so much better if all the greek organizations could get along and strive to be better as whole in stead of competing for who's the best.
College Sophomore,1,"Wiley is a HBCU, most of our buildings are really historic. We are currently renovating our student union. I believe once it is finished then our campus will come together and more upgrades will be made in the future."
College Sophomore,1,"We are redoing our Cafeteria , so everything is really in a convince state as appose to actual quality of the food and service."
College Freshman,1,"Drug use at Wiley College is prominent and pretty belligerent. On any given night walking past Thirkield hall, our largest and most prestigious building, you can smell the pungent odor of marijuana wafting through the air. People are sometime so bold as to smoke in front of professor and members of the administration. However though, there isn't a lot of peer pressure to smoke, many students stick to an ""to each his own philosophy"" ."
College Junior,1,"Lack There of – If the school or the boxing ring does not throw a party, there's nothing to do."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Much – In Marshall,Tx there isn't much to do. There is a very small selection of attractions,events, and activities. The safety in Marshall isn't so safe i honestly feel like the town is dangerous and not so friendly. But i need an education so until i have a plan and can afford to transfer im stuck at Wiley college"
College Sophomore,1,"The drug scene at Wiley college is over the top.Drug visibility is very high,thats all you see.The usage of drugs and drinking from students is almost everyday and all day.Its very sad because drinking is so big at Wiley that studies are the least of students worries"
College Senior,1,"Environment Is Poor – The housing in Marshall, Tx around Wiley College is very poor. The apartments are too much for any student too be in school and to try and keep up with payments and a job. Even if there wasn't a money issue, it still would be a problem with the community. Every week there is something bad going on in the apartments. I believe Wiley College should provide some apartments that would be only for the students, because living in the apartments with the people who live in Marshall , Tx is not a great combination."
College Sophomore,1,The weather here is very inaccurate . We're able to receive experience two seasons in one day or maybe four seasons in during a week. Texas weather is quite bipolar. It's also very rare that classes get cancelled due to weather situations.
College Freshman,1,The meals are nasty hands down i can't stand the cafe food
College Student,1,The Process Was Terrible – I was thrown out of the system at my school because my financial aid didnt go through. and after a week of missing class the school called and said my information was sitting on the desk the whole time. My money was dispersed right around finals! which is the end of the semester.
College Student,1,Drugs Are Very Popular – it makes my stomach turn when i want to sit on the yard for fresh air and have to breath in so much weed smoke. None of the security guards every say anything to the students. Its become acceptable.
College Student,1,"Apartment Are Dangerous – None of the student apartments are well lite, nor are the in a remote area. the Police response out here is beyon deplorable."
College Junior,1,The vans are very out dated and break down frequently while on the road.
College Sophomore,1,Boys Not Worth My Time. Majority of the gentlemen that you'll find here are very immature and not fully prepared for a huge change in the enivorment.

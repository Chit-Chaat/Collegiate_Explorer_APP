The campus encompasses many modern buildings and is situated in the middle of soybean and cotton fields. 

I would recommend anyone attending Bethel University because of the small class sizes that allows for students to have a personal relationship with professors."

Senior,5,I like the atmosphere and small class size. Renovations could be made to the campus to update the older buildings.
Senior,5,"I arrived at Bethel because I had family who went here. The faculty are very open minded and eager to help you succeed. I was apprehensive at first, but Bethel has truly helped me grow as a person and I feel that I have learned a lot since starting. I am now graduating with a Bachelor's in accounting, looking to start the MBA program. The class sizes are small, so you really have the opportunity to form lasting relationships with your professors and fellow students."
Graduate Student,5,"Bethel University has been a great experience. From the staff to the administration, they all make it possible. Bethel isnt just a university this is a family. There are people that devote themselves to helping students reach their goals."

Freshman,5,"My experience at Bethel, so far, has been absolutely amazing! Everyone is super nice and helpful! I wouldn't want to go anywhere else!"
Senior,5,"I attended Bethel University in McKenzie TN. I began my journey in 2013 when I signed up for the Sucess program. The Sucess program is designed for working parents trying to educate themselves in an all changing world. The majority of the facilitators were graduates of the program, this was helpful in my way because they had already experienced the struggle that we had to take on. Bethel University has a torturing program and wonderful library assistants who have helped me on several occasions. The staff had the heart to help students succeed and that is one of the values that keep me fighting for my education. The only thing that I would change about the University is the cost, it is extremely expensive to attend Bethel or any University."
Alum,5,"I received a BS Degree in Management form Bethel in 2010.  It is a great school and the instructors were wonderful also.  I would definitely recommend the school to anyone wanting a good, reasonably  priced education."

College Freshman,5,"are 24hr patrolling security gives comfort, takes away in problem of being abused or assaulted in anyway"
College Senior,5,"The athletics are fairly decent at Bethel and they give a lot more options than 90% of other schools (for example bass fishing, bowling, and archery)  Student involvement for greek life and clubs is pretty low but it's mostly because everyone is already involved in a sport, volunteer group, or music involvement on top of all of their classes.  As someone who has done campus life, music involvement, and school it can get to be a lot to balance it all.  Homecoming is always a huge hit."
College Sophomore,5,"There are two relatively newer housing buildings that are very nice and spacious. The Resident Assistants do Health and Safety checks once a week, and there are also wonderful ladies that come and clean the common area and bathrooms once a week."
College Sophomore,5,Many of our varsity sports and club sports do very well in their season. Most of the students come and support a lot of the home events.
College Senior,5,"I treasure my school Bethel University because of the sincerity from the first day I left my name and number with a desire to future my education. I had just completed my Associates degree in General Studies, with Aurora Community College and was looking into moving toward my Bachelor degree. I wanted to attend Bethel University for three reasons, (1) the University has somewhat become our family graduate school (2) research and writing is of great importance at Bethel, and I had discovered I enjoy writing and I have a desire to write books, (3) it is a school based on Christian principles which are very important to me. I was a woman in her 60 plus returning to school after many years and was still somewhat nervous about going further in my education however,  my recruiter, my orientation facilitator, my adviser, and every professor I have had has been there to assist in every way possible. The availability to students are awesome and I am grateful. I would highly recommend Bethel University to another person."
College Freshman,5,"the visits that I have made to the campus have strongly solidified my decision to attend Bethel University. The staff, professors, and students that I have had a chance to speak with have all been well mannered, helpful, kind, and enjoyable to be around. The campus is easy to navigate around because of the size and scheduling during registration was easy to accomplish. I am very satisfied and pleased with my experiences so far."

College Freshman,5,"I love the greek life on our campus. There are plenty of great sororities and fraternities to choose from. Most of the organizations are local, so you might not recognize the name. The greeks are mainly community service oriented, but they do know how to have fun just like anyone else."

College Senior,5,I absolutely would do this again. My career goal is to be the owner of my own company or the executive to an existing company. The only concern I have is the location of business. I might have to leave home in order to find that golden opportunity to pursue my dream.
College Senior,5,I absolutely love being at my school. I have the chance to receive higher learning and have the chance to better myself as an individual. 
College Freshman,5,"I have a job close by and my schedule with theatre and my touring goes along great and my directors, boss, and study partners are always there to catch me up or fill my position as I chase my dreams. It is by God that I was chosen to go to Bethel and many other reasons behind me attending there. It is a privilege to be able to enjoy school, make, money, and perform all for the price of hard work and determination. "

Alum,4,"I was in the nursing program at Bethel.  A lot of the teachers in that program and the director changed after I left, but I can inform you that the rest of the campus was great. I loved the staff most teachers wanted you to learn and were willing to help. The ones who didn’t actually left a year or two after I had them. The town is very small, and unless you have already saved up for college, it’s difficult to pay for."
Senior,4,College here has been the best two years of my life so far. I got to meet my best friends and discover myself.
Niche User,4,"I had a wonderful time at Bethel University, but the campus felt slightly unsafe at times. Walking alone was rare, even for me, and the baseball, hockey, as well as the football team all held reputations of sexual assault among the university. Not having experienced these things, I can only tell you what I have felt. I made lifelong friends here, though, in McDonald Hall. McDonald Hall was the best part of my experience as the all girls dorm held activities almost monthly!"
Niche User,4,I would like to see more events and places around the area where can interact and engage with one another.
Sophomore,4,"The main thing that I like about Bethel University is that since it is in a small town you get the small town feel which is one that I am used to. I really like all of the people here at Bethel. I have met some friends here that I know I will be friends with for a life-time. The overall schooling here at Bethel is manageable. I am very thankful that it is because I play football here and during the fall we are away traveling and so I miss class a lot on Fridays. The teachers here are only wanting the best for you, all of the classes that I have taken here have been made a lot better because of that teachers that taught them. Bethel is a place that if you were coming from a small town or school then you would do just fine with that adjustment factor."
Sophomore,4,The school is okay. I'm not too fond of the food and I feel that it's just a below average school in some areas. They have good programs but other than that I'm not too impressed.
Junior,4,Bethel University is a great school to attend for working individuals.  I am able to work and complete my work and still go to school.  I have had great teachers.  My only issues are the advisors can be more supportive than what they are to the students.

College Senior,4,"the security team is very down to earth and always willing to help out students.  They patrol regularly and keep decent tabs on things. I do think we need more cameras though. There have been a few thefts/vandalism on the edges of campus in recent years. Also, a year before I came here, there was a stabbing from one student to another, but those kinds of things aren't entirely controllable by the school."
College Senior,4,"Many people have pretty decent jobs within months of finishing school.  Any that don't, are just getting to a solid place on their student debt until they find the right job, or get hired by the school."
College Junior,4,We walk as a group from class to our cars in the garage.
College Junior,4,The business management is great and flows from one class to the next.

Most books are received the day before class starts and there are assignments do that first night. Some students do not get their books until week 3 or 4 of the 5 week course..
College Sophomore,4,I am enjoying my learning experience with Bethe University. I have learned a lot of useful information that I plan to use in the future after I graduate.
College Sophomore,4,Safety is very important and highly regarded.  One thing that contributes to the aspect is that the size of the school is very small and comfortable.
College Sophomore,4,The student career prospects of Bethel are of good value.  The education is geared to be beneficial and useful.
College Sophomore,4,The scholarship process was great and the application process was super easy and made me feel like an individual and not a person.  The atmosphere is friendly and inviting and we are bonded by extracurricular activities.
College Sophomore,4,"The housing is varied among the requests of the students, which I really like."
College Sophomore,4,The athletics here are a big part of campus life as most of our students receive scholarships for the sports that they play.  For this reason I think these activities sometimes overpower the academic aspects.

College Freshman,4,"Greek life is a way to really get involved in the bethel community, well as the town community as well. Greek life here is not all about the partying but designing events during the school days to keep students up to par on there studies and to get to know each other to the best of there abilities."
College Freshman,4,Bethel Athletics are 75% of the school. Being a small school athletics take up most of the room here. Football is the most dominant when it comes to number of people. Bethel is known for its national bass fishing program and nationally ranked basketball teams. Those teams have major attention from around the nation and will dominantly be the face of our campus
College Freshman,4,"Bethel University has been well worth the time , money, and experience. the small classrooms are very helpful for students to ask professors  for help. this opens up doors for everyone to reach there full potential in life.

My time here has been great I see myself graduating and becoming very successful all thanks to Bethel University"

College Sophomore,4,"There are so many challenging, yet interesting classes. Most of the professors I've had are very passionate about their job, and they explain the material very well. The professors also work well with students who are in sports, band, and Renaissance. My most favorite part about Bethel is the students on campus. Everyone is pretty friendly and the students support and attend all of the sports events and musical events consistently. The school's population and campus is big enough where you can meet someone new everyday, yet be able to see many people you do know walking to class. I absolutely love this school!"
College Sophomore,4,"I love the campus because it is such a good place to focus on your schooling, while still having the opportunity to party and have a social life"

College Junior,4,The strictness is only for our protection so it is great.
College Junior,4,My school does a very good job of getting you ready for the workforce and advancing you if you are already in the workforce. Many of my instructors are former students.

College Freshman,4,"Most of the dorms are new. The rooms aren't very big, but they are liveable. All but two dorms are coed. Heritage is the hood of campus. Prosser, mcdonald, and west are the best for closeness to classes. The atmosphere is good. Some students are too loud and messy though."
Niche User,2,"I love how diverse Bethel is. I meet so many different, friendly people from all over the world. I met some really great teachers as well. I feel Bethel is too small for me, and it does not have many opportunities. I would love to see Bethel get more Greek life."
College Freshman,2,"it is a tiny town, not a good location for a college. The town is more ideal for retirement aged people than college students."
College Freshman,2,not a lot of variety
College Freshman,2,Due to the size of the town is what makes it bad
College Junior,2,"Being that Bethel is located in a small town, there's hardly any apartments to live in and the ones that are available are expensive AND with not many jobs in this town, you have no money."
College Junior,2,It takes forever to get packaged and recieve your money.
College Sophomore,2,"There are a .few fast food places, some restaurants and some cafes"
College Sophomore,2,If people want to go to a party or a bar they generally go to Martin because those are few and far inbetween in McKenzie.
College Senior,2,"There isn't a lot of parking spaces available at the building I have to go into for class-basically, first come, first served."
College Freshman,2,As a middle child I began to pull all nighters to try to may for school. It was a hassle and I  begged to leave school early to get a head start on applying for scholarships. It however impacted my school work and then had to give up and let whatever scholarship come through - just accept it and move on. 
College Freshman,2,If you have a dorm you have to pay for meals as well. The food is good if you are not looking for healthy options.
College Freshman,2,This school does not allow you to live off campus unless you live in a 100 mile radius of the school
College Sophomore,2,The gravel back parking lot at heritage is terrible it has hardly any run off areas to prevent rising water and gravel eats away at tires
College Junior,2,I sometimes have troubles with the people in the offices. I will randomly find out that I have charges that are due when I never knew about them. Can be kind of frusterating.
College Senior,2,My school is located in a very small school. I love my school it's just very costly and there isn't much to do or places to go. It is literally in the middle of nowhere. That leaves us as students with not very many places to just hang out or chill unless you have a friend who lives off campus.
College Freshman,2,this school is better for a person who wants to be more isolated and concentrated on work.
College Freshman,2,you are not treated as an adult here when you live in a dorm.
College Freshman,2,"I would give the transportation a C due to the fact the campus does not provide any transportation for their students; however, the campus is small enough to where students can walk anywhere they need to."
College Junior,2,"Most students have their own cars for getting to places off-campus. The campus is small enough that you can walk anywhere you need to go. McKenzie doesn't offer public transportation, but Bethel is a friendly place where you can usually find a ride with a friend. Many of the local churches will also have church buses or individuals willing to give you a ride to church services and activities."
College Freshman,2,"It's november and yesterday it was 71 degrees! Today it was extremely windy, rained and got cold. You'd be wise to check the weather everyday!"
Alum,1,They do not care about their students.  They do not care if you receive your diploma or not.  This place is all about the money and only about the money it is simple and they will hold your refund and to cheap to fix their own mistakes
Alum,1,"Hello, I graduated and never received my diploma.  When I contacted someone at the school they told me they mailed it to the wrong address and I need to call that place and track it down.  I have not since heard from this school.  This is horrible behavior for a school of higher learning.  No one called with any concern about this situation.    They sent the tickets for the graduation to the correct address so the school had it however, either way, I deserve my diploma I earned it. I should not have to HUNT it down.  An unprofessional school terrible advisors so sorry I attended this place!"
College Junior,1,"There are only a handful of places to eat. Mom and Pop diners don't last. There are 5 fast food locations, two small town grocery stores, no movie theater or any place for student's to have fun off campus."
College Freshman,1,There is absolutely nothing here for college students. I believe Bethel is great for no distraction and full study mode for college students. The nightlife comes twice a semester. Football Homecoming and Probates for pledging greek life. 
College Senior,1,Seeing as we are a small school in a small city. We don't have many options when it come to eating. Our school cafeteria closes and opens at certain times.
College Senior,1,NIGHTLIFE ISN'T PLENTIFUL AT THIS CAMPUS. YOU CAN OPT TO TAKE A ROADTRIP TO NASHVILLE TO EXPERIENCE THE CLUB SCENE IF YOU WISH. SHOPPING IS COOL. u CAN GO TO THE OPRY HILLS MALL OR THE MORE EXCLUSIVE GREEN HILLS MALLS IN NASHVILLE.
College Freshman,1,"There is rarely anything to do! So, you have to make up your own fun. It somewhat keeps you out of trouble, but it can be very boring."
College Junior,1,There is no public transportation at Bethel. and personal parking is extremely limited.
College Freshman,1,"No transportation whatsoever! The school is isolated for the most part, and the nearest Wal-Mart  is an hour away! Unless you or a friend have a car, transportation is rough!"
College Sophomore,1,Bethel University housing is very limited. There are only 4 buildings to live at one campus. It is very expensive and very little social interaction occurs in the campus housing.
College Sophomore,1,The facilities are lacking in moderness and size. They are small. The library only has one floor of books and movies and about 20 computers at the most. The student center closes at 11:00pm leaving no place to hangout after hours. There are NO campus activities.
College Sophomore,1,"The majority of the student population smokes weed, but drinking is the main problem at Bethel University."
College Sophomore,1,The campus pretty much shuts down by 11:00pm. There is no place to go and hangout or go and study with the opposite sex after library hours. The town itself has no place to go and hangout. Mcdonalds is the only place that stays open 24 hours.
College Freshman,1,"Small Town Boredom – McKenzie, Tn is not a college focused city. There is very little to do there. Unfortunately, there are zero restaurants that are open 24hrs/day, which is much needed for college students. There are also very limited restuarants in the area and no mall. We as students enjoy our school sports but there isn't alot of fans showing up to cheer us on. One could really become quit depressed in this small town. There really needs to be some improvements that focus more on the college campus."
College Sophomore,1,There Isn't Much – The county our school is in is a dry county so there are no bars or clubs that aren't more than 30 minutes away. Parties do happen every weekend though.
College Freshman,1,"Mckenzie Nights – McKenzie, Tn has no nightclubs, or bars. The only parties are generally held by frats at the National Guard armory. There is also no public trasportation. So, if you do somehow get too drunk to drive, you better have a friend nearby."
College Senior,1,No one can give you definite information. There are excuses as to why there are delays.

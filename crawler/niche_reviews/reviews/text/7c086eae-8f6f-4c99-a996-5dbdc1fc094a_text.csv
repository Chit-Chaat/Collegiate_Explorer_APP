Freshman,5,I take most my classes online it is hard to learn but still pretty fun and it allows me to eat cereal during a lecture
Junior,5,"What I like of Penn State Scranton is that is a very welcoming and that it has staff that actually care about you and how you do in your classes. I really appreciate when I can reach out my professor and ask questions about any difficulty I have in the class.I t will also be great if they campus can add more languages since I like to learn a new language and learn from other cultures as well. Even if language is difficult to find maybe adding more classes of culture to amplify  the diversity, the awareness and educate more students on campus.During this pandemic there has been a  lot of changes personally and in the school environment but they are trying their best to make it as interactive and fun as possible following the guidelines. Once campus is open aging will be more activities for the students. Even in this times it will be great if we can do some activities safely on campus in order to distress and have a more lively campus. More access point for people with disabilities."
Senior,5,Great Experience. Online classes are easy to follow and easy to submit assignments. I actually prefer online classes because it reduces travel time when you are at a branch campus.
Sophomore,5,"I took five classes online for the spring semester and I took an additional three summer online course this year. It was definitely different but all of my professors were really good with handling the situation. I have retained a lot of the information and still learned in a great way. It honestly was better for me, I felt less stress. My professors all made sure if we were confused they would offer a zoom one on one which was so helpful. They also understood if there were any technical difficulties, which there were, and they always were kind about the matter."
Sophomore,5,"Penn State Scranton is definitely a great way to start your Penn State career. I have been a PSU fan for my entire life. My dream was to attend University Park, but I actually decided to attend a local school which I then transferred from. I decided I wanted to follow my dreams of attending PSU, my dream school. So, as an ease into the new situation I decided to start at PSU Scranton and it was a great choice. I can't wait to attend University Park next year but being at Scranton is also a great campus. It has so many ways to get involved and great opportunities as a first year. The classes were a great size and the professors always wanted to help no matter what. I also met with a career advisor who really helped me calm down about worrying so much about being ""lost"". Penn State is the best community no matter what campus you are at."
Junior,5,I enjoy the diverse student body. I feel like I can really be myself and enjoy the activities provided to us. We have an incredibly supportive faculty across the board which makes college life a little less hectic.
Freshman,5,"I love how diverse this campus is. They always have events for everyone’s interests. However, the campus is out dated in some areas like the library, and the cafeteria does not have many options. Overall, the campus in enjoyable!"
Sophomore,5,Penn State Worthington Scranton is a small campus which provides excellent opportunity for professors and students to get to know each other. All staff have been incredibly helpful. Smaller campus provides for smaller classes which are perfect for student to professor ratio and interaction.
Freshman,5,"I like that it is a small school that is close to my family. I liked that I could live in an actual apartment without staying I  dorms, but still had the dorm room and roommate experience."
Freshman,5,This campus offers amazing help from professors due to it being a smaller campus. I can personally talk to my professors or ask them for help when needed. The school has a great reputation.
Senior,5,Penn State Worthington Scranton is a great campus.  It's very personal and comfortable with a lot of resources for the students.  The professors are kind and offer a lot of assistance to the students.   The campus is at a beautiful location and have a lot of activities and events going on on campus with a lot of great giveaways.  The atmosphere is friendly and inviting with an enthusiastic staff that make you feel right at home.
Freshman,5,"At Penn state Wothington Scranton, there’s many pros outweighing the cons. The small classrooms and campus allows for outstanding quality staff and guidance when needed. There are endless opportunities waiting for students to take advantage of.  I highly recommend your first year of college at this canpus even if you’re unsure of your aquired major!"
Freshman,5,Penn Stare Worthington is a small campus that offers a large number of general academic classes.  The class size is very small and allows students to form relationships with their professors.  The classes are challenging but the availability of the professors make even the most difficult class a positive experience.
Sophomore,5,"Penn State Worthington Scranton offers an affordable big degree. By that I mean on your diploma it reads Pennsylvania State University not Penn State Worthington Scranton. We are all one! You obtain a Penn State degree without the horror of enormous financial debt after graduating. My favorite thing about my campus is the great growing diversity of clubs and activities to be involved in. For example Campus Activities Board puts on a karaoke night, stuff a plush, coffee house, game shows, and so much more. This helps to balance academics with relaxing and having fun with fellow students. As well as offering fun activities there are also educational activities that are held on campus such as Chinese New Year Celebration, How to Write a Resume and Interview Like a Pro, etc... overall, Penn State Worthington Scranton provides a wonderful and cultural experience at an affordable cost which in the end yields a stupendous degree!"
Junior,5,It is amazing. The Professors really care about the students and make sure all of the classes are applicable and enjoyable.
Sophomore,5,"Such a homey atmosphere from the time I step foot on campus!! The view is to die for and easily noticeable from the library, view cafe, class rooms, and the lounge. Professors work with students one on one. If they see that you care, most will pass you with a C or better. Just work hard, show up, do your homework, and see your professors. 

Penn State Scranton offers the best experience in and out of the classroom. Where it be extracurricular, or bus trips to New York City. This campus has the big campus resources within its close-knit community. 10/10 would highly recommend. Take a visit on campus to see what else we have to offer!"
Sophomore,5,I love this school.  Great student to instructor ratio.  They will do anything to help you succeed .  I love how it's a 4 year degree program right in my own back yard.  We also have various clubs and all sports.  WE ARE PENN STATE.
Freshman,5,I have recently just finished a Summer Bridge program at Worthington. I will be a Freshman in the Fall of 2017. I feel as though this program prepared me in the transition of high school into college.  This course gave brief English and math concepts that will prepare you for college studies. I feel every incoming freshmen should take this course.
Freshman,5,"Perfect, small campus to help with my transition from high school.  There is always a way to get help, academically and physically. The professors ae great and I am super xcited to attend."
Sophomore,5,I love the small atmosphere that Penn State Worthington Scranton offers. The teacher- student connects that are able to be made are incredible. The classes are small and intimate. The math classes could be better.
Freshman,4,The school is helpful and the teachers help and  the students and   location is pretty poggers i really do like it here
Senior,4,"Penn State Scranton is a great campus. The advisors are really helpful, the professors work with you to make sure you are understanding everything and there are many opportunities for extra curricular sports, clubs and activities.

Out of the whole campus there are probably only 1-2 professors that need to change their teaching style. (The kind that make it harder than it needs to be because they feel they need to do that) I  feel like they should be focused on making you learn, not making it extra hard so you don't."
Freshman,4,The accessibility for anything school related and the teachers were really good at giving students such as myself advice on my education
Freshman,4,"So far I've been a student at Penn State Scranton for about two months, and I'm happy here. All of my professors and counselors are really personable and helpful. The classes are the perfect size and the students are friendly (for the most part). I would say the tuition is fair although I wish there were more academic scholarship opportunities. The location of the campus is convenient although I have to commute four days a week about 45 minutes. There are a lot of fast-food options nearby and Dickson City is a close 5 mins away. My only downside would be that the college doesn't always feel like a college, meaning it feels a little small and there doesn't seem to be many dorms/housing. I think PSU Scranton is a good choice to start your college experience, then maybe transfer to another campus."
Alum,4,"PSU Scranton is a small, cozy campus for those looking to transition to a larger one or save money by commuting. There is off-campus housing offered, but it was a HUGE money-saver for me to commute.

The campus itself has plenty of STEM equipment and resources, plus a decent sports program. The arts programs were thoroughly lacking, but it is a very small campus. The clubs and organizations (including Student Gov and THON) are a big deal on campus, and many students are very involved. Events are happening all the time with tons of free food, swag, and good fun!

The community is an odd one, since about half of the students attending are 2+2 students who will only be there for two years. Despite that, the campus is small enough that everyone knows everyone and the community is welcoming and kind."
Freshman,4,"I like the small classes and 2 minute commute. All faculty and older students are always willing to help and I never feel dumb when I ask a question. I planned on only staying here for 2 years and then going to main campus. Then, I found out it just says ""Penn State University"" on your degree so why not do all 4 years of college 2 min away from my house. I know I made a great choice!"
Sophomore,4,"I love the faculty, the student involvement and opportunities, and the passion that the faculty and students both have about eduction, and becoming your best self. You are academically challenged by the professors, advisors, and learning staff,  and have so many wonderful resources to help you succeed in life. And, there are also a lot of fun events that help you to breathe from the stress of college and allow you to enjoy yourself. You truly feel like family and it’s wonderful."
Sophomore,4,"The campus at Worthington Scranton is small, but it works well for those who like a more one-on-one approach with their professors like myself. Its a beautiful campus with a wonderful view of the mountains and towns that surround it. The staff is friendly and always willing to help, and love to new faces participating in the events hosted within our cafeteria. One thing I would love to see to more of at  the Worthington Scranton Campus, are student lead discussions about world and local news, how it effects us and what we, as a campus and as a community can do to help change it."
Freshman,4,"My time at Penn State Worthington Scranton is currently great. I've been learning a lot of things and it's been already a great help in my life. As a pre-business major, I have been working hard to maintain my grade to transition to UPark and my professors has been a huge help. The learning center is always supplied with tutors and helpful advice to motivate myself to keep striving for my long term goal. I would recommend this campus to anyone who is going for nursing or engineering and likes a small class setting with amazing people. "
College Sophomore,4,I have had a great experience with my professors. They are willing help out however they can. They can always be found on campus or in their office. The tutors at this school are a great help as well.
College Sophomore,4,"PSWS doesn't offer campus housing, but there are apartments across the street that rent to students. It's a great opportunity to meet new people and know a majority of students on campus. It is also very convenient because of how close they are to the school."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletic teams at PSWS are opened to anyone, so I think that is great because if you didn't get a chance to participate in high school you get a second chance to in college. The campus community is very supportive of their teams and always fill up the home section at all events."
College Freshman,4,Its great! People are willing to help you out on campus. They help out a lot with career services and internships.
College Freshman,4,"Penn state athletics are great! Mostly everyone is very engaged. Everyone has good school spirit, fan support, and all the students have a good time."
College Freshman,4,Overall Penn State Worthington is a great school to start off with. Small classes which helps me concentrate a lot better to do well in school. Variety of classes to choose from and helpful teachers that are willing to help you out. I would defiantly recommend this school to anyone who wants to have small classes.
College Freshman,4,"Beautiful campus, fresh air, and plenty to do. I was sold from the online tour."
College Freshman,4,"Students are commuters, so not many issues"
College Junior,4,I love the feel of the small campus size. Your instructures get to know you personally and have a personal stake in seeing you do well. I would definately choose PSU Worthington/Scranton again! In fact I have in the Fall Semester 2014!
College Junior,4,"As far as I know, and I'm not involved in a lot of groups on campus, there doesn't seem to be a lot of drug use on campus. At least not openly."
College Junior,4,"PSU offers a world of acadmics. The curriculum for the nursing program is wonderful and up to date. Workload is tolerable. It can seem overwhelming at times, but so can a day in nursing!"
College Freshman,2,"limited tests, so if you fail one, its hard to come back. Some teachers are rude. Some teachers are very nice, but give hard tests."
College Freshman,2,Campus food is not good. Better off getting fast food or gas station food.
College Freshman,2,"Prices are outrageous for housing off campus. There are some apartments on campus, but they are also very expensive."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't really party around campus, but there are  few spots for partying.  The  campus is near downtown Dunmore. The best bet for a fun night would be to go to Scranton, which is less than ten minutes away. There are more spots there to have a good time."
College Sophomore,2,"There Are a Few Sports – There are a couple sports with a decent gym that gets the job done. there are also events such as the flag football league,ect."
College Sophomore,1,There is no party scene because no one lives on campus. People party with their groups of friends off campus
College Freshman,1,Gen-eds are killers. Never made it to my major. Never took a class I liked because of failing gen-eds
College Freshman,1,Gen-eds are horrific. The classes are very difficult and time consuming. It makes it hard to succeed and drags down your GPA
College Freshman,1,There is nothing. Hard to make friends and fit in if you are from out of town. Things are just miserable here.
College Freshman,1,"None. All of my friends went to Scranton University. All of my friends were in cliques with others from their own local school. Since I did not go to a local school, nobody knew me enough and did not invite me."
College Freshman,1,Gas stations and Fast food. I think I have gained weight and developed diabetes due to eating at these places.
College Freshman,1,"Cold and wet climate. Basically a town full of chain restaurants and gas stations. Students go to Scranton university for parties, you can only get in if you know people there."
College Freshman,1,I have never had or heard of having an internship
College Freshman,1,Expensive apartments on campus. No social life
College Junior,1,there are no dorms on Worthington Scranton campus so there is nothing to say except that they should get them cause its hard for out of state students to find a place to live during the semester
Recent Alumnus,1,My parent make just a little bit to much for me to get any financial aid but they don't pay for my schooling. They financial aid offices are somewhat helpful but they don't make getting the information very easy.
Recent Alumnus,1,There wasn't off-campus housing available until this past year. The cost to live at the housing by the campus is extremely expensive. And as far as parking goes it is first come first serve. There were times I would be driving around the parking lots for 20 minutes looking for a place.

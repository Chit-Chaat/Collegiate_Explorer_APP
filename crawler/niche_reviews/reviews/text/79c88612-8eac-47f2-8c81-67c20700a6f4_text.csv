Graduate Student,5,"This is a great school for the individuals who want to explore more than what is thought in the curriculum.
Lectures are wonderful. School admin are caring, I am looking forward to a great outcome.
Diversity blasts."
Graduate Student,5,"I love the experiential courses and dyads
  Working closely with classmates fosters a sense of community and mutual understanding.  The people I’ve met are incredibly warm and big hearted."
Graduate Student,5,"An amazing institution that focuses on educating the heart as much as it institutionally tries to educate the mind.  The people at this university are kinder and more loving, by a long shot, than any other institution of higher education you will ever come across."
Graduate Student,5,"great school  I like the fact that its in down town San Francisco thus giving the the school a good eccentric vibe that makes work and school more pleasurable. san Fransisco is also a diverse place and the people are great, most have a liberal view point and open to other cultures. The school programs are great, I enjoy the fact that it has psychology, TCM and Fine arts under one building."
Graduate Student,5,"It has only been my first semester and so far I love everything about it. The faculty, the students, the teachers, the campus, the resources."
Graduate Student,5,CIIS will open your mind to new things and has the kind of intellectual atmosphere that is often absent at many colleges where students are just looking to prepare for a career without really learning about the world we live in and of which we are a part.  CIIS is a better and different experience.  It is an awesome intellectual environment and a great community of thinkers.
Graduate Student,5,"I love the classes and the community of learners is really amazing. People are super open and kind, and everyone is always willing to help you out."
College Sophomore,5,"professors are amazing, library is great, courses are great"
College Senior,5,Holistic learning keeps student body engaged.
College Senior,5,"If you love food, SF is your haven."
College Freshman,5,Very diverse in a multitude of ways.
College Freshman,5,Only feel unsafe in the area outside of the campus because I am not overly familiar with big cities.
College Freshman,5,Excellent clinical preparation for the field.
College Freshman,5,The financial aid office is very helpful and willing to help.
College Junior,5,"I wouldn't go anywhere else.  CIIS provides support for the whole person/student: mind and body and spirit.  It is rigorous in nature, while supporting the inner-life of the individual.  Professors, TA's, and other staff are very supportive."
College Senior,5,There are not enough choices to click for what the political beliefs are of the students who attend this school.
College Senior,5,"While academically rigorous, my program as well as others, encourage a holistic approach to learning from mind-body-heart-spirit."
College Senior,5,"We have a bee hive on the roof, a meditation room, a zen garden, yoga classes."
College Senior,5,Integral studies are the way of the future. In a world in planetary and social upheaval it is time to get integrated.
College Senior,5,East-West Psychology is a student-centered graduate program that has core requirements and encourages cross-disciplinary studies.
Graduate Student,4,Online experience is great so far with CIIS. Except from the labs that I preferred them to be in person.
Graduate Student,4,"CIIS has an array of unique programs only found at this school (ie, Humxn Sexuality and Expressive Art Therapy). It is a refreshing take on education, dismantling the teacher-student power dynamic. There is a spiritual component to the school, with students, professors, and guest speakers asking large cosmological questions any day of the week. They offer intriguing discussion series as well. The classes are small and the workload is manageable. That said, there are things I am still wishing there was more of: more food options inside the campus, more feedback on my writing, and better communication. The later is a larger issue, where there are mistakes on the Syllabi, last-minute changes, and unclear standards for work. Also, I understand that the school is looking to break away from the judgment-focused way of Academia, but some students would benefit from more rigor and challenge. All-in-all, I am in my dream program and hope to add to the solutions of the issues I have found."
College Senior,4,"I haven't started classes yet, but from the meet and greet, it seems great!"
College Sophomore,4,"good quality & variety of food, good hours, delicious"
College Sophomore,4,"enjoy the community, the program, the workload is fine"
College Sophomore,4,"i have no idea what the school policies are in regards to this, it's not applicable"
College Sophomore,4,"there is no campus housing, students live off campus"
College Sophomore,4,great school facilities to support students in studies
College Sophomore,4,"b e a u t i f u l  here in san francisco, glad to be here"
College Sophomore,4,"glad to be here, courses are engaging and entertaining"
College Sophomore,4,good good good good good good good good good good
College Sophomore,4,great selection of internships and help getting them from the staff
College Sophomore,4,"great teachers, great community, good workload, plenty of internships"
College Freshman,4,Very little alcohol or drug use.  This school has many psychology programs and high awareness of problems with addiction.  There is a high number of students in recovery.
College Senior,4,"the mission, valencia street, soma, financial disctrict, the haight are all close by"
College Senior,4,The cohort model of learning is revolutionary. We learn from our peers and yet are guided by our instructors.
College Senior,4,We are taken care of in this regard.
College Senior,4,Mature adults don't need this strictness.
College Senior,4,"Because the studentship is small and focused, there is little problem with drugs and alcohol."
College Senior,4,There are no sports here.
College Senior,4,The studentship is quite mature.
College Senior,4,What is the Greek Life?
College Senior,4,The cohort model of learning.
College Senior,4,"If you live in San Francisco, walking, biking or bussing is where it's at. Driving is harrowing and parking is a joke."
College Senior,4,Intelligent free thinkers roam the halls of CIIS.
College Freshman,4,"I had to write two essays, submit a writing sample, provide letters of recommendation, and participate in a unique group interview. The process seemed to serve the purpose of conveying who I genuinely am to the school."
College Freshman,4,"I take the bus to school in San Francisco from Sebastopol, CA by choice."
College Freshman,4,Right in the heart of San Francisco.
College Senior,4,"Public transportation connects people to where they need to go, though some routes are inconsistent and unreliable."
College Senior,4,There are healthy options for almost everyone from gluten free products to vegan to old fashioned junk food. Caters to all.
College Sophomore,4,it is very nice. well kept.
College Junior,4,My major is the most academic in the school but in some ways lacks focus.
College Junior,4,The curriculum is cutting edge. My only critique is that sometimes professors are not specific or rigorous enough. One of a kind education though.
College Junior,4,I do not see any drug use. This is a graduate and professional school so the student body is rather mature.
College Senior,4,There is an open door policy with most faculty and administration.  All of my proffs are always happy to engage with me and to welcome students into their offices.  The turnaround time for finaid info and curriculum related matters is really fast.  The environment is nurturing and supportive and the pedagogy is cutting edge.  The environment on campus is calm and there are spacious and adequate lounge and lab areas for students. The only drawback so far is lack of institutional scholarships or programs to help pay for this pricey education.
College Junior,4,"I am in the ICP program at CIIS.  One great thing about many of the classes is that they are student centered.  I really feel like they  care about the students and if you are getting the material.  There's a lot of reading to do and the in class time is more experiential than lecture.  CIIS teaches transpersonal psychology so if you get that we are not bodies with mind but are body/mind/spiritual beings then this will be a great place for you!
Be prepared in this program to dig deep inside yourself and do the work on yourself."
College Student,4,CIIS is a very integral and diverse place of education and modeling of inclusive/respectful beliefs.
College Student,4,Great institution for out of the box and alternative pedagogy.
College Senior,4,Plenty of Opportunity – Scholarships are available as long as they are applied for in a timely mannor.
College Junior,4,"Safe Building, Less Safe Area – Mission Street just is a little sketchy, so the school gets a lower grade for that although they can't help that.  The building, however, is incredibly peaceful and secure.  Even with few students there in the summer you feel like you're in a safe, community-centered, and homey place among like-minded souls."
College Freshman,2,"Some programs have very old and slow computers.  Wireless internet is not available to students with older laptops due to multiple firewalls.  IT tells students that to fix this problem, the student needs to ""buy a new laptop."""
College Freshman,2,"There are a few genuinely involved faculty and staff.  For the most part, this school lets students who need financial or housing services get marginalized until they just...drop out for lack of help."
College Freshman,2,Weather can completely change from 1 mile in San Francisco to another.  Foggy in one district; 1 mile later clear and sunny; 1 mile later raining; 1 mile later windy...best you can do is wear layers and always carry a small fold-up umbrella.
College Freshman,2,Little flexibility in classes or instructors.  Very difficult to find a job to fit around the school schedule.  Even work study jobs demand 8 hour shifts that do not mesh well with class schedules.  School schedule presumes your entire life is as a student.
College Freshman,2,"If I knew then what I know now, I would not have enrolled here."
College Senior,2,"There are no dorms in the one-building post-graduate campus, and San Francisco is packed full of people and rents just keep rising. Students get really creative- like myself, I live in my minivan to live and breathe in this city and afford graduate school."
Recent Alumnus,2,"As expensive as this university is, you would think they would offer a much larger selection of scholarships, but they don't. They do offer a $3,000 a year scholarship to first time students, which is piss in the wind relative to the total cost and fees."
College Junior,2,I don't drive but I hear the parking is difficult because it is in a busy part of the city.
College Freshman,1,There are no fraternities or sororities at this graduate school.  You need to add a n/a option on your questions.
College Freshman,1,"No student parking is provided.  Limited faculty and guest parking provided, but it is never full.  You just see those empty spots every day and fume that you had to pay for parking or take the bus for an hour."
College Freshman,1,Students pay 800 - 900 to share a living room turned bunk house with other students.  A 2 bedroom apt. will have 6 - 8 strangers living in it.  $1300 a month will get you a tiny studio with a shower but no bathtub and no parking.  Landlords choose which strangers will be your room-mates based mostly on your credit rating....and how many students have a great credit rating?
College Freshman,1,There is NO campus housing.  There is very little in place to help students find housing.  Several students are living in cars or on people's living room floors.  Virtually no resources in place to help students with housing in any way.

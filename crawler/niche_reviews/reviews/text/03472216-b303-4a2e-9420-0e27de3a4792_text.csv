Freshman,5,The University of South Carolina did the best that they could during this inconvient time. It is new to both professors and students. I believe they are handling the COVID-19 pandemic the best they possibly could.
Freshman,5,This is the best school EVER!!! I love it so much. Filled with teh best people around. It's my home away from home.
Freshman,5,"I have only been here for a few months but it is amazing. I feel very safe and have learned a lot. However, COVID has made it hard to get the true feel of it."
Niche User,5,"Yes i did take many of my classes online and i loved it because the teachers are very friendly and innovative here at USC. The crisp, clean, and friendly environment just welcomes you into the campus with beautiful gardens and peaceful libraries. The dorms and residential areas are all equipped with kitchens, bathrooms per room, individual refrigerators adn microwaves, free wi-fi, a gym and a swimming pool. The teachers are very encouraging and for instance if you have a test or quiz, they will motivate and encourage you to study and pay attention in all of your classes and the teachers also stay in touch with you. I couldn't have found a better university than USC."

Senior,5,"Columbia is a magical place. 10+ bars always busy, pool parties when its warm, best tailgate in the country. Need I say more?"
Senior,5,I'm sure it is the same experience that most students have across the country. I have one in person class but the rest are all online.
Sophomore,5,"Great campus and atmosphere. Attending college in the middle of Columbia means a great location, abundance of things to do and see. One thing I would like to see change is faculty involvement in student issues and concerns."
Freshman,5,Throughout this first semester the majority of my class have been instructed online. The professors which instructed these courses did and excellent job in communication and response feedback in order to enhance every student's overall learning experience.
Freshman,5,Throughout my first semester here at the University of South Carolina I have had a fantastic time ! The academic rigor suits me just right and there are a lot of resources to accommodate to your personal needs here on campus. I have also seen a progressive moment in the promotion of diversity and compassion towards all. The University of South Carolina is a excellent institution.
Senior,5,Diverse community with educational opportunities around every corner. Lots of social activities and groups to join.
Sophomore,5,I like online classes here better than in person ones. Usually require a lot less time and easy to complete using resources.
Sophomore,5,When we had to switch to online classes due to COVID-19 I was a little skeptical. I was super worried because I'm a better face to face learner. But i really had nothing to worry about. The teachers were great and the online part ran so smoothly. If I had to critique the online part i would say it could be a little more engaging. Besides that it was really quite simple.
Senior,5,"Sometimes when we assist to clases that are face to face is a little bit of a waste of time, because some profesor do not teaches you. In some of the clases you have to teach yourself and still assist to this clases for attendance. I love the online learning so much better."
Sophomore,5,"Beautiful campus.  Wonderful professors.  Inclusive community!  I have loved being a Gamecock so much, and I know you will too!"
Sophomore,5,"The University of South Carolina is the best college in the state of South Carolina. The professors work super hard every day in order to provide a safe and effective learning g environment for students. Even during a crisis like COVID-19, USC still works hard to provide its students with as much information and help online as possible. So as not to lose grades or credits from classes. On campus housing and dining may not be as great compared to some other colleges, but it is still the cleanest and safest compared to the other housing and dorms on other colleges. I always really look forward to coming to class at USC. Nothing makes my day then to sit in class and enjoy my professors’ lectures and engage in activities with my peers. Meeting new people and having new, fun experiences is another positive of USC. You never can go wrong by coming to one of USC’s on campus programs. They are the best at helping people find jobs as well."

Senior,5,Great array of online courses for those needing to vary their time in and out of class. Good professors who make even online courses interesting.
Senior,5,"Great college experience. From night life, to adventuring, to college sports, USCs college life is unmatched. Located in Columbia, there is a lot to do and much to love about the campus and city."
Junior,5,Learning online at University of South Carolina has been a little difficult but change is no problem for me. It allows me to find a challenge.
Sophomore,5,I did take classes online but only because of the coronavirus situation . Based on my personal experience i didn’t like too much because it was really hard to understand the content of the classes .
Sophomore,5,"I’ve really enjoyed my stay in the University of South Carolina , the campus is amazing , people are nice and caring and the student life and diversity is great for international students !"
Sophomore,5,"University of South Carolina is a great school. Many fun, many opportunities for students. Football is the most exercise thing in South Carolina. It's turn into a different atmosphere when the football season had come."
Sophomore,5,I like the University of South Carolina because its a great school. There are a lot of majors to choice and a lot of diversity for students. Facility attitude toward students is one of the amazing things made University of South Carolina became special.
Junior,5,"Overall I would have to rate my school 5 stars. I am getting absolutely everything that I wanted out of my college experience. Huge sporting events, large classes, a big campus, the party scene, sports clubs and most importantly an amazing education. There are so many opportunities on campus for getting involved with hundreds of options of clubs to choose from. There is also so much help available for your classes and the most amazing campus that really gives you the college feel. so many of us leave home looking for."
Alum,5,"For the most part, the teachers at the University actually cared about their students learning and did whatever was necessary for their students to achieve success."
Graduate Student,5,A lot of online classes were offered. I took my summer classes at USC online. This allowed for me to have my summer free and do school work on my own time.
Graduate Student,5,Amazing School. Best four years of my life. Highly recommend USC to everyone. I have great professors and mentors.
Sophomore,5,"Due to COVID-19, most of the spring semester was spent online. The professors were all very understanding due to the fact this was a transition for them as well. The transitions was very smooth and all the professors gave the resources online needed to succeed in the class."
Sophomore,5,"The University of South Carolina is an amazing institution and full of endless opportunities at your fingertips. The city of Columbia is full of connections for a future career. There are endless social opportunities as well. There are a variety of clubs and events through the university to participate in (Cock Stock, Greek life, club sports, etc) The academics are wonderful as well. Schools such as the Darla Moore School of Business and the College of Nursing are critically acclaimed. Most professors are very easy to talk to and are interested in their student's success. They are great for networking as well in the city of Columbia and beyond."
Senior,5,I love USC. It is a huge campus but the classes are closer to each other once you get in your degree program. Professors and student life are great.
Senior,5,"I had really great online classes and professors, especially through the covid pandemic. It was like I was actually in the classroom."
Freshman,5,Had no trouble transitioning to online classes. Professors communicated well and the material did not change.
Freshman,5,"The best place to go to college. Great weather, great location, tons of things to do, and great academics"
Senior,5,As an out of state student I felt safe and fit right in with the area. I love the school spirit and the academics offered. The athletics scene is electric. Go COCKS 🤙
Alum,5,"If I could change one things about USC it would be the availability to interact within departments more, specifically for my major."
Freshman,5,"I love South Carolina. The school provides great education and gives endless fun times.  Once you learn the food options, there are some really good options."
Junior,5,"I have had such an amazing experience at the University of South Carolina! I lived in Patterson Hall, which was a beautiful centrally located dorm. It looked like a hotel! When I was on the meal plan, the dining hall had Chick Fil A, Panera, and Twisted Taco! They have a lot of other options as well. Football season is by far my favorite time of the year. The way people rally and tailgate together is such a fun bonding experience!  As a nursing major, the program is very competitive. I have had wonderful professors who give many resources if struggling. I do recommend reading rate my professor reviews though. Overall I love the campus and I wouldn't trade my experience for anything! Go cocks!"
Alum,5,"The University of South Carolina has exceeded my expectations greatly. I am a recent graduate of the University and I could not have asked for a better four years. Personally, I went through an extremely tough time during my time as a student being diagnosed with Lyme Disease. The university went above and beyond to make sure I would graduate on time and ensured that I was okay both physically and mentally.  Having an amazing staff help me during a difficult time was everything. Besides that, the overall experience was amazing. The university does everything they can to truly make the four years of undergraduate, the best. Though the dining halls and parking could be better, so many other positives outweigh the food halls and congested parking lots. At the end of the day, I could never have asked for a different experience or school and I highly recommend the University of South Carolina to anyone. Go Gamecocks!"
Sophomore,5,"My time at the University of South Carolina thus far has been nothing short of incredible. I feel extremely lucky to attend an institution that cares so much about its students and encourages us to be the best versions of ourselves. I have learned more than I ever expected from my professors, staff members, and my peers. The University of South Carolina has amazing courses, activities, opportunities, and athletic programs. I feel safe on campus and never have to worry about the safety of my friends. If I could change one thing about the university, though, it would be the lack of diversity. It is important for colleges to admit students regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, etc. While I have met many students who are diverse in some ways, I have noticed that there is a less prominent population of races aside from caucasian."
Senior,5,"University of South Carolina is a well-rounded university. It has a beautiful campus, great sports, and awesome academics. You will have a real college experience at USC. The school spirit is high and the different ways to get involved are endless. Not only is the campus itself great, it Is located in the city of Columbia which has so much to offer - restaurants, shopping, the beautiful river walk, baseball games, and so much more!"
Senior,5,The University of South Carolina was an incredible 4 year experience. I had a wonderful opportunity to be a part of the #1 Undergrad International Business program in the country and it was a spectacular experience that I recommend to everyone.
Senior,5,The environment is so welcoming and friendly. The professors are nice and very experienced. There are so many new people to meet and lots of organizations to join. The campus is beautiful and has a lot of housing options on and off or near campus.
Sophomore,5,The University of South Carolina is a great school. It Is so easy to get involved. The sports games are super fun to go to and also this school is the only SEC school that offers free tickets for sports games to students. Most of the professors really care about their students. The people are great. The campus is so beautiful. The food is good and there are lots of options.
Alum,5,Overall I had a great experience at the University of South Carolina. There was always something to do and it afforded me the opportunity to study abroad for two years in Hong Kong with a cohort of 40 other students. The school has some great professors for the International Business School.
Freshman,5,"The atmosphere at South Carolina is unmatched by any. The campus is beautiful, the school spirit is tremendous, and the weather is excellent."
Niche User,5,"The whole experience from the admissions to actually getting on campus is amazing.  The offices helped significantly with the admissions process, and the transition from high school senior to college freshman is very smooth.  The dorms are nice and there is plenty of activities all across the campus for any and all students to participate in.  The dining options are diverse, so you can find basically anything that you crave.  It is one of the best party school in America, and I believe it has that reputation for a reason.  I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience at the University of South Carolina. Go Gamecocks!"
Sophomore,5,"The Honors College at UofSC is terrific! I get all of the perks of attending a big university while having small class sizes and actually getting to know all of my professors. I chose USC because I didn't want to walk to class in the snow, but I found so many more reasons to fall in love with the school."
Freshman,5,"Fantastic social atmosphere meets top-notch academic flexibility and quality. I absolutely love the people and the vibe at South Carolina, especially as someone coming from the North, I was apprehensive to say the least. South Carolina has turned into a true secondary home, and I am very pleased that high school senior me chose to go there."
Freshman,5,"It is a great school, and we have excellent school spirit too. The experience is one of a kind and Columbia is also a great college town. The school gives lots of opportunities to try and experience new things."
Freshman,5,The University of South Carolina was everything I've ever dreamed of. My school has provided me with a stellar education thus far and more opportunities than I could ever ask for to get involved and gain leadership skills.
Freshman,5,"I fell in love with the campus when I visited it last summer. Columbia is where I grew up until I moved to Georgia when I was ten, so UofSC has a special place in my heart. The campus is a mix of a college town and a regular city so it’s honestly perfect for anyone."
Freshman,5,Awesome experience before COVID-19 and I can say they are handling the situation very well and I thank them for all that they are doing during this time. Everyone needs a little help and I think this school does that regardless and provides a safe environment for students. See you in the fall!
Junior,5,"University of South Carolina has great diversity and they make sure people know it. Not only in classes, gender, and race but diversity for students to do and experience. The only aspect that I would change is the dorms, they are a little old, but extremely livable. USC gives great opportunities not just in the classes, but outside in terms of finding new passions to love and people to meet."
Sophomore,5,"U of SC is the best school I could imagine. It is very well rounded, challenging, diverse, and so much more."
Senior,5,Go Cocks! University of South Carolina is a very inclusive school that focuses on your freshman year experience. It has a lot of bars nearby and an excellent tailgating scene.
Freshman,5,I love this school so much. I am so sad I am not there right now. It is the most fun place you will ever be and I have found my best friends. The school work is challenging too so it is not just all about partying!
Freshman,5,"I can safely say, as a student, I made the best decision going here. I’m from PA so I thought that adjusting would be difficult but it proved far easier than expected. Between their 500+ organizations and many opportunities, I dealt with a crazy roommate and found my people. I have dealt with some real hardships but I really feel that campus resources have helped me get through things with free therapy and support. Even with Corona, USC has stated they are going to give students money back for housing/meals, showing they truly care about the students. Football is also an unworldly experience that words won’t do justice. I’m not in greek life but don’t feel left out bc of friends. Overall, USC embodies southern hospitality and welcomes students with open arms. I wouldn't trade USC for the world and I know many other people share my positive experience. Even with Coronacation, I would much rather be at school; if that isn't commitment to the cocks, idk what is. GO COCKS!!"
Freshman,5,"I love this school! I wouldn’t want to spend my 4 years anywhere else. The amount of school spirit here is insane, and I have met the most amazing people. Go cocks!"
Niche User,5,"The University of South Carolina has a beautiful campus with loads of resources to help you succeed. They have people who will help you along your way to ensure your future success, counselors who will ensure that you're satisfied with your major and will help you logically if you're not. They have internships built into your classes to make sure you have experience in your desired field. The University of South Carolina is in a beautiful area. The city is surrounding the campus so there's always something for you to do in your free time. It's nice to see the school spirit the students have and all the support they show the school."
Freshman,4,The online portion has been a bit difficult to deal with but the housing office and all the others have been amazing. Meeting people has been hard but I believe that is more of a covid thing than the university its self.
Freshman,4,It is very hard to learn online but I am doing the best I can. I have 5 classes that are online and 1 that is in person and I feel like it is harder to learn online but I definitely feel safe doing it.
Sophomore,4,Online learning at UofSC has been great. Professors have altered their teaching format in many ways in order to best accommodate students.
Alum,4,"Overall, I had a good experience at USC. Although, I would like to see more unity on campus amongst different groups of people."
Sophomore,4,UofSC is my dream school that I got into in my freshman year of midland technical college. I would have gave them five stars but there campus is like so crowded and you need a map just to get around. They need more parking spaces for the students that don’t live on campus because it’s like we have to walk a mile just to get to our classes. I do live the school it’s beautiful and of course it’s school it’s going to be difficult but everyone there is so nice.
Senior,4,Online classes are organized and are beneficial to students. Professors rarely have a problem instructing online.
Sophomore,4,"Good school for the true college experience. Lots of people, but easy to find a group with common interests. Would recommend if you’re looking for the typical movie college life."
Alum,4,"I was part of a specialized program that accepted recent undergraduates and adult students. The coursework was challenging, but rewarding in that we had classes that were meant to prepare us for the working world.  They also provided us with public speaking lessons that helped immensely with presentations."
Alum,4,I did not take online classes here. I did not take online classes here. I did not take online classes here. I did not take online classes here. I did not take online classes here. I did not take online classes here. I did not take online classes here.
Sophomore,4,"My experience for my first year at USC was pretty awesome. I met new friends, had amazing teachers, and learned so many things. When I was in the dorms my RM was super helpful and the people on my hall were great. If I had to change anything about my experience it would be an easier system to call when you needed help with something. The people who assisted with my FASFA weren't very helpful at all, I had to figure everything out on my own. Besides this it was the perfect year."
Alum,4,It's a great school with an amazing  campus. They staff are knowledgeable and helpful. I also love the various clubs that you can be a part of. The school has a good reputation and you can meet people from all over the country.
Alum,4,"I do not normally take online classes, however, when the pandemic hit in the middle of last semester, the instructors worked hard to provide us with a smooth transition to online learning. I think they did a great job making that easy and available to everyone."
Sophomore,4,"In the computing field, most of my professors adapted quickly to the online learning environment, so overall I've had a pretty great experience in that department."
Alum,4,"As a student-athlete, there is no better environment than SEC sports. In Columbia, you have incredible community support and so many opportunities to network. The campus itself is absolutely beautiful and the city seems to be growing around it in every direction. My first two years, the class sizes were very large, but as you ascend into higher level courses, the class size drops and you find yourself establishing relationships with professors. I loved that we were close enough to drive to the beach for the weekend but also could head west and hit the mountains! School really comes first but Gamecocks know how to have a good time."
Junior,4,"It is a very good college, I love the campus. Something I would love to see changed is the math building. They need to remodel it."
Junior,4,I love how big the campus is. This gives students a lot of great opportunities to branch out and experience classes and activities that help find your career and passions.
Junior,4,There are a lot of opportunities to take online classes which makes it easier to take a lot of classes. They offer a lot of classes with a wide range of class sizes and class subjects which I also appreciate.
Sophomore,4,I've enjoyed my time at the University and can not wait to go back and enjoy the next few years there. USC makes it easy to reach them in times of need and they were always helpful through the entire process of moving in and getting settled last year.
Junior,4,"I took a few classes online and the ones that I did, the professors were very helpful. The syllabus was extremely detailed with a day by day schedule of what needed to be completed and what was due. The professors I had also sent out emails as reminders for deadlines and always responded quickly if I had questions."
Alum,4,"My experience at the University of South Carolina was one I would recommend to any aspiring college student. While the campus size may take some getting used to for students from smaller areas, it is well worth the experience as it offers a wide variety of activities and a strong diversity in the student population to allow for almost anyone to walk away with an unforgettable story or two."
Freshman,4,It has been one of the greatest experiences that I have ever done in my life. It has great academics and it is a good return on investment. It is not the most Diverse community but its on their personality that matters. The campus is pretty big and there are things to do. I love going to the football games and there are two intramural fields that I will play on and that is where I met most of my friends just playing soccer. I don't party at all but it has a big scene. The Professors care and I was surprised that one of the professors from my lecture hall recognized me. The local area is great as there is a food Lion near buy and downtown is also close not to mention the State Fair. I love housing but it is a bit to expensive I would say but it is worth it for the most part. There is variety in the campus foot offered and it is safe. There are many activities to get involved in on campus. Its hard to give it an overall rating but if I could I would give it a 4.5/5
Freshman,4,The tried their best on the situation that happened but the biggest problem would be the live lectures. I would have audio problems and not just that but also sometimes it would be static on the interaction screen. Luckily this was all avoidable as I could just view the recording of the lecture online and that problem would be solved and the assignments were not that bad online.
Freshman,4,"Most of my professors made sure we got what we needed to get what I needed to learn,I felt safe at home and made learning easier.labs are difficult on line .the only thing I hated that I  couldn’t be with my study groups .learning at home  was sometimes challenging but the group on line helped each other."
Freshman,4,"I love the shanon college group  and my dorm wasn’t so bad .the food really sucks .most of my professors cared I felt like some didn’t .i had one that couldn’t even speak real good English ,but for the most part my freshman year was ok."
Senior,4,"I prefer actual classroom learning. While online learning was as good as it could have been, as an out of state student my tuition should have been credited. I did not elect to go to South Carolina for online learning"
Alum,4,"All of my online classes were great, and the transfer from in person classes to online was very seamless. My professors handled it very well."
Freshman,4,Teachers were very understanding during the difficult online period we had the past semester. Classes were more organized than my expectations were.
Sophomore,4,"The school is great overall! The food is great, football season is the best time to be part of the university! A lot of walking but great university"
Graduate Student,4,"Call to academics professors hold a high value for the students and education, Beautiful campus located in a great area. Plenty of opportunities and resources."
Alum,4,I enjoyed the campus life at USC Columbia when I attended their for two years to obtain my bachelor's degree in Mass Communications. I obtain my Associates Degree from USC Sumter (my first two years of college).
Senior,4,"I really liked my time at University of South Carolina. Everyone has great school spirit and the athletic games, especially football and basketball. There are so many clubs and activities to get involved in, there is something for everyone. There is also a great variety of classes to choose from."
Freshman,4,"Very nice campus and great food! The teachers are nice, supportive and understanding. Freshman year is a nice transition from high school and they give you plenty of space to grow. Dorm life is very nice aswell."
Freshman,4,I like its overall size.  Makes me feel more in a city instead of school.  The professors are really personable and easy to connect and talk too.  The vast amount of students makes it easy to make friends and associates.
Junior,4,"I'm currently a transfer junior here at the University of South Carolina. I'm a Biology major, hoping to be a physical therapist. MY experience so far at this school has been a positive one. I like how there are a variety of activities to get involved in, such as different sports clubs and community events to get involved. I also like the amount of diversity within the school. This school also makes you feel like you actually want to be there and learn. the professors make the classes enjoyable and not miserable. But if I would change something about the school it would be that there should be a better grading system, this is because some professors grade differently then others and instead it should be all the same level."
Niche User,4,USC has been a great place to learn and live. Classes are hard but professers really try their best to help you pass. I have met so many new people and there is never a dull moment.
Freshman,4,"It was easy to make friends, as there is a wide variety of students with different interests. The university ensures students feel at home and have access to many useful things such as free counseling, volunteering opportunities, and safe transportation around campus and back to dorms from the bar areas (this is done to keep students safe)."
Sophomore,4,"I love this university. Especially coming from out of state where I knew no one, usc made me feel at home. Most people are not from SC, and there is a diverse population of students (most being from the northeast!). The area around the school isn’t the safest, but there are many tools provided to the students like apps and shuttles to stay safe. The school spirit is incredible, and the academics, especially at the Darla Moore School of Business are impeccable."
Freshman,4,"I am a second semester freshman and I love it here! I am originally from PA and I am so glad I chose USC, would not want to be anywhere else."
Sophomore,4,"I am still attending the university as a current sophomore and if I had to pick a few characteristics of the university that continue to draw me to their programs I would have to choose their outstanding academic atmosphere, the abundance of opportunities to join clubs and get involved, and the programs in place for students to lead them to success"
Freshman,4,"This is my first semester here at USC and I love it. This first week is a little confusing, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of it."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I like the college but there are a few quirks. For one, I hate how they do the meal plans (which are required for freshmen). They don't have an unlimited meal plan and the amount each swipe is worth changes throughout the day. Also, if you want to eat between 11:30 - 3:00 or between 5:00 - 7:00, it'll take a very long time. This means I often have to choose between eating and making it to class on time. The last thing is that it is extremely difficult to eat healthy and get enough calories on the meal plan. Almost all of the healthy meal swipe options are extremely low calorie and thus it's very difficult to eat enough (especially on, at most, three meal swipes a day). Most of the dorms are over priced. I pay 750 a month to live in a dorm with a roommate. There are cheaper dorms but they're equally as terribly priced for what they are. Student health will also charge you to your  account almost every time you go without telling you that anything costs out of pocket money."
Junior,4,"UofSc has been the best years of my life so far. It is more than just academics, but a community. It feels like a small school in a big school setting."
Alum,4,"USC is a hidden gem. Students get all the benefits of a large state school (party scene, SEC sports, beautiful on-campus gym and pool, etc.); however, they are also able to receive a fantastic education (#1 for first-year student experience, #1 International Business program, etc.)."
Freshman,4,I like all the resources provided to help students with their academics. The school is also greats with allowing students to create spaces or clubs where they can feel included and find a place to feel involved.
Junior,4,"Great atmosphere, nice sized classes, and lots of resources available to students. The city felt safe to live in since students are encouraged to live off-campus after freshman year."
Junior,4,I like that the campus is integrated into the city allowing for students to not feel so isolated from the outside world. The clubs and student involvement here is amazing as well. I do however wish there were more opportunities to interact with faculty outside of the classroom.
Freshman,4,"The University of South Carolina is an easy going, yet always active campus in the heart of the capital city. There are endless opportunities to get involved in the community and get to know the rest of the student body. The school’s diversity creates a unique environment that allows for self expression. The campus makes up a large amount of the city of Columbia but still preserves the beautiful nature sights throughout campus. It can be expensive for out of state but more than worth it"
Sophomore,4,My Overall experience at the University of south Carolina has been pretty good. The campus is clean. They have great food options. I have done well in all my classes so far and whenever i needed help i have been able to find it.
Freshman,4,"Great environment and plenty things to do on campus! Most dorms are great, but some need to be updated and it costs way too much money for out of state students."
Niche User,4,"My overall experience here is very positive. The student body is very nice, and the facilities are very nice. The campus has nice scenery."
Sophomore,4,It is an easy campus to learn and easy to walk from one class to another.  Students and professors are easy to get to know.  The Freshmen Orientation programs make transferring to college fun.  I would recommend changing the Housing policy of allowing upper classmen to stay in the residence halls rather than pushing them to get an apartment.
Junior,4,"It's a decent school. Lots of offerings, especially if you're in the honors college. I enjoy being here and would recommend it in general, although Columbia is not an exciting city."
Freshman,4,"I love the school spirit and overall community which can be found across campus! However, information from the University is not always clearly communicated, and it is a party school. With so many students around me distracted from their studies, I have found that I am even more motivated to pursue my studies and avoid associating with people who are constantly partying. I don't think enough emphasis is placed upon the importance of finding the major which best coincides with your interests, however there are so many resources around campus that if you need help with virtually anything you will be able to find it somewhere!"
Freshman,4,So far it has been pretty great! My dorm is kinda bad but that’s alright because the campus is amazing!
Senior,4,"Overall my experience was fun. Top not h programs, pretty moderate diversity.
Saturday football games really get the town excited. You’ll have a blast at USC, just do what you came to college to do"
Junior,4,"The University of South Carolina is easily one of the best colleges in the state of South Carolina. There is so much to do. Located in downtown Columbia, the capital-city of the state, you are constantly surrounded by different tourist attractions, fun things to do, and lots to see. It is housed in a very urban part of the state but the mountains are only a three hour drive away and the beach is only a two hour drive away. It is a great place to go to school!"
Junior,4,"Great school, excellent opportunities for students to get involved on campus. Excellent professors on the whole, great student housing."
Sophomore,4,"I really like attending the University of South Carolina. Since starting there last semester I've made wonderful connections with classmates and professors alike. I enjoy my classes, I love the location in central Columbia, and I appreciate the help and support I get from everyone on campus."
Junior,4,I have enjoyed my time here. I have learned a number of valuable skills and been connected with a lot of wonderful people who have enriched my education.
Sophomore,4,It is palce of higher education as well as a place where life long relationships are made. Everyone is extremely friendly from the president to the students. For a college smack dab in the middle of a city it sure brings a college town vibe especially when the weather is cool enough for students to start studying outside. The university also does a lot for students like making all of the athletic events easy and free to access. This strengthens school spirit and morale so that everyone feels connected and invested.
Senior,2,"Academic wise, this school has some decent options and I did have one or two fantastic professors. I suppose I'd begrudgingly recommend the school if you are smart enough not to get caught up in all the other alcohol and drug behavior of the majority of the student body. This is more of a party and football school, so be prepared to be around a lot of immature and irresponsible kids who could care less about their education and more about which frat guy brought the alcohol for the tailgate or which bar down in five points they should get drunk or stoned at in the middle of the week. So overall, if you care about getting a good wholesome education, making meaningful relationships based on genuine connections and decent qualities with intelligent, like-minded individuals, the University of South Carolina is NOT for you."
Senior,2,"Had to take some online classes due to COVID. Not a fan, as you don't learn as much. But I suppose the majority of professors are doing the best they can."
Senior,2,"The University of South Carolina’s Engineering Department has only one thing that makes it better than most other universities, it’s cheaper. Academically the curriculum is disjointed. Motivation to learn is non-existent for a large majority of students. In short, USC does not provide an environment to learn, it provides an environment for mediocracy.
The engineering department must change the culture in the department. The curriculum must be taught by professors who care and in a way that ideas build on one another. Students should be expected to work for their grades. Courses should be a balance of theory and application.  Lab experiments should be incorporated in individual courses and not in disjointed lab classes."
College Sophomore,2,"I hated my traditional style dorm that I was in last year, mostly because I did not like the girls I was with on the hall and I need to have my own space."
College Sophomore,2,So many people are in Greek life and it is all they talk about.  I often feel left out because I do not want to join.
College Sophomore,2,"It is too big for me, as well as too far from home.  Everyone parties and drinks, which I don't want to do.  I haven't met any good friends."
College Freshman,2,"I have had the worst experience with campus housing, and honestly have contemplated moving off campus because of this."
College Senior,2,"The presence of Greek life is frustrating. While I have different feelings about the Divine 9 and other fraternities and sororities that are not part of the Pan-Hellenic nonsense, there is still a constant reminder that they are there, be it by letters, be it a headline in the news, be it a reference to a ""Well, my sorority..."" as a part of a class discussion. During my sophomore year, there was an instance of a GDI (goddamn independent) removing the R from the sign Greek Village, which is our fraternity and sorority row, making it Geek Village. While many non-Greeks and Greeks alike found the prank humorous, there was also quite a whiplash following the incident to how Greeks looked at non-Greeks. Being a southern university, there is still a sense of necessary belonging to some sort of group; those students who once belonged to a large church growing up now belong to a large Greek organization."
College Sophomore,2,"The majority of the sororities and fraternities on campus promote ideals that have nothing to do with furthering ones education. Recently many have been either disbanded or temporarily shut down due to reports of hazing, alcohol/drug abuse, and student's being injured during functions. The non-Greek student population have a very negative outlook on those that choose to be a part of it, creating a social divide between the two. This tension between the groups is mounting, to the point where non-Greeks are fighting against the system while individuals who are a part of Greek Life are acting out even more in retaliation against the rest of the student population. It can be said however that our sororities, holistically, provide a large amount of money to charities through their various social events and volunteer work."
College Sophomore,2,It's bad everywhere! Our country needs to make it a priority to get under control.
College Freshman,2,"The rooms are dirty, the bathrooms have mold, and parking is awful. We are near the athletic fields so athletes are always using the parking spots and even though we live in this building, sometimes we have to walk in the street. This is ridiculous considering how large our parking lot is."
College Sophomore,2,"Easy to find a fraternity you fit in with. Pledging is a nightmare. Everything you have heard about pledging that may scare you happens at this school. Apparently it's all worth it, that is if you feel like degrading yourself for 2+ months."
College Freshman,2,"It has been about 3 months now and being here is still bad. All the fun college experiences only happen at the bars, and if you don't have a fake.... Well... You're screwed. There's not much diversity here whatsoever. Also, greek life seems to have a stranglehold on the university. If you want to really have fun, you have to turn to them. Personally I don't see the point, it's just a huge group of people who want to conform. I know for a fact that I made the wrong college choice, and thanks to my scholarship, (the only reason I'm here) if I transfer, I have to pay the full price for an out-of-state student... yay."
College Freshman,2,"I've only been at USC for less than 2 months but so far my experience has been horrible. The campus is pretty, and most students are friendly, but the faculty and RMs have been awful both to me and my friends. The office of student conduct will jump on you for things as insignificant as owning incense (it doesn't even have to be lit, and you will be fined $150), treat you like a felon, and when it comes to legal issues such as possession or alcohol, will strip you of all of your rights and do not possess an inkling of sympathy or respect for students who break any of their rules, no matter how ridiculous they are. Most RMs will write you up for anything that comes close to violating conduct, even if you didn't actually break any rules."
College Freshman,2,"My current school is not what I was looking for. USC is full of sororities and fraternities that just drink at the downtown bars every night. The school advertises itself as a super friendly and busy school, in reality it is not. Their events are poorly planned and not advertised at all. Students find out about activities after they've already happened. The students on campus are mostly rude and unsocial. Looking back, I would have chosen a different school and plan to transfer."
College Sophomore,2,"Not much diversity.  Everyone's pretty much white, middle-upper class, and dress nicely.  People aren't really too fond of the LGBT community.  Political views are more conservative but it's not that obvious or a big deal really if you're not."
College Junior,2,I have never received aid from the University of South Carolina
College Junior,2,"It's pretty awful. Financial aid office has been no help whatsoever. Options are also limited when it comes to receiving financial aid. Tuition fees are high, so it's not good."
College Freshman,2,You don't get many options.
College Freshman,2,The meal plan availability and costs are ridiculous. Food choices are limited and food workers are rude.
College Freshman,2,The buildings are mostly old and falling apart. The wifi is always disconnected and there was a huge black mold problem going around. It is also extremely hot in my dorm all year round.
College Freshman,2,Everyone goes to bars instead of partying! I hate it!
College Junior,2,"It's not great. I was told I was going to be receiving a scholarship when accepted, but then never got it."
College Sophomore,2,I live in Olympia and the landlords are idiots and don't know what they're doing. Never living there again.
College Sophomore,2,"They're expensive, especially for there quality. They are basically rip offs"
College Freshman,2,"I was not expecting to live in a dorm where I did not have my own bedroom or bathroom, so the ease into living was tough for me at the beginning. However, though I do not enjoy my on-campus living environment, that does not affect my overall view of the university whatsoever. The dorms are not the cleanest and, for months, we went with nothing but stark cold water that required us to travel to different halls in our building for a hot shower. The current building that I live in, which is also the cheapest choice of housing, is not ideal, but I am positive that those in upper echelon living statuses are satisfied with their community and building."
College Freshman,2,"I mean, it means well, but if I don't want to go to class and can keep my grades up I shouldn't be penalized. The police on campus aren't really helpful. Overall it is too strict compared to other friends colleges"
College Freshman,2,There are very few healthy options and you don't get that much food.
College Freshman,2,"As a freshman girl, I do not feel safe walking alone at night. There are a lot of emergency call boxes if you need help, but the areas on and near campus can feel very unsafe."
College Freshman,2,"There really isn't much to do in the surrounding Columbia area on the weekends besides go out to the bars. It can get pretty boring, and there aren't a lot of university sponsored activities either. If you have a car, you can drive to Charleston for the weekend."
College Junior,2,USC completely disregards off-campus crime even if it is 5 feet off campus. They are more concerned with not raising their reported crime than actually keeping the students safe. I reported an on campus crime several weeks ago. The police did not listen to me and did not follow up despite that I left my name and information. The police that are supposed to keep the students safe are to busy ticketing them for underage drinking to actually keep them safe.
College Junior,2,It's a waste of money
College Junior,2,They always wear their baggy shirts that look stupid. They all wear the same thing. It is very easy to spot a greek
College Freshman,2,"Everything is pretty far away, and the off campus housing is typically not in a college-like area."
College Sophomore,2,Cops are everywhere preying on underage kids just to arrest them for being drunk.
College Freshman,2,I am having alright fun but it is really hard since I do not have a fake ID and am not in greek like and am not a girl. I try really hard to have fun but there is a problem with the girls here they are a holes but hot.
College Freshman,2,On the Academic portion of college I am really liking it but socially it is very hard without a fake ID or joining greek life. The girls here are extremely unaccepting and have some sort of problem.
College Freshman,2,"The only real party scene is in downtown bars and at tailgates. You need a fake ID if you are underage, which I feel nervous possessing. There is slim to no house parties and Frat parties are only for people involved with that fraternity and their dates. I think this is the major downfall of the school."
College Senior,2,More concerned with underage drinking than ANYTHING else.
College Freshman,2,I am not in Greek life and I feel as if it is looked down upon.
College Sophomore,2,"You barely ever see campus security, if your dorm needs a swipe to get in you feel safe, i never really felt like i had to lock my door during my freshman year but living off campus its not safe you always have to have the door locked, even if youre the only one home. its hard to find ways to get home late at night from the library for example. they have carolina van shuttles but you never know when they show up and you dont want to sit out side and wait a half hour for them. they dont have people that walk you back to your dorm which would be nice. usually the cops will just show up rather than campus security taking care of things which is a pain because the columbia police department has its priorities all backwards and think its more important to give college students drinking tickets rather than busting gang crime. very disappointing"
College Sophomore,2,"They pretty much kick you off campus after your freshman year and all the housing options for apartments are not close AT ALL. They all tend to rip you off but the places are pretty nice, you can almost always get a pool and your own bathroom for 500-600 a month, and most are individual leases. If you don't have a car living off campus you are pretty much stranded there all the time, the shuttles run during the day to campus but if you have classes that end later than the shuttle then you're screwed. I would rather live in the not so great campus housing and be close to everything than be in sketchy areas where the off-campus housing is. you can rent houses but they are old and gross from years of wear by college students. those are nice because they are semi close to campus and five points but more expensive and more of a pain in terms of rent"
College Senior,2,"I mean, the prettiest thing in Columbia is the University. It's not safe, so much gang crime. There are no professional sports, it revolves around college sports. Cost of living is cheap because salaries are bare to none. Nightlife is based for college students, not graduates or older crowds. Just no."
College Junior,2,The cost of living it very high.
College Sophomore,2,It really needs to be less strict. The police should be monitoring things in Five Points instead of busting underage drinking. They don't have their priorities straight.
College Sophomore,2,"With an increase of incoming students and a decrease of on campus housing due to renovations, more and more students are moving off campus."
College Freshman,2,The rain can be horrible.
College Freshman,2,"Parking is bad, people Park without paying screwing the people who do over"
College Sophomore,2,"Scholarships I feel can be very hard to get outside of hope, life, and palmetto scholarship. I did apply for financial aid, however I did not fall under the requirements to receive it. I've been applying for scholarships since I was in high school and unfortunately haven't received any additional ones outside of life scholarship."
College Sophomore,2,The strictness about personal and academic issues is absolutely absurd considering we are all adults living on our own.
College Sophomore,2,If you are a transfer student you can say goodbye to any aid or scholarships.
College Freshman,2,The school wifi is terrible
College Sophomore,2,"It is a cult of students who believe they are benefitting their community and future, but are actually just making themselves appear very unprofessional for their future!"
College Senior,2,Nuts about parking regulations with no warnings given whatsoever.
College Freshman,2,People get drunk at night and bother other people.
College Sophomore,2,Some dorms are old and are on the outskirts of campus.
College Sophomore,2,Some students have express how they feel about other on race is a negative expression
College Junior,2,"The housing process is pretty bad. There are 31, 00 students at the university. freshman classes have been as large as 4,000 students. Housing is guaranteed for freshmen. After your freshman year, if you want housing, you are entered into a lottery  with the rest of the student population and you have to just HOPE you get housig. After you're freshman year, you are encouraged to move off campus but that does not fair well if you cannot afford $500 dollars a month (and thats on the low end pricing for the off campus housing). There are shuttles that run between campus and the off campus communities but most of them stop running after 6pma nd do not run on weekends so you will be stranded on campus or off campus in your room if you do not have a car or unless you can hitch a ride with someone. "
College Junior,2,"There is no need to have a car on campus but if you don't have one there is no way to get to surrounding walmarts or grocery/shopping stores. There are bars and restaurants that are nearby and in walking distance. Parking is a nightmare during peak class times in the morning and in the evening. The lots fill up quickly. there is not nearly enough space for all the parking that commuters do to the school from nearby off-campus housing. if you park somewhere you are not supposed to, you WILL get a ticket between $8 and $25. "
College Freshman,2,It's very expensive and difficult to find open spaces.
Niche User,1,The website has an innacurate description of requirements. If you apply you will get declined on their mistake.
Niche User,1,Do not apply here you will be dissapointed. Lack of communication. You have no direct people to talk to when the answer is only through email. The rankins are not accurate. A complete dissapoinment. If are consider this university think twice. There a plenty of options out there and tuition are considerable. Do not have USC as a first choice.
Graduate Student,1,I'm a graduate student in statistics. It was the worst experience I've ever had. The teachers were awful and they stole my money. Transferring out after one semester.
Alum,1,"I didn't really enjoy going there, the school is too big and the professors don't seem to eager to help."
Freshman,1,"My experience has been terrible, just terrible. To start off, this school does not have a proper fraternity rush. It's who you knew from high school. If you don't know anybody going into USC, you have no chance. The city of Columbia is a disgusting and terrible place too. Don't go here. You will regret it."
College Sophomore,1,I hate everything about this school.
College Sophomore,1,"This is a completely sport oriented school. If you don't care about sports, or football in specific, you will have a hard time relating. If you have no interest in Greek life you will be a bit of an outcast. Most people at this school only want to interact with other people involved in Greek life (I tried the pledging stuff; it's a complete nightmare). The party scene is exclusive to the bars downtown, which are overcrowded, hot, and full of conceited jerks (and again, this is not an inclusive scene unless you're involved in Greek life). Not to mention, the city of Columbia is not the safest place...I work at the Jimmy Johns downtown in what is called the ""Vista"" and I am often harassed by the homeless population, along with frequent shootings, stabbings, offenders of public indecency, etc. I am approaching my third semester at USC and am eager to gtfo. There is also a significant drug problem on campus; from benzo's to amphetamines it is hard to escape from it. Over all my experience at this school is terrible and if you have any interest in perusing a career in the entertainment industry, expect to only study sport entertainment because that's all they offer (they claim to offer more than that but it is a lie, trust me I know first hand. I went to study music/entertainmet management and so far I have only taken SPTE courses involving sports.)"
College Freshman,1,I absolutely hate USC. I am transferring.
College Freshman,1,"USC is way too big to get to know people you genuinely like. I have had some good experiences, but not what I'm looking for. I am highly considering  transferring schools."
College Freshman,1,they don't offer any scholarship for international students
College Freshman,1,Very poor quality of food which is extremely overpriced. The meal swipes you dont use dont roll over so if you miss a meal that money just goes to the school and not you. The workers (Sodexo) are extremely rude and do not follow our campus wide tobacco free rules.
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid office is the most inefficient and rude office on campus
College Freshman,1,Very homogenous. I felt like everyone I met was the same in terms of beliefs and value. It is really a school where not everyone can find there own place because there aren't many different types of people
College Freshman,1,As a picky eater I never had anything to eat. The food is very average and it gets boring right away
College Freshman,1,I personally believe that students are not being apprehended enough and often get away with things they should not be getting along.
College Freshman,1,the financial aid office is terrible.
College Freshman,1,Campus housing is the worst and is not worth the price students pay and does not meet accommodations for forcing freshman to live on campus.
College Freshman,1,The police treat everyone like criminals and they are swarming everywhere during fridays and saturdays they have nothing better to do but write minor in possession tickets they are a holes.
College Freshman,1,Terrible party scene all their is to do is go downtown unless you are in Greek Life. You need a fake ID if you like to party at all trust me get a fake or join a fraternity unless you are a girl then its slightly different.
College Sophomore,1,"The administration at this school is run by monkeys. They have no regard for what the current students need. Campus dining is an absolute nightmare and NEEDS to be reformed but they don't care. Getting into dorms is a pain too to sign people in all the time to some of them, a guard at the door is great and they are helpful when forgetting carolina cards or with drunk kids, they usually dont call the cops unless they think they need to intervene. a lot of dorms dont allow overnight visitors that are of the opposite sex. get over it its the 21st century. some buildings do allow it though from the start which makes zero sense. all they are concerned with is how the school looks to incoming students. campus security is a joke, I never saw them my freshman year but i heard they would sometimes walk around super late at night. with how dangerous this city is though you would think that they would be more helpful. i swear they only have like 10 guards on at night. just this year after a bunch of armed robberies did they add more campus security. the administration is just straight up clueless, they should study other schools that have better ratings than them and reform stuff"
College Sophomore,1,Parking is absolutely awful due to the overcrowding and unforgiving ticket prices.
College Sophomore,1,It sucks Id walk everywhere possible 
College Junior,1,"i use my own laptop, as does everyone else. internet connection sucks on campus"
College Sophomore,1,"You cannot be different here. This is an extremely Southern, conservative school and you will  be shunned if you are different. "
College Junior,1,"PARKING IS AWFUL!!!! They don't have nearly enough spots for the amount of students on campus, and you can never find a spot for class unless you leave an hour early. Also, they enforce the meters at the worst possible times like 5 minutes before they're supposed to stop ticketing and right before classes get out. The parking garages are always filled up within the first week of passes going on sale and they are $300 a semester and rising. "
College Sophomore,1,The food here is absolutely disgusting. Most students get sick of it after a week.
College Sophomore,1,"Almost everyone in the Greek scene is a huge douche.  They think they are better than anyone. They also see their only purposes in life are to party and watch football. The guys in fraternities also view women as objects instead of real people, and the girls in sororities only confirm this for them. Sad. If you are not a huge douche, run!!!"
College Sophomore,1,"Almost everyone goes out and parties every night so if you actually care about your education like me, you're screwed."
College Senior,1,The campus network and wireless availability is probably one of the worst I've come encounter with.  It's very spotty and in class I've had trouble logging into websites needed for classes.  This is most likely the worst thing about the campus.  They should definitely look into fixing this issue as soon as possible considering most classes and note taking for class by students is more technology focused these days than past.
College Senior,1,There are more students than parking spots.  The garages fill up entirely too quickly as does off-campus parking with the meters.  It's more worth it to take the shuttle from your apartment if one is available than to drive to class.
College Sophomore,1,I am a white female who's dad owns his own business so I wasn't eligible for any help in regards to financial aid.  Also not many scholarships applied to me.
College Sophomore,1,Parking when you're coming from off campus is virtually impossible. That is what I am doing and I bought one of the cheaper passes which runs 80$ per semester. That is for the coliseum lot which I say I can get a spot in every 1/10 days. There are always cars circling around the full lot and so when a spot opens up it is taken right away. If you did some sort of illegal parking then theres a really good chance you got a ticket for it. Many people get tickets for things such as having your wheels touch the lines of the parking space or pulling through. I did not need a car my freshmen year. If you are bringing a car it is worth buying a garage spot even though they can be as much as 400$. 
College Junior,1,"I've payed $80 for general student parking, I haven't been able to find a parking spot on any of the student lots since the school has started. I've tried coming during early hours and also late at night, and there are still no spots available.  The only parking I've been able to find has been the Bull St. garage, and you have to pay hourly for it.  I feel like buying a decal was a waste of money, and like I'm being double charged for parking."
College Junior,1,Parking is a nightmare. It takes forever to get a spot. You will always get a ticket if you are illegally parked if only for 5 mins
College Junior,1,Parking on campus is not the ideal parking.  It is difficult to find parking spots and most of the time you have to drive around for a while.  It can cause you to be late to class and sometimes if you're late to a class too often then they drop you from your course.
College Senior,1,Police is very strict with underage drinking and related activities. To certain extent even the local police department is way too involved. I believe college is a time to experience new things and sometimes they interfere with this. I do however firmly believe that in order to be able to enjoy these privileges one has to be responsible.
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is terrible. You either need to purchase a garage spot ($300+/semester) or buy a permit while you are well aware that it will be almost impossible to find a spot near your classes. The people in the parking office are unhelpful and never seem to know what they're doing.
College Sophomore,1,"This is a branch of the USC system. there is no public transportation in this area. Alot of the support services are located off campus, therefore students really need their own transportation."
College Junior,1,"I have never had an internship, but that doesn't mean I'm not looking! My university didn't focus on biological internships (the majority are business- related) so they're hard to find. Equally hard to find are internships that don't require prior expeeience. For example, I loke studying microbiology and am consideeing a future in the field. However, I don't have enough experience so I must wait another year. To gain experience, I am conducting my own research in the fall, and aiding a professor with his/hers in the Spring so that by next summer, I will have gained enough to work with a team. The bottom line is that more internships need to be provided for other majors than business. I won't give USC and F because they are starting to realise this and are adding more opportunities."
College Senior,1,You do need a car to get around the town of Columbia but not on campus because there is a shuttle system or most people just walk to class. There are also never enough parking spaces on campus. The police will quickly ticket your vehicle or have it towed if there are any violation of the parking regulations. Most parking spaces are not convenient to classes. You can buy a permit for a parking garage but these can be costly.
College Sophomore,1,A part of me feels like almost everyone's the same. The guys and girls are carbon copies of eachother and there are only a few little pockets of people with distinctive differences. It's just not very diverse but I'm used to it now.
College Freshman,1,There simply aren't enough spaces for that many people. You're better off walking to class and saving the gas. I guess the only plus is that you're classes are right there next to your parking spot
College Freshman,1,Even if you have a parking permit it's a nightmare. Getting to campus at least 30 minutes early is recommended. After 5 it's a free for all on spaces.
College Sophomore,1,"Do NOT live in the Woodlands of Columbia.  The places are beautiful but the staff and service suck.  The staff lies and does whatever is necessary to avoid the problem, and if you have an issue they will lie if they must or not supply you with bills in order to get you to stop bugging them.  The shuttles don't run at the times they say and people are loud and rude at all hours of the night and all week.  There is nothing you can do about it either because no one on staff wants to be responsible.  If you sign a lease and one person bails, BEWARE they might just cancel your lease, then lie and say you wanted to sublet.  Then promise you a great roommate but give you the wrong style apartment and a nightmare of a roommate."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is awful. You pay over $300 per semester for a garage spot that is still first come first serve, or you can get a commuter pass but with so much new construction we have lost our parking lots around campus. PLUS parking is SO far away, its almost pointless. Commuter passes are good for an entire year but $80 for no parking is pointless. Get to campus an hour before classes and just find somewhere to study... because you will miss class if you get to campus 30 minutes or less before your class."
College Junior,1,"Always receive parking tickets, if you even are able to find a spot. Garages are expensive. I live 5 minutes from campus but have to leave 30 minutes before a class just because of parking."
Recent Alumnus,1,"When asked what was the worst aspect of USC, I tell them parking. There are not enough lots to satisfy the amount of vehicles, leading to being late for class and excessive parking tickets. The meter maids are also terrible and completely unreasonable."
College Freshman,1,"It is very easy to lose scholarships, get kicked out of housing, or suspended."
College Junior,1,"The shuttle system is slow and inconsistent, and the campus is quite large.  Parking is horrible.  Just unforgivable.  They will charge you a lot for a parking pass and then there will never be parking.  There is almost no public transportation worth speaking of in Columbia.  Transportation will be a constant frustration and induce much anger."
College Senior,1,"I am not satisfied with the program at all. I would definitely get my masters again but probably not from this program. Regardless, I am optimistic about my career opportunities."
College Freshman,1,I rarely see diversity at University of South Carolina.  The minority groups however tend to hang out and are pretty tight knit with each other.  LGBT group usually have random events on campus. Religion in the school is pretty much Christian-affiliated.
College Junior,1,"Dumb, Drunk, Boring, and Entitled – I suppose if your idea of fun is to get wasted and taken advantage of by 19 year old frat boys who think they are hot before they can grow facial hair or to nail crunchy, straw hair dye-bottle blondes and never have an interesting conversation... then you might be able to look past the fact that they are also monstrously stupid, lazy, and full of themselves."
College Junior,1,Parking is horrible when trying to get to classes on time. There is not enough space. Chances are you are more likely to get a ticket by the time you return to your car.
College Junior,1,Expensive and hard to find a spot and then you have to walk far to get to class.
College Sophomore,1,"The parking situation at USC is AWFUL! Although you don't really need a car if you are living on-campus just to buy a regular parking permit is $75 & to buy one for a garage can range from $300-$500 per semester! Not too mention if you buy a regular parking pass there is NO close or convenient spaces and the ticketing is ridiculous, they will tow or ticket at any cost. Your meter runs out, $25 per day & towed after the third; you back your car in, $5 per day & towed on the third; & if you don't pay the ticket you can't graduate."
Recent Alumnus,1,"If you get on campus early, you'll get a great spot. After 9, forget about it. And don't push your luck and park in a reserved spot. They will find you, and they will give you a ticket."
College Sophomore,1,"Never Again – I could not stand living in a dorm my freshman year. Is was small and cramped, and we constantly had issues the entire year. Half of the time we had no hot water and no air conditioning. It was all girls, which wasn't that bad, but we had ridiculous rules and restrictions while the all boys dorm had none."
College Sophomore,1,"Shuttles Are No Good – Our shuttle system has several issues. There are not enough stops, or even enough buses. They are almost always extremely crowded. Also, they stop running before all the classes are even out! I hate using the shuttles and it is much easier to hike across campus than take the busses."
College Sophomore,1,Over Sale. They over sell general student parking spots so parking can be really stressful.  I had a garage spot and it was definitely the way to go. Garage can be really expensive though. I paid 360 a semester but it was totally worth it to me.

Sophomore,5,"I enjoy virtual classes, it is an interesting way of learning. The professors express theirselves in a way that helps us students all learn differently. It is fun being able to experience a different method of learning, for our own safety and protection. This will be for a long period of time where we must be dealing with such learning methods."
Sophomore,5,"I have been in YSU for 5 years now since my high school years, thanks to Youngstown Rayen Early College program that helped me stay at Youngstown State University for this long."
Sophomore,5,"I love how YSU provides affordable higher education for those in the inner city.  Youngstown is a very hard place to live but when you go on campus all of the worries of where you live and the environment just go away. 

The professors and staff are so helpful and genuinely care about the education of the students. The grounds are safe and the school is a wonderful place to be a part of.  I would suggest more parking however, that is an issue with downtown Youngstown as a whole."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently an online student only and I love how the professors keep you engaged with them as well as your classmates.  The work load is quite heavy compared to traditional classes. 

You must be disciplined and organized to be successful.  Each professor that I have interacted with has responded promptly to questions and concerns that I have had."
Junior,5,"For 3 months in 2020 during COVID I had to finish my classes online. My instructors were constantly guiding and emailing to make sure I was comprehending what I was suppose to be doing. Online classes was a great experience, I continued to do good in the classes and make passing grades. Thanks to tutoring and my professors I finished out the 2019-2020 school year."
Freshman,5,"Youngstown State University's STEM College is the only college in Ohio specifically dedicated to STEM. The resources, laboratories, workshops, and research opportunities available to STEM (specifically Engineering) are worth the cheap price of in-state or advantage area (Pennsylvania) tuition.

Outside of STEM, Youngstown State University gives fair value for the price. Due to the low faculty to student ratio and paygrades, interactions with the departments (such as financial aid and housing) can drag on for long periods of time. That being said, most professors have generous open office hours, and there are student resource centers available for Writing, Mathematics, and general tutoring. In addition, the MAAG library offers powerful studying tools.

Outside of academia and the physical fitness center, there is little to do at YSU. Student gatherings/parties/clubs are scarce. Most students seem to spend their leisure time in their dorms, or off-campus."
Senior,5,It's been great. The school really quickly made all of our classes online and I'm excited to have them online again for this upcoming semester.
Sophomore,5,YSU is definitely one of the best engineering schools in Ohio! The Faculty is amazing and is really supportive! I just love it here and will hate to leave!

Freshman,5,I highly recommend online learning for those who have kiddos or work a full time job that is not flexible with hours
Senior,5,Absolutely love YSU. It’s close to home for me so I’m able to commute. The professors in each program are willing to help their students become successful. I don’t think I would be able to go to a different school because YSU has captured my heart.
Senior,5,"I have taken many classes online and they’re very convenient for someone who has a busy lifestyle. Depending on the class, you can go at your own pace and complete work early."
Freshman,5,Everyone on campus is super nice! They want you to succeed and they will help you out as best as they can! The campus is amazing and I overall love going to YSU!
Sophomore,5,"I transferred to Youngstown State from Lakeland Community College this spring semester 2020. My education experience has been amazing. I took online classes and commuted an hour to the college for meetings with professors and to get my books. The professors are very understanding and care about your overall education and mental health. During this COVD-19 everyone involved has been understanding, which I appreciate. I would recommend this college to anyone contemplating where to go."
Freshman,5,"I love YSU, it's a great environment. I haven't had a problem with anything so far. It's very affordable and the quality of education is fantastic. The campus is really pretty, especially in the fall. My favorite thing is the amount of tutoring and free help that the school offers. Very useful."
Graduate Student,5,YSU offers many programs and is very affordable. The campus life is improving and expanding. The athletics programs are becoming more exciting. President Tressel is an amazing leader.
Niche User,5,I think this is a great campus and hey are doing a great job to help fix the surrounding area. The views on campus are beautiful. All of the buildings are really nice and the staff are great people and care about what they are teaching. The surrounding area is being redone and they are doing a great job of it.
Freshman,5,YSU is a great University with a nice campus and has loads of clubs and perks. This University is a great place to go to visit. The staff are friendly mosy of the professors are nice. YSU also has a REC center where you can work out or play ball. It's a great school with great pride.
Niche User,5,"They helped me out a lot. I didn’t know what I was going to do with my life, but YSU came to the rescue."

Freshman,5,"So far, YSU is absolutely one of the best colleges in the area. Having travelled to other colleges around northeastern Ohio, none of them seem to have the community that YSU does. Not only are the students friendly, but the staff does everything they possibly can to help aid students. They want to see their students succeed and that’s something that YSU should take pride in: their dedicated staff."
Freshman,5,"Youngstown State University is an excellent college with great academics and an affordable tuition.  There are hundreds of clubs and organizations to join, as well as local jobs that are more than willing to hire students."
Junior,5,Go guins! Youngstown state is underrated. This university offers more than you can imagine. The student involvement and resources are unmatched!
Junior,5,"Before first attending college I was nervous just like any other first timer would be, but not only because I wouldn’t be able to find my classes in time but also would I make any friends. My first day was a lot more comforting than I imagined. I met up with my academic advisor who always kept me on track with upcoming tests or big assignments I would have to do. Also if I ever felt lost trying to find a class or building I wasn’t familiar with there was always someone there who could lead me in the right direction. College is a going a lot better than I imagined and I am nothing but thankful for the people and kind acts that have been brought to me during my journey!"
Junior,5,Youngstown State University is a really good school. The professors are very nice and want to see you achieve your dreams. The campus  atmosphere is really great to very one helps each other for the most part and you will make lifelong friends here.

Freshman,5,"when I first started classes last fall as a freshman I was terrified because it was all new to me. YSU makes their students feel like home. They have great things for incoming freshman to do. The ignite program is something for all freshman to go to. The orientation is also super nice, the students get to go to classrooms and kind of see how the campus works. After completing my first year at YSU I love it here and can't wait to see where it helps me go with furthering my future."
Sophomore,5,"My experience so far at Youngstown State University has been great! All the professors are very helpful and really take their time to explain things in the classroom or even  during their free time. I have made some of my best friends at this school, if i had to change anything i wish there was more to do after classes are over, there seems to never be any activities or things to participate in unless you join specific clubs. Other than that i really enjoy going to this school!"
Freshman,5,Very diverse. Has a great campus and has a free dental and medical clinic for the community. Provides summer programs for local children.
Freshman,5,"Youngstown State University is undergoing changes that will see many different students receive countless opportunities in order to further their education, as well as meet new people through common interests and organizations. The campus is constantly getting remodeled, which benefits the students, who will see upgraded facilities, new places to eat, and a sleek look to the area that they will spend a majority of their time in. The campus is also extremely diverse, and YSU prides itself knowing that their students are comfortable with the different races and diversities throughout the university. I am excited to be a Youngstown State Penguin and am looking forward to using all the tools that YSU has so that students like myself can succeed."
Freshman,5,Youngstown has a family environment. The University grounds are open and have lots of nice outdoors space. They always keep you and your family in the loop about what is going on on campus and when you have to be somewhere.
Senior,5,Youngstown State University is always looking out for their students' safety and success. The campus is one of the safest around and have police on call if students wanted an escort back to their dorms from late night classes. Many of the degrees are backed by involvement in student organizations and specific courses that provide an extensive knowledge an any major or study. Youngstown State University's goal is to have students graduate within four years with little to no debt and have a full-time position upon graduation.

When you get into your major, your professors work one on one with you to make sure that you know the information."

Senior,5,"YSU is affordable, has great scholarship opportunities, great academics, safe environment, and lots of things to get involved with. It’s a bigger public university but has a personal feel to it"
Junior,5,"I love that my college has so much school spirit and also has times when students want to relax and enjoy the night, with Penguin Night, Family feud, dance parties etc. 
They are also improving their choice of food items and also making things available for night class students as well.  i truly enjoy coming to a University that welcomes all regardless of gender, race, religion and political views  as well."
Niche User,5,"When I first experienced Youngstown State University, I felt immediately at home. I knew that this college was right for me. The people are extremely welcoming and some are former colleagues of mine. Taking classes every other day can also help me time manage as best as I possibly can. Going forward with my future, I am proud to call myself a Youngstown Penguin."
Junior,5,"Youngstown State isn't perfect, but it isn't all bad. There has been a lot of growth in the time that I've been here, and quite honestly I don't see it slowing down. Campus is quiet, clean, and it isn't too big. There are definitely some professors and part-time faculty here that aren't exactly the greatest, but there are so many wonderful professors here who truly do care. Youngstown State is changing, and if things keep going the way they've been, I see no reason why greater things aren't to come."
Senior,5,"I had the best History professors that enhanced my major and my education. Beyond that all professors from multiple disciplines have led to a more diverse educational background for me and I have felt much more comfortable venturing outside of my major into classes like psychology, sociology and gerontology because of the high quality professors Ysu possesses."
Junior,5,"My favorite part about YSU is the teachers, who genuinely care for the students and sometimes go out of their way to help someone in need. Excellent and varried food options, well kept grounds, many study spaces, and mostly new roads around campus except one area (which may be paved within a few years). The best part is that the president of the university, Jim Tressel, cares a lot about the campus, staff, and students. Probably the easiest man to approach and have a good conversation with, and he remembers just about everyone’s name."
Niche User,5,I love my visit very friendly and informative just what i was looking for in a campus.. I got a chance to see the athletic facility and education building. My tour guide expressed and show us the whole campus in each students fields. The Admission department gave us the information to make a real good assessment of our requirements.
Senior,5,I love it! Small enough to feel known na welcomed but large enough to allow for solitude. I love that the faculty is so involved with their students and they genuinely care about bettering their futures. I have never felt like an unknown face in a sea of faces.
Sophomore,5,"I love it here at YSU I like their education program. In their education program, they really make sure that you get the experiences that you need and they put you in the field right away so you can get a feel what you will be doing."
Junior,5,The professors truly care about their students. The classes are generally well-structured and the counseling staff makes sure that students get the most out of their class schedule. The Veteran's Center is very good about making sure Veterans are awarded all the transfer credit they are due.
Sophomore,5,YSU is one of my favorite places to be. This school has so many different courses and programs and is very diverse. Plus they have so many wonderful people on staff always willing to help and answer any questions. Plus it is ranked one of the safest colleges in Ohio. YSU is like my second home!
Junior,5,Excellent school. It has a variety of undergraduate and graduate programs. College of Education has a rigorous program with a lot of required pre-service teacher training in the field. The college has a tight relationship with the areas public schools. The courses are well designed to give students opportunity to be ready to teach right after graduation.
Freshman,5,I really enjoyed my first year as a student at Youngstown State University.  The professors and staff are very great and are very willing to help their students succeed.  The facilities are very nice academically and athletically .  Overall a great school to attend.
Freshman,5,What a great campus in the middle of an up-and-coming city. The Campus Rec Center is top-notch and the class halls are always filled to capacity. Professors have always been ready to help as soon as need be. I like that.
Niche User,5,i don't really have much experience with Youngstown state university because I am just a high school senior but I do have an older sister who tells me about her experiences with the whole college scene and how she likes it and how she does in the classes.
Junior,5,"YSU is for every kind of student. Professors are wonderful and the classes are challenging. There is plent to do on the campus and around it. Great sports, organizations, and opportunity for cultural and social enrichment."
Junior,4,"I have had a great learning experience at Youngstown. My instructors have guided and helped me through the years. I am in my fourth year studying Exercise Science, without the guidance and help I would not have made it this far. Instructors, friends and tutoring have provided many options while struggling to make passing grades for all classes."
Senior,4,I really love this university. They're doing a lot for the community by fixing up the roads around the university and were very quick to make our classes online due to COVID. They're also really good at keeping the students informed. The teachers are great but sometimes seem disorganized.
Sophomore,4,"I love Youngstown state university overall. Before COVID they had these amazing (and free) monthly penguin nights that are themed and a lot of fun. They have free food, prizes, activities, and more that are awesome stress relief activities. They have both good and bad aspects of campus. Some of the restaurants/cafes on the edge of campus will once in an awhile get some weird visitors but other than that campus feels pretty safe! I love to sit by the fountain at the beginning of the fall and the end of the spring semester. Food is pretty good but I wish they had a few more options. I love the rec center and all the common areas they created within each building on campus. As a commuter, I wish they had a little better parking though!"
Freshman,4,I just completed my first year and overall I had a great year! Some communication struggles with my advisor due to the recent pandemic but overall a great experience
Sophomore,4,"Youngstown State offers a wide range of classes taught by mostly very good teachers. The campus is a safe, clean place for students to live at, and use on a daily basis."
Sophomore,4,"For starters, the campus is beautiful! I love walking to classes on nice days and looking at all the pretty trees.  Plus, the faculty and staff are the nicest people ever! They're always available to help any student with anything and it's nice o know there's always someone there to support you. Not only that, but there's such a diverse group of students that go here; you're bound to meet someone new every day."
Freshman,4,YSU is close to home and is just as good as any other school many people pay double the amount to go to.
Freshman,4,I like how accepting Youngstown State is. I never feel uncomfortable there because everyone is always so nice and genuine. The professors I have had so far have all been very approachable and understanding of all the work they give out.
Senior,4,You get what you put into for your college experience. I've enjoyed my time at YSU and I will be sad to see my days end there soon.
Junior,4,"I began attending Youngstown State University Fall of 2017 and at first I was nervous but as the semester went on, I began familiarizing myself more and more with the different resources and people that attend YSU. This college has lots to offer and also lots of ways you can get help in your classes if you need it."
Niche User,4,"I love the smaller classroom setting, makes it easier to meet new people. One of the problems for me is that I live almost an hour away, but other than that Youngstown state University is a great college."
Junior,4,The diversity as well as the student government activities! The housing is really nice as to other universities. I like that there is a variety of different foods and as a student you don’t have to just pick on place all the time .
Niche User,4,"What I like about Youngstown State University is its diversity of people and all the things you are offered. Youngstown State University has many different options to major in and minors as well, giving many people the option to explore different  careers and what they want to do in the future. Not only is it the people, but YSU is an affordable college so that people can pursue their dreams."
Freshman,4,I am very pleased by my experience at Youngstown State University so far. I am about to begin my second semester there and I am very pleased that I chose to attend YSU. The campus is the perfect size for walking from class to class and everything is very easily accessible. All the professors are very nice and actually care about their students and their success.
Niche User,4,Youngstown State is a growing university that is continuing to grow year after year offering more opportunities to students.
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman this year.  I have lived in the Youngstown area all my life.  I couldn't image going to college anywhere else, as my older brother and both my parents are Youngstown State graduates.  Enrolling in my classes was easy and my academic advisor was friendly and easy to talk to.  I was on campus yesterday, getting comfortable with the location of my classes.  I am excited to start next week.  I am happy with the way things are going so far.  I wouldn't change a thing."
Freshman,4,"I'm just starting YSU. 
I've been raised in the local area and have been to the University several times for different functions.
Great atmosphere and a lot to do.
Reasonable cost."
Senior,4,"The campus is fairly small, which makes it hard to get lost! My biggest fear as an incoming freshman was getting lost on my way to class, but I had nothing to be afraid of. The campus is small, but the brains of the students and professors are constantly expanding with every passing year. Go 'Guins!"
Freshman,4,"Still new to the university so the 4/5 stars is mostly insurance, but so far everyone has been incredibly friendly and helpful. My employer was also willing to help me start working early because I already had semester hours through CCP in high school, which was nice. The campus is very nice, and usually clean, although there is a lot of construction in the summer time (which is to be expected). Orientation was also very informative, and the amount of comprehensive maps around campus and on the app are very helpful to me, as I am terrible at directions."
Senior,4,Overall I believe Youngstown State University offers a wide variety of education to all students of many different ages. It’s one of the most culturally diverse schools and there is no reason you cannot feel accepted there. The staff and faculty are always willing to aid a hand to every student in need and some even go above and beyond to get you on the right path to graduation.
Sophomore,4,"The people associated with Youngstown State University are very welcoming to new students, making the adjustment easier, all while providing a comfortable environment. There's plenty of things to do on campus, along with having many organizations to join. Most of the professors are very caring people and try their hardest to teach students what they need to know. Overall, Youngstown State University gives students plenty of opportunities, while keeping a nice environment and an affordable college education."
Freshman,4,i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it. i like it.
Junior,4,"Youngstown State is a great school to attend, and I'm really glad I chose to come here. The campus is amazing, there's a lot of places indoors and outdoors on campus to study and hang out with friends, and there's always something going on and a way to make new friends."
Freshman,4,Staff and advisors help motivate you to succeed. I would like classes to be offered more frequently.
Freshman,4,I currently enjoy my enrollment at YSU. It is only my first semester though. There is nothing really negative I can say.
Sophomore,4,"I love the on-campus classes. In my experience, the professors have been friendly and kind.  They seem knowledgeable in their fields.  The campus is nice and there are many options for food.  The people are friendly and there are many options for student activities and things to do on campus."
Freshman,4,"Over the years, YSU has definitely made some great improvements. From new dorms, to the WCBA, new sport teams and dining, their commitment to improving the students overall experience is evident. Faculty are readily available to help you when needed and extra help with classes is very accessible. They are striving toward diversity and creating a fair and safe campus for their students. President Tressel is a great leader and YSU is a beacon of light in the city of Youngstown."
Freshman,4,I like how diverse the campus is and how connected the campus is. The professors are very helpful and easy to work with and the students are friendly and nice. YSU also offers a range of opportunities which can help you when choosing and settling into a career.
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed attending YSU as a non traditional student. The environment was wonderful and diverse. Always something interesting taking place in the arts. I joined a few social clubs and all, yet I will be the first to admit, that I did feel out of place making friends 10 and 20 years my junior. Ten years later I’m regretting not keeping phone numbers and contacts because I did meet some really cool people attending YSU. My experience going to YSU is one that I will never forget."
Senior,4,"There are lots of clubs and on campus activities. The students are fairly social, the professors for the most part are great. The campus has grown the past several years and feels much safer than it used to. The parking decks and sidewalks are better lit. There are plenty of restaurant options."
Sophomore,4,Youngstown State University makes an effort to be evolved and pushes students  to go out of their comfort zones.
Freshman,4,YSU is a hometown college. Built in the city of Youngstown. It has built up it dorms and buildings for the modern times. The downtown is getting a face lift as well allowing for students a variety of entertainment and eating establishments.  One of the new policies is the tuition promise. Your tuition will stay the same from year one to year four no matter if they raise tuition during your time at YSU.
Junior,4,"I enjoy YSU. Many of the professors are fantastic and make the subjects they're teaching interesting and easy to understand and retain. I wish the campus restaurants were open longer; many of them close just in time for night classes. I firmly believe that the university should be spending more on their professors than on their football team, since it is an university and we are there for the overall goal of education."
Junior,4,I would like to see a change in the advising because it lacks. I love all my friendships I have made and all the help I’ve gotten from professors.
Junior,4,"Been going here for 8 years (part time student) Love this university apart that the Mechanical Engineering Technology department is small with only 3 professors. I had to repeat every one of his classes. Learned more from my tutors and other students. Plus our equipment is outdated, built back in the 60s and 70s. Other than that it is cheap and good for disabled students. Having said that though when Jim Trestle became president the university went downhill. Services all around are being cut. They reallocated all that money to build new dorms that got bad reviews and no one wants to live in them, and they built a new bookstore that is now privately owned. I would love to stay and complete my studies here but not only due to life circumstances and the fact this university is starting to go downhill I have to move out of the area I am cutting my losses. I just said my goodbyes to all of the ppl I cared about."
Sophomore,4,"They have a lot of cool activities and events that go around on campus for students to get out of their rooms and meet new people. There are also many student organizations that cover a variety of interest areas. There's a place for everyone at Youngstown State. One of my favorite parts, would have to be their selection of places to eat on campus and around campus. There's so many choices, that personally I haven't grown tired of any of the options. Another good thing about Youngstown State University, is that their professors seem to really care about the success of their students. Personally, my professors have gone out of their way to make sure that I am succeeding and understanding the material covered in their classes."
Junior,4,Some staff can be very rude at times. Others can be the angels you need on a bad day. Campus is convenient everything is in walking distance.
Freshman,4,"YSU gives lots of opportunities to meet new people and get involved on campus. There are tons of different organizations to join. There are lots of options for food, and even as a vegetarian I haven't had trouble finding something I like. I haven't ever felt unsafe while on campus. The instructors come from all over and are always highly qualified and I've personally never had a bad experience with one. There are some things they could improve; driving around campus is a bit difficult with all the potholes, and it takes them a while to fix facilities in the dorms. The air conditioning in the summer could absolutely improve."
Niche User,4,"My favorite thing about Youngstown State University is the atmosphere. The students that are attending the campus are friendly and are very involved in the activities at YSU. Also on campus there are plenty of ways for students to get involved to show their school spirit such as scavenger hunts, sporting events, giveaways, festivals, and games. The professors are also very helpful when helping incoming freshman decide their major. A Barnes & Noble has recently been constructed on campus for students to buy textbooks or any other office supplies they may need for school. Also Youngstown State University offers an app for students with a smartphone that provides campus information and security at a press of a button in case of an emergency."
Niche User,4,The professors are very good and caring. I love the environment of Youngstown. There is a lot of thins to do outside campus. The sports facilities are quite good and of course the engineering department is quite impressive. The department is ranked high in country ranking.
Senior,4,Youngstown State is a great school if your focus is 100% on academics. They don't however have much to offer as far as community activities. The tuition is reasonable compared to other schools in the area.
Senior,4,"When I first started college here I chose a major that was not the right fit for me.  Through an electives course I found a major that I loved.  The classes are all different sizes; some ranging from a few students to some with over 100 students.  I have enjoyed my time here, the only downfall was that some classes were not offered during times that were convenient or only during certain semesters. I also have to take my field camp through a different school because YSU does not offer geology field camps."
Junior,4,Youngstown State University is an excellent way to obtain a competitive degree at a competitive price. Their have been issues in the past with food options or living space but it truly amazing to see how much the campus has grown and how many new choices students have for both living and dining.
Junior,4,This has been an amazing experience. I attend the satellite in Kirtland and the staff and the school have been great.  I am majoring in social work and the teachers all work in the field which helps give real life experiences to the learning.
Freshman,4,"YSU is a great college to go to if you like a small campus but the educational opportunities of a large college or university. Class sizes are relatively small the professor to student ratio is about 14:1. Small classes allow students to get he individual help that they might need or want. The educational benefits of YSU are amazing for a same state university. 
Although, there are somethings I would like to see change. There are not a lot of students that live on campus, there are only three dorm buildings in total. It almost feels like a commuter school in the sense that there are a lot of students that just go to class and then drive home. Weekends are very quiet and there aren't a lot of parties going on mostly because of the lack of students on campus. But, there is some change happening! YSU is building new apartment building the students can stay in. There are three apartment complexes around campus, University Edge, University Courtyards and they are build The Enclave."
Graduate Student,4,I love going to grad school at ysu but I wish we had more classes online and didn't have as many Saturday classes
Sophomore,4,The overall experience has been quite well in the 3 semesters I have at YSU. There are many great places and a wide variety of student activities to keep someone busy. The price of the university is also a big plus.
Freshman,4,"I am a international student and freshman this year in YSU. Over here I have a good experience, the academic environment, housing, food all of them are good expect for their diversity of knowledge about the outer world which is outside the USA Nd as well as I personally think that the living area in Youngstown is not that safe. So I would like to feel more safe around the living area."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy Youngstown State University! Here, I have found what I am passionate about. The campus is beautiful and my professors have been great so far! I have enjoyed so many activities and events over the past few years and I hope to enjoy my next few years here as well."
Freshman,4,Youngstown State University is a very diverse university and I feel very welcome.  I am having a amazing time here and I am so happy I’m attending.
Alum,4,"YSU is very good school. They have many clubs and activities on campus. Down town Youngtowns is being built up daily, so the if you are a social person there are things to do. Academically it's an average, but they are always trying to be better every year. My niece had the opportunity to attend YSU also and she majored in Finance and the CFP fast track the school offers is amazing. She was able to get a job her Jr year in college and now 2 year after graduating she her own boss. This school is underrated because of the area it is in but YSU is a good school. And I just graduated this pass Dec and much has changed since I left. So go while they still have one of the most affordable tuition out. I didn't stay on campus because I'm a Non-Trad.  I majored in Psychology and miniored in Social Work. I love the psych department We have the best chair and some of the best professors. Give YUS a try...you know you always wanted to be a Penguin."
Sophomore,4,"You get a lot of bang for your buck here. I do not live in Ohio, however, I was close enough that I did not have to pay out of state (I had to pay a 200 dollar fee on top of in state tuition). Some of the teachers do not know how to teach; in those classes, I often didn't feel like I really learned anything. However, those that can teach are very passionate and helpful. The social atmosphere here is just simply amazing. I have been able to meet so many friends, many of who have very diverse backgrounds and interests. There are many clubs here, so there is something for everyone. Campus is extremely safe."
Freshman,4,I like Youngstown State University as a whole but I wish it was more affordable for people. Youngstown is a great place full of businesses and stuff to do with friends and families.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at YSU has been great, the people are friendly and always willing to help. The professors are always there to help, they make sure you understand it before moving on."
Junior,4,It is close to home for me.  They are making it safer for the students and making improvements all around the campus.
Junior,4,It's a great school. I meet a lot of new people there and it's not a big college. Their sports team are great. The teachers like are great and the food is also great too. Everyone is friendly and nice too.
Senior,4,"My overall experience has been wonderful.   I have met a diversity of students some I'm now friends with.  Most of the staff has been helpful in assisting in my area of study.  I like that the first year of your college career you are given a Peer Mentor,  who assist you in what ever areas you need help, e.g. studying, and time management just to mention a few."
Freshman,4,"I love YSU a lot of friendly faces and helpful staff. But one thing I would change is the math department, some things that they handle could be dealt with in a better way."
Freshman,4,"Youngstown State is an up and coming college that used to be primarily attended by Ohioans. However after President Tressel took over the reigns things have begun to change. YSU has done great improvements to their roads and parkways. they have vastly improved their social life on campus as well. My first semester at Youngstown was a very enjoyable one, because I get the pleasure of a college experience while still not being too far from home. I would recommend Youngstown State to anybody.     "
College Sophomore,4,I am a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon and it is one of the best decisions i have made in my life.
Junior,2,"I have two classes that are not even taught by a professor! we have to work ""on your own pace"" according to those teachers. I paid over 1500 dollars to be in a class where I have to teach myself."
Junior,2,"Starting at Youngstown State University, I had multiple faculty members who carried a behavior of disrespect towards students present in the classroom. We also had what I think one of the poorest responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in March. The students received almost none of their money back after transferring all their classes from on-campus to online. Many colleges refunded their students most of their tuition. Many students and I determined the fair amount we should have been refunded based on our designated categories, yet YSU refunded its students almost nothing. Many of us received less than a hundred dollars back!!"
Freshman,2,"Avoid online curriculum if possible. Teachers are rarely available for assistance/communication, and most student resources are only available on campus."
Junior,2,"Was good till both Randy Dunn and Jim Tressle has taken over. A lot of programs have had their funding cutbig time, as a result the academics here suffered. They are now allocating the money to build new dorms to get more students, and more money for sports. Plus while the teachers in the Engineering Department are good, the machines they use for labs are old, like built in the 60's and 70's."
Alum,2,"Everything about this school fits the definition of ""plain"" or ""average."" You can probably have a slightly better experience at any of Ohio's other 14 state universities. The University President (Jim Tressel) is corrupt and only got the job because of his celebrity status in Ohio. I'd estimate only about 5%-10% of graduates go on to find professional jobs in the area. The engineering college does an extremely poor job of preparing students for real-world jobs and does not help find any internships."
College Freshman,2,Not worth the money for the meals and rooms. If you live 45 minutes away or less just drive. Only good thing is free laundry.
College Junior,2,"Non-Greek students view Greek students as stuck up and snobby. One of the classic phrases around campus about Greek members is that they ""couldn't find any friends so they paid to have some"". I personally know a few Greek students and they are very nice. It's sad they have a bad reputation around campus."
College Junior,2,I don't know anything about the party scene at all.
College Junior,2,There's no obvious party scene going on at all throughout the university
College Junior,2,Very little diversity on campus. Most of the diverse students are in graduate programs.
College Junior,2,"I've been chased around a parking lot by a homeless man trying to lick my face, so I wouldn't say it's really the SAFEST campus."
College Student,2,The school focuses more on academics than is sport reputation.
College Sophomore,2,Some of the professors prefer to indoctrinate than actually teach.
College Sophomore,2,"I never really see the campus security that everyone talks about, and the school doesn't allow students to carry guns, so we aren't allowed to protect ourselves."
College Junior,2,Close off-campus housing can be dangerous due to the neighborhood
College Junior,2,Financial aid for YSU is extremely difficult for transfer students such as myself. We are kind of stuck in limbo.
College Junior,2,"Dorm life is very small. The school consists of somewhere between 8,000 to 13,000 students and less than 20 percent live in on campus housing. These are not exact figures, but are very representative of actual figures. Now as for the atmosphere within the dorms, it is very sociable, and people are very open to talking to new people. Lyden house is very dirty, but Cafaro house (honors and scholars housing) is very nice and tidy."
College Freshman,2,"Even though it's in the middle of downtown Youngstown, there aren't many places to go besides a food joint, the Labor and Industry Museum, and Stambaugh Auditorium/Covelli Center when an event is taking place."
College Junior,2,"The semester before last, I would take a meal swipe at Denny's for lunch, and get basically whatever I wanted. Then for dinner, I'd go to Christman's, and get whatever I wanted. Now Denny's doesn't take meal swipes anymore, so I have to hurry and get there before 11AM, when the five dollar chicken strips combo deal ends. I can only really afford to have that combo for my lunches every Monday through Friday, because Flex points are only accepted certain places. I would really rather go to Wendy's, but I can't afford it. I used to go to Pete's place and use a meal swipe, but it's a chik-fil-a now, which I will not frequent because they are homophobic. (the company, not the employees, I've no idea about the employees). I could probably have McDonald's cheaper, but I like myself too much to put myself through that. I want an option to just put your flex and pete's points all into one pot, so I know how much I have, and can create a budget accordingly. Also, the new thing where they limit the amount a student can access at the beginning of the semester also throws off my budgeting. Lastly, I would like an online option where I can look up my account and see how much money I have, instead of having to buy something to get a look at my account- but oh wait, do I wanna look at pete's or flex? In conclusion, I hate flex points, they are unnecessarily confusing, make them go away, and give me back meal swipe options."
College Sophomore,2,The surrounding areas are bad and not safe. There is a lot of crime in surroudning areas.
College Freshman,2,Not the best place to live.
College Sophomore,2,There are very few options near campus and the ones that are available are only fast food chains like Taco Bell and McDonalds.
College Sophomore,2,There are not a ton of parties that take place and the ones that do occur are sketchy and can be a bit dangerous.
College Senior,2,They need to receive better options for the students on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Randy Dunn's smile did not keep us warm in the snow, sadly enough."
College Freshman,2,I hear a lot of students drink and do drugs.
College Freshman,2,I don't really know much of what goes on here
College Freshman,2,It's is cold and the weather is erratic
College Junior,2,The weather sucks in Northeast Ohio. Rarely any sun.
Recent Alumnus,2,My financial aid was exclusively FAFSA
College Freshman,2,"I do not know much about off campus housing, there are a few places but they are located in places that are not so safe."
College Freshman,2,"I feel like the nightlife is not very safe, it is not much of a party school"
College Freshman,2,Campus is usually never closed no matter what the weather is like. The winter affects commuting the most and it is dangerous for students. Safety comes first but the campus will be open with terrible conditions. It is the worst part.
College Freshman,2,"The weather in the area is absolutely horrible. It's so bipolar ranging from snow to sun, we can have a 60 degree day go to 3 feet of snow the next day."
Recent Alumnus,2,The weather is ohio weather. One minute it could be raining the next its sunny. Always carry an umbrella is a good rule. 
College Sophomore,2,"They are think that they are above every other student on campus, but really they are no one special. "
College Sophomore,2,The landscape of the campus is literally a wind tunnel. The winters are painful and freezing.
College Freshman,2,"The variety of foods available, however for dinner Christman is the only place open and it is the same food day after day.  I know multiple people who have gotten sick from eating there!"
College Freshman,2,Alcohol and drugs are snuck into the dorm rooms all the time!
College Freshman,2,I will never again live in the dorms! It is extremely loud and noisy during quiet hours and in the middle of the night. It also is EXTREMELY and RIDICULOUSLY expensive!!!
College Freshman,2,"In the dorms, people sneak drugs into their rooms frequently and do drug deals in the bathrooms, and near campus.  Some of the RA's in the Lyden House tell students about the random checks, and they tell the students to hide everything before the check."
College Sophomore,2,Campus crime happens very often on campus. We always get updates on crimes going on or around campus. 
College Sophomore,2,There is not mcuh night life going on. There is not very many bar or clubs to go out to that are close. 
College Senior,2,It is best to avoid night classes without a group of friends. 
College Senior,2,The issue of drug safety depends on the location and crowd.
College Senior,2,"For safety reasons, it is best to stay on campus. "
College Senior,2,A lot of parties result in police intervention. 
College Junior,2,"When it snows, it's pretty difficult to do much of anything. "
College Junior,2,I don't really use the transportation around campus. I usually walk.
College Senior,2,"I personally, do not buy parking permits.  I catch the bus and park by meters, and make use of the free parking, which is far and few."
College Sophomore,2,I experienced a bad experience. I thought my financial aid was complete but I was not informed that it was until 2 weeks prior to classes starting.
College Sophomore,2,"Off- campus dinning is bad. There are only two choices. McDonalds which is 24 hours and subway which closes at 10. However,  they are both in walking distance of the dorms."
College Freshman,2,You need a car on campus because most people don't live there. Those who do live on campus don't live too far away and can easily drive a few hours home.
College Freshman,2,Most students grew up in the area of Youngstown. A lot of people have Italian or Greek background. Everyone is democratic.
College Freshman,2,Very few options. There are two pizza places and two sub shops all on the same block.
College Sophomore,2,"I do not receive any financial aid from the government. It was a lengthy, time-consuming process to apply and I ended up with nothing to show for it anyway. My father's job is expected to be able to cover my college tuition and expenses, yet none of my family understands where they think that money is coming from. I'm having a hard time paying for my college expenses."
College Sophomore,2,"There are many parking areas for students. However, the price is so high. And the safety and availability of parking in the decks is poor."
College Sophomore,2,"You never see any drug usage on campus, but we all know that a lot of people smoke weed or do other drugs. It's Youngstown."
College Sophomore,2,Cost of nearby dining is not any different for the students as for the general public which is really unfortunate. 
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is smaller in size, it is straight to the point, and I can still live at home."
Senior,1,"Teachers at YSU have not gotten a raise since the 90's. The school supports fracking, and the head of the Environmental department does not believe in climate change. Most of the professors are kind, but are overworked and don't have the resources to do the best they can. Along with this, the last store in that area, a CVS, has shut down."
Sophomore,1,"To put it as simply as possible, YSU is a shit show. The University goes out of its way to screw over students, well everyone that isn't a student-athlete at least. The parking is a complete joke, you'll park in a lot labeled for YSU students and you'll come back to your car to see a $100 parking ticket. You have to pay a ton per semester for a parking pass just for there to be nowhere for you to park. At least in the creative college, the professors are rude, have no idea what they're doing, and haven't updated their lesson plans in probably 10 years. I could go on for hours about all the reasons you shouldn't go to YSU. There's a reason it's so cheap. It's terrible. Go somewhere where you won't hate every day of your life"
Alum,1,"As a parent, I was very disappointed with the entire experience my son endured during his first and last semester at Youngstown State University.  Before he even made it to orientation, he had two different roommates.  When he arrived to school neither was his current roommate.  His newest roommate never even showed up, so I never met him and when he did, he told my son he had found someone else to live with and changed rooms.  They finally assigned another roommate to my son after orientation.  He was 21 or 22 years old and an upper classman who had nothing in common with my son, who had been a standout high school athlete and extremely outgoing kid.  After 6 weeks, my son withdrew from school.  I was devastated.  His overall experience was horrible and now he is stuck with a $2700 bill for absolutely nothing but 6 weeks of pure misery."
Freshman,1,Mainly a commuter school. Most people live within 30 minutes and even those who do live on campus go home on the weekends. Not very good if you're looking to have a social life.
College Freshman,1,There is nothing to do on campus for underage nightlife. Most people end up leaving on the weekends because of low activity.
College Freshman,1,Parties are always held by the frats. Its usually who you know in order to be considered to be on the list to get in. All of the frat houses are in a sketchy part of Youngstown so its always a risk in going. Its really not worth all of the hassle.
College Junior,1,we don't have a greek life.
College Sophomore,1,NO FUN AT THIS SCHOOL
College Sophomore,1,WE DONT HAVE ANY BLACK GREEKS !
College Freshman,1,Youngstown is not the safest place to live.
College Sophomore,1,"There is not much to do in youngstown, Ohio. There is never much of anything going on "
College Senior,1,Scholarships are rarely updated and useless. I pay a large portion of my tuition.
College Freshman,1,There are barely any restaurants on or near campus. The food court has only three different places. It's expensive and not that good.
College Freshman,1,"YSU is a commuter's campus. I don't feel a sense of community when I am there. All the buildings are boring brick. It's a small campus. If you don't live on campus, it is extremely boring."
College Senior,1,I was just a number and they could not have cared less that I had driven 6 hours to meet with an advisor. I will never forget that bad experience. Biology dept definitely needs an overhaul. they are giving Youngstown a bad name.
College Senior,1,"I'm from out of state and the Biology major was a complete joke from day 1. They had me drive from Delaware to meet with an advisor and he was late. They were quite unwelcoming and of no help adjusting. I can only assume it was due to my race.

Also they put me in all remedial courses to boot."
College Sophomore,1,"There isn't any local shopping, recreation, or area attractions other than a park. I have no desire to stay on or near campus after class."
College Sophomore,1,"As far as parking enforcement, there is barely any. Recently, YSU has changed their parking permit policy. Before, you could purchase a parking permit separately for an additional charge of $100- $120. But now, any student who is taking 5 credit hours or more are automatically getting a charge of $115 onto their tuition bill. This gives us students no choice as to whether or not we would like to purchase the parking permit. Before, some students would pass on the permit and use the parking meters provided on the surrounding city streets. Now that every student is being forced to buy these permits ""upon request"" are now going to flood the parking decks because why not? They already have to pay for it."
College Junior,1,I don't believe nightlife is totally encouraged on campus outside of the student life center where you can find a few pool tables and over priced restaurants galore.
College Sophomore,1,The off-campus housing at YSU is dangerous. There have been shootings right near campus on side streets where many college students live.
College Freshman,1,There is a city bus that brings students to school but the town doesn't have the cleanest of people.  The cost is cheap but I wouldn't recommend the public transportation system.
College Junior,1,"Its Here – Youngstown and alot of the surrounding cities are surrounded with drugs. However on campus I havent seen a ton of it, but I know there is a bit and off campus it can be very bad."
College Junior,1,"The parking at YSU is ridiculous.  There are never enough spots, and parking passes have increased to $100.00 dollars per semester. Parking should be included in the thousands I pay for tuition. Parking meters are often broken and even if you find a safe place to park on the street you'll have to walk a mile to get anywhere. If you park in a lot that you think is open because there's no sign stating you need a parking pass to park there you'll get a ticket and have to pay $25. Finally, parking passes are a hassle to buy. Especially if you live on campus and have to buy a normal pass, then go to the parking office and get it switched with a resident pass after you prove to them you live on campus. If you work or need to be at the university to attend meetings in the summer you wont be able to buy a parking pass if your not taking summer classes. Have fun parking!"
College Freshman,1,People are doing drugs everywhere and no one gets in trouble.
College Freshman,1,"The parking available for students is outrageous. They are charging students who don't have cars 100 dollars just for more money. I have heard stories about ice in the parking garages. the attendants dont ""attend"" to anything."
College Freshman,1,"There are always people smoking marijuana. No one really does anything about it. The smell fills the dorms at night. I do not participate in illegal activities, so this is very bothersome to me."
College Junior,1,"Don't Waste Your Time as a Penguin. I love it here because it's home. But as soon as I graduate, I'm heading for the hills."
College Junior,1,"Good Looking Girls Are Non-Existant. The best girls are preoccupied with iPhones and affliction clothing. None are intelligent enough to speak to. I'm considered one of the best looking guys on campus, and that tells me their aren't many impressing looking guys around either."
College Junior,1,"I am in the BS/MD accelerated medical program through NEOMED, and YSU will not allow us to complete for full-ride academic scholarships. I feel this is unfair. Every student should have an equal chance at this scholarship."
College Junior,1,"Most students go to Ohio State for big parties. The parties here are decent. Low key, but can be fun. Frat parties are below average."
College Freshman,1,"There is a shuttle bus but it is not very helpful because it only comes at certifying times, is pretty small, and only picks up at a few places."
College Freshman,1,"Like What Safety? at orientation i remember them saying how safe the school is. ummm i BARELY ever see police patrolling, and i have never seen one of those emergency phone booths that they claim they have so many of."
College Sophomore,1,"the professors are horrible, some grade good for not doing anything and then there are the ones that are very critical"
College Senior,1,"There isn't much to do unless your're creative. Parties are lame because everyone is still in their high-school ""cliques"". It's not hard to meet people but it will take time to find ""real"" people. Bars and clubs aren't too bad but they get old after a few visits. I would recommend doing your own thing and visiting other schools!"
College Sophomore,1,"Costs Are High, Not Enough Space, and Strict Fines – Parking on campus is a nightmare. The parking decks are falling apart, one had to be closed in the middle of the past semester do to disrepair. It took what were crowded parking areas to no where to park and problems with students parking illegally and/or parking in one place all day. No assigned parking except for staff and some places only street parking for one hour, with classes that could last 1-3 hours or more."
College Student,1,I feel our Police here don't do everything in their power to protect our students. There recently was a shooting here that involved the death of my friend. It sickens me that they don't do their job to prevent things like this from happening.
College Student,1,Local Attitude Towards Students – Students here need to be involved more with the school community rather than partying.
College Freshman,1,"No Fun – i am a freshman at ysu and i can not wait to get out of here. nothing to do on the weekends. half of the people that do live on campus go home every weekend. cant even fill the stands of a football game. easy to get drugs if you want but not a problem. outside of every hall is at least ten people smoking, gross. "
College Senior,1,its a commuter school people rarely go to on campus athletic events because people live 30 minutes away from school. The most attended is football because of the day of the week and people from the surrounding communities come
College Sophomore,1,"Not Much – From what I've seen, there is not a great deal of options."

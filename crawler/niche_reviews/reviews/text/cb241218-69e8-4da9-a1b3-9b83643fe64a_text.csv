Freshman,5,"I love their degree programs, as well as flexibility. They're more than happy to help you find what schedule works best for you. The tuition and cost of books are very affordable, and the professors are extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend Rogers State University."
Freshman,5,"I take 2 classes online out of my entire college course. The format is very easy to navigate, good for staying organized and on top of my classes. I love being able to work on my school work from home, and at my own pace."
Sophomore,5,Rogers State University has a diverse and well rounded campus. All the students on campus are extremely nice and are always there to help or answer any questions you could possibly have. The professors are exceptional! They are always asking students what they need help on or if they have any questions. Any time I was confused they stayed after class to help and even checked to make sure I was understanding throughout the semester. This campus is truly an amazing experience!
Sophomore,5,"My online experience is not a lot from Rogers State. They classes I have taken though, the professors are helpful and make sure to check in frequently. They always answer emails back fairly quick. The RSU database is fairly easy to navigate which makes it much easier to deal with."
Sophomore,5,"At first, I was reluctant about coming to Rogers State University as I was terrified by being away from home and being on my own, but RSU made me feel at home. The atmosphere is astronomical and the experience is extraordinary. This campus made me feel less scared and more comfortable. I can not wait for this next semester and the more years to come being a Hillcat!"
Freshman,5,my overall experience with RSU  has been wonderful except their processing is super slow I  couldn't even get into some of the classes I wanted.
Freshman,5,I didn't do online but the campus experience has been super amazing the classes are super informative and self explanatory.
Senior,5,I love the atmosphere at Rogers State University. I feel very safe and protected while on campus. The professors are very helpful.
Freshman,5,i loved the small campus tour i took and i really enjoyed meeting teachers and getting to know some of the students.
Junior,5,"I just transferred to RSU last semester for their nursing program. They have been amazing so far! I don’t have any experience with the professors outside of the nursing program, but I’ve heard mostly good things."
Freshman,5,My experience at Rogers State University has been great so far! I attended Pryor's campus for concurrent classes and for my first semester. Next semester I will be attending Claremore's campus and I am so excited. The classes are small and easier to learn in. The environment is very welcoming and the campus is very simple to navigate. I can't comment on the dorms or housing because I do not live on campus and I probably never will because I do not live too far from the campus. I have heard from close friends that the dorms are very nice though.
Freshman,5,"I honestly love it here, the atmosphere is amazing, the campus is small but not cramped. Walking from one end to the other is no big deal, the staff is helpful and knowledgeable. It really is just great."
Niche User,5,"I visited for softball and it is amazing I love the campus and dorms. its a small campus, so it is very easy to get around. the lunch room is filled with so many options, its near the town so if you leave for lunch you can get your food and come back without being late."
Freshman,5,I love rogers state university! I feel like i finally found a place where i belong and fit in. I love how small the classes are so i connect with my professor one on one. It helps me learn better and pass my classes with flying colors.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus community and staff. They all come together and will help you in any way they can. The dorms are roomy, clean, and very well maintained! Every thing is at a walking distance which makes for an even safer environment. The classroom size is great for students who need a more one on one learning environment. Overall, Rogers State University is a very well-rounded and comfortable place to be."
Freshman,5,Great professors . Close to home. Was able to go to university as congruent student that covered my tuition and saved a lot of money. Fun place great cafeteria.
Freshman,5,"The campus is beautiful and everyone is friendly. All of the professors that attend the university are always willing to provide guidance in the fields you are attempting to pursue, and the many avenues open to the students. A dining facility is also present, and it serves the best food for students."
Niche User,5,All of the administrators have been extremely helpful and my time at RSU has been low stress. The campus in Bartlesville is small yet functional and filled with nice people. There are a lot of great events for their students. The Bartlesville allows concurrent high school students which is amazing. I have finished a semester as a concurrent student and am continuing on to a second semester. I love it!
Junior,5,I am currently a junior and I enjoy RSU for It's atmosphere and friendly school social events. They have several school clubs that i regularly receive updated information on. I really enjoy their open facilities. They have a beautiful library and several on campus computer rooms.
Sophomore,5,Rogers State is a small 4 year college that has amazingly small class sizes and professors who are more than happy to know all of their students on a first-name basis. I love the atmosphere here.
Junior,5,I love Rogers State University! I have been going to this university for two years and I still enjoy it!
Alum,5,"My experience at Rogers State was good. I completed my associates in biological science. I did not stay on campus so I am unaware of how the dorms and cafeteria is. I enjoyed my time with professors, who are all very nice. the classes are good sized and very interesting."
Sophomore,5,"Rogers State University has an amazing atmosphere. It has small class sizes, and the teachers are very helpful. It also has tutoring centers available for students needing extra help."
Graduate Student,5,Rogers State University is very personal. Class sizes are great and allow the professor to really get to know each student. The campus size is just right. It takes 10 minutes to walk from one end to the other.
Sophomore,5,"Rogers Sate University is a great school! I am originally from a small town in Oklahoma and by attending RSU I still have the opportunity to attend a D2 school without having to move to a big city. I've really enjoyed the atmosphere here because everyone is very friendly and everyone including the teachers always go out of their way to help you if needed. The campus is super nice! Everything is always clean! Classrooms are decent size but since I've started my upper level classes I've had very few students in them which makes classes a lot easier because the teachers are always able to help if needed. I've yet to be in a class where the teachers don't take the time to learn everyones name. Lastly, my favorite thing about attending RSU is that there is always parking lots open! The worst thing about going to big schools is I could never find a parking spot but here I never have that problem. I truly wish I would've went here my first year of college."
Senior,5,"Now on my senior year of college, I can say that I have enjoyed my time at Rogers State University. The only complaint that I have is that in my first year the counselors were not as helpful as they should have been."
Graduate Student,5,"I liked the possible mixes between in class and online classes. This helped me maintain a job and continue with my studies. I also liked the friendliness of the teachers. The university is located in Claremore, a town with just about everything a student could want. There is also the Davis Gun Museum, the biggest private collection  of guns in the US. Not bad for a small town! Tulsa, the big city is not too far away. This helped when we were required in one of my courses, to attend an opera and classical music concert. Sports activities are growing at RSU for both men and women competitions. While I attended RSU, the school completed its soccer field."
College Freshman,5,"My favorite things at Rogers State University include the personable teachers, and students. Classes are small and this allows me to get one-on-one time with my professors. I am glad I chose this school and I would chose it again if I had too. The small campus and population makes college less stressful and more accessible. Yet, I still get the complete college experience."
College Junior,5,I am having a wonderful experience so far.
College Freshman,5,There is so many opportunities for students here.
College Freshman,5,I love living in the dorms. I love the environment there.
College Sophomore,5,The faculty does everything to help you succeed
College Freshman,5,I have had the best experience with the professors! They are so easy to talk to and they want you to succeed! They will help you as much as they humanly can. The class size here is fairly small and the professors know who you are.
College Freshman,5,"I feel completely safe here on campus. The campus police are always out and I see them in the parking lot by where I live many times a week. It is just a nice comfort for the students to have their presence around campus on a daily/hourly basis. It is a nice sense of security. Since I currently have physical issues due to an injury, it helps to know they are there if something was to happen."
College Junior,5,"I feel pretty safe when I'm on campus. I don't really feel like I have much to worry about. I know RSU campus police will work closely with Claremore PD if the need arises. The only time I've ever been presented with a need to worry for my safety was when there was a shooter on campus last year. I think the school handled it all really well, though. They used the emergency alert system to tell everyone to stay in whatever building they were in. They did everything they could to keep us all informed and aware of what was happening around us. I felt well cared for and looked after."
College Freshman,5,All the classes I've taken so far have had great professors. They were all very helpful and at times forgiving when things happened.
College Freshman,5,The person who showed me around was awesome. He was a soccer player from Ireland. The school is very big and beautiful. Everybody is super friendly to everybody. There are always people to help each other out.
College Sophomore,5,I don't live on campus.
College Sophomore,5,I was pretty easy for me. I have dyslexia and I got my ssi number mixed up but other than that it was easy.
College Sophomore,5,"I love being a biology major at Rogers State, it is rewarding and the professors really work with you to make sure that  you learn and comprehend all the material given to you. Workload is not too overwhelming apart from when one has many tests at once, which is to be expected at nearly all universities. I know Rogers provides several internship opportunities for several biology majors including environment conservation and others as well."
College Junior,5,"Although I am an online student, I envy those that can be on campus all the time. I get emails and advertisements about their campus events, etc and if I lived closer to campus, I would attend them all. I have, the few times I have been on campus, have been impressed with their library, student center and hang-outs. I think overall, RSU is the most beautiful campus ever and it isn't just in what I see with my eyes but how I feel when I am on campus. RSU is the greatest!!"
College Junior,5,"I transferred to RSU from a two-year college nearby. There are universities that are closer to where I live that I checked before choosing RSU. Those colleges were not so helpful and definitely not friendly. I heard about RSU from a colleague and checked them out. From day-one they were helpful and friendly. Also, the degree I was going for was offered totally online, which with my situation (full-time employee) works best for me. All the other universities did not offer that."
College Junior,5,"My overall experience so far has been excellent. I have had to call for many questions about financial aid, enrollment, etc and have always had friendly responses. The professors are also most helpful. I only had one or two that weren't. The unique thing about this campus is that although it is a large campus and have many staff members, they all treat me (the student) as though they are happy that I am one of their students. If I had to choose again, I would choose RSU again. I recommend them all the time to my family and friends."
College Junior,5,"The academics are the best at my school. I have had the best and most helpful professors. The curriculum, registration process, workload and special study options exceed any other schools I have researched. I don't know much about the popular study areas, since I do most of my studies online."
College Junior,5,I think it is great. It is unique in that the workload is customized for adults with heavy work loads. Most of it is offered online. I know of people that have received their degree in what I am going for that have been successful in internship and job opportunities.
College Junior,5,I have found the town my school is located in to be friendly and attractive. There are many cultural events and activities there and I love shopping there. They have the best Wal Mart I have ever been to.
College Junior,5,"The process was pretty easy. Just speak with the adviser. She helped me with my plan of study. Also, the financial aid and admissions were friendly and helpful with everything I needed."
College Junior,5,"I am extremely happy with my program. It is designed for my type of person. I am a full-time employee and have to adjust for my education. My program is helpful in that it is mostly online and is easily adaptable for me. My career goals are to advance at the institution where I am presently employed (technology center). Getting a degree will allow me to do that. I am not too concerned about finding a job in my field, since I already have a 'foot in the door'."
College Student,5,"The professors I've had so far have been the best.

The workload is just right. I feel this campus is the right one for me."
College Student,5,"There are plenty of restaurants and fast food chains in town.

There are some deli's for the healthy choices. Sadly, there are not that many vegetarian or vegan options in town."
College Sophomore,5,Unique opportunities would have to  included the various amounts of clubs Rutgers has available. Such clubs are able to study abroad to different regions. 
College Sophomore,5,"Rutgers University is known for its diversity. Therefore, all students who attend Rutgers are aware of the different backgrounds that are placed in the same learning environment. Such diversity does not create challenges but opens the eyes of individuals to broaden their perspectives. "
College Junior,5,The housing is like apartments. They are very new and updated. Beautiful parks and amenaties
College Sophomore,5,Professors are a great help 
College Junior,5,parking is not a problem at all 
College Junior,5,the school is pretty strict but it is a good thing 
College Junior,5,i dont really go out. 
College Junior,5,"weather dosen't really affect campus, just make sure you have an umbrealla"
College Junior,5,everyone on campus is very nice and outgoing 
College Junior,5,parking is very easy and close to everything 
Niche User,4,I like that Rogers State has move than one campus for the ease of students. This allows more students to take the classes who do not wish to commute.
Sophomore,4,"With the recent COVID-19 pandemic taking the world by storm, it has been quite a journey academically for students and professors alike. It has challenged us all and pushed the boundaries on learning. While doing online classes is not my forté, I have found no problem doing them. While there can be some miscommunications and disruptions, RSU has found ways to make the best out of this situation."
Senior,4,"It's somewhat challenging taking classes online but the professors try their best to help you in anyway they can. Every time I've taken any online class, my professors would answer my emails within a timely manner."
Sophomore,4,As a student looking to complete the BSN program at rogers state I believe this college is a cheaper alternative to the other schools in Oklahoma that offer the same degree. I do not think they go into as much detail but the professors have been extremely helpful during my time at RSU.
Freshman,4,"Rogers State University is filled with positive energy, a safe environment, and an outstanding staff.  Attending this university was one of the best decisions I've ever made.  Overall, the professors, and counselors makes sure everyone is one step closer to seeking their degree. Rogers state has a various amount of majors, and  a high graduation rate. It also has a large acceptance rate."
Freshman,4,I took a few online classes as a concurrent high school student. The staff was very helpful and made it a great experience. Look forward to attending my first year as a full time student.
Junior,4,"I go to one of the satellite campuses, and the one I am at is really laid back. The classes are pretty flexible with my schedule and since I live close to this campus I didn't have to worry about housing. So, it was an easier transition for me from high school to college."
Junior,4,I have had a great experience attending RSU. I have enjoyed my classes and my professors. I also really like the the small campus and class sizes.
Freshman,4,The best part about Rogers State University (RSU) is it's flexibility on creating your academic schedule. It's easy to switch your classes around to fit your own schedule.
Sophomore,4,It is a good college experience with a great environment. They have friendly staff and are willing to help you with anything and everything. The classes are tough but are good to learn from.
Senior,4,"It is a small school that really takes seriously the task of instilling a sense of community and responsibility into every student. This leads to graduates that care about the communities they are a part of and proactively seek to be of help in any way. Students get involved through volunteering opportunities throughout campus and see that it is not just a way to beef up a resume, rather it is a worthy and noble way to live your life. The initiatives around campus usually take this similar community-focused approach and it can be seen by the way student seek to help one another.
Students are encouraged to go above and beyond in all aspects of their life to make the most of the classes and be more prepared than other graduates around the country. With a huge emphasis on placement after college, the graduates from RSU come out with great qualities that I think they would not have coming from bigger programs."
Senior,4,Overall I’ve had a great experience at RSU! I chose them because they offered my degree completely online which was a huge bonus with my small children. There were a few hiccups over the years but everything was quickly resolved. The staff has always been super helpful.
Senior,4,My experience thus far with Rogers State University has been fairly good. There are a few things that i would like to be seen improved like communication with advisers and ability to meet with them more. Also i am two classes away from graduation and found out at the last minute that my speech class that i transferred from a junior college would not work but had been told the entire time that i have attended Rogers State that it would. Had i known this i would have corrected the issue sooner therefore not delaying my graduation because i exhausted my student loans and federal pell grant. Now i am stuck because i need approximately $5000 to take two classes to obtain my bachelors in business administration.
Sophomore,4,Rogers state is a great college it’s not that expensive to attend. The college has two off branch to Bartlesville and Pryor if you live anywhere in those locations or outside of town in those locations. The professor are good you might have on or two professor that aren’t that great as a professor. The class sized are small the most class sized you’ll have is 30. The smallest class sized you might get is 6 sometimes. The tution for the university is a good price and the off branch is cheap too both for full time and part time student.
Freshman,4,What I like about Rogers State was the students. They are so kind and caring. They help you out whenever you need it. They help you create study groups to help make sure you pass. What I didn’t like about Rogers State is that you have to have a different username and pass for everything. I often had to reset mine because I kept forgetting it.
Freshman,4,Good overall environment. Easy to make friends. Classes are challenging but I've learned a lot. Most proffesors are easily accesible
Freshman,4,I enjoy the community of Rogers State University. Overall everyone is very friendly and supportive of each other.
Freshman,4,Rogers state is a small campus but that just makes every student and teacher relationship closer. They have good resources and everyone there is so helpful and will make sure your college experience is a good one.
Freshman,4,"Rogers State University is my first college to attend and I enjoy it more than being in high school. I don't have many friends, but the people are really kind as long as you say hi. The classrooms are small enough to be able to ask any questions during lectures. There are plenty of clubs to be a part of if a student were to want to be helpful and social. Rogers State University is a great college experience."
College Junior,4,I love going to school here it make me feel comfortable due to its size and cost
College Freshman,4,I love my university as a whole. I think it is one of the best schools out there in my state.
College Freshman,4,I wish there were more police on campus.
College Freshman,4,Not a lot of people participate in sports at RSU. We don't even have a football team. We're not known for being a big university that is largely sports driven. We are a small community.
College Freshman,4,The faculty and professors really care about their students' success.
College Sophomore,4,There are a few minor things the university still needs to work on. I think they're still stuck in a 2 year mindset but overall the school is great!
College Sophomore,4,This school sets you up with great internship opportunities. I feel confident in my ability to find a job after graduation.
College Freshman,4,Here at Rogers State University it is very personal. You get to know your professors and the campus is small enough to not get lost. I love it!
College Freshman,4,"Every week, an RA hosts an event that provides information to students over sexual assault, as well as the importance of safe sex, and abstinence."
College Freshman,4,"Almost once or twice a week, there will be a recruiter on campus who is willing to help you gain the information you need to apply for the position they are advertising."
College Freshman,4,"With the diversity, class style, and class size at Rogers State, my overall experience has exceeded my expectations beyond compare. Everyone here is extremely helpful with everything you encounter. With our motto being ""It's Personal"", RSU has gone above and beyond to make that happen with every student."
College Freshman,4,"Because almost all of the freshman live in the newer dorms, the dorm living is spacious and convenient for everyone."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is somewhat important at Rogers State. Considering we have two Sororities and one Fraternity, people are somewhat hesitant in joining Greek life."
College Freshman,4,"Being a part of the athletics here at Rogers State has been a blessing within itself and everyone involved with athletics, such as the athletic directors and coaches, care about each and every one of their athletes, as well as other athletes."
College Freshman,4,"I consider Rogers State my ""home away from home"". The people here are extremely helpful."
College Freshman,4,"I live in family housing with my husband, a 1 bedroom apartment. I had never heard of family housing on a campus before, but it makes it so much easier for people like me that are married and want to live on campus. It makes it so I can enjoy the campus life and my marriage all at the same place!"
College Freshman,4,I have had such a great experience just since January. Professors are easy to talk to and classes are small enough the teacher knows you. The atmosphere here is great as well.
College Freshman,4,"Boys basketball just won the right to go to the state conference! So, RSU is pretty hipped up!"
College Junior,4,"I really do love the courses and professors here. I question some of the courses that are required for my major sometimes, but overall they are okay. Professors really seem to know what they are doing and how they can best help students. There is an okay variety of classes offered, but I wish they did more online during the summer. I love the sizes of my classes. Even the few gen ed classes I had here were a good size. I'm from a very small school, so the small class sizes make me feel at home. I think it also promotes an openness to discussion. No one is really afraid to speak up because there are far fewer people to speak up in front of."
College Junior,4,"It seems like there are constantly career services and booths on campus for various job opportunities. Many of the employers recruiting on campus seem to very promising too. I don't really know anything about the alumni network, though. I do know that degrees are pretty valuable in general. I know a nursing degree from RSU seems to be valued highly. I think my Business degree will have high value to me because most all of the people who taught me have real experience in that field. I think this provides all of the students an advantage."
College Junior,4,"This is my second year living in the dorms. My first year, I lived in a 2 bedroom in UVB. I did not like that I had to swipe my card to enter the building, and it was really inconvenient that the door to the door locked automatically every time it closed. I locked myself out multiple times because I went to step outside and I forgot to take my keys. I now live in a 4 bedroom in UVA. Even though they are the older dorms, I really enjoy these. They are spacious with a full kitchen. I like that RSU has the option of apartment housing so we can have our own bedroom and shared space with other people. I was a bit annoyed that the cost went up after the construction of UVC, but overall, I think the price is okay. It is more convenient to live on campus, but I probably wouldn't if I was from the area. Because of my schedule and eating habits, I don't like that I have to purchase a meal plan just because I live on campus. I feel like it is a waste of money because no matter how hard I try, I really just don't eat enough to make the whole meal plan worth it. The process of living on campus is a fairly simple one, though. In general, I think it has been a nice experience."
College Junior,4,"I have really loved going to RSU. It's the perfect size for me since I came from a very small town in Western Oklahoma. I think one of the best things about RSU is that it is full of the best professors. They hire professors with real life experience in their field, and I think it really reflects in the classroom. It is very helpful in trying to learn the subjects. If I could go back to high school and pick it all over again, I think I would still pick RSU again. It felt a bit out of my comfort zone at first, but I have really loved it so far!"
College Freshman,4,"There are many different kinds of people on campus. I have a fellow student in my class who is from Nigeria, which is petty awesome. Everybody gets along just fine."
College Senior,4,I love RSU. It's a beautiful campus and not to big. It's a great place!
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy this school much more than I thought  would it really surprised me how friendly the people and staff are.
College Freshman,4,The area is mostly white but the campus is quite diverse.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of new sports that have positively impacted the school.
College Freshman,4,There is a large variety of topics. Professors have been there a long time.
College Freshman,4,As far as I can tell most graduates have a great job outlook.
College Senior,4,"Some of the courses challenged me to work with people in teams. Some of the courses also challenged me to think like the professors, especially when answering their test questions. Many of the professors come from different parts of the United States and from other countries. This introduces students to different mentalties or ways of thinking. I am impressed how diffrent academic subjects seemed to complment one another, as though they were mapped out. I would defntely choose my college again!"
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of rules about what one can and can not have. These ensure that students stay safe when on campus. Of course, as well, there are campus police."
College Freshman,4,"I'm not in any of the above offered, but I see great promotion all around for them and hear a lot about how greet the above things said are."
College Student,4,"They have the best Nursing, EMT & Paramedic program here."
College Freshman,4,"I am attending Rogers State University, which for the most part is a decent school.  I like that the classes are very small, and that the professors really get to know you.  The only problem with RSU is the lack of activity on campus.  Most people live off campus, so the events that are held by the Campus Activities Team are really boring and have little to no turnout.  Also, the dorms are not worth the money, and the food at the cafeteria is absolutely reprehensible! However, if you are a commuter student that eats off campus, RSU would be great for you."
College Junior,4,I have enjoyed my experience at Rogers State University. I hope to continually learn more about what this campus has to offer online students.
College Freshman,4,"Rogers State University is right in my home town. All staff has been very accommodating, from admissions to financial aid to instructors. The class size is small compared to other colleges. The campus is beautiful, easy to get around both in a car and on foot. My only complaint is the fees charged for every credit hour, it basically doubles the tuition. The school is worth it though."
College Junior,4,"The staff at RSU are very friendly & helpful.  They are willing to spend the time necessary with you to resolve issues.  Also, the campus is clean & beautiful."
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy my current school, Rogers State University. The class sizes are small which allows for me to have more one on one time with my professors. The campus is not very large either which makes it easy to get to each class quickly in the amount of time  between my classes. The advisers are great and will work with you to find the schedule and classes that fit your needs. Overall, I would chose my school again and do everything the same."
College Senior,4,All of the professor's in the business school are very helpful and classes are small where students can learn better.
College Freshman,4,"My school has been absolutelty fantastic. Everyone that works at my school is polite, kind, understanding, helpful. The staff is amazing. I have had zero issues. I am so happy to be going to this school and I am very proud to represent it."
College Junior,4,This is a great college.
College Sophomore,2,"Chapman dinning hall is just gross. the plates are never clean as theres always food particles found on the ""clean"" plates. The food is not teen/young adult friendly. They reheat the left over pizza from the day(s) before. the Centennial Center has pretty good food, although none of the food in there is healthy. Everything is fried and the grease drips off of the food there, but its still pretty good."
College Sophomore,2,"I am sure they are great if your an athlete, but if you aren't an athlete, you're a nobody."
College Sophomore,2,"Unfortunately, the greek life is a joke here. Im an ASA girl and I hate that the people on campus think we are a joke. We do SO much in the community that no one see's which sucks for us. I hope that the greek life really begins to grow as this would be a perfect school for greek life."
College Sophomore,2,There are very few restaurants that are not Mexican cuisine.
College Senior,2,"Every semester you go through the same mess of papers and still the next semester they have to have the same thing all over again. It is hard to keep off their probation list due to the number of credits I have even though I have passes all the classes I have taken, but have accumulated so many credits, some due to the new regulations put in at the colleges about sciences that are over 3 years old.  I have had to retake 2 semesters of sciences by there order."
College Senior,2,Bartellesville doesn't actually have a campus life..I don't know about the Claremore campus
College Senior,2,"there is no public transportation in Bartlesville, taxi are there but very expensive."
College Junior,2,RSU is considered a christian setting and does not take lightly to inappropriate behavior
College Junior,2,Buffalo Wild Wings is probably the best place to go.
College Freshman,2,"No one really talks about the sports. Soccer and basketball are the biggest thing. I think a lot more people would participate if there were football. Homecoming is during  basketball so it doesn't get much attention either. 

I know that there are intramural teams on campus but I have no idea how to join in."
College Sophomore,2,NOTHING TO DO IN CLAREMORE. I go to Tulsa often though
College Freshman,2,The city of Claremore does not have enough housing variables by income to provide for students who wish to live off campus. They need to partner with housing in the city and local areas to assist new or transferring students obtain their housing needs.
College Freshman,2,Some students like myself live away from the campus. Although RSU may not have hazardous road conditions 20 miles away roads could be dangerous. They have campus open most of the times when distant students risk their lives to drive to the campus. They strictly leave it up to the individual instructor as to how to handle the absents of the student during inclement weather.
College Sophomore,2,"Weather is bad in Oklahoma in general, however the roads leading up too college are dangerous to begin with. Light-moderate snow will most likely cause school to cancel. Expect to have class cancelled a few times in the winter, which is perfectly normal considering surrounding areas. Tornadoes occasionally cause classes to cancel, but its rare. "
College Sophomore,2,"Theres few apartments close to the college, but Ive heard many people complain about the dorm prices. Many people live with their parents or in an apartment because dorms are so expensive, especially the ""new"" dorms. "
College Sophomore,2,"Food at RSU Hillcat Hut dining room is very expensive, and not very good quality. Most people com pain because a cooked meal is nearly 8$. They don't have many healthy options either. They have granola bars, small salads and wraps.These options are expensive and out of my budget. "
College Sophomore,2,"Alot of students seem to keep to themselves. Students at RSU dress sloppy, and come to school in pajamas. Many students lack in punctuality, coming in class late and interrupting class is very annoying and the teachers don't seem to care. "
College Sophomore,2,"Financial aid is a big process in which they always tend to mess something up, or find missing documents. Therefore, many students find it that their only options are to take out loans, which is what I am left to do. "
College Sophomore,2,Parking is one of the worst things Rutgers provides. Permits are very limited and not convent to where the individual may live on campus. 
College Sophomore,2,They do give preference to the jocks for the cheaper housing.
College Sophomore,1,They have NO campus involvement at all
College Sophomore,1,"Theres one ""okay"" apartment complex and its still run down and not super nice."
College Sophomore,1,"LOL at the ""party scene"" at this school. if you want a party school, then you need to go find another school because, thankfully, this is not a party school."
College Sophomore,1,"I transfered to RSU with a 3.6 GPA and they gave me $500 for a scholarship for the year. Unless you are a student athlete, you do not get anything! which isn't fair at all because unlike the athlete, people like me are actually PAYING in FULL to go to school there but they don't give out any kind of help to people who are not athletes."
College Senior,1,"there is no parking just for school, has to be shared with a couple large churchs, and all the down town parking. Our campus is in middle of downtown"
College Senior,1,"the campus in Bartlesville has no parking for students unless you want to walk a ways, also it has very little in the way of schedules."
College Freshman,1,The aid office might contain the dumbest laziest people in the whole county.
College Freshman,1,rent a house if you can find one.
College Freshman,1,"no bus, so you can drive or walk"
College Freshman,1,"bad parking, too few spots for the number of commuters, and there is no bus service provided and few bike racks."
College Freshman,1,There is almost nothing to do on campus or in the city.
College Freshman,1,The night life in Claremore sucks. If you want something to do you have to drive to Tulsa.
College Sophomore,1, Claremore has very few offers
College Sophomore,1,"I think that RSU has a poor selection of food, I usually chose to eat off campus. Other campuses such as OSU and OU have a wonderful seletction in their cafeterias. I understand that RSU is smaller than those schools, but they could step it up a little bit."
College Sophomore,1,You would have more nightlife by turning on your nightlight in your bedroom. There is absolutely nothing happening on campus. EVERYBODY goes home on the weekends or they are commuters.
College Sophomore,1,"Your Friends Are the Swans – People are weird and mostly keep to themselves. Everybody hides in their dorms, it's very dull, boring, and people are often rude when spoken to. Rogers is very cliquey and it's like being in high school all over"
College Sophomore,1,If you don't have a car plan on walking or bringing your bike!
College Sophomore,1,"Punishments Are Severe – You drink you get busted! Don't do it. police get called, they walk you around in handcuffs, everybody gets in trouble. The police officers are nice, but the rules suck! 

There are no local bars close by, clubs, parties happen sparingly. IF you have a party in your room and the police show up automatic fine and if their are underage drinkers that's another fine. 

Don't come back drunk or you will get a ticket."
College Freshman,1,Very Frustrating – The financial aid process at RSU was extremely hard because the office is very hard to get a hold of for any kind of help or assistance.
College Freshman,1,The Greek Life is very small and boring. No impact on student life what so ever.. The 1 small frat meets at Wings to Go every week but doesnt do more than that.

Freshman,5,I love my college! They really care about me as a student. The courses are great event with COVID-19  and having to do things online. The teachers challenge me with great classes and offer important feedback to help me grow. I a so thankful to be a Sycamore!
Freshman,5,"Due to the recent virus of COVID 19 it has messed a lot of things up. But the staff at Indiana state have made things very easy putting in extra time to answer any questions, making sure to stay in contact with all students, and providing all information through social media or direct contact."
Freshman,5,"I am going to be attending Indiana State in the fall. The transition from high school to college can be one of the scariest things for a freshman. But, the staff and many students have made the transition for me one go very smoothly. I came into the year scared but where I stand now I cannot wait to start my classes and get involved in the community!"
Graduate Student,5,"What I love about Indiana State University is the diverse population on campus and the professors. Despite the diversity, the students on campus feels like a ginormous family in that you don't feel judged or alienated. There's a place on campus for anyone and everyone. The professors are something special, too, because you feel that they are really there for you. They want you to succeed and are eager to come to your aid if you ask for help."
Graduate Student,5,"I did not take any classes online, but some of the professors do take advantage of the online tools available through Indiana State University. There are classes that are online only, but I cannot effectively rate them since I've not done them."
Freshman,5,"For the first time in years, I felt as though I actually belonged at a school. Not only was the atmosphere inviting, but for me the college and the surrounding area was the perfect balance of tight knit community and downtown city."
Freshman,5,So far it has been an excellent experience! Everyone is very professional and willing to help you with anything you may need. I'm an online student and they've always been there to answer my calls and emails and have always been able to answer any questions. I completely recommend this University
Freshman,5,I take all my classes online and it is very easy to navigate and they make it a good learning environment even though its through a computer screen.
Junior,5,I've heard good things about the online learning and that a lot of people like it and it is very accessible to a lot of people and it's good for the people who can't come to campus and still get a good grasp on the material.
Graduate Student,5,I really enjoy both classes online and in person.  I feel that any student should be able to handle the online courses.
Graduate Student,5,"I love the administration. I don’t feel like a student number there. As a graduate student, it’s easy to feel isolated because everything caters to the undergrads. That has not been the case for me. They keep me informed on all issues. 

I'm always informed if there are changes on campus. The courses are not expensive and ISU does not make you feel crazy when you ask questions.

I look forward to returning back to campus. In my graduate cohort, we all come from various states and countries, which really makes the experience unique. As a cohort, we keep in touch with each other, celebrate each others milestones, and vent when needed.

I must say that those are rare experiences that we share. When I ask other graduate students about their experiences, they never seem to have the family experience I’ve had at Indiana State University."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Indiana State was great because I was able to adapt when I started my first year of college, I was surrounded by a lot of people who I did not know and made new friends. I also like the fact that I've learned what it is like to be on your own which involves taking care of your own priorities. And I am hoping that the school can make great changes due to the covid-19."
Freshman,5,"So far with my experience at Indiana State University the transition has been very smooth. My professors have helped make the adjustment of living in a new place easier and always a helping hand. Although, the professors are helpful the online adjustment has been difficult with some professors who are not the best with working technology."
Alum,5,"Since my college experience at Indiana State University there have been many, many, changes some that I am very jealous of. The Campus has become better than it was before I attended ISU, they have air conditioned rooms, dorms have been renovated, they’ve built a state of the art Athletic facility. Programs have been moved for the improvement of some Majors, the walk to class is short 10 to 15 min max there’s no need for a shuttle bus to class. Many of the things that need to be improved have been approved, My overall experience is something that I wouldn't change. I Love ISU,"
Niche User,5,I like the hospitality. Everyone seems that they enjoy the time they spend there. Everyone enjoys their teachers. The campus is also really pretty and it does't feel that you are by yourself. I can be myself there.
Junior,5,"I love the campus life that they offer. It is small enough where I do not get lost, but it is big enough where I do not feel trapped."
Freshman,5,I am only a freshman at Indiana State University. Minus all the ups and downs that I have had this semester with the Coronavirus. I have had a very good experience.
Niche User,5,They made me feel like part of their family. There are amazing people there and it's a great school.
Freshman,5,"I visited the campus and instantly fell in love. From the desk workers, financial counselors, fo the tour guides, it was a breathe of fresh air. The campus is gorgeous! The dorms are very nice, clean, and new. This campus is one you’ll never forget you visited. It seems to be an average size school with about 13,000 students which is a good size for comfort in classes. They have many clubs and activities for students to join and many bonuses that come with having your student ID card. This is a great school that I would recommend anyone to visit!"
Freshman,5,"When I visited ISU, I felt like I was home. Their core values that they have are inclusive and diverse. They take the time out of their day to include everyone. I recommend this campus to everyone. They have many clubs and activities that one can do. The area is gorgeous and very well kept."
Niche User,5,"I enjoyed our tour around the campus. It really helped me see where i wanted to go pursue my dreams at. Usually i am a quiet person, but i feel that this school will wake me up from my lonliness"
Freshman,5,"I never questioned why I decided to come to Indiana State. I am only a freshman here at ISU, but I have nothing bad to say about the campus or the people here."
Freshman,5,"My experience in this college has been great, so great that it makes me feel I’m home, the clases and teachers are the best and they are always helping. ISU has a lot of good opportunities and is always checking their students if they are doing well, they also help the ones that are having financial problems like me, since my parents live in Mexico and they can afford a student loan, the school helped me with some money to pay part of my balance, and I’m so thankful for that."
Senior,5,The diversity is amazing! Professors are willing to get to know you as a person and not just a student.
Freshman,5,I have learned about how to live on my own and how to use my resources that are being provided for me.
Alum,5,I graduated from ISU in 1989. I loved the small campus and class size. I was involved in a sorority and many activities on campus. I graduated with an elementary education degree and have been teaching for 27 years. I highly recommend ISU if you are looking for a small campus and wanting to get involved in college life.
Sophomore,5,"As a sophomore and in Greek life, I wouldn't trade my experience here for the world. Because of my amazing professors, I have been able to obtain various internships and made so many friends. Plus we just got a new dining hall and they custom make stir fry and burritos/omlettes. Its amazing, apply & visit!!! But literally, Indiana state is the only university in the state for all dorms to be air conditioned/heated."
Niche User,5,"I liked how each student and staff member that I had a conversation demonstrated such positive, genuine feelings about ISU. The school felt so welcoming, and their programs offer a lot of opportunities for my career of interest at the school (both on and off campus)."
Niche User,5,"I have lived in Terre Haute, Indiana all of my life and I didn't ever step foot on the campus until my college visit this past year. I loved the feel to the school. The campus is beautiful! I took my senior pictures there and just loved walking around! I love the new buildings and renovations they have done to the school in the past decade. I've even seen they are redoing their front entrance! I highly recommend you take a visit here!"
Niche User,5,"they were so nice and were very helpful. they showed me around campus and in dorms, they even gave everyone a free meal at one of the dining halls."
Freshman,5,"I love Indiana State University. ISU was not on my radar when I was applying to college. However, I stumbled upon it and took a visit and from my visit it was absolutely amazing. I could tell the kindness and welcomeness was genuine and not faked. Currently, everyone willing to help you no matter what. Another thing I appreciate about ISU is that there are so many things to do on campus and an abundance of clubs to join. There has not been a day at ISU that I have been bored or regretted coming here."
Freshman,5,"It’s a very social and interesting campus. As a student you will always find something to do around and there are many different social groups/organizations you can fit right in with. There are also mane resources you can reach out to with any situation give such as tutoring, electronic assistance etc., anything you can think of!"
Senior,5,I have attended ISU online classes for 3 years now and am about to begin the LPN-BSN nursing program. I am very happy with my experience at ISU.
Senior,5,Indiana State has become my home over the past three years. I fell in love with the campus freshman year when I lived in the dorms. The only thing I would change is the food choice in the commons and substitute out some fast food places with healthier options. My favorite food place would be George's and my favorite place on campus is the fountain and the quads. I really enjoy the availability of the professors and how each building hosts various classes for a specific major that way students are not lugging their books all over campus.
Freshman,5,"When I was a senior in high school, I took numerous visits to Indiana State University. Every time I came back to campus, I felt more at home. The faculty and students wanted to make sure you felt welcome and did a marvelous job at that. I would recommend any student to go to Indiana State University and I couldn't imagine myself on any other campus besides this one. Indiana State University is truly my home."
Sophomore,5,"I liked how open minded the school is. They don't discriminate against people, they have well trained RAs, there are multiple on campus jobs that students can apply for, they offer many scholarships, and the Dean is very nice and cool women. If i would to change something it would be the food in the dining hall, it is not the best but it is edible."
Freshman,5,I like that Indiana state is very diverse and offers a variety of majors and minors so it's easy for everyone to find their right field of study. The professors and also other students are very helpful and hey want to see you graduate which makes college life a lot easier.
Freshman,5,"I really like the diversity at Indiana State University, when I went on a campus visit I felt like I was at home, they made me feel extremely welcomed. I could see myself spending the next four years of my life at this university. I would recommend this school to lower classmates.  I can’t wait to begin my journey At Indiana State University!"
Sophomore,5,"My Experience at Indiana State University has been a great. Arriving at the campus my freshman year I was afraid of what college would have in store for me. However, the help I received, events that were help, and the resources the school provided made my first year amazing."
Sophomore,5,A big education with a small college feel.  Classroom sizes make it easy to make friends and get one on one help from the professors.  Dorm life is great and there are tons of social activities.  Always feel safe on campus.  Really looking forward to the next 3 years.  The student body is very diverse.
Sophomore,5,I love ISU! The amount of school spirit and involvement here is awesome and the instructors and professors are fantastic.
Graduate Student,5,"The professors are kind and caring, and really want to know their students.  The instruction is exactly what I would expect to have in a PhD program.  I feel that they are doing an excellent job of preparing me for my future role in Educational Administration."
Freshman,5,"I love ISU. It is an average sized school, but every class is only about 40 students. That's what is amazing. Terre Haute as a whole is an amazing place to be."
Freshman,5,ISU is a great campus in the middle of Terre Haute IN. the town is rebuilding so its constantly having something new to do
Freshman,5,Indian State University gave me a chance to restart my education. I’m so grateful for a new start in my journey as a college student.
Senior,5,Great school but very expensive. I am from Georgia benefiting from their online nursing program which is the only nursing program I found online to get my BSN As an LPN. The only thing I don’t like is that it is very difficult to get in contact with certain individuals at times.
Sophomore,5,"The campus is small and the teacher to student ratio is pretty good. Some classes are a little large but most are just the size of a normal high school classroom. Most times you are able to ask the professors any number of question pertaining to the current subject of that class. If you end up working on campus, the jobs do a good job on working with your schedule. Overall, the school is decent and is very welcoming to students of any background."
Freshman,5,"Indiana State University is a school that is full of positivity. The professors are genuine and uplifting, and the atmosphere is amazing!"
Niche User,5,"A few years ago me and my family took a special trip to Indiana State, and I enjoyed every bit of it. The campus there is much bigger than the other ones I have visited, which were in Michigan so that would explain it. When I was told that I was going to take a trip to Indiana State the thought never had came to my mind that I would want to attend here when I graduated from high school. The dorms there are very nice, and also much bigger than the other college dorms I have seen in my lifetime. Honestly I can say that there is nothing I would like to see changed about the school because to me it's perfect just the way it is."
Sophomore,5,I learn a lot about Indiana state university on how lovely the community is and how they grow together as one.
Freshman,5,"Indiana State University is the perfect size campus! It is not too big, but it is big enough to provide students with an abundance of opportunities."
Senior,5,The professors are amazing and want to see you succeed. The education level is above any other school.
Junior,5,"Indiana State University is a great school. During the day the campus is so beautiful. Students are all caring and nice to each other. There is a problem with some of the more risky areas where the possibility where something bad could happen. They say Indiana State is a dangerous campus, but I do not see it being a very dangerous campus. If you like Greek life then this is the place for you. I am a Founding Father of Alpha Sigma Phi at Indiana State. Greek life is so connected with many activities weekly. Great sports fan base to go to games with."
Junior,5,ISU is a great school with a great staff members who are always willing to lead a extra helping hand I love ISU
Sophomore,5,I enjoy Indiana state bacause it has the a degree in something I am passionate about.  The program I am enrolled in is very well taught and very hands on/enjoyable at the same time. That is what I was looking for when deciding schools and ISU matched up perfectly
Freshman,5,"as a freshman, it was very cool to step on the campus and be as welcomed as I was. the classes are easy to get to and easy to adjust to. It is a very nice campus."
Freshman,5,"This is a great school for People who are focused on looking for a great and friendly environment. Also if you’re into sports the school spirt is amazing. You have hundreds of opportunities to get involved and become apart of the campus no matter your sex, race or religion."
Freshman,5,"My advisor has been amazing, and everyone I have reached out to has proven to be an asset and very helpful during my online student process."
Freshman,5,"Everyone you meet at ISU is very friendly and helpful. The housing is up to date, clean, and homey. The campus is gorgeous and easy to navigate."
Sophomore,5,"Indiana State University is a medium sized school with all of the characteristics of a larger school. ISU encourages its students to get involved, both on and off campus. It is consistently ranked #1 in community service, and has over 100 student organizations to join. ISU truly takes care of its students. From recently renovated dorms to facilities for student aid, ISU wants to make the most of your college experience. 

March on Sycamores!"
Freshman,4,The online learning has been great at Indiana State University. It was a challenge for teachers and staff to get used to but things have progressed. The courses are well run and the technology supports the class work. I have enjoyed the online experience.
Senior,4,"It's a good school environment if you're from a small town.  It's not a small college, but it's not huge either so class sizes are good and it's not difficult to  contact most professors."
Junior,4,The environment is very good and you will meet new people and the teachers are very helpful it's a good school to recommend to anyone who wants to go to a big school that you can handle. Their are a lot of activities on the campus so you are never bored.
Sophomore,4,"The professors genuinely care about your grades within the class and will do their best to help improve it. As long as you keep an open line of communication with them they will work with you to ensure your success. Living in the dorms was average though, the food is below mediocre and sharing one bathroom for the whole floor wasn't fun."
Senior,4,"Great school, be wary of your advisors. Always double, triple check with them (as well as some of your professors) to ensure that you are on the right path to graduate on time!"
Junior,4,The classroom sizes are just the right size for students to communicate with their professors. Everyone is kind and helpful. There are so many social and academic opportunities that allow their students to grow individually.
Sophomore,4,"Indiana state is a good school to go to, From the diversity to the professors they help you a lot. Some teachers e doesnt care if you fail, but these specific teachers want you to succeed and be the best you can be. This was the first school I have went to with so much diverse, and everyone on campus you could easily get a long with.They have a lot of events on and off campus. Not only do they have events for students but they aslo have events for the major you are in. Im studying construction management and they are really great in that area, you can travel across the world to learn what you want to do and enjoy every second of it. The food is good well at least for one semester, once you start eating it too much then thats when it just becomes ok. I cant stress this enough, the professors are so willing an caring about the student futures, I really believe that the those are some of the best professors that I have ever encountered. not only do they help, they help you learn."
Freshman,4,Overall I like the college. Class sizes are perfect and a lot to do on campus and things to get involved in. Always activities going on to participate in
Freshman,4,Indiana state has created so many opportunities to me. they have encouraged me to join a sorority which has allowed me to give back to my community. the professors are extremely kind and great at their jobs.
Freshman,4,"Indiana State University is a very diverse school that has a variety of majors for people interested in attending. I hear good things about certain departments such as nursing and criminology, and many people attend Indiana State University for those reasons. In the future, I would like to see more renovation to older facilities, buildings, dorms, etc. I would also like to see the school improve safety measures, the parking situation, and food quality."
Freshman,4,I'm a freshman at ISU and I can say my experience has been ok. I feel like it a little separated but I like the professors so far. They are really helpful here. they taught me a lot about the campus and resources. The student involvement here is really good and they give us good opportunities.
Freshman,4,Indiana state is GREAT! They value diversity and helping all students achieve their academic goals! The students and staff on campus are all very friendly and willing to help you out when you need it. There are also so many opportunities to become a leader in your community. There's plenty of fun and exciting organizations to join as well as jobs to get on campus. The campus itself is homey and very nice.
Alum,4,I enjoyed the campus. The trees and old buildings are absolutely beautiful.  My academic counselor was also my favorite professor.  There are a wide array of classes to take.  The gym is amazing.
Junior,4,I enjoy how small the campus is but it is big enough that you will always meet new people and see new faces.
Junior,4,Indiana State is a great university. Over the years I have struggled with paying for school and my grades were affected by that. ISU gave me many chances and I thank them for that. I was allowed to explore many different majors without any problems!
Freshman,4,I enjoyed being at Indiana State University. The faculty is always nice to talk to and they are so understanding. They also understand how hard it is to be in college and work  at the same time.
Senior,4,I have had a great experience with Indiana State University.  Their admission process was straightforward and their faculty has been very helpful.  I am an online distant student so I have not experienced the on-campus life.  I am very happy with their online platform and the online classes so far.   One of the items that was a bummer for me was that I applied and started in spring.  The transfer scholarships or online scholarships were not ones I could apply for because I started in spring rather than fall.
Senior,4,Indiana State is focused on student success and student involvement. They strive for diversity and inclusive excellence making sure that they are attending to the needs of all. The campus is constantly doing upkeep and renovations to buildings to make sure we are safe and inspiring innovation. There are also many green practices and initiatives that the campus has undertaken which makes it all the more appealing.
Freshman,4,"Honestly, I love almost everything about Indiana State University. They keep their campus very clean, and they take pride in helping every single student succeed. They have plenty of student resources that prove every student can succeed there if they just try. One of the only negative comments I have about ISU is the safety, even though there is on-campus police.. there are still lots of sexual assaults. It seems to happen pretty frequently, which doesnt make anyone feel safe."
Freshman,4,Everyone comes together to help each other.  When students are in need other students help them.  The school is a family based school.  What this means is everyone treats each other as family.
Freshman,4,"I have had a very good experience so far with Indiana State University. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. When I went on my tour, the tour guide said hello to almost everyone, including their names into the greeting. One thing I would change is safety on campus. There are night classes and I feel that there should be a transport system across campus, other than the campus police. I also feel there should be more maps on campus. Overall I love the school and the programs."
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love Indiana State. Truthfully, it wasn't my first pick. I enrolled very last minute and wasn't really looking forward to attending because it is so close to home, but it quickly became my ""home away from home."" I met the most amazing people who became my best friends. It has a great psychology program, too. I can't imagine not attending ISU now."
Sophomore,4,"Indiana State University is not your typical midwestern college. ISU is a fast growing university that is reaching up to its potential. It has a beautiful campus and the student life and party scene are great. The academics and professors However, the poor local area of Terre Haute bog down the great things about Indiana State, especially in the case of safety. Indiana State is a public campus, which means anybody is free to roam around campus to certain degree."
Junior,4,What I like about Indiana State was that the Professors are always helpful. They want to help you succeed in anyway that they can.
Senior,4,I have attended here for almost 4 years and have joined greek life and made some of my best friends from across the world and across the nation. I have gotten to meet so many inspirational leaders from across the globe.
Junior,4,"I am currently starting my Junior year at ISU. My time here has been amazing. The faculty to student ratio is low so in most classes, as a student, you are able to make connections with professors to help you grow as a student. I am in the Safety Management program and the experience and knowledge professors have on the course curriculum is unmatched."
Sophomore,4,I am a Residential student at Indiana state university and I would have to say even though campus can seem small there are always some amazing events going on and everyone I have come into contact with is very welcoming and nice.
Alum,4,Great place to learn and have an active social life . Good place to learn and develop all the skills needed to be a success
Sophomore,4,"The people are really friendly, great helping opportunities, food could be a little better, welcome leaders are nice and very welcoming"
Alum,4,"Indiana State is a relatively small college, you do not get super large classes you get at larger universities but there is enough people that you do not feel like you know everyone at the school. The professors actually care about your academic success and will give you the help if you ask for it."
Freshman,4,"I love how friendly everyone is! The campus is gorgeous and the town around it has so much to do. There are many different clubs and organizations to join, too! Fraternities and sororities here are much different- they are definitely not the stereotypical version from movies. Overall, it is a great, overlooked school!"
Freshman,4,I love the diversity I love the campus life and the greeks I love the color blue it is my favorite I love how students express them selves around campus I wish teachers would give help tp students more and they need to better the jones hall dorm
Freshman,4,Indiana State University does well at transitioning students from high school to college and small towns to a diverse campus. The classes are not unnecessarily hard and are very manageable. There are always lots of things to get involved in on campus.
Niche User,4,I like the campus because it is beautiful. The best part of the campus is the water fountain in the middle of campus. I also like that it is very diverse.
Sophomore,4,"The campus itself is about average I would say and the food may be somewhat lacklustre. However, the staff is excellent, particularly in the technology field. They are extremely understanding and make personal connections with you."
Freshman,4,"The size of the campus is excellent, everything is close-by and most of the teachers are quite good. There are also a hundreds of club activities to be apart of, as well as many fraternities and sororities to join if interested."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is very nice and clean, and the people are friendly. I enjoy my classes. My professors are all good as well."
Freshman,4,"It's not to far from home. It's an great experience, having to learn how to leave without a parent around. College really help you make choices you never thought you'll make you will make in life. This experience really hit me with reality for the good of me."
Freshman,4,Beautiful Campus with housing newly renovated in areas. New interiors and changes happening all the time.
Freshman,4,"Indiana State is a nice place to go if you're looking for a medium size college. The campus is a good size with the furthest buildings ten minute walk from the student housing towers. Good range of activities, only bad thing is half the people you come in with leave/drop out by second semester."
Niche User,4,I enjoyed the class size and the fact that it's medium size college. It also appears that there are a lot of activities to get involved in. I don't currently play sports but I think I can find something there to get involved in.
Freshman,4,I love how diverse the campus is. This is definitely my dream school and it is close to home so I'm not homesick at all.
Sophomore,4,"I believe that Indiana State can up their quality of food from Sodexo. There have been countless times I and others have experience post-meal discomfort. The taste of the good isn't even good. I realize the residence halls have each been getting their turn being renovated but the Lincoln Quads were not up to code and students were living in them, they're out now, but the prioritizing the safety of students in the order that they renovate buildings. Lincoln Quads should have been shut down come to the end of the past year."
Freshman,4,"Indiana State is a great college overall and excels especially in community service. This focus on service around the community is a great way to be involved at the college and start your skills in networking . The campus is beautiful and is constantly being improved and expanded, but my one complaint with that and the college overall is the amount of machinery being moved in and around campus blocking road ways."
Sophomore,4,I have got to experience the on campus living which introduced me to a lot of new people and friends. I have enjoyed that. The thing I like least or that needs fixed is the financial aid department. I don't feel as if they are helpful enough to out of state students.
Senior,4,"Overall a good school, I would like to see more instruction interaction, instead of a system grading papers."
Senior,4,"Indiana State University is overall a great school. Most professors really care about their students and want them to succeed.  While people complain about the dining on campus, I think we have a wide variety of options and that both dining halls are yummy (while Lincoln is smaller and has less variety, it is cheaper,and Sycamore is definitely the best... since they are buffet style you really get your money's worth). I also appreciate how diverse the student population is, as there are many international students."
Sophomore,4,"Indiana State University is a great choice for a four year college. They have a very diverse campus, filled with different resources to help you complete your goal. Tutoring is readily accessible though the library and also the professors. The financial aid office and the advisor building both have great hours and you can find any information you need.  Campus life is very fun. Their are plenty of clubs and groups to join as well as a awesome athletic program.  A beautiful recreational center where you can take a work out class or relax in the hot tub. Campus food is pretty good. Their are a variety of different fast food options as well as the dining halls for daily meals. Overall Indiana State is a great school ."
Freshman,4,"I really loved it there. The professors are nice and helpful. The dorm rooms are not to bad. Also, everyone is really friendly."
Senior,4,"Indiana State University has given me many opportunities academically, socially, and for personal growth. I have really found myself here and feel I would not be the person I am today without the privileges and events ISU has offered. I made the right choice coming here and I would definitely recommend this college to people looking to further their education while finding their true selves."
Alum,4,I loved the Suite Dorm. I came from a large family and moved in with  4 sisters! The walk to campus library was great and the city had a small town feel.
Sophomore,4,"I just finished my sophomore year at Indiana State University, and so far I have had a fairly well experience. It was definitely a culture shock because it is a very diverse community. You have no choice but to adjust to the environment in order to do well socially as well as academically. How are my classes? I enjoyed so far most of my classes and the teachers I have had. But, it is very important that your teachers are on top of grading your work and making sure they are grading your work fairly. What I'd like to see change is the faculty to do a little better job to hear the voices of the students because there have been times where we have had situations that affected the whole school and there has not been much change. Other than that, they are good at making sure you succeed."
Freshman,4,I liked the campus and all of resources available to me. It is a very friendly environment and everyone is extremely helpful. The campus is also smaller so everything is walking distance and isn't that far of a walk. There are also a lot of events that go on every week so there is always something to do.
Freshman,4,"When I was a senior in high school, I hear about Indiana State University. During orientation I was inspired by the people and how happy was to be hear. My freshman year was eye opening and I enjoyed every minute. I never really had friends until I came to Indiana State. In college you to stay focus and do different things out of your confident zone."
Freshman,4,"I love Indiana state, however the campus food could be better! There a lot of opportunities to join organizations. Their are many ways to get involved including school activities, or athletics."
Alum,4,"My experiences at Indiana State University was life changing. I was just thrown into the college life. After graduating and leaving Terre Haute, I realized I missed the campus and campus life. I miss the eagerness of running to the commons on Fridays when credits were starting at 1p.m. I miss the homecoming tailgating. I loved and miss the numerous opportunities for free t-shirts, I felt like I got a new t-shirt every month. I loved when it was a nice sunny day and the fountain was on and everyone was out socializing around the fountain. Some students even had water balloon fights out there. Indiana State University was my home away from home and I truly miss it."
Junior,4,"There is a supportive environment within the university to have questions or concerns addressed. With a recent change from aviation management to professional flight, the overall transition has been smooth and I have a clear and exciting view of my degree path. The aviation program offers new and growing learning opportunities, including a degree in unmanned systems, which was part of my initial draw to ISU.  I am also pleased with the connections and networking opportunities offered through the aviation dept. I feel very hopeful about related job opportunities available after graduation."
Sophomore,4,"Indiana State is a fun, diverse, and educational university that is perfect for any student. ISU has a range of classes that allows students to take interest in anything they want; there are also tons of clubs and activities open to all students."
Sophomore,4,"I love the freedom of ISU. You can be yourself and basically do things on your own. I feel as if it is good at setting you up for adulthood. The thing I would change is campus safety. I don't always feel the most safe on campus, especially at night. I would suggest taking more measures to ensure classroom safety and maybe having more security on campus at night."
Alum,4,We I was a student at Indiana State University I have a good experience at this school.  I like most about the school is that the city where the school is located is a pleasant place with low traffic.  What I would change is their should be more public transportation in the city.
Sophomore,2,The online classes were a struggle for everyone. With the corona pandemic it causes a huge switch in how the classes were taught. Online classes are much harder and is a lot of you teaching yourself all the information needed within the classes.
Sophomore,2,"I would like to see a more inclusive environment. They pride themselves in being diverse, but they forget being diverse is based on more than color and gender identity (though these are huge and important). They are in a steady decline. The party scene is hard to get into without connections to Greek life, frats reject more than they accept, ""black"" parties get shut down and are never registered, people are quick to call the cops for underage drinking (of course people get ticketed)"
Senior,2,"While my classes have been good, I have had many poor customer service experiences with administration offices. Advising and financial aid have both run me around, wasting months of my time and thousands of dollars."
Freshman,2,There is never anything around campus to do and the professors here do not actually care what they are teaching . If something is broken it is never fixed and the dorms are all unclean and disgusting
Niche User,2,The university was diverse and you got to meet a bunch of people. I felt like it was no different than a community college. The campus doesn't have much to offer other than a fountain and it's small campus. There's nothing to do surrounding the school and it lacked clubs/activities outside of Greek life. The towers to call campus police never worked so in some ways it lacked safety because they oversell parking passes and you have to walk a ways to get back to your dorm from the parking lots. I felt it was a waste of money and a joke for an education so I decided to transfer.
Alum,2,Money hungry.  Charged a $100 per semester fee for the recreation center that was in construction years before it was done and I was gone by then.
Sophomore,2,"I enjoy being in college , but I feel like Indiana State University is not the right place for me to be. I have not had a single professor that I actually liked, and there is not very many classes to choose from for electives. Plus, my academic advisor never helps me and the only time I ever hear from her is if I email her multiple times. My math teacher never emailed me back once the entire semester either, which makes it hard to communicate. Also, they say they offer free tutoring but I went to the session 3 times and each time the tutor did not show up."
Junior,2,the professors clearly couldn't care less about their students or when a student is struggling in their class.  these professors don't encourage their students but instead degrade them and ruin their confidence.
Freshman,2,I would like to see change in the facility.  It's like they don't care about us when we complain unless it is posted on social media and has thousands of shares.
Recent Alumnus,2,I had showed interest in the nursing school years ago and spoke and emailed the office plenty of times and some how i fell off their radar and did not get informed of changes made in the application process.
College Freshman,2,"Living in a dorm is one of the worst things ever. There is mold in the bathrooms, the floors are crap, and it is way over priced. These are all reasons why I am not living on campus next year."
College Sophomore,2,"I had to share my dorm room with two other guys.  We were in a very small room with a very small bath.  We were fortunate enough to have air conditioning.  But the room could definitely use updating.  For what you have to pay, all rooms should be air conditioned and the walls painted nice, nice flooring in.  The curtains need to be update also."
College Freshman,2,Safety on campus isn't horrible but a lot of fights do happen outside of the dorms at late hours.
College Freshman,2,The dorms are very expensive and not even worth payin that much money to stay on campus.
College Freshman,2,"The value of a degree at Indiana State I would say is poor. Many kids here during my first semester dropped out of college or transferred to a different college in hopes of getting a degree there. I'm sure as adults we are all here on a mission to get our degree, but the work ethic and perseverance to do so, lacks a little at the school."
College Senior,2,I hated living off campus.
College Senior,2,I always enjoyed our friend's parties but Frat. parties did not interest me. It's best to go outside of ISU for your partying needs.
College Senior,2,It takes a file to complete and takes a while for them to get you your money. Some people wait 3 months after school has already started!
College Freshman,2,"I was able to have the option of a little financial aid for my first year even though my grandmother had a fund to pay for the whole cost.  I'm still not sure what I will be awarded for my second year, if any at all.  For the first year I was awarded $5500, out of the cost of $21000.  I was also awarded the Midwest scholarship for 4 years which is about $7000 per year.  I am afraid, however, that I will lose that scholarship because some of my friends have lost their awards and had to withdraw from college altogether.  I guess a tip would be to read the fine print and make sure future decisions do not impact keeping the aid or scholarship award."
College Sophomore,2,The way my package was worded it seemed like I was egible for grants and scholarships but it was actually loans. Already in much debt and my educational experience average.
College Junior,2,"Parties are often exclusively Greek, although girls can get in with a little effort (i.e., cleavage). Parties aren't very often, and they are usually pretty bad. You can choose between either: ATO, where you'll be assaulted; Phi Delt, where they'll rage but no one will want to come near you, or you can just go to a different campus and have a lot more fun. My friends and I would go to parties at Rose Hulman and they were better than ISU's parties."
College Sophomore,2,People get away with things easy
College Sophomore,2,Seems very unsafe at times
College Freshman,2,i dont care for it
College Sophomore,2,"I do not like what I chose to do. The money is not good, it takes a lot of time."
College Junior,2,"Although the police station is on campus, there seems to be more crime than you would think. There has been threats to shoot up the school and there has also been a shooting on campus."
College Freshman,2,"I personally loved our ensembles and chances for performance. However, there are many teachers who go extremely fast with their lesson plans. The workload is enormous: with practicing, theory and skills homework and piano practicing ontop of any core classes you are taking. If you aren't ready or can't work hard, do not choose to be a Music Major. Most music majors are pushed to the limit in credit hours, as I had 16 credit hours first semester, and 18 credit hours 2nd semester. I was super stressed out all the time, and my major started becoming a job that i didn't want."
College Freshman,2,"There have been numerous occasions when my neighbors would be smoking marijuana and the smell would drift into my room. The smoke alarm would go off, but no one ever came to see what the issue was (partially my RA's fault). However, even at the smoke-shacks there have been instances where cops have caught students smoking ""cigarettes"" that were really joints. There is not much peer pressure in it, i've never been forced or even asked to go to a party with anyone. However I'm betting that around 3/4 of the students on campus have already been to a party their first year on campus. There is always a party going on off campus in the Fraternity and Sorority houses. Many people drink alcohol and smoke marijuana on this campus."
College Sophomore,2,The winters are awful and terre haute is very windy
College Sophomore,2,The price for the university apartments is expensive
College Sophomore,2,Some  students  smell  like  marijuana.
College Sophomore,2,The  weather  is  very  bipolar  in  Terre  Haute.  One  minute  it  is  hot  next  it  is  cold.
College Freshman,2,"It's fine to live here, but when I want a girl to sleep over on the weekends and she can't because of the curfew it gets a little stupid"
College Freshman,2,The wifi network is terrible here
College Sophomore,2,"This is a dangerous area for living,where violence is an everyday occurrence."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not options for vegans who want an those who want to eat fruits and vegetables as a majority of their diet, without the added fat and salt."
College Freshman,2,It because It difficult to fine spot those meter people are on you fast even if your just running in for like ten minutes. So it make difficult how much it cost to for you only being able to part in some parts.
College Sophomore,2,"It's nevr really anything off campus that's close and not expensive. Everything is either far, to expensive, not good in quality, or landlords aren't helpful nor have any good people skills."
College Sophomore,2,Students are drunk and really loud and the halls smell like marijuana and alcohol all the time.
College Sophomore,2,"The transportation is bad. The buses are too small and run to slow. There needs to be a improvement in the public transportation system. The bus drivers don't respect the fact that there's no seat belt's. Therefore driving really fats, hitting every bump, swerving etc is not good. I also don't like the bus schedule most students work off campus and have to leave out 2 hour's early just to get to a certain destination."
College Sophomore,2,There were a lot of people in my classes that had hangovers. Once someone asked me if i would sell them my pills. I ran away from them!
College Freshman,2,There tends to be a large number of non-students on campus.
College Freshman,2,when it snow's results in campus closing.
College Sophomore,2,It is Indiana. What more is there to say about it?
College Sophomore,2,For a good price you might get an apartment that looks bad on the outside but good on the inside.
College Sophomore,2,"Horrible, not much of different restaurants to try. All chain restaurants mostly. Really small city actually"
College Freshman,2,Homelessness is very well seen
College Freshman,2,In the beginning of the school year it is fine. Now when it comes to the winter time it is AWFUL! We have had three blizzards already and out of three blizzards school has only been cancelled twice for freezing temperatures. It is very dangerous and cold outside and I think it makes the teachers look inconsiderate of students because we have to walk distances to class in the conditions and could risk getting sick. Most students will not even go to class on these hazardous day which will result in a absent and points will be loss. This seems unfair to me because I have to risk getting sick walking in the weather or it will affect my grades.
College Junior,2,"Financial aid is hard to come by, if you want scholarships. You have to have a real sob story it seems, almost one that sounds made up, to get anything."
College Junior,2,"Not very many attractions or activities to choose from. People resort to drugs and sex. Not very many cultural events,not a lot of celebrations of diversity. If you know people that are in higher places, who are ""In,"" you have a better time writing your ticket and getting into opportunities."
College Sophomore,2,The weather here is your typical mid west four seasons type of weather. I'm not a cold weather person but if you're used to Midwest weather then it's not too bad. 
College Sophomore,2,There aren't many nice people in Terre Haute. If you work off campus and deal with these people they are snobby and rude towards you.
College Junior,2,"Another area ISU makes you pay a lot for that you get little return on. This year they got a new chef and completely redid the menu to try to be ""healthier"", which is great, but all the food tasted AWFUL! On top of that, they provided less options than before, so there was nothing really else much to eat besides the nasty entrees or going to stuff your face with pizza and burgers. Not very good options. It was so bad they actually gave up a bit on their new entrees, since NO ONE was eating them.
As for budget recommendations, don't go crazy in the Commons with fast food. You'll run out Commons Cash before you know it. As much you probably don't want to, try to eat in the cafeterias as much as possible. You'll get more out of your meal plan that way."
College Junior,2,"If you have the ability to live off campus, do it. You pay an exorbitant amount to live in the dorms, and only a few dorms even feel like ""standard"" living. If you're a freshman, don't expect AC unless you're entering class is so big they have to stick you in whatever rooms are available outside the freshman dorms. 
I don't think there are many problems with Hines, Jones, Sandison, Burford, or Pickerll, but expect to battle the elements in the Towers and the Quads. You're also likely to get screwed by Residential Life with your roommate, as it doesn't even seem to match you with the questions they ask. "
College Junior,2,"Permits are over $100 now, and parking is horrendous, if only for the placement of parking. A few of the lots by dorms are either staff lots or have been transformed into pay lots. Another lot is now being turned into a dorm! Which leaves way less parking for students near dorms, and the only time you are lucky to find a spot is Thursday-Friday when people go home for the weekend. 
While the school SAYS there is ample parking for everyone, they're talking about the huge parking lots on the complete opposite side of campus away from dorms and classroom buildings."
College Freshman,2,"There is little to do except go shopping or see a movie. There are a few museums around, and there is a couple of parks and a state park close by. It's somewhat safe, but I would not walk anywhere."
College Freshman,2,"I have had a major lady bug problem for a few months. I also don't like that at the first floor of my dorm, there is no community kitchen for people to actually cook food. Just a community microwave and refridgerator. "
College Freshman,2,"It's always soooooooooooooo hard to find a parking spot, especially at night!"
College Freshman,2,"It's not my type of town coming from Indianapolis. The school atmosphere is nice, but a lot of the students I know from high school. The town in general is boring, not much to do. Everything is so far from the school. The mall is nothing great. I am just used to Indianapolis, Terre Haute isn't exciting at all."
College Junior,2,campus security is a concern 
College Freshman,1,"Indiana State is very limited. For me to be paying as much as I do yearly they are really behind on renovations for new halls. The food choices are horrible. Every single day it is the same food! Most of the time, it is not hot!;even when the doors just opened. The commons is super expensive for no reason at all! Then the rooms are bad! The first week I kept on wondering why I was getting bit; I thought it was a spider! I was so wrong! Bed bugs!!!! Not only in my hall but in the Quads as well. My friend had a roach and they asked her, ""Which kind, we have many!"" ISU always throws in our face how they are number one for community service when they should work on their food quality, room quality, and quality of their school overall! If I was given the chance to talk to high school seniors about coming to ISU, Id say anywhere but here!"
College Freshman,1,ISU financial aid sucks! The financial aid office is so slow and they try to cheat you out of a lot of money.
College Freshman,1,The food on campus by Sodexco is pretty bad. I always end up eating in my dorm unless I have to eat something quick before class.
College Senior,1,This place is not good and cleanliness is out of the question
College Senior,1,This is by far the worst place that I have ever been to
College Sophomore,1,It is so difficult to receive assistance at ISU.
College Senior,1,"Not all of my Financial Aid was given to me when needed, I was checking on the statuse of my loans seven days a week for about 3 weeks. Terrible process."
College Junior,1,I do not live on campus.
College Junior,1,I really don't associate with any one on campus.
College Freshman,1,There's to many students with cars than there are parking spots
College Sophomore,1,"The weather is really bad in the winter here in Terre Haute IN, and campus won't be closed no matter what. It usually takes me 20 minutes to walk to class when the snow is bad."
College Sophomore,1,"Unless the state of Indiana declares a state emergency, you are going to class."
College Freshman,1,Financial aid for college is terrible. That is one thing I hate the most about college. Financial aid is extremely stressful especially for my family and I. I wish it could be easier. But I do understand college is a business therefore we have to pay.
College Freshman,1, I completely hate trying to find a parking spot. I also hate the parking passes. I think that if we pay for a parking pass their should be enough parking spots. It is very difficult to find anywhere close to park.
College Freshman,1,This school has the worst math teachers. I have even had a horrible Philosophy teacher. My english teacher is great though.
College Sophomore,1,"There is not any very convenient transportation. The campus does allow students to ride free, which is a plus. The transportation is pretty sketchy. It would not be something someone would want to ride alone on. "
College Sophomore,1,I do not know anything about off campus housing. I live quite a ways away from campus.
College Sophomore,1,I do not go to parties or live on campus so I can not really say.
College Freshman,1,"Financial aid people that work here ripped me off they had me believing I had enough to pay for everything come to find out when I got here I had to take out 2 loans and when I took out the second loan which was enough to cover for the rest of my bills the lady said I wasn't eligible for the full loan. the total loan was 3,000 a semester I only had a little over 2,000 left to pay but the lady told me that I could only get 1,000 I can understand if they don't want to give me the full 3,000 but they had the ability to give me at least 2,000 and while I was there the lady tried to give me a parent plus loan which is a loan for your parent to take out on you but my mom can't do that so we'll have to pay out of pocket for the rest of the bills someway and I learned there is also a processing fee of $10 which they sneak out of your loan so technically I'm really getting $990.00 back to pay for the bills. I came here because it was a cheaper option to begin with and I had scholarships and grants that would have covered the basics tuition and room and board (which cost way more then tuition especially considering I got the cheapest dorm which does not include air conditioning) so the fact that I'm already digging my whole in debt freshman year due to sneaky hidden fees and even sneakier financial aid people who work here makes me ticked"
College Sophomore,1,There are no real city busses but some small buses that gives transportation to some areas in Terre haute that's is free to college students. The best transportation is to have your own car to get around.
College Junior,1,"I have never felt safe on the campus. It is a small, beautiful, safe place to be. Keep your doors locked to avoid petty theft or late-night pranks. And be warned that Campus Security are pretty cool."
College Freshman,1,There are always fighting for parking spots. If you dont get there  a certain time of day you dont get a spot
College Freshman,1,The cost of parking on campus is a bit high. Finding parking spots during the day is difficult.
College Freshman,1,"I honestly hate the food in the dining halls at Indiana State University. I don't know what it is about it, but most of the food is very nasty. The food tastes old , well at least every time I've eaten in the dining halls. The only food that tastes good in the dining hall is the salads and fruits."
College Sophomore,1,The campus has a lot of rules about underage drinking and drug use. These rules do not get followed very often. The only time that anything is done about either of the above is if someone is caught outside drunk or high. Even then they get a verbal warning and have to attend AA meetings or drug abuse meetings.
College Freshman,1,There is nowhere to park during the week. People pay for a parking pass that cost so much but you never can find anywhere to park.
College Freshman,1,The Greeks pretty much own everything. There aren't many activities to do if you're not in Greek life or on a sports team.
College Freshman,1,"The dining hall is one of the worst places I have ever eaten at. Many of my friends got sick for a few days after a meal that wasn't prepared properly. The Commons has pretty decent food but there aren't really any economical options for anyone trying to stay healthy; it is extremely hard to do. I feel that if the school redid the way that the food was made, and included a better variety the school would be much improved."
College Sophomore,1,"You have to get to classes about 30 minutes early or there will be no spots. All of the close lots to the buildings are pay lots. The just converted half of the Rec Center parking lot into a faculty lot, and there are always at least 70% of the lot being unused because hardly any faculty members park there. It is so inconvenient when you want to go work out and have to park further away. Not to mention parking passes are $125 dollars when half the time you can't even find a spot. I often stay with my friends who live on campus in order to avoid wasting gas and being late by trying to find a spot."
College Freshman,1,"Im not a driver, but from the complaining that I hear, parking is terrible and a real living nightmare for students and faculty members."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking at ISU is atrocious. There are not enough parking spots for everyone parking on campus, especially with the designated lots for staff and students. To top it all off, one of the parking lots is now being turned into another dorm, so there is even less parking available."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is awful on campus! Students pay about $120 for a parking pass a year, but the student lots are decreasing. The lot right off of the third street entrance in front of the towers used to be a student lot, but is now a pay lot. They also took away another student lot and gave it to faculty because they are building in their old lot. My roommate gets better parking two blocks off campus for free than I do! "
College Senior,1,"There isn't much parking for students. Our campus is growing in size of buildings and student numbers, but there seems that faculty has to have 3 times as many parking spaces and half don't get used at all. So most students have to park off campus."
College Freshman,1,It Depends on Where You Are. If you are on a certain floor or in a certain dorm and you are having a good time with your friends either the RA will yell at you for being to loud or not say anything after being complained to by another person. Some are looked upon as racist and there have been instances where I believe that to an extent.
College Senior,1,"Food Is Crap – They give us the same food everynight and it gets very tiring.  My freshman year they had a different food every night and it was good.  Then their was budget cuts and then I honestly believe made the food worse than what is served at my highschool.  Then on weekends, the only choice you have is fast food in the commons and that gets very tiring after a while.  Then on sunday, one of the dining hall opens for brunch and is expensive even with credits.  Its 15 credits for brunch vs 6 credits for lunch/breakfast.  And the brunch is terrible.  Its all greasy and cold."
College Senior,1,"The City of Terre Haute is a miserable town.  The drug and crime rate is high and their is nothing to do.  Their is a mall but its very small and almost impossible to get their if you dont have a car.  Their is nothing to do on campus and on the weekends, food and entertainment choices are limited."
College Senior,1,"Our school fails at this part.  They offer a parking pass to every student on campus.  Its a 124 dollars as of me writing this but they only have enough parking for half the students on campus.  So if everyone on campus has a car, only half of the students have some place to park.  Its a very unfair system especially for freshmen because they sell you a pass thinking your guaranteed a spot and the chance of finding a spot is very small."
College Senior,1,"Poor Athletic Department – The school phased out or are currently phasing out sports that do well but that are not major sports like football or basketball.  Our basketball team did go to the NCAA final 10 but was kicked out first round which wasnt a big shocker.  The football team is terrible.  The only team that is ok is the Track teams.  Other than that, our sport teams are not good at all."
College Student,1,"Fin Aid – horrible, please check on your aid and scholarships once a month starting in at least may"
College Sophomore,1,Permit Costs – The parking permit is around $80 with barely any parking spaces.

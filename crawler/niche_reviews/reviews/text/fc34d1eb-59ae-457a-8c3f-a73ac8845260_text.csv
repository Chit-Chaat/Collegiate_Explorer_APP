Senior,5,"It was good, they made it interactive with case studies, zoom meetings, and assignments that made it more than just staring at a screen."
Freshman,5,"Great professors make learning fun and easy. There is always something to do on campus, whether it be a sports game or another event there is always stuff to do. It is also really easy to connect with the fellow student given that the class sizes are small and there are not a lot of students on campus. Siena Heights is exactly the place I want to be!"
Freshman,5,"Overall, Siena has offered me a good space to grow and become the best version of myself while also becoming a better student."
Freshman,5,Siena Heights is a diverse friendly small university that offers a wide variety of majors.  SHU also offers many athletic opportunities as well.
Sophomore,5,I love the small campus. You can be to any class in minutes.  There is so much to do on and off campus. The food is great and there are many options. The Performing arts studio is state of the art and new. Professors meet one on one with students and they have small classes.
Graduate Student,5,"I like the satellite locations and the flexibility by the school supplying blended classes to be able to work, take care of family and go to school."
Sophomore,5,"Siena Heights University was the college that i chose to further my education. I do not regret it, nor have i ever even thought about going somewhere else, i absolutely love it there. It is a small, private, catholic college that is located in a smaller type of town with a low socioeconomic income level. We as students at Siena do many things to interact with the community to make it a better place. The athletics here are amazing!"
Freshman,5,"I first visited Siena Heights University when they invited me to their campus because I play football and they showed me interest in my skill set. It all sparked when I got there, the campus was beautiful and very new and everyone, and I mean EVERYONE on the campus whether student or faculty was nice as can be. I couldn’t believe it, it was everything I wanted in a college and more!"
Senior,5,"The online program so far is fantastic! The curriculum is spot on, and the professors are personable and willing to help. I truly feel like I am learning, and improving my intelligence. As a matter of fact, anyone I have ever spoken with from the University is extremely nice. I am very impressed with the online program which has win awards for excellence!"
Junior,5,Overall I have had an easy transition. It's been over 10 years since I have attending some kind of college or medical program. I see the reviews people are leaving are mostly from freshmen about sororities and food around campus. I think leaving crappy reviews about fraternities and sororities is not even relevant to the education. I'm under 30 years of age and know what my priorities are. The school has helped me with getting the right path for my medical BA degree and the classes are fast so I will be done in a little over a year. I'm not complaining about financial aid as I don't even qualify for it and have been paying cash as I go. Leaving me debt free once I am done. Being part of the online program I think its easy to adapt and makes it convenient for me to jungle a full-time medical job and a part time teaching job.
Junior,5,I love the close knit environment Siena provides as well as the one-on-one interaction with professors. The administration creates an atmosphere that encourages students to succeed and enjoy their college experience.
Senior,5,The advisors are wonderful here at Siena Heights University. They have helped me when I had issues with classes or had questions about my career interests. They also helped me register for classes and get my degree!
Alum,5,"I graduated 32 years ago. We had phenomenal professors, really outstanding people of integrity who cared about the students, and made sure that they had an understanding of life and their career field.. It was easy to take courses outside of my field, so with extra business classes, I have been able to run my counseling business on my own. There's no way to put a price on that, but I know it's saved me many thousands of dollars. I also was able to take courses in art, nutrition, and music to really round out my character. Although the professors have moved on, they left a legacy that I'm sure students currently are still enjoying. Yes, it's a small school in a small town, but it's a great place to get a big start in life."
Graduate Student,5,"Completing my four-year degree with Siena Heights University has opened doors that were not previously there.  Up until three years ago, only those with nursing backgrounds were given opportunities to climb the career ladder within surgical services. Myself and fellow peers have been given the opportunity to change the narrative that a nurse is not always the answer for management needs within the realm of healthcare. My hope is to continue where I left off with a bachelor’s degree from a proven institution and take the necessary steps to achieving a Master’s degree in Organizational Leadership from a university that has brought me great success. I have nothing but gratitude for the professors, staff and institution which have helped me advance in my career."
Sophomore,5,Siena Heights University is a great college is love my professors they really help if you are struggling. There is a diverse group of students that go there and chances of you seeing someone you know while walking around campus are pretty good.
Junior,5,"I decided on Siena Heights University because there is a satellite campus at Jackson College in Jackson, Michigan. This is extremely convenient for me. The main location is only 40 minutes away and easily commutable. I like that the college offers 15 week classes along with 8 week classes. I am able to come in on the 2nd part of winter semester 2018. They offer accelerated programs and alot of online classes that can work for anyone. The staff is extremely helpful and caring. The college has so many options for anyone attending college."
Niche User,5,I will be attending Siena Heights University in the Fall of 2018. I have visited there twice. It is a beautiful campus. The admission counselors are very informative.
Freshman,5,"Being a first year student here at Siena Heights University I haven't been able to gain a full experience. However, so far since being at this school I have felt nothing but genuine concern from my professors with how I do, which makes you as a student want to be there and better yourself. You can definitely tell that they want to see you achieve great things and learn to your best ability. The atmosphere is always positive and everyone seems to share an uplifting attitude. My experience so far has been nothing but great, not just in the classroom but through athletics as well. The coaches want to see you succeed and push you to be your best but also show extreme concern with how you excel in the classroom, before they become concerned with how you excel in your sport. I would recommend Siena Heights to any and every high school student because I have never experienced a college campus as good as this one."
Niche User,5,"I toured several schools with both academics and athletics in mind. Out of all the schools that I toured, the staff made a great first impression. They really encourage the success of the students, and make every effort to empower young adults to learn all they can and make a difference in the world."

College Junior,5,"The ITP (again, at LCC linked with the Siena Heights satellite campus) has excellent instructors. The director is phenomenal and so skilled. Nothing about it is easy, but it is so worth it."
College Junior,5,"There are far from enough sign language interpreters, and there is a very high demand for them, which leaves a lot of room for ""pioneering"" the field, working with many people state and nation wide, and offering a lot of mentoring opportunities."
College Junior,5,"this review is for the Lansing Community College Sign Language Interpreter Training Program. LCC has a partnership with Siena Heights, allowing students to dual enroll. The LCC interpreter program is incredibly intense. We have a 240 hour practicum in which we must fulfill hour requirements in professional development activities which includes attending events such as workshops and conferences. We must also have hands on interpreting experience as well as observation sites where we are able to observe and learn from professional interpreters. Our instructors are an array of working interpreters as well as Deaf community members. I would choose it every time, as it graduates students with so many skills and professional relationships that are so crucial to finding jobs and beginning one's interpreting career."
College Freshman,5,The courses at Siena are varied and fun. Professors are very helpful and know their stuff
College Freshman,5,Our schools puts a very big emphasis on career services

College Freshman,5,I love Siena Heights! It offers great opportunities to get involved and makes learning fun
College Student,5,There is not a safety issue at all of campus. There is a department of public safety that works very hard to keep students safe and they provide escorts if requested. The city is very safe and friendly. Most campus crime is just having alcohol and marijuana.
College Student,5,The classes are small and very interactive. I love all of my professors so far and they are all very helpful. I feel like I am getting a lot out of my classes and I enjoy taking the liberal arts required classes.
College Sophomore,5,"I love my classes and my teachers are even better. I love that my academic adviser got to know me and help me pick the classes that I will enjoy, not just the ones that I need to do."

College Freshman,5,Everyone is given an equal opportunity to succeed academically. Everyone however does not choose to take them
College Freshman,5,"The professors get really involved with their students. They care if a student is injured or sick, and even try to go to sporting events that the student is in"
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love it here! Wouldn't have it any other way!
College Sophomore,5,It's the best college experience I've ever had! I am very pleased with all of the advisers and professors that I have worked with thus far. I am referring all of my current students to Siena Heights University.
College Freshman,5,Financial Aid did their very best to get the the most money that they could and as much scholarship money as they could give.
College Freshman,5,We have security cameras all around campus as well as different DPS locations where they are monitoring the cameras at all times. If we feel unsafe we can always call a guard to help us out or help out in the dorms.
College Freshman,5,"For being a small school, there are always parties."

College Student,5,"The most popular place here is Apple Bee's. Everyone goes there after games, to have lunch, and during the time when appetizers are half off. Another discounted place is subway if you show your id then they will give you a discount on your whole meal. We also have the most known fast food places like taco bell, kfc, steak and shake, and many more."
College Sophomore,5,I work for the department of pubic safety on campus so I am one of the people who look over the campus and keep it secure. I would say we have one of the best safety staff around and work 24/7 to keep the campus secure.
College Sophomore,5,"Athletics is the one reason why I came to this school. Some of our teams are nationally ranked in the NAIA, which is very cool to be around. There is plenty of fans that come out to support the teams around campus, especially since we got our football team recently."
College Freshman,5,Technology fee is minimal per semester and it covers as much printing and computer use as you can use
College Freshman,5,"I love the internship opportunities offered by the Business Program. I am really looking forward to finding an internship that fits with my interests.

The Business professors I have had so far are great. They have no-nonsense attitudes that make you embrace reality, and I love that.

College Senior,5,"I am majoring in Comprehensive Elementary Education , and it is a good program at Siena Heights. My professors make it easy to study the areas in teaching that are best suitable to you, and allow you to feel comfortable about the teaching profession. All my instructors have helped me become not only a better person ,but have taught me a lot about what it means to be a good elementary teacher, and how to be prepared before I teach a class of my own one day. Experience is everything here, and you get a lot of experience in your field of study that really benefits you to know the things you will be dealing with or doing when you pursue the career. Education takes a lot of experience, and I am happy to say it has made me aware of what it takes to be a teacher."
College Senior,5,"I like the campus it is pretty big, and their is lots of activities , organizations , and events always going on. It is always fun during the semester to check out everything that is going on, and it provides great oppurtunities to explore your educational interests as well as any personal interests you might have. The students , administrators, staff, and professors are always welcoming as soon as you come through the doors. I am happy to be going here it has changed my life for the better."
College Junior,5,The teachers are great at helping. There are tutors as well that can help you.
Niche User,4,I like how friendly and honest everyone is and I like how people are willing to go out of their ways to help others in need. Things run a bit slow sometimes but that's to be expected with so many people interested in such a good school.
Senior,4,"The professors were flexible and were able to tackle every issue with stride. It was a new experience for everyone. It was frustrating at times, but it was overall a really nice transition. It was not as enjoyable as being in class, but it was still nice to get on and see how everyone was doing throughout the week."
Senior,4,I struggled through my first couple of years of college. My Junior and this year have been great. I have found some people that I am comfortable around and the classes and professors are great.
Senior,4,"It’s a good school, with a community feel to it. The teachers respect you, and want to help you succeed. The one and only issue is the tuition costs so much, it’s almost unbearable to afford."
Freshman,4,"Siena is not a very big campus and it's easy to get around. The classes are not far so students don't have to walk far. The school has many resources for students that may need academic help. I haven't had any bad experiences here at Siena. All of the people are friendly, you just have to get to know them."
Niche User,4,"If you want to start small while also making connection Sienna Heights is for you. Faculty is very flexible when it comes to accommodating your needs as a student whether it is financially, supportively or just getting you out of your comfort zone to try new things."
Junior,4,I love the people there! Everyone here cares about your life and future. The atmosphere here is like no other. During sporting events everyone on campus participates and shows how much they really care about Siena. I love everything about Siena Heights!
Freshman,4,"The staff and faculty here are very nice and helpful. If you ask for something they will try their hardest to get it done. The school is expensive and the dorms are ok.  The only problem is that you will struggle a little bit, in the beginning, trying to figure out the school itself."
Freshman,4,"As a Freshman (Sophmore as of Fall 2018) I commute from my house. While i dont live on campus, there are many activities and events that you can attend, as well as organizations. I love Siena, as i am double majoring in Early Education and Child Development. As a double major, communicating with the teachers and advisors is a key part to it. Overall, I feel that Siena is the best choice for me, and have had great experiences with all teachers. While on campus, many of the staff members will get to know you by name, not as a number. To me, it is really important to recognize students and call them by name, as it makes you feel important. There is always a Campus Safety Guard around for emergencies, and they are very quick responders. The campus is well diverse, but all students are welcoming and accepting of each other."
Senior,4,"Great professors, small class sizes, inspiring programs. I was happy to have spent my time here and finish my degree strong through a school that was reputable, professional, understanding, flexible, and ready to help see each student succeed in a career path specific to them. It has been a great experience thus far."

I do think that the food in the dorms needed be improved and well as the dorms themselves.  Many times my heat has not worked and has not been fixed for days."
Freshman,4,I like that Siena is in it's on little town and it's quite because I can focus more on my homework and working.
Freshman,4,School committed to it's students success and helps with offering small class sizes so students could receive the one on one attention they might need. Tries to involve all the students in stepping out of their comfort zone and become a better version of themselves.
Freshman,4,"I have not had many experiences with Siena, but this is the school I am choosing to go to in the fall. My mom and grandma went to the college before me. The whole staff is helpful and nice, I just wish the financial aid team was better."
Senior,4,"Great school to attend online courses. For working adults who have many things going on in life, this is a great educational establishment to expand career opportunities. The program creates flexibity with completing assignments."
Freshman,4,"I love Siena Heights University. Out of all the Universitys that I toured this was the only one that seemed invested in me. This has carried on throughout the year, and I see this with the upper classmen. The school sticks with you and makes sure you are on the right path to get a job and graduate on time. The professors are wonderful and understanding. The food is kind of horrible most days, but some days it's really good. It's a really amazing school that isn't only worried about getting my money. I love Siena and I highly recommend it! "
Junior,4,"I am a current student at Siena Heights University and I believe that It is a good university very family orient and who have students that are competent, purposeful, and ethical. "
Niche User,4,Siena Heights University has the away-from-home feeling while also staying small enough to not overwhelm anyone It is a very beautiful campus with religious aspects but does not pressure people to join in those beliefs. The athletic facilities are impressive as well.
College Junior,4,"A Liberal Arts Degree is the most valued among employers. At Siena Heights University, you are receiving a broadened education on all subjects. This is the best type of education any individual can receive."
College Junior,4,"A Liberal Arts Degree is the most valued among employers. At Siena Heights University, you are receiving a broadened education on all subjects. This is the best type of education any individual can receive."
College Junior,4,The campus security is top-notch. They are always patrolling and there are rarely any incidents.
College Junior,4,"I personally am not involved in any Sororitys. The ones on campus are friendly and community-involved. The Sorority does Trash for Cash: walk the dorms and take out students trash for a donation (I find this beneficial). The Fraternity does the annual fall camp out: The boys sleep outside for a week, demonstrating homeless living. They accept donations of canned food which they then donated to the local Salvation Army. (This is very moving)"
College Junior,4,All the sport facilities are extremely efficient. Majority or the equipment and fields where paid for and/or donated by benefactors and Alumni of Siena Heights University.
College Junior,4,Siena Heights University is extremely diverse. Everyone is friendly and inviting. The staff and RA's encourage you to participate in various clubs and sports. I am honored to call myself a Saint!

College Sophomore,4,Career services is very helpful. People come and start talking to you about career prospects within students' freshman year often times. Staff does a good job of wanting to provide students with many great opportunities.
College Sophomore,4,"I feel that most every professor I have had has actually cared about the students. Professors offer that one-on-one time for struggling students, and I find that extremely valuable. I like that the classes are smaller because it allows more interaction with the professor. There is a wide variety of courses, and most of the classes I have taken have been extremely interesting and enjoyable."
College Sophomore,4,I have loved being able to be a dual-enrolled student and cannot wait to begin my first official year on campus this fall. All of my professors so far have been very approachable and most of the students seem nice.
College Student,4,I am a minority and I have great experiences with the diversity of others
College Student,4,Sienna Heights works hard to provide a drug free learning environment
College Student,4,The school is well lit. The staff informs students on campus safety. The police in the area are stellar.
College Student,4,Sienna Heights has provided an easy way to enroll for classes. They have degrees that will tailor your needs. I am fortunate to have found Sienna Heights.
College Sophomore,4,"The sports there are great! I actually bowl and its so much fun. The traveling is so worth while. The football games are so amazing and people are always supportive of the football players. You would never really see anyone missing any games. Not even me! I have a work study where I work at athletic events and I see lacrosse and soccer which I thought was boring but when I actually watched it, it was so interesting to watch even though I didn't really know what was going on."
College Junior,4,There are campus police available 24/7 to escort people across campus. All employees (including students) must complete extensive video training on scenarios and policies related to sexual assault and how to proceed upon either hearing about it or being victim to it.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus. Our campus security makes it a safe place
College Freshman,4,I dont live on campus but from being in the dorms a lot I can tell they are above average
College Sophomore,4,"I attended Siena for undergrad and when I was nearing graduation, I was contemplating continuing my education in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. Even after I got a full time job in my field, I still decided to attend grad school at Siena Heights. It's been a great experience and I would recommend it to my peers."
College Student,4,The value of a degree from Siena is high because it is a liberal arts school and that's what employers want to see. I have received a lot of great guidance for my choose field. Siena is all about helping you find the right major. The career center is convenient and the staff is great.
College Student,4,"I really like the campus housing because it is really close to everything. I share a room with one other person and we both have plenty of room for all of our stuff. The RAs are really nice and always throwing events for everyone in the Siena community. You can pay extra to have a room in the newest building with your own bathroom and air conditioning but I heard the rooms are a little smaller. The community bathroom is always pretty clean and I very rarely have to wait to use a shower. They have quads, suites, single suites, singles all in the main residence building and they are working on getting new furniture though the old stuff is fine. There  is also campus apartments that are really close and you can live in them when you are a junior. I really enjoy the campus housing but I suggest checking it out for yourself."
College Student,4,"Siena is a small school where every body knows every body. I absolutely love it because I have a lot of good friends and everyone on campus is very friendly. The classes are small and professors are very helpful and approachable. They have a lot of scholarship opportunities and different programs to get involved in. I am in the marching band and we are like a family. I chose to only give a four out of five because sometimes campus can be a little boring but the area is great and it's easy to find stuff to do with friends. Also, there really isn't a party scene if you are into that but everybody still finds ways to have fun."
College Sophomore,4,"There is not a lot of drug and alcohol use around campus and when there is, it is pretty well hidden. Sometimes you can smell drugs when you walk down a hallway and later you will hear public safety knocking on their door to confiscate it. It's a pretty safe campus."
College Junior,4,"I feel quite safe on campus, it's always wise to take precaution and have a walking buddy, but generally the safety concerns are rather low."
College Junior,4,The class sizes are small and wonderfully focused on each individual student.
College Junior,4,"The school has somewhat recently added a state of the art football stadium which has drawn in a large number of athletes. The band, cheer and dance team, and fans are always excited to root for the football team, making each game a fun event to attend."
College Junior,4,"So far my experience at Siena Heights University has been great! My adviser has been super helpful throughout my entire process of switching from a community college to Siena. She is the kind of person that cares just as much about making sure that each student is set up with a degree plan that works with their schedule and will ultimately lead to employment in a field that they love as the students themselves are. Although I was originally irritated when I found out that I had to take a required Adult Learner course, I can honestly say that this course has made a tremendous impact on my life. Both the instructor and the course content have been extremely helpful in challenging me to take steps within my life that will help me become not only a better student, but a better version of myself. I am excited for my next semester to start!"
College Sophomore,4,"From what I have been told and what I have observed from my friends who have graduated, there are very few students who graduate from here that do not get accepted to graduate school or get a job in their field after they get their Bachelors."
College Sophomore,4,I am involved with Alpha Phi Omega and we have had a very successful year. We have recruited several new members and we have really gotten involved with volunteer opportunities in the community. It's great for relationship building and brotherhood too.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the seminar style of our classes. I also love how small the class sizes are, which provides a more one-on-one interaction with the professors."
College Junior,4,The admissions process was excellent.
College Senior,4,The class sizes are small. That's the best thing of this college
College Senior,4,"The student involvement with one another isn't the greatest, our school spirit could be better."
College Freshman,4,There's always security watching campus and there are lights all over for night time travel
College Freshman,4,The career counselors are very realistic and push you to pursue your dreams and get you a job in whatever field you want
College Freshman,4,The housing is well kept and the community bathrooms are always clean
College Freshman,4,"Football, basketball, and all other sports games are really fun to bring friends and family to. They get everyone involved!"
College Sophomore,4,We have a very diverse campus.
College Sophomore,4,We have a campus public safety that monitor everything
College Sophomore,4,The dorms are old but they still are a great place to live.
College Senior,2,"The campus housing didn't have too many options, and being a senior, I didn't want to be near too many freshmens. I had issues with the wireless internet connection, and other things."
College Freshman,2,"We do not a lot of food options to choose from. they have the same thing daily. A student paying 33 grand a year. I feel more food options should be applied. The items they sell at the SHU Shop are very pricey, when it is not worth it. for example, a bag of chips basically costs two dollars. all students do not have a car on campus. They do not cook the food properly sometimes. I got sick from the food twice here because it was not cooked thoroughly. overall, the food here is bad, it taste like lunch food nobody wants that. honestly, they should add a subway or, another food franchise."
College Sophomore,2,"Pretty bad. A lot of times the so called ""parties"" are just get together in an apartment.  Usually very crowded and hot. Not a great experience. However, there are occasionally some good parties that happen off campus. Don't come to this school if you are looking to party a lot."
College Sophomore,2,The dorms are very old and could be fixed up. Very small and cramped as well.
College Sophomore,2,"Adrian is a horrible town that is not very nice. A very tiny mall and not a wide variety of stores there. However, you aren't too far from Toledo or Ann Arbor"
College Sophomore,2,"The food is very unhealthy and always covered in oil. The vegetables cannot be very healthy if they are cooked in so much oil. The salad bar is always empty towards dinner time. The later you are to eat at each meal, the less options."
College Freshman,2,"There's nothing to do off campus, and there's no interaction with the other two colleges in our city."
College Sophomore,2,"Small town, not much to do there."
College Sophomore,2,"They are strict on a lot of things, but if you comply they are USUALLY pretty good about it."
College Sophomore,2,It's a small town so there's not that many options available.
College Sophomore,2,The buildings are old and the only good thing about it is that it's connected to the building where most of the classes are.
College Freshman,2,Snowpacalypse 2014! Its been crazy here. We have lost at least three days of school to snow or cold.
College Sophomore,2,The campus doe not provide any form of transportation but the campus is not big so getting from class to class is not a big problem. Vehicles are necessary for going places off campus.
College Junior,2,Nightlife is okay.  There are a few bars and parties.
College Junior,2,There are very few options for off-campus housing with higher prices.
College Freshman,2,"If there is party on campus that everybody plasn to attedn itts usually fun. The in town club is not really a good one but, if everybody decides to go it usually is fun. The real fun is car pooling with your friends and going to other colleges in the area to have fun. U of M, Michigan State, Eastern Michigan and etc. But, on campus nightlife is not very fun on a consistent basis. A good party maybe every two months. If you drink then thats a different story. But, students who are underage and just want to nightlife or the weekend Siena is no where near a party school."
College Freshman,2,Most is merit based and athletically based. Most of a person's aid will come from Merit and there's not a whole lot the school will do besides that to work with you.
College Senior,2,"I had major issues with trying to become an independent student, and the woman in charge of financial aid was an extremely displeasing person to work with on figuring out a solution, even after an appeal process she was even nastier than before and could really care less."
College Senior,2,Gets old really fast. Students are better off not getting a meal plan and buying their own grocieries.
College Freshman,2,"Adrian has by no means an apartment surplus. Though thereare a handful of apartment buildings off campus, they are several blocks away, accross town, or out of town. I myself commute from home, while still living with my parents. It's not where i wanted to be, but on-campus housing is too expensive when added to the high tuition of a private school."
College Freshman,1,They don't do anything and don't have a house
College Senior,1,I don't think we have that here!
College Freshman,1,"There are not a lot of places to eat at all. you know their are two university's located in your city. so why not build more dining options. like buffalo wild wings, red robins, and famous daves. They do not have a lot of food options at all. only one, which is steak and shake."
College Sophomore,1,"Not a ton of options. However, they are very nice and do a lot of good things for the school by hosting events."
College Freshman,1,"The school doesn't allow you to live off campus until you turn 21, and on campus living is very expensive."
College Freshman,1,There's pretty much only fast food around us. As a vegetarian there's no options.
College Freshman,1,"There is no transpiration, and you pretty much have to have a car because it's not safe to walk, but there's a fee to have a car, so it's pretty much a trap to get money from students. They even charge the teachers to park there."
College Freshman,1,"We don't live in a very up and coming town, so there isn't much to do outside of school activities. If we got more involved with bringing the city back it would help a lot."
College Sophomore,1,There is minimal greek life on campus.
College Junior,1,We do not have public transportation unless you were to call a taxi. If you do not have a car or a friend with a car you will have to walk.
College Freshman,1,"There are one set of dorms. The dorms are small. 75% of them do not have lights in them you have to have a lamp. some rooms are bigger and some a re smaller but people still pay the same price for them. The dorms need to be re-painted. The bathrooms need to be remodeled. Living conditions could be a lot better for how much the school cost. You can live in the apartments. But, they are overpriced and come wothout a meal plan. So, you have to buy your own food."
College Freshman,1,"The only thing to do at Siena, nightlife wise, is illegal things. There isn't anywhere to hangout outside of Siena. Once a week, the club is an option, but most people don't even do that. I wouldn't recommend anyone come here due to the lack of nightlife."
College Freshman,1,"The parking is ridiculous here. Your only allowed to park in certain areas, and it is not very clear when you get here where that is. There isn't that many students here at Siena, so for them to have restrictions on parking is outragous. Being that this is such a small place, you should be able to park where ever is convienient for you."
College Freshman,1,"It took a while for me to recieve my financial aid package. I had to do verification more than once. Once it was all packaged, I recieved less money than what I was told I was going to get. That changed my feelings about returning to Siena."
College Freshman,1,"I am a vegan and the cafeteria is not vegan friendly at all, furthermore there are practically nothing but fast food restaurants in the surrounding area."
College Freshman,1,i really dont know much about it but i heard they were pretty crappy
College Senior,1,I do not feel that the instructors are professional. I think that some of the classes are non informative and offer no challenge what so ever.
College Senior,1,At the Lansing Campus there is not a whole lot of anything going on.
College Senior,1,Nothing Has Ever Been Addressed – I think that there ios no interest much about the student after they have finished the program
College Junior,1,Imbalanced Ratio – The guy to girl ratio is very imbalanced as the guys outnumber the girls by a great margin.

Alum,5,"My yeara studying at UH Hilo, was the most life changing experiance. Local people were so welcoming, athletics program filled with great mentors and coaches, and the professors really wanted what was best for me. I finished with a BA in kinesiology, and man was it tough. But UH provided all kinda of resources to assist me completing my studies at my best, and on-time. I enjoyed my time there"
Alum,5,i never took online courses at University of hawaii at Hilo. But i do know that it is probably no different...expectations were high everywhere in all areas
Junior,5,"It's a great school with very helpful Professors and staff. Classes are small for the most part so you really get to connect with your peers and Professors on a deeper level. The campus is safe and accessible and full of green spaces. The location itself is ideal if you live on campus, as the dorms are a few blocks away. Overall, this is a great school and would definitely recommend it!"
Junior,5,What I like about this campus is everyone is friendly and the teachers and staff are always there if you need help or if you need advice on anything.
Freshman,5,"The most exceptional thing I find about the University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo is the College of Hawaiian Language I am truly blessed to be apart of, Ka Haka ʻUla O Keʻelikōlani. This college is one of the best facilities and programs I have ever been apart of. Their program is very unique, I feel very supported by my peers and professors, and I am able to feel comfortable in the environment."
Freshman,5,"After the rest of the semester being moved to online learning, every single one of my classes was transitioned to be taught on Zoom. I was able to access my material needed for every lesson online and each of my professors was able to teach well. This online learning experience had made me realize that I am capable to take more classes online, which I will be doing in the future semesters I have at the University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo."
Senior,5,"My experience at the University of Hawaii at Hilo has been nothing but positive, fun, memorable moments. The staff, the students and intramural activities really bring nothing but good and happy college experience."
Freshman,5,"my experiences at Uh Hilo are great, the foo there is fantastic. The teachers their are incredible, I have classes on both UH Hilo campus and Hawaii community College. The work our place is amazing and helps a lot of people to get or be in shape."
Freshman,5,"The University of Hawaii at Hilo is an amazing school. Everyone here is super supportive and always wants the best for you. Every student I met they are all super nice, helpful and friendly. I am super excited that I chose this school because it has everything that I wanted in a university. I can't wait to start joining clubs and participating in all this school has to offer."
Junior,5,"The campus in Hilo is moderately sized and easy to navigate. The staff are very friendly and love to see their students succeeding. The class sized are about 30-40 students, which is rather small. This makes for an intimate learning experience and more one on one time with the professors. There are plenty of social activities, programs, tutoring, and even a stress management seminar. My favorite thing about UH hilo is that during finals, they have local farmers bring baby goats to the campus. Petting and holding the animals helps reduce stress from test taking."
Freshman,5,"Application process was super easy, financial aid office was very helpful, Great campus, Amazing diversity."
Freshman,5,"So far University of Hawaii at Hilo has been nothing than a second home and family to me. The transition from high school to college wasn't as bad because of the countless support given from the professors, counselors and how friendly everyone is. I haven't been happier with University of Hawaii at Hilo and the diversity of the students is tremendously amazing, here at University of Hawaii at hilo there is a variety of ethnicities and students from all over. The class sizes are perfect because you get that one on one with your professor and they really care about your success as a student and in your future. I really would recommend Hilo for any high school student who is still scared to go to a big university. University of Hawaii at Hilo became my second home and I couldn't be any happier to get my education close to home but still an island away."
Freshman,5,The thing I want to see changed at the University of Hawaii at Hilo is more activities. I think there should be more activities for the student body to do. Many college students here are either doing homework or just chilling with friends. I think that there should be activities for the students so that they can get to know other people and have fun.
Freshman,5,The diversity of the campus makes it really easy to meet new and exciting people. The professors seem to care about their students and are usually very friendly. Classroom sizes are usually no more that thirty to forty students.
Freshman,5,"I love it here, the class sizes are small and the faculty really care about you personal and academic success."
Sophomore,5,I loved attending college here. The campus is amazing and everyone is so nice you can meet some of the best friends you will ever have by attending school here. Professors are invested in your learning and will help you every step of the way. DO NOT get involved in varsity sports at this university.
Senior,5,Beautiful campus and great atmosphere. Small college with advisors that are very invested in student success.
Graduate Student,5,"Most of the professors are nice and helpful. When the professors had their office hours, they answered all questions I had."
Junior,5,"My experience at University of Hawaii Hilo has and continues to be an amazing journey. Everyone is very friendly, classes are great, and the sight is worth seeing!"
Senior,5,"UH Hilo is a wonderful school. Diversity in Hawaii is what makes Hilo so special. Everyone is different, which makes everyone the same. You fit in no matter where you're from, or where you're headed. It's a really nice campus and the weather is cool and rainy. Staff are friendly and helpful and I am happy that I chose UH Hilo!!"
Freshman,5,Everyone is very helpful and friendly.  The food in the cafe is awesome great taste great choices.  Love the fact I am away a college but yet not to far from home.  UH Hilo has a lot of activities for not only new student but for every student on campus.
College Freshman,5,If we feel unsafe to walk back to our dorm we can call security and security will walk us back to our dorm. Campus has a lot of light polls around campus
College Freshman,5,"As a freshman in college and being away from home, everyone here has been very helpful and friendly."
College Senior,5,There have been many professors who have helped set up field schools and job/internship prospects for students of my degree. Thankful.
College Senior,5,Appreciate all the professors who I have taken classes with. The quality of the courses have exceeded my expectations. The variety of courses offered is sometimes monotonous but overall good. Class sizes are small and perfect.
College Senior,5,"Medium sized school, professors who care, quality topics are taught."
College Senior,5,"Because the school is smaller than other universities, everyone knows everyone. It feels like a very safe environment to be in as well."
College Sophomore,5,"The classes offered are amazing!  Especially the Hawaiian language classes and Ohana classes.  They give amazing insight into ideas that have probably never crossed a typical American's mind before.  It's not just those classes that do that however, but almost every class and professor challenges students to think outside of everything they've known.  

Another thing that jumps out at you is how passionate the professors are about their subjects.  I've spoken to multiple students about this and all agreed that even if they don't enjoy the subject, just the passion of their professors keeps them coming back.  

Its easy to pass the classes as long as you take notes and do all the assignments.  The professors are all fair graders."
College Junior,5,"The campus is ethnically diverse, filled with students from all walks of life. The campus is very friendly and the instructors show so much passion for their fields that it makes me want to emerse myself in the course and not just pass it."
College Junior,5,"The university has a variety of students from all walks of life, ethnically diverse and student friendly. My instructors all show so much passion in their fields that it encourages me to really emerse myself in the course material and asses how it can impact me as a student."
College Sophomore,5,What makes UH Hilo so great is the sense of belonging you have with your fellow students. They become your ohana and the friends you make are irreplaceable.
College Senior,5,Your ethnic or racial background is accepted here.
College Junior,5,The staff are so helpful. I didn't have any problems getting my Fasfa corrected and documentation turned in. I feel like they know their jobs well and are always available to help
College Junior,5,I love going to school to become a Nurse Practitioner.  I love all the hands-on learning.
College Freshman,5,"SCIENCE. they have amazing science programs here. marine science, geology, chem, pharmacy. this is a great place to be for that. marine science get to go in the water very first semester. geology gets to go to cave first semesters. a lot of field trip they are great!!!! love it."
College Student,5,able to start right in on my major and we are out in the ocean by the second week
College Sophomore,5,"Small school, small town... everyone kind of knows everyone,so generally all look out for one another."
College Senior,5,The professors I have had have been really nice. The work can be demanding at times but you learn a lot.
College Senior,5,Hawaii is one of the best places to study marine biology.
College Senior,5,Biology is great because of all of the interesting wild life surrounding campus.
College Senior,5,Lots to do on and off campus. Transportation is only average though.
College Senior,5,Guys and girls both very attractive and friendly..
College Senior,5,It is very safe. Most students feel very safe when on or near campus.
College Senior,5,Plenty of off campus living options. Living on campus is also great.
College Senior,5,Great on campus housing. The housing is very spacious.
College Senior,5,Lots of options. It is both quality and quantity. Many places stay open fairly late as well.
College Senior,5,The campus is beautiful and always filled with very friendly students. The school is filled with people from all over the world.
College Sophomore,5,UH Hilo is one of the best schools to go to for diversity. I have met people from ALL over the world!
College Senior,5,"Getting into the program is easy - no challenges getting in whatsoever. Graduating from the program is a whole different story. Because our program is so rigorous - only offering the major requirements through the medium of the Hawaiian language as early on as your 1st year in the program, but typically by your 2nd year - people drop out of the program by the 2nd or 3rd year, finding it too difficult to pass their courses. And, at the end of the program we have a tough proficiency test that must be passed in order to graduate, which before it was made a graduation requirement only had a 30% passing rate - definitely due to the students' scholarly ethic and NOT due to the program/courses/teachers. 

So in short - it's easy to get into, but it's a tough program to graduate form."
College Senior,5,"I love anything that has to do with school. I just enjoy the feeling of being in a class setting. Also I love the feeling of knowing if I work hard enough it can achieve things I never have. The unique thing about my program is that everyone thinks it's hard, no one wants to put the time in because of the workload. But if you work hard you will succeed."
College Senior,5,Campus life is absolutely fun and always something I look for through out the week. The campus center and libraries always have enough space and faculty to help you with everything you need.
College Senior,5,"The athletics at my school are really good a lot of people usually do coke out .also other teams show us support, even if they play another sport. It's a really good sport oriented community and the support is tremendous."
College Senior,5,"Favorite experience would have to be sports events, the school is very sport oriented. Just a great environment and being around a great bunch of people. I would always pick this school because in my opinion this place teaches a lot about yourself."
College Sophomore,5,"Being in the nursing program is incredibly challenging, demanding and generally engulfs your entire life.  That being said, it is rewarding and amazing and I love it."
College Sophomore,5,"It's recorded the most diverse campus in the country, and I believe it. We just had International Night and I saw more countries than I knew existed and they all gave an exhibition of their own cultures. We get students from all over Europe, Asia, US, Austrailia, New Zealand, Pacific Islands, you name it!"
College Sophomore,5,"Being in Hilo, we have more countries represented on and off campus than most can even imagine. Hawaii in general costs a little more cause everything needs to be shipped here, but that said, you want it, some restaurant in town has it."
College Freshman,5,The school is very diverse in terms of there being a large mix of students from various backgrounds of different ethnicities and races and from different locations.
Recent Alumnus,5,The school takes it students very seriously.
Recent Alumnus,5,"It's not like back home, very hot. It's just right for me."
College Junior,5,"It's Hawaii, everyone knows everyone and most display the Aloha spirit. Very friendly campus."
Sophomore,4,"Fully learning online is quite difficult for me because I like the face to face interaction from teachers to students.  So far, professors have been understanding of the Covid-19 situation, thus, some may extend deadlines or reduce the workload.    The school is still open for those who don't have internet access or who don't own a computer or if you would like to borrow a computer who are willing to take one home."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Hawai'i at Hilo is a really diverse campus.  There are many students and teachers who come from different parts of the world.  This campus isn't your typical party college but much more of a relaxed ""go with the flow"" type of college.  You are more than likely to quickly make a friend because you may often have the same classmate(s) in two or more of your classes.  Having a car or a peer with a car would help you if you are the type of person who seeks to have fun or adventure.  As I said,  the Hilo campus isn't a party campus so you would find your fun through adventuring the island.  I personally like the College of Hawaiian language (Ka Haka 'Ula o Ke'elikolani) because I am majoring in Hawaiian language and studies.  Their agriculture and marine science colleges are also very good as well from what I had heard from friends."
Junior,4,Online classes were flexible and manageable. The online courses are usually very explanatory and easy to navigate online. It was truly a great online learning experience.
Senior,4,"Very small campus with lots of social interacting. People are very kind and welcoming, professors really enjoy their job and love to see students succeed. This campus should be on a poster board for being the most diverse. You see people of every race, culture, and economical background all striving to achieve higher education."
Junior,4,All the teachers here are very friendly and help you when you need it. Also the staff is very supportive. When learning online all the teachers are well prepared and ready to teach.
Junior,4,"University of Hawaii at Hilo has been good to me every since I had transferred back home. The professors, staff, and advisors are very welcoming and helpful. This university is very diverse and everyone here is laid back which is something I love. The only changes I hope to see are the dorms and more food options to pick from."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the small classes and outstanding teachers! However, they do not give their students very much support and charge outrageous prices for everything."
Freshman,4,"This University is definitely not a ""party school."" For the most part classes are quite small so there's a lot more interaction with professors than larger schools. Love the area, it's a quiet town and beaches are 10mins away!"
Freshman,4,"Before coming here all I saw (I read on here as well) was mixed reviews. It's a smallish school, so I can tell you right now if you want to party, you need to be in sports or know people in sports. Many of the teams only hang out with each other and don't like outsiders. I'm social so I do just fine. Unfortunately they don't have cheer here so I find myself out of a sport. There's not alot of school spirit. It's science and hawaiian focused so this is the perfect place for me. It will still be enjoyable if you do a different major. If you dorm, pick Kehau or Ikena. Having your own bathroom is much better and those dorms have room to live in then the 'cozy' other ones. This is the greatest place if you like the ocean, hikes, and the outdoors overall. It's also a very high amount of good looking people here. Walking around campus I always see someone I know. Overall, I would choose to come here if I had to do it all over again."
Freshman,4,"UH Hilo is a great university. Small class sizes allow professors to get to know you and offer you help when needed. Professors have officially hours in which they freely allow you to come and talk, and in general they are really helpful and kind. The school is extremely diverse, and people come from all over the world to join the Vulcan family. The school also provides a free tutoring center, where people are always willing to help, language labs and advising are also available, and UH Hilo puts a great emphasis on self care, encouraging people in need to seek help, as they have the resources to truly help you."
Graduate Student,4,"The University of Hawaii at Hilo is a small university nestled between the makai and the mauna. It's very small, and you can easily tell that we have limited resources. Lots of local recreational opportunities is a huge plus in attending this university. The professors here are wonderful and truly care about student success."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Hawaii at Hilo is an immersive experience of both culture and knowledge. All of my professors show care for their respective subjects and the small student to teacher ratio allows for additional assistance on concepts you may find confusing. The campus is beautiful, extremely safe and all around a fun place to be. If you are seeking a relaxed environment that balances student care and academic opportunity this is the University for you."
Junior,4,"The instructors are very understanding. They are willing to work with you on extensions, etc. I have enjoyed my time here."
Sophomore,4,"I think UH Hilo is a good school. There are some good professors. There are some bad professors. I'm not always particularly fond of some of the teaching methods but they do try and they aren't bad people. The financial support isn't the best but I think with time then it can be improved. Also, quite often people are drinking and doing drugs but I think that happens at college, not for me but other people."
Freshman,4,"I have greatly enjoyed my experience at UH Hilo. I love that the school is part of a smaller community, which makes the campus feel like home because you know where everything is and who everyone is. My professors are kind and dedicated; they really wish to see their students succeed. UH Hilo is great for students her are looking for a more personal educational experience with hands-on learning opportunities."
Sophomore,4,UH Hilo is a small university so your able to connect with your professors and you feel like you can approach them whenever you need academic or personal help.
Senior,4,Most professors are willing to work with you one on one to ensure your future educational success. Facility is well-kept and other students are very friendly.
Junior,4,University of Hawaii at Hilo is a great place to complete your college experience. The professors are very welcoming and invested in your future. The small class sizes allow for one-on-one aid from all the resources available.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at UH Hilo. So far, my first experiences in college are great! I love how small the classes are. The professors know all of their students and are able to effectively provide one-to-one assistance with students who need it. The campus is also very diverse, which is amazing because I have met so many different people from various places. If you enjoy school activities, there is always an event to enjoy with your friends. Attending a school in Hawaii is something that I am so grateful for. The environment is very safe and the weather is also very nice. The biggest thing that I would also like to add is that the classes are very manageable, and not only do I get a quality education, but the classes I am enrolled in are enjoyable and engaging."
Junior,4,I like that the university is very diverse and has a safe environment.  My professors are all very helpful and replies to my concerns via emails instantly.
Junior,4,"It’s a nice small campus and everyone is friendly and helpful. There are some instructors who don’t update you on grades when handing back exams and you need to meet them in their office, which is sometimes a hassle."
Junior,4,"I like the diversity of students. I love the island vibes, beaches, and courtesy of the people Favulties, staffs, and students make me feel welcomed here at the University of Hawaii-Hilo"
Senior,4,UH Hilo is a very underrated college and they provide everything a student would need to be successful in college. The only downside is small quirks such as AC being broken and terrible meal plan requirements.
Junior,4,"I like UH Hilo’s diversity of students, extracurricular activities and clubs, and events students can go to. I like how teachers are very helpful and the abundance of resources to help for class, get food, and find one to de stress. The gym has a variety of equipment and classes to help as well and the dorms are nice."
Junior,4,"Some facilities are lacking in comparison to mainland ones. The library should be open later for students, especially during finals week. Overall though, a great school, especially for biological science, marine science, and geology majors."
Junior,4,"I absolutely love University of Hawaii at Hilo. The professors are excellent and care about their students deeply.  My best advice for those that are thinking about coming here is that if you thrive in a chill and relaxed environment, then this is a great place for you! The campus is dead most of the times, so if you are looking for a party school do not come here.  Overall I think the university is great for on campus activities, the knowledgable professors and the small classroom sizes."
Sophomore,4,"The academics are just as good as any other University. The acceptance rate is extremely high & so is the diversity. From my experience, unless you choose to live on campus or play sports, your chance at a good social life plummets to almost nothing."
Freshman,4,"I have just recently completed my first academic year at the University of Hawaii at Hilo.  I loved all of my classes and professors, but the one thing it would be nice to see change is the ""party scene"".  It feels as though there are not any opportunities to meet other students around campus, although I will say that the university's student council does seem to work hard to organize events."
Freshman,4,"This place is a real treat. It has the basics, and then some! They have a good tutoring center, enlightening programs, and dedicated faculty.As a bonus, the possess a great gym and swimming pool area available to all attending students for free. I am proud to call this campus my alma mater."
Alum,4,"Hilo is that perfect mix of education and the Hawaii experience rolled into one. The environment is very welcoming and laid back. However, return on your investment depends on your future plans. Great place for nursing, marine biology, and Hawaiian Studies majors."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about UH Hilo is that it’s near to my home and the professors are helpful, passionate, and personable."
Junior,4,I really enjoy the people here and the overall atmosphere. There is lots of diversity and the student to teacher ratio is low. You don't feel like you're just a number here and the teachers actually know you.
Freshman,4,"University of Hawaii at Hilo is a small campus compares to schools in the mainland, but that can be helpful in many ways. You meet new people and can have a name to name basis with your professor. Professors care how well you do and there is many types of ways to get help if you need"
Freshman,4,had a great time and experience at UHH. I had fun with the parties and got along well with peers and teachers. I can't think of anything to change it's great how it is right now.
Junior,4,"The resources available to students that are in place to help them succeed are outstanding.  The dissemination of information about the campus, the community and events is well done through e-mail and messaging system."
Freshman,4,Professors are great but the school is a little unorganized and the communication needs to improve but overall it’s not that bad
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the student life so much here! There is always an event going on, and there's always somewhere with an open door for you to study. Classmates are so eager to get to know each other, and they have a sense of humor that lightens the stress in the atmosphere. Dull moments are rare to come by. Every day is an opportunity to meet someone new! Also, the professors and other faculty at the university are open, honest, and always willing to help us out. They're spunky and unique, which makes it nearly impossible to be bored in class."
Freshman,4,"I like University of Hawaii at Hilo because of the diversity, thoughtfulness, people, location, and teachers. What I want to see change is more students enrolling so more classes will be open."
Junior,4,The overall atmosphere of the campus is very inviting and open. There are always events going on around campus that students are encouraged to go to.
Junior,4,What I really like about this college is that they have a positive community and that there is help 24/7. Another thing that I like about this school is that there are different clubs to join to make friends with.
Junior,4,"The University of Hawaii at Hilo has amazing degree programs, especially the Medical and Eviornmental Sciences with Hands On Learning. The campus is filled with students from all over the world. Located on the Big Island of Hawaii, the campus offers many outdoor explorations to different parts of the island"
Sophomore,4,"I love the feeling of Ohana as soon as you step onto campus. The faculty and staff is so friendly and helpful as well as devoted to helping you succeed. There is so much diversity here, that it is easy to learn about new cultures and meet people from all over the world. The campus could use some updating with their buildings and dining hall facility, but overall the schools location makes it hard to complain. With the beach just down the road and plenty of cool, hidden waterfalls, you will never find yourself bored."
College Freshman,4,I find the courses quite cool since it's a reasonable number to have with the programs. The work load is sometimes a lot but bearable and the style that my professors put our work into is similar to the we use to work just with a little more to do.
College Freshman,4,"The staff is always aware and the administrative office and staff are always there for all of their students. Students themselves have a small group that cares for one another, so if anything were to happen no one would get away with anything. Security is always keeping a watch out to prevent that situation from happening, and they are doing a really good job."
College Freshman,4,Teacher here has been really nice and very helpful
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of internship programs and from that there's a good chance of getting a job with that company
College Freshman,4,"Freshman dorm is small but clean,  amenities are very nice and UH Hilo campus is beautiful"
College Freshman,4,UH Hilo tries to include all student in sports.  There are a lot of fun student games on campus
College Freshman,4,Very intense and well rooted for.
College Freshman,4,It was a different experience for me. I liked the paste it was fast moving yet bearable to keep up with.
Recent Alumnus,4,One of the reasons why I love my school (especially the department that I am majoring in) is because the staff motivates me to do my best work and encourages me to continue along the educational path to earning my Master's Degree.
College Senior,4,Constantly get emails about different internship and job opportunities. It helps to be proactive and get to know your professors.
College Senior,4,"Compared to other schools I've been to, the student body here is very diverse. Everyone?s pretty much laid back and friendly. I haven?t had any bad experiences with any teachers, but some are definitely stricter when it comes to grades and giving extra credit. The weekend adventures provided through the school are a great way to explore the island if you don?t have a car. The dorms could use some upgrades and parking can be a bit of a nightmare if you get stuck with the general parking pass. Overall it?s a pretty decent school with a beautiful campus."
College Junior,4,Awesome new gym. Athletes are some of the best students on campus coaches make sue of that. Big community help also. Intramurals is also fun I help work the nights mon-friday!
College Sophomore,4,"Campus safety is pretty good, there are not many serious crimes on campus and within the wider community. Campus security is not many but there are a few you spot here and there, there are emergency call stations placed through the campus that I believe are for incase something happens. Campus is small enough where everyone especially on the dorm side will notice."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school as I said before, my courses have been pretty standard so far and love my professors and have really had no problems but for one I ultimately ended up dropping, I have since but an average student I can do the work it is more the effort to do it. I love how my teachers make it easy to learn and class sizes are too big I think this might have to do with my major. I think lecture style is the most common some teachers are more flexible with their structure though. Overall a good first experience at university."
College Sophomore,4,I love my school it is in my home town. One thing that I find really amazing since attending UH Hilo is how many people form all over the world come here and how international we seem to be. I have made wonderful amazing friends from many other states and countries. Much of them are willing to show me around there states/towns/countries when I visit. The experiences I made just staying in my own little town out in the middle of the ocean is such an experience I never realized I would have back in high school. This is why I definitely like that I chose to stay.
College Student,4,"I feel adequately safe on campus. I have no qualms about walking alone through uh Hilo and I have no experience, first or secondhand, with any type of sexual assault that has taken place here. The security guards of the university are not spread around the campus however and that could potentially be a problem, but I still have no doubt there is a low chance of there being a security risk to the school at any time. In general I believe throgh my experience uh Hilo to be a safe low crime university. I am not aware of any security or police measures of any specific for the campus."
College Student,4,The quality of the courses and professors here at uh Hilo are great. In every single course I have taken here as a freshman on the second semester I can honestly say that I have felt every single one of my professors made me feel they genuinely cared for me and my education. They all let me know that they were available to me and wanted me to reach out to them should I need help with the assignments. As for the classes themselves I feel they carry out their purpose very well. I learn a lot in them and put in a lot of hardwork to make sure I complete them with flying colors.
College Freshman,4,"Sexual assault and safety is taken very seriously at UH Hilo. All resident assistants, faculty, and professors always emphasize our students safety. Their was even a presentation and documentary about sexual assault following a discussion of who, where, and how to communicate someone incase an incident were to occur."
Senior,2,"Honestly, Housing sucks. They never fix anything and the policies don't really make sense. The classes are about average. If you're from the mainland, expect to feel like an outsider. The locals tend to stick together. But the professors are nice. The average age of a professor is pretty old, but the school is hiring younger ones."
College Freshman,2,No Parties. Super small school. Pretty boring. Gym is horrible.
College Student,2,"The only athletics I am very familiar with are the basketball teams and only because a relative of mine played on them for three years. It is my understanding that both the women's and men's teams are low on wins and have a mediocre fan base. I atttended a couple games but they were relatively tame. All of the other sports teams such as baseball, volleyball, golf, tennis, etc. are also not well known amid the local public. So, to my knowledge, we do not have a very successful athletics program here at the university of Hilo."
College Freshman,2,Ive yet to see a fraternity or a sorority
College Senior,2,"The university needs to reach out to the local community in order to offer more job prospects and, there is bias hiring here."
College Senior,2,Greek life is almost nonexistent.
College Senior,2,Housing is limited. There are not enough on campus housing options for even half of the students. Cost is unreasonable compared to off campus options. On campus housing is very close to classroom buildings.
College Freshman,2,The meal plans are seriously overpriced and they force it upon a lot of the students.
College Sophomore,2,No greek life. But that's okay...
College Sophomore,2,"It s an over priced buffet so you are forced to get as much food as possible in order to fill the amount your paid, gaining your freshmen fifteen with ease."
College Junior,2,"The only good time to eat the food was brunch...""sometimes"""
College Junior,2,The dorms were too small and there were termites that they wouldn't get rid of. The dining hall food was also very bland. Some RA's took their job too far and abused their authority.
College Sophomore,2,Not good. No healthy options.
College Sophomore,2,Horrible. Very small yet expensive.
College Sophomore,2,Only parties are in the dorms but you can easily smoke and drink there without anyone hassling you.
College Junior,2,It's not really a party place.
College Freshman,2,there really isn't big house parties. cops close everything down before 11. so good luck. casual drinking nights are big though groups of 10 people or so - making less noise. if its raining you might have a better chance. people go camping to get drunk.
College Sophomore,2,There's is little to no school spirit when it comes to sports. It seems even the athletes only do it for the scholarships
College Senior,2,"There's not enough of a variety, and the food is actually quite pricey."
College Junior,2,"Not really anyone here that interests me too much.  A lot of people are friendly, but not too much ""eye-candy"""
College Freshman,2,"No one really have school spirit except the Orientation leaders. Basketball and girls volleyball are the two biggest sports on campus, and even with that, the school spirit is horrible, at the game no one is really interested. We have no cheerleaders, mascot, or a school cheer. School spirit is very sad."
College Freshman,2,"I don't know I can't get any advisor to help me, or they give unhelpful answers that makes you feel like you're not confident in any decision making"
College Freshman,2,The wifi is slow at best and is common for it to randomly not work for long periods of time. And buy a printer with your roommates because the printing is very unreliably.
College Freshman,2,The only games I've been to are the basketball games and basically no one shows up. And those who do seem to not even pay attention to the game.
College Freshman,2,"It's too laid back. It's so unorganized, no one knows what to do. Staff will give you the run around just to get help with something. It's hard trying to meet people because people are in cliques. It feels like high school. You can't do much unless you're 21 or you have a car."
College Sophomore,2,"Although the bus on campus only costs a dollar and runs on a very off schedule, normally the buses are anywhere form 10 minutes to over an hour late. They are very inconsistent, so I normally rely in walking or getting a ride from an off-campus friend, since everything is between 10-45 minutes away by foot."
College Freshman,2,It rains a lot here and they do not have roofs on some pathways in order to get in class.
College Freshman,2,"Job opportunities are really bad. I know I'm not a very experienced worker, but I've applied to over 50 places around Hilo. I did not get hired to a single business. Only 3 interviews. Many of the people here says that you need to know people that can help you with the hiring. I feel like new residents have little or no chance to get an job here, since they don't know as many people as a long time resident would know."
College Freshman,2,"I wanted to major in International business because I'm bilingual. Unfortunately they do not offer that degree, so I have to choose something else."
College Freshman,2,"The restaurants here does not provide a big variety as I expected. Considering that there's a lot of mixed blood people here, I thought that it would apply to diversity on restaurants menus."
College Freshman,2,"The wireless is always slow. Very slow. If I bring my computer just because I want to seat anywhere I want, I have to deal with the slow speed wireless internet."
College Freshman,2,It's hard to meet people here. I'm talking about decent people.
College Freshman,2,The walls are very thin
College Junior,2,House parties is the nightlife!
College Freshman,2,We only have computers in the library.
College Freshman,2,They are far from campus. You have to take the bus
College Freshman,2,There is no night life. I do not really care though
College Sophomore,2,"From what I've heard, you need to stay on top of your financial aid because you can't trust that it will be taken care of like you're told. That's why do my financial aid through private foundations."
College Junior,2,"Hilo is very chill. If you come here, you should expect a lot of Netflix nights.  However, there are things to do.  It's not a complete dud. Just have to get out there and explore."
College Junior,2,"A lot of the teachers care about their students, some not so much, a lot of small minded people in the student body but that is to be expected when these people have lived in a small town all their lives, stuck on an island in the middle of nowhere"
College Freshman,2,"Generally not that intelligent. Boys are mostly just bored and looking for fights or something to do most of the time. Not much to do on or off-campus, so the social scene is relatively weak. Not many good beaches nearby, but some people still like to go."
College Freshman,2,They could help to be a bit stricter in my opinion. I've had several problems with noise at night in my dorm hall. They don't even attempt to control visitation and I wish they would because I've actually had to call security because my suitemate let a man spend the night in our room while she wasn't there without my permission and I did not know the man.
College Freshman,2,"The general feeling I got from the moment I got here was that I was completely on my own and no one was going to help me. The academics are extremely sub-par, I do almost literally no outside work and maintain As and Bs. Also, many of the students are from Hawaii, some even went to the high school next door, and they all seemed to know each other. Coming from the mainland, I didn't feel that welcome or included."
College Freshman,2,"The only place in Hawaii you're really gonna get good quality sports is at the Manoa campus because they're Division 1. Otherwise, don't expect much."
College Freshman,2,"The athletic center is smaller than at other schools I've seen and is usually crowded. The library is relatively small but the good news is that they share books with the rest of the University of Hawaii system, including the much larger one in Honolulu, but the bad news is you have to wait for them to ship it to you. Nothing much exciting really happens on campus."
College Freshman,2,Most of the facilities have relatively poor hours and good luck trying to figure out what clubs are available on campus because you won't get much help there.
College Freshman,2,"Good luck trying to get your schedule figured out, especially for freshman year because they won't assign you an advisor until three weeks into classes and they won't let you add or drop anything until you actually get to Orientation. Extremely stressful for trying to buy your textbooks as well. The general feeling you get is ""figure it out yourself""."
College Freshman,2,You won't find that many and the ones you do find are relatively old.
College Sophomore,2,"There are no bars on campus. No where to buy alcohol on campus. You must walk to the little general store down the street. There are no ""clubs"" nearby. The college is in a old little town. All the ""clubs"" and bars need to be driven to. "
College Senior,2,There are many students and staffs who own a car but not enough parking spaces.
College Sophomore,2,There are not enough free parking spaces accessible to students and/or staff.
College Junior,2," Unless you live on campus in the dorms, dinning closes down at 3 pm - no dinner for you. If you live in the dorms there is dinning available from 5 pm until maybe 6:30 or 7 pm, but it is very expensive ($15 for all you can eat, with NO other options). There is very little variety and there are only 2 places on the whole campus to eat at. If you want to eat off campus you'll have to travel at least a mile or two.  "
College Junior,2," There are many attractions, cultural events, and activities here provided you have some deep pockets - unfortunately that cuts cuts out about 95% of the college students. Shopping is about 2 miles away, not so cool, safety on campus is good, but be aware of those around you if you go downtown. There are some sporting events on the campus, but not a large variety to chose from. Off campus, many of the islanders resent mainland people whom they feel ""stole their land."" Although the majority carry EBT cards here, and would starve without them; nevertheless, they dream about independence from the US and white boys are not welcome with open arms.    "
College Junior,2, The few bars that exist here are located way downtown and there are very few to chose from. 
College Junior,2," Probably more so because I am much older than the average student here, I feel pretty left out most all of the time. The girls are extremely attractive but there only interest is in those young studs who are just seeking to put another notch in their belts and move on to their next challenge (girl)."
College Junior,2," Getting the ball rolling is an extremely slow and frustrating process. Many of the students working in financial aid do not know what they are doing, so it is important to find someone who has been here for a few years and knows the system.
 The good thing is that once the ball is rolling it keeps rolling smoothly throughout your college experience."
College Freshman,2,"The school's charm lasts about one to two months but after that the boredom and seclusion tends to take a toll. If you decide to go to UH Hilo be prepared for a lot of rain and humidity. Know this is not the typical ""Hawaii"" that everyone expects. The town of Hilo itself is pretty run down and UHH doesn't do much to stand out. Anyone subject to chronic chest/sinus problems should know that when the vog is bad it makes the experience here miserable."
College Freshman,2,"Live off campus. The dorms are old and not in the best shape, I would have no problem with this if the price was lower. Living off campus is way cheaper if you find a house to rent with a few other people. Living in the dorms also means you HAVE to be on an overpriced meal plan unless you're in Ikena which has a very small kitchen area."
College Freshman,2,"The food itself isn't completely horrible, it's just never open. Weekdays it's open 11-1 & 5-8, Saturdays & Sundays 10:30-12:00 for brunch and dinner is from 5-6:30 or 7 on Sundays. So if you miss or get hungry after that have fun finding a bus or taxi to take you to Walmart for food"
College Senior,2,I'm not to sure about the nightlife.  I don't usually go out at night.  I'm always at home studying.
Alum,1,"This school is complete garbage. Stay away from it, Manoa if you are able is 1000X better, competent staff and actually has fair teachers and classes that you actually learn something from."
College Sophomore,1,"We have no Greek life on our campus, our school is too small for such an organization/institution to be reasonable and worthwhile here. Although many people do end up living on campus and near off campus there are dorm/university organized events for students and many off campus partying."
College Student,1,"I am not at all familiar with Greek life in my university and to be quite honest I have never even heard of it until now. Maybe it is because I live in Hawaii, as I have been for my entire life, but in my opinion Greek life is simply not popular among uh Hilo students. I have seen one sign indicating membership to a sorority on a building but other than that I really can't say anything else about Greek life at uh Hilo, because I just don't know anything about it and have never heard about it ether."
College Senior,1,They do not provide housing for students with families (I.e. Children)
College Sophomore,1,"If you want a place that's moderately clean and you won't be killed by some drunk idiot, you're gonna have to pay.  That's assuming you get past the wait lists these Hawaiian landlords have for places that are within driving distance to campus."
College Sophomore,1,"The safety is fine but the health care is abysmal.  The person who is there is unprofessional, rude and frightening."
College Freshman,1,The nightlife is really bad.There are house parties but everyone from the school goes to them and they get shut down very quickly. There is one club I know of that has student nights on Wednesdays.
College Freshman,1,"The bus schedule to get around town is so difficult to learn, the bus will come about an hour or more late. If you miss a bus the next bus won't come for another hour or even later. The taxis are convenient but so expensive, it's better if you get taxi coupons but eventually that money will add up. The school have shuttles that will only take you to Walmart or Target, but the school has bad promoting so  students don't find out about the shuttles until it's too late."
College Freshman,1,"There is nothing going on at night on campus so you have to leave campus for any fun which means you need a car. Anything you do on campus has to be quiet because you need the windows open otherwise it'll be too hot in the room with more than three people in it. And ""quiet hours"" start early."
College Freshman,1,"The public transportation is either too late or too early. When they are late, sometimes it exceeds 30 minutes. Shen it's early, it does not wait until the schedule time is met. They just leave making relatively a lot of people miss the bus. Also, the buses availability is horrible. It goes to limited places, and the schedule has one bus in an average of two hours. That's not a lot of buses. My class starts at 9:00 and the bus comes at the college around 9:02, then I would have to walk, so I would be late in school for about 10 minutes everyday. Because of this issue, I have to take the bus that gets to the school at 7:20, making me wait for one hour and 40 minutes until my class starts. Overall, the public transportation is horrible."
College Freshman,1,There's no store open at night. Anything open actually. Just convenience stores
College Freshman,1,People do not email you back. I've tried.
College Freshman,1,Sometimes the buses do not always come on schedule
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek life. we have volleyball girls
Recent Alumnus,1,We don't have any transportation.
College Freshman,1,"Completely unhelpful advisors, stressful registration, practically non-existent workload, a few special study options but you have to seek them out yourself."
College Junior,1," I would guess at least 95% of the student population are either Pacific Islanders or Asian. If you are a white boy from the mainland you're certainly in the minority here and will feel left out of almost everything. Religious affiliation is variable and probably about average. Economically, there isn't much of a middle class left anymore ... just like on the mainland either you are well off or you are poor-period. "
College Junior,1, Drugs and alcohol are everywhere and available to everyone. There is very little enforcement of the drug/alcohol policies here and those who don't take part are given the cold shoulder treatment.
College Junior,1," There is only one computer lab/library on campus. The hours are very limited and the number of computers is very limited. Technical problems tent to be the norm, rather than the exception - especially during crunch time when you need them the most. Lap tops are not much better as the wireless access is  accessible in many locations where it is suppose to be."
College Freshman,1,Nothing to do without a car. The best thing to do is drive across the island to find an actual beach. You'd think they'd be everywhere considering it's an island but the bay UH is near is dirty and there are no sand beaches on this side of the island.
College Freshman,1,There are basically no places open after about 8 pm. There are also hardly any places to go even in the day time. Eating out on a Sunday is also nearly impossible.
College Freshman,1,"There are only two taxi companies that take the school coupons and work after 5 and or on the weekends. And even still they have terrible customer service, take forever to pick you up, sometimes forget to pick you up forcing you to wait another 40 min for the next taxi to come around. And paying cash for a taxi can be really expensive because some taxi drivers will take advantage of you and taking the longest way possible to get where you need to be. The busses are nice, they're just normally super late and don't run late or on Sundays.

Get a car or be stuck on campus."
College Freshman,1,"I had more of a night life in 8th grade than I do now that I go to   this school. Sometimes there are school operated activities at night, but that's pretty much it."
College Junior,1,people buy parking and there is none!  its a huge joke.
College Sophomore,1,"The campus is small, so there's no need for a shuttle, but the bus system is horrible. No service on Sundays, and thy stop running around 9pm. there are only hourly buses intra-Hilo - one that goes downtown, and one in the opposite direction to the mall area. Buses to nearby towns are practically nonexistent. The taxis are good -- we have shared-ride coupons we can buy for $2 each that can take you within a 5 mile radius, otherwise you just pay fare if you need to go farther. But there are only two 24-hour taxi services, and they're SO busy all the time! Honestly, within Hilo, walking will get you around WAY faster than the public transportation."
College Senior,1,security doesn't do anything but call the cops if you're doing something illegal
College Senior,1,never enough parking and security doesn't protect your car
College Sophomore,1,"Housing units are old, run down, over crowded, and extreemly over priced."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is horrible. It take me 30 min to find a parking spot and it is usally very far from my class. Plus all of the construction on campus is blocking a HUGE amount of parking spaces, so even though I paid for a zone 4 parking pass I am never guarenteed a parking spot. I want my money back!"
College Sophomore,1,Be Early – there is not enough parking for the amount of parking passes that are sold to the students. You must get to the parking lots 30-40 minutes early to make sure that you will be able to find a parking place. also some of the parking is so far away from the classrooms that it is not even worth it to park in them due to how early you have to get to school.
College Sophomore,1,There is not enough parking in the good zone (2). Also carpool parking is limited. If they want people to carpool thy should make it easier not harder for them. Also a lot I students park on the road and the cops come and ticket them. There is also constructing that's been taking place for 2 years and they park ad block off half the parking! UH Hilo needs to get to together.
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek Life at University of Hawaii at Hilo.
College Freshman,1,"Labs Are Limited – Their are limited computer available on campus. They are usually fully packed with student during normal school hours. The WiFi is spotty and only really useful in some areas on campus. I think it is really important to own a computer, i know i would not be able to do my school without one."
College Freshman,1,Not Helpful – THe financial aid workers are very rude at times when you ask them for help.
College Freshman,1,There are not many places that let people under 21 in.  The only place I have been to is Level 2 and the place is a joke!  It's right next to an apartment complex and you have to bring your own alcohol in.  All they played was rave music which gets tiring and it's weird.  There is nothing to do in Hilo
College Freshman,1,Dining Hall Food Sucks! The food here is not very good.  It is very fattening and made me gain 15 pounds in my freshman year.  It sucks and my high school had better and healthier choices.
College Junior,1,The University of Hawaii at Hilo does not have any Greek life because it is a smaller campus.  There may be organizations off campus but none that are affiliated with the University.
Recent Alumnus,1,No Night Life – There is absolutely no nightlife here.  All there is to see is the beautiful island scenery and the beach.  This school is located in a very very small city which is very remote and low in population.
College Senior,1,"Although the public transportation is free, it is not reliable at all. Sometimes the buses won't even come at the right time."
College Sophomore,1,Drinking and Majianua – Alcohol is widespread and easy to find if you look for it. Majiauna is also openly used

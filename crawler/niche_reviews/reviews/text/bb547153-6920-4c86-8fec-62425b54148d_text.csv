Junior,5,I love UofI because the people are great and the classes are interesting. There is a great academic and social balance among the student population.
Junior,5,I love how there is a wide variety of classes available and that class size varies a lot. I wish more classes were taught by professors rather than TAs but still an enjoyable learning experience. Now almost all classes are online though so none of that matters.
Freshman,5,Great school. They Care about the students learning environment and safety. There is someone always willing to help you and you u can achieve your goals if you wish to. They guide you on the path you so wish to choose and can achieve that with many peoples help.
Senior,5,"All of my classes shifted to remote learning due to Covid-19, and my professors have done an exceptional job adapting each course and making sure students feel prepared and comfortable in each course. Along with that, advisors and other faculty continuously provide information about extra support and ways to connect in these challenging times."
Senior,5,"With an incredible size, UIUC is an ideal environment to find or try out anything you may have an interest in. Although it might be hard to find your niche immediately, the inclusive and supportive community and faculty ensure that each individual not only excels as a student, but as an individual and future professional as well."
Sophomore,5,I'm taking all of my classes online and all of my professors have been super flexible. I haven't run into any issues so far.
Sophomore,5,"All of my advisors have been super nice so far, and there are a ton of resources such as career coaching, job opportunities, and learning opportunities. I've been looking into switching majors and everyone has been so helpful and supportive."
Freshman,5,"All of my classes have been online this semester. I have had a wonderful experience in all of these courses so far. I have had few technical issues so far, and I feel like I am still learning all the content I would under normal circumstances. All of my classes have combinations of synchronous and asynchronous learning, which gives me flexibility in my schedule while still keeping me motivated. All of my professors are also extremely understanding and have been great about ensuring that everybody is supported despite the majority of learning this semester being online. Each of my professors offers flexible office hours and long testing windows to ensure each student can succeed. Finally, the university also offers many resources such as virtual learning centers for different departments, virtual tutoring, and virtual mental health services. I am fortunate to have had such a wonderful online learning experience."
Freshman,5,"All of my professors are knowledgeable, reasonable, kind, and genuinely want to see their students succeed. There are so many resources for students on campus, such as the Career Center, the Study Abroad Office, and the Counselling Center. There are also many wonderful registered student organizations that allow students to get involved in their community, as well as numerous volunteer opportunities. Another wonderful aspect of the university is the amount of networking one can accomplish during their undergraduate degree. There are research, internship, and job opportunities that help students prepare for life post-college. Finally, the majority of the students are positive and helpful. Although I am only a Freshman, I have yet to interact with an unkind or rude classmate. Overall my experience with the university has been very positive, and I highly recommend that everybody in the process of college applications look in to applying to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."
Alum,5,"What an amazing 4 yrs I had at UIUC!  I reconnected with old friends, made many new ones, and learned a great deal from my professors and classmates. The campus quad was a relaxing place filled with huge oak trees, squirrels, and huge grass lawns to lounge around on. To this day, I still apply the material I learned in my science classes (I was a molecular and cellular biology major) to my current part-time job as a teacher!

Overall, my 4 yrs were magical, inspiring, and above all, completely worth it!"
Freshman,5,"I had a great experience at this university. It is a really large state institution and most people are from Illinois but still there is much diversity within the faculty, staff, and study body"
Freshman,5,"The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a great institution for higher education. While it is true that UIUC is known for its Engineering and Business programs, exceptional professors and other resources are available across the board. Alongside stellar education, campus life at this university is awesome. There are so many fun things to do around campus."
Senior,5,"UIUC is a great place to be as a student. Not only is it an incredible quality of education, but there are endless opportunities to find your friends and ways to give back. With a plethora of student organizations and many events to help the students come together, no student is left out and can easily find friends or like-minded individuals. Administration also always work to foster a university community that is welcoming, accepting, and safe, all of which has been proven during this recent time with BLM and COVID-19."
Sophomore,5,"Love the atmosphere, people, campus town! A very lively place with a great education. This school has a great social scene and very intellectual professors. There is a great opportunity to join diverse clubs in the school, so take advantage of them and step out of your comfort zone!"
Alum,5,"I took a few classes online. They were well organized and well run. They provide for all the resources. However, many times online classes require quite a bit of work. Overall, it was a good experience."
Alum,5,Great school. A great mix of social and academic life. Classes are difficult but provides resources to succeed.
Senior,5,"Due to Covid-19, we had to continue all of our Spring 2020 courses online. However, I will say that it maintain high quality!"
Senior,5,I love my school! I wouldn't want to go anywhere else! Our school offers amazing education and research and the experiences I had here will last a lifetime.
Alum,5,"I was enrolled in the Year Long Project program for Elementary Education. This program enabled me to experience a full year of student teaching in a variety of classroom settings. I felt strongly prepared for life in the ""real world"" thanks to U of I."
Freshman,5,"I am glad that I choose to go to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Not only the tuition fee is not that expensive compare to other institutions, but the STEM program is also well-developed with high qualities."
Freshman,5,"I am glad that I choose to go to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Not only the tuition fee is not that expensive compare to other institutions, but the STEM program is also well-developed with high qualities."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is an amazing school that offers a broad range of social activities and courses, allowing each person to gain the most individually."
Alum,5,"I really like the overall environment on campus as well as the resources offered by the school. My advisor was really helpful and willing to give us any information and my major-related opportunities to explore. Also, by joining leadership workshops held by the Illinois Leadership Center, which I have gotten chances to interact with many alumni and gain advice from different perspectives. In addition, my food service experiences that I learned from FSHN340 which is an extraordinary class in UIUC providing me experience managing the procurement, production, and service of food, as well as the sanitation and maintenance of equipment and facilities. We as students will run the cafe throughout the whole semester and interacting with customers daily and providing efficient service as a team."
Senior,5,The online learning experience has been exceptional and easy to adjust to. The chancellor and other school officials allowed for a seamless transition from in person to online classes. I am very proud to attend this school.
Senior,5,"I am currently a senior at this University and I LOVE this school. The culture, the diversity, the student body, the administrators are all absolutely amazing and I am so proud to be able to call myself a student at UIUC. The academic programs are exceptional and the administrators push for excellence at every level."
Freshman,5,The learning online experience is not any different from the online learning experience of other universities. One thing I would say is that instructions are really clear and most professors understand that adjustment to their courses are necessary for this change.
Sophomore,5,"I took a few classes online, and they were straight-forward. However, I do not recommend taking online classes related to your major."
Sophomore,5,"UIUC is a great school, and there are many resources to help you succeed. I recommend applying to this school!"
Alum,5,"I have had a fantastic experience at this university! The faculty are great and I have gained such valuable knowledge throughout my years there, both in an out of class. There are so many opportunities that the university offers students, such as amazing research opportunities. Also, campus life is very active between RSOs, athletics, social events, and overall student engagement! I could not have been happier attending this university!"
Senior,5,Overall experience at UIUC is very pleasing and comfortable. Schoolwork is moderate and there is always fun activities to do on campus.
Freshman,5,My online experience was not so terrible. All the professors and staff knew exactly what to do so it was a very smooth transition.
Freshman,5,I have recently completed my first year at UIUC and absolutely loved it! The food on campus is decent!
Sophomore,5,"UIUC is a wonderful school! The student body is diverse, dining hall food is great, and campus life is exciting. It is situated in a perfect college town which enhances your college experience. It is a large school with over 30,000 undergrads, but I have made personal connections with my professors. You can always make a big school smaller but you cannot make a small school bigger. Finally, the workout facilities are amazing and there's a wide variety of intramural and club sports."
Sophomore,5,My professors were very understanding and flexible with the transition online. My classes were held on zoom and class discussions were encouraged despite us being online. The process went a lot smoother than I was expecting.
Graduate Student,5,"UIUC is a great university, I have loved my time here as a student. There are really no complaints except I wish I had more time here!"
Freshman,5,"While online was a weird transition, most professors understand the difficulty and will make it easier if anything."
Freshman,5,This campus has a lot to offer with tons of people to help you go where you want to go with your academic and social goals. Very underrated.
Sophomore,5,"I took 22 credits online and although it was difficult to focus, I was able to fall back on my professor for any help. They provided the necessary tools and resources to help me achieve the grades I wanted and complete the semester."
Sophomore,5,I enjoy being at campus and being surrounded by rigorous students. The teaches implement skills to help us students get a better understanding of the curriculum. I enjoy the many activities they have to offer as well as the diversity and uniqueness of the school!
Freshman,5,"The professors and teaching assistants are always willing to help, and the quality of the teaching is unbeatable. As an engineering student we had many hands-on classes and they were all even more entertaining than I hoped. Besides that, there are countless ways to spend time, with bars and parties. Great experience"
Freshman,5,"The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign was a great experience! The culture, academics, and extracurricular activities were all above my expectations. This university really pushed me to reach out to people and resources for help instead of waiting for someone to reach out to me. UIUC taught me how to be independent and responsible."
Sophomore,5,"overall, I love attending this university and I am glad that I picked uiuc. very diverse. many clubs and activities around campus to engage in as well as job and volunteering opportunities."
Freshman,5,"i really enjoyed my time here, i'm sad that school closed because of corona but i hope that we will open soon"
Alum,5,I loved my classes. I felt they were really challenging but manageable. I joined a sorority which had a huge impact on my experience. I love the campus as it’s super easy to maneuver around. I would like to see more flexibility in deciding a major as a freshman because I feel like they should emphasize going undecided and trying out more than one academic area of interest before committing. I feel being an Illini has helped shape the woman I am today.
Sophomore,5,So far the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has been great. I have been able to live an enjoyable and fun life while learning a lot and pursuing a finance degree. Best of both worlds.
Sophomore,5,my current experience at the university of Illinois is amazing. the environment is welcoming as there is something for everyone. rather it be wanting to join a greek life to RSO's there is always events and great opportunities happening.
Alum,5,"This campus, professors, and friends are what have allowed my academic and personal interests as well as personality come fully into fruition. Although these aspects of my life have continually developed over the span of my life to date, there has not been a more influential 4 years of my life than these. The molecular and cellular biology program along with the chemistry courses that I was a part of reassured me that I was in the right place, and the culture of the student body was that of collaberation, not competition. I could not be happier with my choice of university to attend, and I hope that anyone who sees this and is debating between where to spend their freshman or 1st year chooses this one."
Junior,5,The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is very diverse with a lot of experiences that students can get exposed to only as a college student. There are tons of different kinds of people that you can choose to bond with and it is a very student-oriented university.
Freshman,5,The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a delightful surprise. There are so many delicious food options and many ways to get involved. The campus feels like home and the plethora of squirrels are unique to UIUC. I am currently studying Kinesiology in the College of Applied Health Science. The best part of this college is that it is small and intimate which allows for a small school vibe at a big ten university.
Freshman,5,University of Illinois is a really great school. A degree from Illinois is worth a lot and the support systems in place for students are great.
Niche User,5,"Campus is beautiful. The new buildings are conventionally nice, and the old buildings have a lot of history - which, as a student, you become a small part of. The University itself excels in so many different fields of study as well; students have a rare opportunity to learn about other subjects outside of their field from the best in those respective fields. Students have access to top-tier institutions, lectures, and classes. Since transferring to another major can be difficult, maybe lowering the requirements such as GPA a bit so more students can discover possible majors they are interested in and possibly pursue in the future."
Alum,5,"I had a great experience at this university. It was my number one choice and I have not once regretted my decision. I majored in Human Development and Family Studies with a concentration in Child and Adolescent Development. My professors were incredible and so helpful. My advisor was an amazing resource. I participated in a part-time job, research, volunteering, study abroad, internships, practicums, various student organizations, and more. This school has so much to offer and I wish they had a graduate program of interest to me so I could attend again!"
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love it here. It’s extremely easy to make friends and find  where you fit in! The campus is huge, and first it’s a little intimidating but you learn your way around. As big as it is, once you get used to it, the campus just feels way smaller."
Sophomore,5,Most of the professors here are very passionate about the subjects they teach. The educational quality is excellent. The Urbana-Champaign area is also relatively lively and there is always something for everyone.
Alum,5,The large campus gives you plenty of opportunity to meet people from all over the global. You will always find yourself meeting new people wherever you go and get to create lasting memories with the people you meet.
Freshman,5,"I transferred here for the Spring 2020 semester and it is honestly an amazing school. The academics are great for a public university and it offers a lot of resources if you take rigorous courses. The campus itself is beautiful and provides a lot of space. I also love the social aspect of the school and making friends isn’t hard as there are very friendly people across campus. The food at the dining halls are alright it’s what you would expect, some offer better choices than others. Typically the rice at the union isn’t cooked properly but apart from that the food isn’t that bad. The party atmosphere is also huge, it’s a big part of the school’s culture and one I enjoy a lot. The area around campus is also relatively safe. Overall a great school!"
Niche User,5,The application process for UIUC is very simple and straightforward. The advisors are helpful and quick to respond. It's a pretty cool school.
Niche User,5,"University of Illinois has some of the most amazing programs, including business, engineering, and teaching. Many of my friends and family have attended the school and now have amazing careers. Everyone at Illinois is excited about being at Illinois which creates the most fun experience!"
Freshman,5,"UIUC has been such a great experience.  There are many sororities/fraternities, clubs, volunteer opportunities and research opportunities.  I've been lucky enough to get onto two great research projects in my freshman year - I never thought I'd so quickly be able to apply what I'm learning in projects that could make real change."
Freshman,5,"Current student. U of I is a fun school but also a nerd school. We are one of the smartest out of the big ten and our engineering program is one of the best in the country. Our CS program is very impressive, the same with our CE program. School provides a lot of resources and experiences. You can get everything you expect from a college -- frats, parties, football/basketball games, while also getting a degree in one of the schools that employers actually  know and care about."
Freshman,4,This has been a brand new experience for me since i am just coming from high school I can not wait to see where they will take me and how far I will go in my path to success.
Freshman,4,"So far, my experience at UIUC has been really nice! Everyone I have met is kind and the professors seem to really care about the students and trying to help make sure you're understanding the information.  I have not gotten into clubs and am not on campus, so i couldn't tell you much about the living conditions or food. But. their classes have been academically challenging and make me feel like I am improving myself as a person."
Freshman,4,"All of my classes are online and all of the professors have been very accommodating. Many of them know how to use zoom, and for the portion that don't we guide them through it.  I think helps all of us to feel a little less distanced from each other and is a good reminder we're all not just faces on a screen."
Alum,4,"Of the few online classes that I took, there were very well structured. The professors for these classes had been teaching these classes through the online format so they were used to the schedule and making sure there was no lack of person-person interactions. Overall, the online classes were very convenient with my schedule and allowed me to pursue other in-person classes that I would have normally not been able to complete."
Alum,4,Online learning was the easiest part about the university. Unless you had to take class via Proctoring or at the testing center which can make you feel overwhelmed if you don't like being monitored so closely.
Junior,4,"Since I am paying in-state tuition prices, I think going to U of I in Urbana-Champaign is worth it. The campus is pretty nice, and depending on your major the academics and resources are great. There are many options for on and off campus living, and a variety of dining halls. Compared to other schools that have opened their campuses back up, U of I has been testing frequently (twice a week) for anyone on campus or involved with campus life."
Alum,4,"Online classes were actually more helpful because I can tune out the distractions from various classmates and whenever I miss a key piece of information, I have the luxury of being able to rewind, pause, and jot down whatever necessary to help me to retain the information presented to me."
Senior,4,"With the rapid transition to a completely online learning experience this past semester, I feel that the university did a great job at making work accessible and realistic to the anxiety and uncertainty students were facing."
Senior,4,"Really fun, great environment for everyone. Classes are very hard, but makes sense for one of the top engineering colleges in the US."
Alum,4,"I prefer in-person classes for the visual and social interaction with the professor and classmates.   I received an ""A"" for the one on-line French class taken."
Alum,4,The U-C campus offers students the opportunity to explore a variety of educational experiences in the classroom.  Monitor your graduate requirements so that you can create an effective schedule as early as possible.
Sophomore,4,"I didn't do a lot with campus activities, but the ones I went to were pretty fun. Seeing people on the main quad was pretty entertaining especially when you seen everyone when they are playing frisbee, or watching a movie, or relaxing."
Sophomore,4,All of my classes were switched to online and most of the classes went really well. I only had one class that wasn't that great for me and I didn't have a really good experience there.
Sophomore,4,The school really does a good job of offering great courses and a pleasant environment. I only give 4 stars because of the lack of organization during these troubling times surrounding our return to campus in a pandemic.
Sophomore,4,"I have taken quite a few classes online at the University of Illinois at the experience was very good overall! It was easy to contact my professors and classmates, deadlines were reasonable, and the assignments were just as hard as in person classes."
Junior,4,Rest place for a great education. Most professors are really nice and passionate about what they teach. The campus is also pretty diverse compared to other campuses I’ve seen.
Alum,4,"I did not take any online courses at U of I; however, the online communication has always been top notch."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a great institution for higher education. While it is true that UIUC is known for its Engineering and Business programs, exceptional professors and other resources are available across the board. Alongside stellar education, campus life at this university is awesome. There are so many fun things to do around campus, including bowling, shopping, and simply going out for a meal with friends. University recreation is also stellar, including workout equipment, pools, and rock-climbing.  Overall,  UIUC is a great school! Go Illini!"
Sophomore,4,"The professors did a great job adjusting to online learning after the COVID-19 outbreak. While I did miss in person classes, I was able to keep up with my work, and (mostly) had responsive professors and TAs."
Sophomore,4,I really liked the diversity in cultures at the university. I also really liked the availability of some of the professors to help the students who seek for help.
Sophomore,4,I really liked the diversity in cultures at the university. I also really liked the availability of some of the professors to help the students who seek for help.
Niche User,4,University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign is a great engineering school. The professors in this university are very intelligent and focused on their research. This university offers on campus housing and has a very diverse campus culture. This university is full of a variety of extracurricular activities and clubs for students to join.
Junior,4,Most of the classes I have taken online all have about the same structure. Lectures a pre-recorded and then posted online and then if there are discussions they are led by a TA through a zoom call.
Junior,4,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign definitely has one of the best party scenes compared to other colleges around the world. It is also very diverse and has many registered student organizations that involve different cultures.
Junior,4,Online classes were particularly easier for me so I didn’t have many difficulties. The professors were easy to contact as well if I needed anything.
Junior,4,There’s always something going on on campus which brings a lot of excitement. The people I’ve met have all been very nice.
Alum,4,My online learning experience is great! I enjoyed that my instructors used Zoom as the main tool to teach us.
Freshman,4,"The University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign is a really good school. Academically, the colleges of the university excel, especially in the field of computer science and engineering. On the other hand, there really is not much to do on campus due to the fact that it is not a major city but if you prefer a more quiet, college-town experience, this would be the perfect fit."
Junior,4,"Welcoming school, helpful faculty and staff, but it can be difficult to find out where to even start or who to go to with your issues in part just due to the sheer size of the school."
Freshman,4,I am entering my sophomore year here so I do not know the most about UIUC but what I do know so far I love.
Alum,4,"I took 3 online courses this past semester and had a very good experience in all of them. Two of the courses used Compass for course information and activities and the other used Moodle, both of which were easy to work with and understand. The instructors in all courses were very clear with what was expected from students as well as when all assignments were due. The only complaint I have is that most communication is done through email with the professor, and sometimes it would've been beneficial to speak to the professor as one would after an in-person class ends. Overall great option to choose though, and helpful when creating a flexible schedule."
Sophomore,4,"I love going to school here. There are minor things that the school could do better, but going to school here is like a movie. I love the experience."
Sophomore,4,"I have taken online courses, and they depend on what exactly you’re taking. But they’re easy and fun to take. Can be a lot of work to put in though."
Sophomore,4,"Before online learning, I would give my experience a five. However, because of the change in the environment, I would rate them four stars. At UIUC, I received a perfect balance of social and academic fun. The students there are friendly, and UIUC has a lot of resources for use. I met a lot of different types of people and have made life long friendships there. The campus is also very beautiful, and it is a well-respected school."
Alum,4,I took a few class online. The professors were good about getting the needed material online. That mostly consisted of prerecorded lecture slides and videos.
Alum,4,"The overall campus life was pretty nice. Most of the programs are highly rated, so academics are a priority for the school."
Graduate Student,4,They did pretty well adapting to online classes in such a hurry. Overall professors were communicative and understanding.
Freshman,4,"I'm an incoming Freshman for the Fall 2020 semester. My experiences with Alumns, online resources, and admissions contacts were phenomenal. I know many current students at the university, and many of them love the campus and environment, and were a major factor in my looking into and eventually committing to UIUC."
Freshman,4,I loved my experience and would 10/10 recommend this college to anyone looking to apply or enroll in STEM.
Junior,4,"The atmosphere at UIUC is great, everyone is friendly. Food at dorms during your first year is alright, but it gets repetitive really quickly. Academically speaking, their engineering and business schools are the most well-known departments at UIUC. I am in engineering and there are plenty of resources to get help from, which I like. Lots of diversity as there are people from everywhere around the world, and most of the professors I've had here are good. The only bad part of the campus is how volatile the weather can be sometimes. Other than that, loved my experience here."
Junior,4,"What I've enjoyed most about the university is the rigor of the courses. As a statistics and economics major, courses are very challenging but also very rewarding. I've always been one to enjoy an endless challenge, so attending the University of Illinois has been a wild yet amazing ride."
Freshman,4,"UIUC was not my first choice of going to...it was near the bottom of my list. I was concerned I would be stranded in the middle of nowhere with nothing to do, stuck with a bunch of other students. However, I am confident to say I am happy I attend UIUC. The campus has a lot of diversity and people that I love. The education I receive is amazing. UIUC is where I belong, and I know a lot of other students believe that too. The reason I did not give five stars is that UIUC is pricey."
Junior,4,"The people are great, the Staff is Helpful, the professors are fun (depending on the subject). Community is generally safe and the various activities around campus are top notch"
Niche User,4,"Great area with lots of neat restaurants. Great college scene with stereotypical energetic people everywhere. Buildings look a little drab and could use some sprucing up to be more inspiring and enjoyable to be in, especially when you're in them all day for classes. Overall, it is a great location with friendly faculty. The admissions team is so kind and helpful as well."
Senior,4,"The ultimate combination of academic excellence and lifelong memories. A well-versed and diverse university, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign offered me opportunities that I was unable to receive that I would not be able to recreate anywhere else. I will never forget my time at a place that makes saying goodbye so hard."
Senior,4,"I love UIUC- academics were hard, but not impossible. There is a lot of diversity and I've met students from backgrounds that I've never met before. It's an amazing 4-year experience. I've lived in the dorms all 4 years though and I've worked for University Housing, and they don't give a shit about you. They're selfish and inconsiderate, and the opposite of bonafide."
Freshman,4,"I love UIUC so much! At first I was hesitant paying the OOS tuition, but it is totally worth it for the endless opportunities here!"
Niche User,4,Campus life is great and very bright. Students are nice and I loved the food on campus. Professor seem nice and some classes aren't too big.
Sophomore,4,"The University of Illinois has a lot of experiences and opportunities available for anyone that steps onto its campus. Every student has the chance to discover who they are and what they want in the positive community that the University has created. Sometimes the efficiency of a course may vary and cause challenges for you, however, that is just one more pillar of the University of Illinois that helps to prepare you for the worlds after graduation."
Niche User,4,really cool and big when i visited! i dont go there! but it's looking to be pretty high up on my list.
Niche User,4,"I'd love to see FinAid for internationals. There are some scholarships, but ut it very hard to understand one's eligibility - sometimes there is no information provided.
Still, one of the best Engineering Majors in the country, and number 7 for Aerospace Engineering."
Senior,4,My experience at the University of Illinois has been exceptional. There are many resources and opportunities to get involved. I feel no matter your background or where you come from U of I could be a great fit. I came from a very small high school. Becoming acclimated to the environment was easy and there were many people to help you make it feel like home.
Sophomore,4,I do not participate in all of the party stuff that happens or the sports that are played here. I mainly focus on the academic aspect of it. Everything else is great so far.
Niche User,4,I like the amount of people and the diverse options allowing for personal growth and valuable opportunity.
Freshman,4,"School values education, and is very competitive.  School is strong in a wide range of majors. School should have more restaurants on campus, and handle social problems more effectively."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the University a lot. I have a good time and really good at academics. I am majoring in Elementary Education the classes I take for my major you can tell all of the teachers' care. One major focus University of Illinois education focuses on it talking about social justice in the classrooms. They make it known of what not to do as a teacher without telling the students what to do, but they focus on informing us of what happens in the classroom. We also have a lot of open discussions in classes that I like. One thing that I think can change is that my major is a lot smaller and I know that in some other majors they do not have as many resources and programs are a lot bigger and they don't value discussions as much in these classes."
Senior,4,"UIUC is a good university. Its programs are rigorous and its job placement rates seem high. Its a the best larger university. However, some professors aren't that great and the dorms and food are lacking."
Niche User,4,"First of all, great CS program. Whenever someone in Silicon Valley asks me “What school did you go to?” Their next sentence is usually “Wow there’s a lot of you guys out here aren’t there”. That has to be a good sign.

The professors are awesome. My personal favorites include: basically everyone who taught me in a CS class.

UIUC has good degree programs in Physics, Civil Engineering, etc and the college of Business also has a great deal of respect, too.

So, great education, check! (Assuming you’re interested in engineering or business)"
Niche User,4,My experience at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is pretty good. I went to sleep in the dorms with a family friend. Once we got there i noticed that the dorm was very neat and modern. Since then I've been in love.
Freshman,4,"Very big, very diverse university, you have to constantly stay out in order to improve your social life. Lots of work, hard math and CS classes."
Junior,2,"A wide variety of fun classes to choose from. If only any of them ever had enough seats. This school is overpriced for what it offers, including double dorm rooms smaller than a typical bedroom just about anywhere that cost more than any apartment in the area, advisors that call students idiots and ask how they got into the school, and a bookstore that upcharges >30% on everything it sells. Everything here is designed to take your money; if you really want the big state school experience, go to a community college first, and then don't come here at all. The school frequently touts its diversity, but the faculty committees are almost entirely white (the college of education is an exception, but they aren't entirely free of issues either)."
Junior,2,"Some professors made great transitions to online learning, but they are in the minority. Most professors (especially those in engineering/STEM disciplines) added additional work for their students, as if these students' lives were not made hard enough already. Even in courses originally intended to be online, professors simply sent out lecture videos (from a different professor, 4+ years ago) and provided no further guidance to the students."
Senior,2,"Online learning during COVID was difficult and awful because obviously, couldn't work with classmates to learn and couldn't go to office hours anymore. Otherwise, online Gen-Eds were really easy."
Junior,2,"I don't feel comfortable here. A handful of professors really do not care about the students. They wouldn't go the extra mile to help a student in their respective categories of education. The campus itself is beautiful, but the educators, as well as a handful of students, fail to contribute to true education. It is more of a business than a place for learning."
College Junior,2,"I don't care for the Greek life at all. I am at school to obtain an education, not to party."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Sexual assault has been pretty bad in all of my time at UIUC, but in the latter half of my time I felt gun violence and hate crimes to be worse than when I originally started."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I never was involved in Greek life, but I have friends that were involved, and the biggest things I heard were:

1. So expensive

2. Lots of ""fake"" personalities

3. The negative always overshadows the good

4. Can take away time from studies and even potential employment opportunities 

5. Overall very, very stressful"
Recent Alumnus,2,"The school spends WAY too much money on sports. They don't make money for the school, and only take away student's tuition towards sports. Much rather have money on sports, so tuition would be cheaper. Considering how bad our sports teams are, it just doesn't make sense to waste so much money on them with rising tuition costs."
College Sophomore,2,"It is unfair to lump together all of the residences considering some of the dorms on campus are actually very nice. That being said, a large number of the buildings on campus are old, unclean, dingy, and overall not worth what the university is charging for residence."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm one of the few students I've met that don't drink at my college. People actively go out and I admit I do feel left out sometimes. But, I know I would feel uncomfortable to I don't feel too bad. Instead I focus my attention on other things that I enjoy doing that make me feel good. I have also been able to find and become close friends with others that don't drink as well. I have some friends who drink, but they aren't excessive with their drinking and don't shame or try to pressure me. But, alcohol is distributed quite loosely and without repercussion around campus."
College Student,2,Freshman housing can be very bad.
College Student,2,No one goes to the games. Everyone parties on weekends.
College Freshman,2,They are crimes committed for which makes me feel unsafe even if I don't participate in any negative activity
Recent Alumnus,2,"Many of the dorms are old, but are being renovated."
College Senior,2,Our coaches are not that great. We have a lot of hope in our new AD
College Sophomore,2,"Our teams are usually pretty bad, but ARC and CRCE are incredible. They are top-of-the-line so that non-athletes are just as healthy as some of the athletes."
College Sophomore,2,"Out of personal experience, I was moved into FAR my first year at the University of Illinois. As sad as it is to say, it ruined my first semester experience in college. It was hard to make friends, everyone/everything was so far away, and the rooms were small and a little old/gross. I didn't even put FAR on my preference list, and I felt that I was the last pick and thrown into a place that I wasn't happy at. I also think being so far from classes and the social scene negatively affected my grades because of the hassle each time I went to class. I was not impressed with FAR Campus Housing what-so-ever, but I was impressed with the IKE and everything it had to offer."
College Sophomore,2,We're the number 1 party school in the US.  I live dead center in Frat Park so I can say there's a lot of drinking and it's not uncommon for the area to smell like weed.
College Sophomore,2,"I'm female and fairly small and I've never been assaulted. Generally, if you know what parts of Champaign to stick to (Urbana is very safe in comparison), you shouldn't get in trouble. However, people have also been attacked just off of Green Street, so there's that. All kinds of people are attacked - male, female, alone, in groups. In the daytime I always feel fine, but one it's dark out, I'd much rather walk in a group, preferably with at least one male."
College Junior,2,"I have lived in Busey-Evans Residence Hall since Freshman year and I am currently a sophomore. To be honest, it was on the bottom of my list every time and I still ended up being placed in that dorm. One main point is that it is a Female only dorm. Many people are not social and are very disrespectful. It is very difficult to live here especially because I am social and outgoing. I would not recommend this dorm to anyone who is outgoing and wants to make friends."
College Freshman,2,It seems to just be about partying
College Junior,2,Very rarely was I happy with the food in the campus dining halls.  It was repetitive and often tasted terrible.  The workers were always nice though
College Sophomore,2,They are very stingy with their money. They really don't give any type of financial aid to students.
College Freshman,2,"Living on campus freshman year was rough. Although I had many options for food, the overall experience of living in dorms was not great. My room was extremely small, I did not have air conditioning, and the wifi connections were terrible. The good things about living in dorms were the convenience and the social atmosphere. I lived in Pennsylvania Avenue Residence Hall and everyone was extremely friendly, I made a great amount of friends living there. Also the convenience was great; there was always a place to grab food quickly and the bus system was amazing."
College Freshman,2,The food isn't that great. Sometimes you don't even want to eat at all and just order food. The dining hours are terrible and that's what gets me the most!
College Freshman,2,"I felt fairly protected by the campus safety, but also felt like I was still at home with my protective parents. The housing was very strict about everything. I felt like they were out to get people in trouble instead of making sure people are safe."
College Freshman,2,I needed scholarships but I did not get any from the school.
Recent Alumnus,2,"When I lived in the dorms there were always cockroaches in the restrooms. The dorms were not the best living situation, but I did make many close friends. It was a learning experience for me and I learned how to be an adult."
College Freshman,2,The meals don't seem like a good value for the credits.There is no flexibility is in swipes. If you want use a meal on someone else you have to use limited cafe credits instead of a meal swipe
College Freshman,2,The food was really good the first two weeks of school. Now it is terrible.
College Senior,2,"Two students went missing and were found dead this year. Assaults, robberies and rapes have occurred somewhat frequently since my time on campus. I used to not be afraid to walk home, but now I wouldn't recommend it. Police may or may not help you and will ticket for underage drinking. There are safety rides, phones, and a sexual assault mandated prevention course however."
College Junior,2,I feel like there are not enough opportunities for people that are not based on financial need
College Senior,2,Small and dirty and old
College Sophomore,2,"The housing is overpriced for what it is, paying for both tuition and campus housing is expensive, so at least one of the two should be reduced. The meal plan that most people get with campus housing is also usually inflexible, and with the smaller plan it is impossible to eat 3 times a week every day in the dining halls."
College Sophomore,2,"The school is expensive and so it should award more scholarships, even small ones."
College Senior,2,"You don't get financial aid as a student unless you fit a very specific set of qualifications. It is fairly easy to get a loan, but the school will not help you. The financial aid office people are nice, though."
College Junior,2,"Since this is a large public institution, it offers very few financial aid options and scholarships. I was able to get a 50% tuition waiver because I am the child of a state employee. Otherwise, I would not have received aid."
College Freshman,2,"I come from a low- income family. We were hoping that we would get more from financial aid but we did not so now I am working 15 hours a week trying to pay off my student account balance so I can register for classes next semester. Also, the College of Engineering charges thousands of dollars more so we have to come up with other paths to get me this money."
College Sophomore,2,Definitely need to give out more money but the state's budget is garbage
College Sophomore,2,Too many kids are too obsessed with what frat they belong to
College Freshman,2,Many misdiagnose in health center. There are some campus crimes but the safety of the students are important to the school.
College Freshman,2,"I was offered no scholarship money or grants. I received one option to take out a subsidized (0 interest) loan for a very small amount. The rest of my ""aid"" was an option to take out the rest of the money in the form of a loan with 7% interest. My family is not particularly affluent and I consider myself an above-average applicant in context to the typical profile of a high-school senior applying to illinois."
Recent Alumnus,2,The landlords are all scamy and the apartments are WAY over priced for what you get.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I don't like that the process is completely random.  So if you get into the University on priority admissions, that doesn't mean you get your top priority on dorms.  Someone who got in on the last set of admissions might still get a better dorm than you."
College Sophomore,2,It's horribly competitive and sometimes you're just waiting on people to fail so that they can drop out of the major and you can move in.
College Sophomore,2,I was a vegeterian and got so sick of eating the same thing and gained so much wieght due to carbs
College Sophomore,2,Everything is spacious and up to date.
College Sophomore,2,We have super bad school spirit
College Junior,2,Some dorms like FAR and PAR are extremely far from campus. It's an additional burden to incoming freshman
College Junior,2,"Not enough variety. They had a lot of healthy options but few alternatives, not everyone needs to lose weight."
Recent Alumnus,2,I think that living on campus is the BEST option.
College Sophomore,2,"I have not had an internship, but I hope to have one sometime in the future. I've heard that, in my specific major, internships are hard to come by and are almost never paid."
College Senior,2,"Parking on campus is extremely expensive.  Parking is just like rent, outrageous."
College Junior,2,"The weather at UIUC is insane. I have been there for 3 years and I have literally seen everything imaginable. Two of the winters resulted in severe weather and dangerous driving conditions, with 57 being shut down for both. Summers have also been extreme, especially if you're in an older lecture hall or your housing does not have AC. There has been snow days after Spring break, as well as the polar vortex. Spring is a hot or miss, but the campus is beautiful after the winter. Rainboots are a must as campus does not seem to drain for days after rain and there are puddles everywhere if it is raining."
College Senior,2,The acceptance of different ethnicities (especially Asian-Americans or international students) is very low. Racism is still an issue here.
College Student,2,"Since it's a state school, there is not much financial aid given out. I think that there needs to be a greater effort in helping people afford to attend. When calling financial aid, they act like they don't have any time for you. You're just one in a crowd. Its just not personal enough."
College Junior,2,"The winters are brutal, and living in the great plains doesn't help with the insane wind."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I did not really enjoy earning my MSW. There were some though-provoking conversations but they could have easily been had in a coffee house rather than paying tens of thousands of dollars. Ultimately, they don't help that much in the field. Professors are easily distracted into not accomplishing much in the course and even when they have a solid plan, they're probably not going to teach you much that will really help. Organization is rough. Still waiting on paperwork I need to get my license (4+ mos now). Workload is not bad- I had no trouble working 20-30 hrs and keeping up. Professors really put their heart into their lectures but just tend to be flighty or distracted or not intent on teaching much? I'm not really sure. Facilities are fine...need to buy your own paper to print in the lab haha. Internship process is very well thought-out and executed."
Recent Alumnus,2,From what I understand it's pretty cheap for Big 10 parking and I found it reasonable. A bus pass is included in your tuition which makes getting to classes easier so long as you plan ahead.
College Freshman,2,"If you're from anywhere warm and sunny most of the time, you're going to have a bad time here. I've lived in the midwest my whole life but have still yet to get accustomed to the temperature and weather changes."
Alum,1,Teachers were not in control of their classrooms. students constantly disruptive and teachers lacked the ability to do anything about it.
Alum,1,Its kind of sad that a school once comparable to MIT is no longer remotely close to its former glory. Instructors are not in control of their own classes and frequently succumb to pressure from students. If you are doing a PhD here this place seems to keep everyone indefinitely.
Junior,1,"It's funny how, right after I left a bad review for Illinois (saying that ""the professors don't seem to care at all"") someone else wrote a glowing review saying exactly the opposite. This only proves my prior point; that there are administrative shills posting positive reviews for Illinois, so take all of the 4 and 5-star reviews with a grain of salt."
Junior,1,"Don't come to Illinois. The professors don't seem to care at all, and many of the students seem to hate it here. I think that most of the glowing reviews on Niche are from college administrators desperate to get more students in order to claim those tuition dollars. Because, in the end, that's all the university cares about."
Sophomore,1,"UIUC has been a horrible experience. It is a mass operation, where no individual student matters. No matter what they tell you on admitted student day etc., you truly are just a number at UIUC, and your professors will treat you as such. Almost all of my professors all seem to hate teaching, and they put zero effort into their classes. I wouldn't recommend UIUC to anybody."
Alum,1,"I hated attending here as a transfer student.  It's basically a research company posing as a university to bring in revenue.  The professors are paid through research grants, and have little to no interest in teaching, so the classes are basically self-taught.  Very expensive for what you get, especially in terms of housing.  If you're not in the Greek system, forget about a social life, you'll feel like an outsider.  I spoke with other transfer students who also went through the motions, but didn't feel like they really learned anything here.  If you interact with the graduate students, you'll realize that very few attended UIUC as an undergraduate, but went someplace where they were taught by teachers."
Graduate Student,1,"High grade inflation. Tons of cheating. Will nickel and dime students for every last cent in their wallet. The classes are mostly a waste of time, and involve team work so you will never actually learn anything worth applying. The MLIS program will make you pay all fee's regardless if you are taking classes online for the semester while doing an internship out of state. Total rip off."
Sophomore,1,Huge GPA inflation. Meaningless class. Don't expect anything unless you have 4.0. Green street is just like intentional student luxury car show
Freshman,1,You are just a number in this university.  Talking to financial aid is a joke.  No one can ever give you a straight answer.   The area is a dump and dorms are dirty and very dingy!
Alum,1,"Violence against minorities has been a stalking problem ever since I briefly attended UIUC, as a CPE at major universities all over the US I have never ever had a single incident with anybody from like this even once ever.  Horrific currently.  Faculty may as well not exist making academics poor to pointless you can't participate in or benefit from unless you go somewhere else. Ridiculous costs."
College Junior,1,All about drinking and parting
College Sophomore,1,Too Greek oriented and teachers did not try to connect to the students' level.
College Junior,1,"Never has anything caused me more stress in my life than applying for financial aid or scholarships to this supposed ""elite"" school.  I worked hard in high school to receive a very high GPA and be in the top 5 of my graduating class.  I was blatantly lied to when I visited the University of Illinois as they said high school GPA won't get you much in way of scholarships but once you prove your worth at the University you will be considered for scholarships.  Well after two years of proving my worth and having a GPA of 3.92 as a Chemical Engineering student I have received nothing but higher tuition and student loans.  The finaid office doesn't help with anything and it is almost impossible to receive money from this school."
College Junior,1,"Lincoln avenue residence hall is the worst housing I have ever experienced in my short life.  It is small, un-airconditioned, and equipped with zero wifi.  The dining hall has terrible food and dinner ends at 6:30 which is unbelievable considering many students have classes across campus in the evening.  There is no redeeming quality about this housing"
College Sophomore,1,"I did not get any scholarships, and had to take loans for all of my schooling. the loans were easy to get through the school how ever."
College Freshman,1,I barely got any financial and it was the worst to try and look for aid while doing homework
College Freshman,1,Don't expect anything—even if you have a 4.0.
College Senior,1,"Very popular, very white, very expensive. Seemed like a big part of campus until I moved out of the dorms. Greeks usually stick together and attend events hosted by each other."
College Senior,1,It's the worst for me because I don't like it. It's probably considered the best because there are always frats and sororities drinking and hosting parties. The bars on the campus are 19 so the whole school goes out. Many people are out all week.
College Senior,1,i havent found any good aid
College Junior,1,"The school does not have much money to give out in scholarships to help students. I have received two scholarships since coming here through other organizations such as the Illinois Club. However, these required a lot of work in order to apply and be able to get these scholarships."
College Junior,1,No free parking and parking passes are expensive.
College Freshman,1,"There's a lot of variety, but if you're from Chicago (as in the Cook County area) the food is horrible and nothing compared to the food up north. Everything is a bit costly and there's not many deals for students. I would say just stick to the food chain restaurants, but even those are a bit off. People from Champaign don't know what flavor is and don't know how to cook."
College Sophomore,1,The local atmosphere is very poor and urban.
College Junior,1,"There is a lot of racial tension at the school. My guess is that it is due to the high amount of international students at the university, but it affects all races."
College Sophomore,1,"Very dissatisfied with campus food, everything seems microwaved and unhealthy."
College Senior,1,"Since the state of Illinois is in such an insane amount of debt, they give virtually no money for students. Therefore I received almost no support from U of I, which makes it extremely difficult to keep up with the rising cost of school and living"
College Freshman,1,it seems like financial aid is only given to the students who are in desperate need of it and not those in the middle. those who can make it but are still going to be struggling a lot to make it and also have worked really hard for their achievements deserve some help.
College Freshman,1,It is annoying how many people are involved and have to buy their friends to party with.
College Sophomore,1,The weather is temperamental and may affect students going to class.
College Freshman,1,It's been snowing nonstop every since December
College Freshman,1,Winters are extremely could and classes do not get cancelled no matter what the conditions are. The warmer months are not too brutal.
College Freshman,1,Terrible weather. Up to -40 degrees F. Classes never canceled due to weather.
College Sophomore,1,There are parties everywhere and underage drinking is uncontrollable.
College Sophomore,1,"They do not consider giving federal work study to  students who have parents that are in middle class families. The application does not look at students' potentials, but rather they focus more on parents' financial situations."
College Freshman,1,"They are very lenient on most things, except parking."
College Freshman,1,It is absolutely impossible to find parking at my school on almost any day of the week. 
College Freshman,1,If you are not Greek at our school there is no point in being a student there.
College Freshman,1,"The rooms are tiny, roommates weren't picked so well, and the food is mediocre.  Also, the staff can be quite mean sometimes."
College Junior,1,I barely received any aid. Advice: search for private scholarships.
College Senior,1,I've had a pretty bad experience with the financial aid process at my school. Despite my high high school GPA I barely received any money. It was also very difficult for my mom to get any financial aid for me. I would strongly suggest going in-person. Almost all my friends have struggled with the financial aid process at my school.
College Junior,1,"Mainly on unofficial are the police strict. They are quicker to bust house parties and distribute drinking tickets. That's also the only weekend that bars are limited to 21+, as opposed to 19+. 

The police are more strict about parking tickets than underage drinking, in my opinion."
College Junior,1,"I'm a female student, and what I've noticed is that campus crime often involves a single female student being attacked in the Urbana side of campus (particularly around Lincoln Avenue). The fact that crimes continue to occur quite often around that area makes me feel like the police and safety services aren't that reliable; if they were, I would assume that more officials would be around that area late at night, thus decreasing the campus crime of the area. Unfortunately, that has yet to happen. 

UIUC does have services like Campus Rides or Campus Walks but again, those services are sketchy because they can refuse to help you if you're near a bus stop. I think that negates the purpose of the service entirely.

As an incoming freshman, you must live in university housing. I lived in one of the buildings in the ""six pack"" dorms and my freshman year, there were many reports of trespassers getting into buildings and stealing from rooms or camping out in bathrooms while people showered, despite the automatic locks to all buildings, staircases, and rooms."
College Sophomore,1,"The engineering scholarships at UIUC almost always go to minorities or women.  If you are hoping to win one as a white male, good luck."
Recent Alumnus,1,"If you are actually here for an education, you will HATE the greek life. It's completely superficial and paints the picture of a vapid, uncaring community here."
College Sophomore,1,"There have been times when googling ""Worst Dorms in the nation"" brought up some of UIUC's dorms. Needless to say, all but one of the dorms are old, run down, cramped, and horrible. They're being renovated, but still do not make up for the poor quality. You pay top dollar for terrible quality."
Recent Alumnus,1,Absolutely horrible. I hate the cold. Though snow control is very active here.
College Freshman,1,Students are better off taking the bus or walking because everything is near by. If you decide to bring a car then you have to pay for the parking meter and usual parking is not near your building you are heading to.
College Freshman,1,Parking lots are far from dorms. Meter parking on campus but still hard to find spot and not cheap.
College Freshman,1,"The campus holds standard rules for misconduct such as drugs, drinking or cheating in school, and for that I would give it a C; however, the odds of being caught doing anything wrong are minimal because there are hardly any overseeing eyes or police to monitor for such behavior, which is why I give it a D+."
College Sophomore,1,"For those non-Greek, frat boys and sorority girls are seen really negatively. Girls are drunken stupid girls who sleep with whoever will take them. Frat boys have stupid clothing tastes and get bad grades because they only get drunk and be bro's at the gym or at their House"
College Freshman,1,The university has very limited parking that are close to classes and dorms. You have to buy a all year permit to park and it is very expensive to aquire. So student are better off using the public transportation to get to class.
College Freshman,1,"There are hardly any scholarships handed out by the University.  If they do hand any out, they're only for the really smart people who get a million scholarships for outside sources."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The town is very big and there is a lot to see, but not much to do. The mall is about 30 minutes away on a bus ride and the mall itself isn't big. The people who like to party though may benefit since there are many fraternities and sororities that have parties when they are nearing the weekend, but there are a good number of counts of armed robberies at night as well. It does have several recreation centers where student may go and participate in sports and cooking or just to relax."
College Freshman,1,it's hard to get financial aid and scholarships here
College Junior,1,"Biggest Greek Community in the Nation, Which Comes With the Good and the Bad – U of I's Greek Community is huge, the largest in the nation. This means that our campus is heavily influenced by alcohol. It can be a really big problem. Alcohol transports are all too common and the bars on campus are 19+. This means underage drinking becomes a big issue, and often the bars are raided by police and drinking tickets are dished out. U of I is a blast, but also is a place where students have to find a good balance between studies and social life while being very cautious of what/where and when they partake in certain activities."
College Junior,1,"It's really expensive to buy a space if your living in an apartment, and also a space in one of the dorm parking lots. Furthermore, parking is really hard to find near campus because almost everywhere has a meter and our parking police are really strict."
College Freshman,1,"Many students don't bring their cars to campus because of the fees, the limited space, and the costs. Just take the bus - it's easier and much, much cheaper."
College Sophomore,1,"The police are pretty strict about underage drinking and drug use. First-time offenders get a letter sent home, and second- and third-time offenders are in danger of losing their housing. It's pretty serious if you get caught."
College Junior,1,Free parking on campus is nonexistent. Meter parking is available but scarce. Parking passes are extremely expensive.

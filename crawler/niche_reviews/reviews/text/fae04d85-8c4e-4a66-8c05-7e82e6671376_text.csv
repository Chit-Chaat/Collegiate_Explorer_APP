Freshman,5,I have been extremely satisfied with my contacts st Georgetown. I have stayed in touch with my admissions counselor and have been very pleased with how efficently she gets back to me!
Freshman,5,"I am an upcoming Freshman for Georgetown College. So far, I have had the best experience with them. I have taken a college visit there and stayed in touch with my admissions counselor. Upon arriving to my visit, the staff was very helpful and answered all the questions I have for my upcoming year as a Tiger at Georgetown College."
Freshman,5,"I love the small, loving atmosphere that Georgetown College has. I love the small class size and the opportunity to have one-on-one time with all professors. This atmosphere and the availability of professors has made the transition to college so much easier."
Freshman,5,Georgetown is a small campus where you actually know your professors and they go above and beyond to help you succeed.
Freshman,5,Georgetown has a great learning environment that encourages students to get involved and within a community of students and staff that truly care about each other.
Junior,5,"Georgetown is an amazing place that has offered an amazing education for me so far. The only thing I would change is the inclusion of students who are not involved in sorority and frat life, however I believe you will find this anywhere."
Freshman,5,The Family aspect is very strong at Georgetown. The small class sizes and even just the town people that walk through you know everyone.
Freshman,5,"Georgetown College is my dream school. The faculty are so genuine and so kind.  The small class sizes allow for very personal interactions with your professors and fellow students. Their wide variety of acedemic and athletic programs allow for anyone to be very involved on campus. If Greek life is your thing, there is plenty to choose from."
Senior,5,Absolutely beautiful campus. The school also has amazing professors who actually care about each and every student as a person. The town is an amazing small town feel with a big city (Lexington) just minutes away!  My time at Georgetown so far has been an amazing journey and I hope to continue it for my senior year!
Sophomore,5,Smaller class size is always a plus as it provides a more personal connection with teachers which leads to a better learning experience. The staff is warm and friendly and genuinely care about you as a student and as a person. There are many extracurricular activities to be involved with which is different than a lot of other smaller schools. There really is not any drama as all the students here are really nice and will smile at you as you walk past.
Niche User,5,"i am a perspective student and i have visited georgetown twice. i love the campus, staff, and the sports. the only reservation i had about the school is the size. it is a very small school and there is no racers i was told by current students "
Niche User,5,"What I loved most about Georgetown College is their small class size.  I felt like I had one-on-one experiences with my teacher, they knew my name; not just my face!  I loved the family-like atmosphere of a small campus.  Being a student-athlete comes with a lot of amazing opportunities not every student can experience.  The girls on their acro-tumbling team took me under their wing and made me feel special when I visited.  It's been 6 months and I still receive phone calls, texts, and emails from the girls checking to see how my senior year is going.  I LOVED Georgetown College."
College Sophomore,5,Athletics help bring our tiny school together we all get very excited for all the teams when they play. Professors and students cheer together in the bleachers.
College Sophomore,5,"Georgetown college is a liberal arts private school. They school is very small and has a friendly atmosphere. If I had to do it all over again I would still choose Georgetown, the professors and students are wonderful."
College Sophomore,5,"as an athlete, it was important for me to have nice facilites"
College Freshman,5,"I'm rushing in the Spring and I couldn't be more excited. The sororities and fraternities are extremely nice and really get involved in Georgetown. The Greek houses aren't the best, but you don't have to live in one to be in it."
College Sophomore,5,The wellness center and on campus counseling are always open and you can go there any time that you need too.
College Sophomore,5,I haven't tried for any internships but I know our career center has held many nexus events to help student become career ready and open opportunities for them.
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Georgetown!  The small class size and the overall friendliness of everyone is amazing!
College Sophomore,5,I think georgetown sets a great community setting in the housing department by spacing out the dorms and having most of them in one general area. I also think that the upgraded housing is a nice option if you are able to afford it
College Sophomore,5,"Greek life is important to Georgetown but that is partially because of the size of our school, more than half of the students I would say are greek, but everyone is treated the same and the Greek associations help our community and the surrounding communities out a lot."
College Sophomore,5,All Georgetown's students are very spirited and passionate for the sports on campus and everyone supports each other.
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love my school, and even though financially I cannot afford to attend Georgetown I have had help from my family, student loans,  and having two part time jobs. I hope to be awarded this scholarship to help with the cost of tuition. But even with the expense there no where else I would rather be and no other school I would trust my education, saftey, and success too."
College Freshman,5,Everyone that I know received a great deal of financial aid from my school. The process is very easy and they walk you through it.
College Freshman,5,"It is definitely tough here, but that is a part of being prestigious."
College Freshman,5,I really like the administration here. they teach you to grow up and be responsible and that is what most people need.
College Freshman,5,There is almost no crime on campus at all.
College Freshman,5,The Biology program at my school is excellent.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus
College Freshman,5,Greek life is extremely important.
College Freshman,5,"There are lots of variety and every type of food offered, and it is no more than a 5 minute drive. Best place to checkout is Galvins or Favas."
College Freshman,5,"It may seem expensive, but the college is great at giving away large scholarships!"
College Senior,5,georgetown really tries hard with academics. they do a really good job.
College Junior,5,Couldn't find a better home away from home.
College Junior,5,Amazing professors who share their passion
College Sophomore,5,My favorite thing overall so far on campus has been attending basketball games and watching those that play in intramural basketball. I'm a big basketball fan and enjoy supporting my school and friends that play.
College Sophomore,5,I love my major! The Sociology department is full of wonderful professors who would do anything for their students. They are ALWAYS available for anything that the student needs and are incredible teachers who are very passionate about what they teach. The workload is sometimes strenuous but you are always very prepared and can do the work. You are also constantly given opportunities for internships.
College Freshman,5,"NAIA National Champions & contender in several sports. Football, Volleyball & Basketball. Great atlic support from students and administration. Georgetown just applied to move to DII."
College Freshman,5,Don't be embarrassed or afraid to talk with the financial aid advisors. They will work with you to get the most financial aid possible. Find out scholarship deadlines and meet them. Grants are available to help offset tuition costs. Do your FAFSA before Jan 1st! State and fed grants go quickly. Make sure you are in line and have all of your paperwork completed.
College Freshman,5,I have an advisor who has worked with me to guide me through curriculum need and my professors have made it an exciting process. One on one interaction with your professors is the best.
Sophomore,4,It was a great small community feel and everyone was very well connected and was able to get you well known and connected with others in certain career fields.
Alum,4,"Good and bad from a small college. I knew all of my professors on a personal level, but there was not a lot of class flexibility."
Freshman,4,Georgetown College is an excellent school for a liberal arts education. All the staff are super friendly and professors look out for your best interest.
Freshman,4,"I wish they had more activities on the weekends, but I enjoy the size of the campus. I also wish they would improve on the dorm buildings, since they've been on the campus since the very beginning."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at Georgetown College. I am in my second semester. So far, the school has wowed me with their academics. Every professor is caring and takes the next step to make sure the student understands."
Freshman,4,Georgetown College is a small campus that is focused on student success. Professors are always willing to help students. Students on campus are friendly and always willing to help.
Junior,4,"It’s a great academic school, professors help whenever need turtoring is always available. Food is edible but not very good, not very diverse, but is getting there, have to drive to Lexington to do anything fun but it’s only about 15 mins away"
Sophomore,4,"Georgetown College is the perfect college for anyone looking for a close knit community. The professors are personable and very helpful. You have a name at Georgetown, you are not just a number to this school."
College Freshman,4,The teachers actually act like they care about you and your well-being. The classes are small.
College Freshman,4,There is at least one security officer patrolling campus at any time.
College Freshman,4,The athletic programs on campus are at the top of their respective leagues.
College Freshman,4,The small college feel allows for more personalized learning and development for each student.
College Junior,4,"The most popular study areas are the study rooms in the library or the places with computers in the science building or library. The workload depends on the class you are taking and the level of difficulty. Classes are 100, 200, 300 + leveled classes with 300 + level being the harder classes with more work. However, each professor is different in how they believe students should learn. I think the workloads in my classes have been average and acceptable. Office hours are always helpful and study sessions or tutors are available too."
College Junior,4,"Everyone is accepted at Georgetown, whether you are gay, black, poor, short, rich, etc. No one judges each other and we are all good friends with each other. No matter where we grew up, who we love, or the color of our skin. There are many African American students who play sports, participate in the school events, in greek life, and there are gay athletes and amazing gay students. Our school does not judge the people within it."
College Junior,4,"Our career center is full of people who know how to get us jobs that are right for what we want to do. They are open to all students to help with resume building and job hunts. Also, many professors in your major department are willing to help you find a career or a location to work at in the future. Many of those professors have come from great places or schools too and know exactly how to help you."
College Junior,4,"The class size at Georgetown is small, with lectures being the biggest classes with around 40/50 people. We are a Liberal Arts school and the students must fulfill core course requirements in order to graduate. So we take language, science, math, music, art, exercise science, etc. courses. Some professors teach with lectures, notes, power points, other from books, and videos. All of the professors I've had were interested in me as a person and a student. They want so badly for us all to do well and they push us past what we thought were our limits."
College Junior,4,"The sororities and fraternities host the Welcome Back parties at our school, which allow freshmen to see all of the Greek houses and meet many of the Greek students,all while unwinding after the stress of starting college. I am not part of Greek life and have always had pleasant encounters with people of Greek life. There is housing for all of the Greek groups on campus and open to sophomores to seniors, but it is not mandatory for you to live in the house. The sororities are incredibly decorated while the fraternities mostly just try to keep theirs clean. The Greek society is very open at our school and students of any grade are able to go through the process of rush."
College Junior,4,"Almost everyone at my school plays a varsity sport and in their off season will participate in an intramural sport as well. Many of our sports teams, men's and women's, are very talented. Our football team won their conference championship in the 2015 season. Our men's basketball team unfortunately lost in the NAIA Division 1 National Championship with a buzzer beater, but had a phenomenal 2015-2016 season. My sports team, the women's lacrosse team, also lost in the NAIA Invitational National Championship game and place 2nd overall in our 2016 league. A great feat for a team that has only been a varsity program for 2 years. The school spirit at football games is amazing, so many students are playing in the game and many more are watching with players' families in the stands. We have a beautiful grass softball field, grass baseball field, two grass practice fields, and an awesome turf game field. Our athletic weight room has all the equipment needed, even if it is a little old. Some thing I love about Georgetown is that all of the teams get along and try to support each other as much as their schedules allow it."
College Junior,4,"I am blessed with the opportunity to play a sport at my college and because of it, I have gained life long friends through the challenges and celebrations we've experienced together. At my school, I have yet to meet a teacher that did not want to better you, make you feel at home, or see you succeed. All of the teachers within my major department have made learning fun, as cheesy as that sounds, but I loved going to class every day. There are pros and cons to all schools, this one is far from my family and very small. However, I would not choose to go to another school because I know that I would be an extremely different person if I had gone to any other school. I would hang with a different crowd, my personality would greatly change, and perhaps my dream job in an ordinary department."
College Junior,4,We have trainings multiple times a year to address the issue. Students just have to take advantage of them.
College Junior,4,I have never felt I could not approach a professor if I needed help
College Junior,4,"Holly James does a lot of work by herself, so she's stretched pretty thin, but she does a great job."
College Junior,4,I am part of campus Greek-life and have meet great people and had lots of opportunities for personal growth.
College Junior,4,"I have definitely found my niche! I have so many opportunities, and I really feel that I am cared for in my classes and extracurriculars."
College Sophomore,4,"there are many opportunities for jobs/internships, but you have to be very persistent with the people who work in the career office or else they forget about you/things you asked for help with"
College Sophomore,4,"the townhouses are very nice and have a lot of room in them especially since we only have 4 people in our house. it allows us to have our own space, but also have a common area in our house to cook and hang out"
College Sophomore,4,"the Spanish professor was not helpful at all, and I did not learn anything. she was the reason I changed my major from Spanish to something else. the cafeteria food is not very good and there are not many different options for food. they offer the same things everyday. in addition, the times that the caf is open is very inconvenient especially since I am an athlete too. the caf is rarely open when I can get lunch or dinner after practice and it does not stay open very late. this is also very inconvenient because there are no other on campus options for food, so if you miss the cafeteria hours you have to go out and buy food instead of using your overly expensive meal plan. another thing that is not very convenient is that there are many different types of housing (dorms, apartments, off campus, and townhouses) but only two meal plans. everyone is required to buy the most expensive, unlimited meal plan unless you live in an apartment. however, I live in a townhouse and I can fix a lot of food in my house, so the meal plan and money spent paying for it goes to waste, especially since the caf hours are so inconvenient. I think there should be an option for townhouse students to get the apartment meal plan because townhouses are very similar."
College Freshman,4,I love the community this school has. Everyone is so close and connected and I like that feel. I like the fact that everyone is friendly and really wanting me to succeed. Campus life is great; it's easy to get involved on campus and Greek life if huge.
College Freshman,4,Georgetown College has been a wonderful experience. The good things definitely outweigh the bad.
College Freshman,4,24 campus safety on a small campus is nice
College Freshman,4,The Graves center is very helpful
College Freshman,4,Georgetown is wonderful in both academic and athletic areas.
College Junior,4,A few local places with some chains make it easy to find something other than school food
College Junior,4,"Everybody gets t least one scholarship, and it may look expensive, but it's not that much"
College Freshman,4,The degree program her is prestigious and that is what I came here for.
College Freshman,4,The relationships with the teachers and professors here are one of a kind and I love it.
College Freshman,4,I am not really looking at the money figures since it will pay for itself.
College Freshman,4,Sports are good but too much emphasis is placed on football
College Freshman,4,"Some of the fraternity housing is run-down, but the sorority houses are nice, and everyone goes Greek here."
College Senior,4,there is always a place for someone. you just have to find it.
College Senior,4,"georgetown is small, but there is so much close by. 20 min to lexington, and like an hour to Cincinnati"
College Senior,4,I'm Vegetarian and am very grateful for the new line that Georgetown put into the cafeteria. It makes my day better and stress free.
College Junior,4,Small campus creates a safe haven
College Sophomore,4,"I don't participate in Greek life and therefore, I couldn't exactly say what Greek life is like at our school. It wasn't something I was interested in, but I do have friends that participate, and they don't treat me any different than those that are in the Greek life."
College Sophomore,4,"There are several different options that are chain restaurants, and then there are a few places that are only located in that area. Most of these places are fairly close to the college and usually have decent prices. Some of the have student discounts, but most don't. The best places to check out would probably have to be Favas or Galvins. They are very popular to the residents in the area."
College Sophomore,4,"Weather doesn't usually affect too much. I deal with the usual, rain, snow things like that. I chose a college that experiences all four seasons which I usually like for the most part."
College Sophomore,4,Student life on campus is great. There are many different events that go on that students are able to participate in. The different facilities on campus are great and usually have just what you need.  Sporting events are even better! It's always fun going to support our school. Student life on campus is just overall great and I see no problems with it.
College Sophomore,4,"My school is unique in the way of how small the school is. There is around 1,000 students, maybe more. There's lots of one on one attention from professors, and with me being a science major, we have one of the best buildings equipped for science majors. We are granted with equipment that some aren't. And I love it. My school is very big on STEM majors!"
College Sophomore,4,The professors are INCREDIBLE here! They are all very intelligent and passionate about their courses. They invest in each student and care so deeply that the student not only passes their course but also grows in every area of life. The professors are always available for office hours and are more than willing to help if the student is confused or just needs advice.
College Sophomore,4,The small campus allows for students to have an intimate relationship with each other. Everyone quickly gets to know everyone and it is truly like a large family. There are MANY campus wide events that help the student get connected with the broader community.
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life is a major part of the Georgetown College campus. It often seems as if the Greeks are the only people on campus and I can see how non-Greeks are sometimes left out. non-Greeks have also normally had bad experiences with Greek life (recruitment) and this causes a major friction between the two. That being said, Greek life is a great thing to be a part of and each Greek chapter works to make campus a better place, through community service and philanthropy."
College Sophomore,4,The college has done a great job of bringing diversity and making it an important part of our student life. There are a variety of events and programs that enhance our knowledge on diversity and thus make it more acceptable.
College Sophomore,4,"Like any school, alcohol is an issue that will never be completely weeded out. Georgetown works extremely hard to pursue a no-tolerance policy on campus though and really does a great job of keeping the students safe. Peer pressure is not an issue. I choose not to drink but never feel left out or as if I am excluded."
College Junior,4,They are great just sometimes have a few issues
College Junior,4,My school is a athletic school I guess you could say because most of the student body is involved in sports and if they are not then they either support or are involved in intramural sports. GO TIGERS!!
College Junior,4,Here at Georgetown College we are allowed to have fun but are encouraged to have safe fun. Some of the policies have been broken by students but the college allows us to have a social life so they let it go sometimes. I dont think that any of the policies affect students academic work.
College Freshman,4,Always someone to catch ride with. Airport in lexington.
College Freshman,4,Security is strong on campus. I have no safety isues.
College Freshman,4,Available at the lab. Always upgraded and state of the art. Always one available when needed.
College Freshman,4,Everyone involved was very helpful
Sophomore,2,"normal online, not a lot of resources, this campus is pretty archaic when it comes to technology. they use canvas and mostly just do quizzes online. for science labs, its hell you have to zoom in and have someone be your hand in the lab. it's insane"
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is not really required, however, most of the school is a part of Greek Life."
College Freshman,2,"The regular dorms are awful. I've been to a lot of colleges for camps and UK's old dorms are probably the only ones that were worse than these. Most students end up living in the townhouses before they graduate since it's a total upgrade from the dorm life. But I manage to live in the dorms. My room is very cozy and even though the showers aren't the best, I deal with it."
College Junior,2,Unless you live close to the school or are married or are over 24 you must live on campus
College Freshman,2,"There are not many options at night. Once it gets late, the only options are Taco Bell and occasionally McDonald's is open."
College Freshman,2,"Not many people at Georgetown College have school spirit at all. If you go to a basketball game, there will most likely be about 10 people."
College Junior,2,Most students live on campus and if they do not then they are commuters. It is better to live on campus and get involved.
College Sophomore,2,Our cafe isn't good at all. They act like they don't care 
College Sophomore,2,It cost to much to live off campus and they take some aid away too
College Junior,2,Buildings are old and in need of some work.
College Freshman,2,"Public transportation around Georgetown is not really good.There are no buses,so if someone wants to go to town he  has to call a taxi which is expensive. However, the school organizes a Friday trip to Walmart .This enables students to buy some essentials. if a student misses the school transportation to walmart, the other only way he or she can use  to go to town is  by asking for a ride from his friends which is inconvenience . The fact that  there are no buses are around town make transportation difficult."
College Junior,2,"If you've got a car that you want to keep on campus, then you've got to pay for a sticker which costs around $90. Freshman have parking lots right beside their dorms, but that's not always the case for upperclassmen. The most desirable parking spots fill up quickly, especially during the week. However, even if you are forced to park in the abyss, it's really probably not more than a 5-10 minute's walk from your dorm or classroom. Visitors park free, if they're ticketed then you can easily file a report with Campus Safety. Some areas are restricted for faculty/staff during weekdays but available to students on nights and weekends. You can walk from one end of campus to the other in about 10 minutes, so a car isn't absolutely necessary. Campus Safety even offers to take students on a trip to wal-mart once a week, free of charge."
College Freshman,2,Parking on campus can be a hazard at times. I do not think it is fair that one dorm has a much larger parking lot than another. If you do not got get here early enough if you do not live on campus or coming back home from the weekend most likely you will be finding a parking spot in the back and have to walk. Which that is inconvenient when it is cold outside or when you have a lot to carry to another building. Mostly people do live on campus so it is not always a huge issue. The parking permits cost 90 dollars. I think that is a ridiculous price for a sticker that is no bigger than my palm especially since we have to get a new one each school year. People already have problems paying just to go to school anywhere not just Georgetown so why would you make a person pay that much when they can use some of that money towards books or something else useful.
College Freshman,2,"Most of the dorms are old and not well taken care of. For instance, Knight Hall (the freshman girls dorm) has no a/c and heat barely works in most of the rooms. The buildings all have high mold problems and need to be knocked down. They are building new town houses though that are extremely nice."
College Sophomore,2,Very nice small town. On the other hand there is almost nothing to do. People go to other schools for a social life.
College Sophomore,2,"Overlly hyped NAIA football and basketball. THe college struggles to fill the spectator seats for these events. The rest of the sports struggle to find funding.
The track and field team for example dosnt have a track and has to train with high schoolers."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms at my school are very old and need remodeling badly. Instead of remodeling old dorms, my school has started building townhouses, which are very expensive to live in. Most students just can't afford it, and are forced to stay in ancient dorm buildings."
College Sophomore,2,"Major Baptist Students – The school is considered a baptist school, however, students are told that is not so. With international students, it may be uncomfortable to them to have Christianity being forced on them. Our school is very focused on God based on Christianity, although they say they welcome other religions, students don't accept them as they should."
College Sophomore,2,"Visitations seemed to be strict as there are set times in each dorm for students of opposite genders are allowed to stayed. However, if a boy visits a girl dorm with his girlfriend, there is nothing against having intimate connect with that person, since we are consider adults. That is not a great idea for your roommate(s) who may or could walk in on you and your boyfriend (This works for the other way around a girl in a boy's dorm). If you wanted to get away with a boy being in a girl's dorm or a girl being in a boy's dorm, you could just stay in their room and spend the night. Then leave right as hours for visits apply. Many students do that."
College Sophomore,2,Not Much – There is not much to do in town. You have to find your own forms or entertainment.
Junior,1,"UNPROFESSIONAL!!
Financial aid is HORRIBLE! Being a first generation college student they took advantage of that. They added on extra fees AFTER the semester had started and denied a student loan to pay for the added fees but then demanded the money be paid in full. After withdrawing to transfer they cleared out my outside scholarships and conveniently had no recollection of them in the systems despite getting the exact same ones for the previous two years.  They released my official transcript to one college but then denied it when I requested another due to an outstanding balance (that was covered by my scholarships!) A $500 payment was made and a payment plan was tried to be set up and they still denied to release my transcript! I was hung up on TWICE by the manager in the financial aid office when trying to set up a payment plan to receive my transcript.
 They are in debt and they do not currently have academic accreditation because they are not in good standings."
College Junior,1,"Georgetown College requires all students to live on campus all four years, so we do not have off-campus living."
College Freshman,1,"You can only live off-campus if you're older than 24, have kids, live with parents, or married.  "
College Junior,1,"It's very difficult to even find a way to live off campus without georgetown taking away half of your scholarships. The best ways to do so are living with your parents or being married, which obviously isn't an option for everyone."
College Sophomore,1,"Minorities (such as myself) are brought in purely for statistically purposes. Despite repeated racial incidences by a racist fraternity on campus towards minorites, their alumni provide enough money to prevent their expulsion.
Many people are biased towards minorities."
College Sophomore,1,"Unles you are willing to pay an additional 2-5K more for better housing, expect crap. My first year at the mens dormitory: guys pooped in the showers, footbal team was constantly ripping of the waterfountains. Not to metioned the bathrooms are never cleaned, only sprayed down. So around mid year half the showers have mold on them.

My window broke midway through my first semester, it took maintainance 5 months to fix it. We literally had to duct tape towels across the windows to keep heat in during December.

As far as girls dorms are concerned: the dorms have asbestos in the walls and dont have AC. THe school dosnt have the money for it but can build multi million dollar townhouses for high income individuals."
College Sophomore,1,"Very Bad food, very bad dorms, and social life. Total cost is almost at 40,000 dollaars. Most people who dont rush a Greek organization trasnfer. Pointless to pay so much for decent academics from a unknown college."

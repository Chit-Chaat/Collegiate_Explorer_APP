Graduate Student,5,"I received my masters from Logan and had an amazing experience. The professors were very knowledgeable on their topics, approachable, and helpful. I felt the content of the classes were relevant and stimulating.  All the classes included weekly discussions, which aided in increasing interactions with classmates. I highly recommend Logan University if you are wanting to get your masters in nutrition!"
Junior,5,"Logan University is a private university with a special focus on education in chiropractic and health sciences. In my personal experiences from the moment I applied until this moment, it has been a very pleasant trip. The communication of the professor and the counselor is good, they want the student to feel heard. I think that being a small university compared to others, the service tends to be more personal. That's something I appreciate because I don't enjoy being in a large crowd. The service, help, and technology offered are very good. I do not regret the decision I made."
Graduate Student,5,"The communication between to students, advisors, and professors is amazing. I have never attended nor worked anywhere that has run so smoothly. It is also a nice well kept campus. Social is awesome, everyone knows everyone."
Sophomore,5,"Logan University is the only university I have found that offers completely online Bachelor of Science degrees Biology and Life Science. The online part does not make academics easy, but rather allows the student grow and further their knowledge and challenge their thinking. The low tuition rate is also a huge plus. The whole experience I have had in 2018 has made me proud to be part of the student body at Logan."

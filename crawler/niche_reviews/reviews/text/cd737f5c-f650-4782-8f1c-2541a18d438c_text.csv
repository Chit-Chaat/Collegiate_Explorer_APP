Sophomore,5,"It's very difficult for me to be able to do online courses so I was worried at first when I had to take psychology, sociology, and nutrition online. But all three of my professors were prepared, which reassured me. My classes were really challenging, and the classwork was heavy and difficult. But I still got through it thanks to my professors' help and candor towards answering my questions. They often responded very quickly as well. So thanks to my professors' readiness towards online learning, I had a good experience."
Sophomore,5,"The professors are really good at teaching and you can tell that they really care. I felt welcomed here the very moment I started going to this college! The materials are both challenging and doable, my professors are often open to questions and reply very quickly. Overall, I really enjoyed going here!"
Freshman,5,"I like their available online classes.  With a full time job and taking classes online here creates a lot of opportunities. I don’t have to worry that online classes here will be limited, instead every quarter classes I can continue on towards my degree."
Freshman,5,Going here has been a real help in starting my college experience. I plan on transferring after my associates to a Washington University. This community college has helped my financially and academically.
Alum,5,"This college is set up very nicely with online Canvas and it is easy to use and follow. You can go entirely online and still feel connected to the college. It offers both online and campus classes, and sometimes, it's hybrid. WIth Covid19, they were very quick to go online only in response to the virus and very little spread occurred from there as a result. They care. My one complaint was my core class instructor. In every other way, he was awesome. Responsive, eager, nice, thoughtful, but he never taught a single thing related to the class and the assignments were screenshot assignments. I have heard from other people in other programs that their instructors are very very good, and in other classes i had, including visual basic, the instructors were very very involved in the lecturing on the subject matter, so it's just this one program i found. So think twice before you do web development here. I had plenty of experience in web development prior to school, so I had no trouble."
Graduate Student,5,"In my country I was student in my 20is, but I have never experienced online class. Since I took first online class it is my preferred way to take classes. You have to have  time managing skills and you are good to go with online classes. I love my experience online and on campus."
Graduate Student,5,"I was at EdCC as mature women student. I love and like it. I got my AA transfer degree there, online and on campus. They have free parking for students. Also they have place where can you find and post your used books-to save some money. Overall I liked being student there."
Sophomore,5,I have taken some classes online and they were great. The professors are very helpful and clear with the expectations. The online learning structure is excellent.
Sophomore,5,"Edmonds Community College has many useful resources to help you be a successful student. Everybody on campus is there to help you, with whatever concerns you might have."

Freshman,5,"I like the class sizes, and how much the professors are engaged with helping us learn. I can always feel confident about going to my professor to ask for help. I also The only downside I would say about the college is the parking. If you have afternoon classes it's usually impossible to find a spot, and it would be great if they added another lot."
Niche User,5,"This is my first year at EDCC and I am so glad to have made this decision! The classes are wonderful and so interesting teached by passionate and amazing teachers! People are friendly and hard-working, I have met best friends for a lifetime here and I am more motivated than ever, not once have I felt like no one was here to help me, there’s so much opportunities and support systems that I guarantee you: everything is possible!"

Freshman,5,"I’m an island girl. Never lived anywhere else before. I am so glad I chose Edmonds Community College. Going to school here has been the best transition. There are a lot of different cultures and local girls. ...just like home. I have the opportunity to take online classes, as well as the traditional in class setting. I am also a Triton athlete, the variability in class schedules works great with the practice and game schedules I have. Edmonds has been a great start to adulthood."
Freshman,5,"I love the Edmond's Campus. All of the trees and plants and sitting areas are so inviting and the whole place feels very welcoming. The buildings are big and there is room to stretch while not being so big as to be ridiculous. I can get from one end of campus to the other in 5 minutes without having to sprint. Which is a bonus!
I can't speak for the party or sports life as I participate in neither but I hear it is quite fun. 
I have had quite a lot of fun with my teachers and the campus staff is very supportive. All in all, I am looking forward to continuing my education with Edmonds."
Sophomore,5,I love attending Edmonds Community College. The instructors are supportive and it's been a wonderful learning experience. The campus is full of diverse and friendly people and has a variety of services available to students.
Sophomore,5,Super friendly campus. Staff and teachers all seem to want to help. I would recommend this school for someone wanting to transfer to a university or get the necessary training to get a technical skills job.
Freshman,5,It is extremely affordable. Everyone is nice and friendly. They are polite and everyone and everything is extremely welcoming.
Graduate Student,5,"As an international student, I feel really comfortable studying at Edmonds Community college. It is super easy to find your own community and people from your country. I always say that networking is a huge part of your education, and it's quite easy to do so in Edmonds CC. You find people all over the place and are able to build relationships quickly."
Sophomore,5,"Good sized campus with a consistently growing community. Helpful and understanding teachers who provide lots of extra help during office hours. Easy access to library, computer labs, advisors, etc.. Surrounding neighborhood is populated with many stores and food places. So far, everyone I've met were really nice and helpful."
Senior,5,"The faculty here are caring and willing to do anything they can to help the student succeed. I have gone to other community colleges and the amount of caring and willingness to help the student succeed far outweighs any of the others. The campus is laid out well and there are so many resources available to the students that were not available at some of the other colleges I attended. The academics seem to be better as well, I feel like I am learning so much more and understanding so much more this time around. I recommend this college to all my friends that are considering going back to school."
Freshman,5,"It has a great campus with supporting professors. Not only do they have a great library, but also a student-ran cafe."
Graduate Student,5,"I was very pleased that I studied in a multicultural, multinational environment and built relationships, met with professors, advisors and consultants. During my studies in EDCC, I volunteered as an assistant during International Assistant Program Orientation Week. Many college courses require teamwork. All this experience helped me to get a lot of useful skills. I liked the flexible schedule of classes, for example, there are classes online or in the evening. This is very convenient for those who work. Thanks to my transfer degree, I was accepted to the university without any problems. And my credits were transfered to the university."
Niche User,5,I have been taking a few classes here and have never had a problem. Safety measures are taken to make sure everyone is safe.
Sophomore,5,"Edmonds Community College is an amazing school. I have gone here for two years and I work here and I couldn't be happier with the people and the academics. There are all kinds of resources to help students, and many programs available for all interests. It's a great school, especially if you plan to transfer to a four-year from here because it has several different transfers that are directly related to your major!"
Sophomore,5,EDCC is a great place to receive a a degree that transfers to a University or Vocational degree. There are many classes where you can update your skills for your current career. The campus is very pretty and clean with great security. I love being part of the EDCC community.
Sophomore,5,"Edmonds Community College is great! They offer so many degree/certificate programs and the staff and students are diverse, competent and friendly."
Freshman,5,"Edmonds Community College has been really great so far, the diversity in people is amazing, without it being completely overcrowded like I see all of colleges being. The staff care so much, that means the teachers, the administration, and even the student workers. Everyone is ready to help and on top of what they are doing, so not much confusion going on and you feel taken care of. I am really enjoying my time at Edmonds."
Freshman,5,Employees are always available to answer questions which makes my life so much easier. This a very diverse school with mostly younger generation. The cafeteria has a large variety of meals to chose from. The classrooms are nice and they offer financial aid to those who qualify.
Sophomore,5,"Instructors are very professional. The brier hall offers very delicious foods especially their cheesecakes. Besides, EdCC has a lot of computer labs. You won’t regret it to study in this college!!!"
Freshman,5,I love being apart of the EdCC student body.  I began my journey with the Edmonds Community Summer quarter of 2017 and loved it ever since. There is nothing that I would change on the campus.
Freshman,5,"I love attending EDCC. Everyone is very welcoming and make sure that you stay on top of your work. Unfortunately,  I slacked off my first two quarters here ( fall and winter) but I have a few fantastic staff here that are making sure I will graduate on time."
Freshman,5,Pretty good college. The campus is larger than other community colleges ive been too but easy to navigate around. Staff is helpful and easy to get ahold of when i have questions.
Freshman,5,I am super impressed with the community atmosphere. The instructors are knowledgeable and helpful . I dont know about the party scene or the athletics or the dorms because I am an older student who lives off campus.
Freshman,5,"There are multiple of reason on why I like Edmonds Community College. The staff, professors, everyone who works at the school are very kind and generous and will do anything to help you with school or anything you are looking for. Everyone will help you stay on track and to make sure that you are going to succeed and go far in your life. I am currently on the Women's soccer team and all the men and women on the sports teams also want to see you move up to a higher level and to not fail in any classes so that we are able to play the game we love. There is such a wide variety of different students that attend at the school which this brings positivity to everyone and to our community as a whole. The food, drinks on campus are a good price as well and taste amazing too. What I love the most about this school is how many options you have to choose for your academics. I have nothing negative to say about my school because this college is a great school to ahead."
Alum,5,"Beautiful campus, great variety of classes, knowledgeable and personable teachers! I had one encounter/quarter with a particularly rude professor (Professor Laminu), however will not hold that against EDCC, because the majority should be able to miss that insolent man."
Sophomore,5,"the entire staff is there to help you succeed in your college mission. Every aspect of school has such an amazing staff. There have been a couple of quarter where I have had two instructors who have doctorates in their field. All of the instructors that I have encountered in my seven quarters of Education thus far have all been compassionate, very helpful, and always there when I have needed them"
Freshman,5,"Edmonds helped me so much to get ready for my first year of college. I was terrified I was going to get lost or even fail. But, all of the teachers and staff really help you out and make sure you’re available to everyone resource they have. There’s no other community college better than this one!"
Niche User,5,I like to I could start taking classes in the child care industry.The teacher's are very helpful to the students
Sophomore,5,"It was a good college, teachers were supportive and helpful, the facilities were limited but the ones that were available were excellent."
Sophomore,5,This school used to be looked down. But they are improving buildings and parking spaces. Lots of college experiences and club to enjoy.
Sophomore,5,All the teachers are experts and strongly encourage coming to see them if you need extra help. Campus is big with lots of buildings but there are a lot of maps and everything is easy to find. Great campus resources and sports team. The only downside is that parking can be hard to find especially around 11am. Edmonds c.c. is by far the best community college I've gone to and I've tried 3 others in the area
Sophomore,5,Edmonds Community College is a diverse campus. I really enjoy being part of it's loving community. During attending the college I have met great people that impacted my life in a positive way. I am very thankful to have the opportunity to be a student at  Edcc.
Sophomore,5,"Overall I believe this is a fantastic community college that offered a lot more than I ever expected. I originally came to this school because it was the only community college with a Horticulture program that had more than just landscaping. The classrooms and facilities are well equipped and comfortable. The quality of the teachers however, can vary widely; some are fantastic and others are horrible. Dorms are nice but incredibly expensive, the local are is mostly boring with decent shopping and food, campus food is good with decent prices and athletics has a much bigger program than I would ever expect for a community college. Safety is alright but, I have seen few warning emails a year about some crimes on campus  that come along with safety tips. EDCC is a fantastic college with high transfer rates and fantastic facilities and programs. I continue to attend even with an hour long, congested traffic commute."
Sophomore,5,"I like that EDCC is really diverse. They have a large student population for a CC. It's really diverse, there is  all walks of life that study here from freshman right out of HS to people in their 50's. One thing that is horrendous is the parking..... the parking here is horrible honestly it tales you like half an hour to find a spot and its a true miracle if you do."
Alum,5,"This school does an excellent job of catering to every student's needs. People of all different backgrounds and ages can all get what they need at this college. As someone who attended during high school to earn high school and college credit, I felt like an equal to everyone else, despite my young age. Overall the teachers, opportunities, prices, and students were great. "
Recent Alumnus,5,"I love the professors. They are mostly so helpful and friendly. Moreover, the ESL teachers, they understand our struggle as being foreign students. The size for classes were mostly small, usually 20-30 students."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The professors are good, friendly, and so helpful. EdCC offers a diversity in the professors and the students. Lots of students come from foreign countries and it was just amazing to know how people from different country socialize with foreign students."
College Junior,5,this school has way more programs to choose from than other community programs
Sophomore,4,I had a struggle dealing with the financial aid department.  They were not communicating with the departments about students who were on financial aid.  It is understandable that there were challenges due to Covid but after repeated requests it was not until the last week of the quarter that they finally took care of students financial aid awards.  Other than that the College is really great.  The instructors are fantastic.
Senior,4,"At Edmonds Community College, the students are there to learn and help is always available to learn even through the covid 19 pandemic.  There is alot of financial assistance awarded to students to complete their education.  There is cultural diversity.  Also, class size is small so there is more ability to ask questions and learn.  There are also alot of groups to participate in on campus.  We have our own movie theater on campus too.  
   The canvas setup for our classes makes learning easier too because we can schedule appointments with our teachers, email our teachers, know exactly when assignments are due, and what each assignment entails.  The submit links make turning in assignments easy and you know right away if your assignment is turned in.  Also, assignments are electronically checked for plagiarism and or similarity to other papers and a percent is given after you submit your papers. This helps students be honest and fix if they forgot to cite the source of information"
Senior,4,"Yes, I took all of the last two quarters solely online.  The instructors and college built new classes and altered in person classes so students could get the educational learning experience they wanted and need to be successful in their field they are studying for.  
     The way that the classes are all layed out in a canvas classroom format makes it easy to know what to do and when it is due.   
     Zoom virtual office hours are held for students when they need to meet with the teacher.  Also questions can be asked via email.  
     Alot of our assignments were also posted to a discussion board the week following the due date we submit them via a canvas submit link.  The discussion board let's us view other classmates papers and comment on what we learned from other classmates. We can also ask questions too if we are unclear about information another student wrote in their paper.  This helps get different perspectives and widen the scope of learning online."
Alum,4,There are a lot of very helpful staff at this college. Most of them want to help you in every way you could think of. I was able to get a scholarship through the efforts of my work study supervisor Elisa. It helped me complete the ATA degree without a financial burden on me.
Freshman,4,"even though I am taking online and only one class per semester I can get every information as much as I want . the only thing I could not get is scholar ship and finical Aid , especially for scholarship I think they give to in favor or some one they know , that why I am a little bit sad"
Freshman,4,"Edmonds Community College is a welcoming, diverse school with great opportunities provided to there students. All of the professors that I had made an effort to work with there students to provide them with the best learning experience possible."
Freshman,4,"I think the professors are doing the best they can with COVID 19 going on. Adjustments are made as we go. Easy on grades. I took online classes before and they were okay, however, I had one professor that never responded to my email and I had to stock him on campus for some information."
Freshman,4,"Very well ran college with some good STEM professors. Easy to choose classes through web site and I had no need to talk to advisors since the spreadsheet for each degree is easy to read.
Free parking!"
Sophomore,4,"My experience in EDCC is I can say I'm enjoying it. As a student, we always demanded to study, and sometimes I get down too, but the view in EDCC is making me calm, there are many trees, and the air is nice. This is just making me feel fresh."
Sophomore,4,"Edmonds Community College has a nice campus as well as a decent variety of classes available. The major flaw of the campus would be the parking, which is often impossible to find between 8 AM and 12 PM. The class availability is fine for most majors but there are little to no classes available for my specific major."
Sophomore,4,"Overall I have had a good experience with this college; I like the selection of classes and majors that are available. All of the professors I have had are knowledgeable and most of them, if not all of them, are industry professionals in their area of teaching. I have not had as positive of an experience with the advising department. I believe that they could improve greatly in making sure the students are supported on the right path to success."
Sophomore,4,"This is an excellent school! Most of the professors are kind and truly caring. They recently put out many resources for mental health which I think is very significant because many students seem to struggle with mental health now a days. There are many international students, so the school seems to lack diversity. The science department needs a lot of work, but I believe they are improving that right now. I learned a lot at this school."
Freshman,4,"It's a very open campus. When the weather gets down, you get rained on. That natural feeling you get. A relief from classes, time to time."
Graduate Student,4,"The college is fantastic overall. If you want to make new friends from different backgrounds, this is the way to go. Everyone is so nice to each other, super polite, that includes the professors, and staffs. You will be overwhelmed by the welcoming atmosphere in EdCC. Most of the prof care about your academic life, even if you needed help in the future, they are willing to guide and support you in every way they can. The college is near to everything: market, mall, skating center, apartment, restaurant, plaza, you name it. I didn't live in dorms, but all of my friends moved out within the first few months spending at dorms, told that it was dirty and stuff, same goes with the housing apartments. There have been many car thief cases and suspicious stranger in dorms reports occur in EdCC recently, tho. I would recommend it to a friend."
Alum,4,I enjoyed my time Edmonds a lot. They have plenty of good resources for their students and is a really great buffer between high school and university.
Freshman,4,"I like that the Edmonds Community College staff is beyond helpful. Let me elaborate. I am a freshman that just graduated from high school trying to figure out everything that I need to get done beforehand before I leave to college. The Edmonds website helped by providing emails and phone numbers to contact the staff for assistance and let me tell you, as many times as I called and emailed them, they were very helpful. They were also very understanding and understood the process I had to go through so they knew why I was so stressed. Thankfully, I was relieved to finally figure everything out and without the constant help from the staff, I don't know what I would do I appreciate them so much for the help and their patience."
Sophomore,4,"This college is good but to have the best experience you have to find some good teachers. Some teachers though are very lazy. My math professor, i had him for 3 quarters was the best and taught me math in such a different way and made me love it. There is also a stem room there and that provides a lot of free help and tons of free snacks!"
Freshman,4,"I've only been a student for a short time but really enjoy my experience here. Very diverse campus, everyone's been really welcoming. School provides a ton of resources. Bathrooms could be slightly less dim and grimy but most of the buildings are several decades old I guess."
Sophomore,4,"Edmonds Community College is a wonderful school for people searching for a place to earn their Associates or Certificate with leisure. There are several online classes, as well as engaging on-campus classes. If I were to change one thing, it would be outside of campus. There are not many places off-campus that are easily accessible by walking."
Niche User,4,"EDCC might be a community college; however almost all of the staff there, from teachers to people at the Services for Students with Dissabilities office, are amazing and make the experience great.  
Also, it is a super diverse campus with people from all over the world. 
It is a good school and I have (and will continue to) encourage my friends to attend.
That said, I do commute/take online classes so I can't say much about what it is like to actually live here."
Freshman,4,"My experience with Edmonds Community College has been okay so far . I love the huge diversity of students and stuff members they have.There are different events and opportunities for students to participate in.They have a very helpful stuff team at their ISS which also employs foreign students, that’s very helpful for the students because they can  interact with more people and also support themselves in college. Each Teacher has his/her own of method of teaching which can be an advantage and disadvantage at the same time depending on the student’s undivided attention.I never liked the fact that there are limited jobs for international students,and also it is very difficult to get a job that’s very discouraging but overall the school is a great place and has good energy around it ."
Freshman,4,Edmonds Community College provides a great experience for those looking to explore different majors and take care of general education requirements. Teachers are great and classes are small
Sophomore,4,"Edmonds Community College is wonderful for non-traditional students, like myself. They are supportive of their LGBTQ+ students, students of color, international students, students with disabilities, students who are supporting a family, and working students. Now that they are offering 4 year degrees, it has gotten even better. I also love their ""self-care days"" that are offered around finals week. Free therapy dogs to pet, massages, snacks, and games for students."
Sophomore,4,"I really like how open minded and inclusive the community is. It feels like everyone gets to start a new chapter in their lives and be a new person. It's so easy to make as many friends as you want and though there are groups, anyone can join and there isn't a lot of drama like in high school. The teachers are also very friendly and care about the students' understanding of what is going on in class. The grading is also usually fair. The only thing I dislike would be the gym, but I know there are plans on renovating it so I can't complain."
Alum,4,What stood out to me about my academic experience at this community college is the cultural diversity. You get to meet people who share your cultural customs and also great opportunities to learn about other cultures by interacting with your classmates.
Freshman,4,"The faculty and staff are pleasant and professional. In every department there is someone that went out of his or her way to make sure that I am taking classes that fit me, and classes that I understand. The people working at this community college really want the student to be comfortable in the environment provided. The scenery on and around campus is rather calming because the school is nestled in the woods a bit. There are creations of art on campus that I can not totally describe, but I appreciate them just the same. No one working there seems too busy to help someone and that is a plus. I actually look forward to school, and I feel that this institution will be beneficial to me. I enjoy learning new things so I feel that this experience will be a big plus as well."
Freshman,4,"I like the amount of preparation I was given. The advisors are very helpful, and the campus is not too big, so its easy to navigate. The bus system is very useful, i use it every day. the teachers know about their subject, and teach it well, and most important is I feel like I could ask my advisor anything comfortably and get my question answered. The class sizes aren't too big, and I feel like I get enough attention so that my grades are good."
Niche User,4,"I attend Edmonds Community College as a part-time Running Start student and my overall experience has been really good. The professors I had so far are really nice and their classes are easy to understand. If you ask the professors for help, they will help any way they can. The school is really diverse and I found many new friends. Hence, it is a really good school and I am planning in attending there full-time once I graduate High School."
Sophomore,4,"Great diversity here, with many international students! Well kept up campus, with plenty of lighting, so it feels safe at night! Parking can be a little tough if you don't come when class lets out and people leave. But once you know the patter, then it is easier!"
Freshman,4,Edmonds Community College is a great community college with a population of over twenty one thousand students with great instructors. After one year of being a student at this college I have not had one complaint with any of my instructors. Communication is excellent here and I recommend students to enroll who are planning on majoring in business.
Sophomore,4,I love the engineering department. I've been taking classes working towards a AS-T and so far the courses and the teachers have been amazing.
Niche User,4,"I liked Edmonds Community College because It was close to home, I had many friends who had attended there before me and they enjoyed their experience.  My professors were easy to work with. They explained to their best ability so that all students would understand."
Sophomore,4,"Well, let's be honest and realistic! Many people expect only the college to offer, but they never think about offering to the college. I'd say: the students are vital in making up a great college life. I've enjoyed attending EdCC because I engaged with it! You'll never see what your school has to offer if you don't explore it yourself. I'm definetly giving a hump up to EdCC because I've learnt in it; I got the opportunity to work part-time and help other students succeed; I've become much open minded due to the amazing diversity; I've enhanced both my social and proffessional life because of the different activities held by our school, and many other postives are still to be mentioned. Again, I've had an amazing journey because I've taken part in it."
Graduate Student,4,Edmonds community college has been one of the best schools. It have many resources for students and feels safe.
Freshman,4,"Edmonds Community College is an amazing school with a lot of things to do in it. They will definitely help you to get into your desired universities, especially for their amazing academic advisors!"
Sophomore,4,"I like this college because they have so much opportunities to build up experiences. For example, I joined a club there called Society of Women Engineers where the Engineer teacher there at EdCC becomes the supervisor and gave us a budget to build something that would help other clubs or the school. I also got a job as a Chemistry & Biology lab assistant and the supervisor allowed me to only work one quarter just for the experience. Also, the professors were very helpful and caring, and definitely shows that they want the student to be successful in their academics. EdCC also provides great classes but the only downfall is they don't provide many classes with different schedules for science classes especially higher level ones."
Alum,4,"I attended Edmonds Community College as a part of the Running Start program when I was in high school. I found that most of the teachers were engaging and challenging, and the materials were interesting. I had a few teachers who struggled to keep up with knowledge of the technology used by the college including the online  class host system, and the projectors in the classrooms, etc. A couple of my teachers were untalented and not good at explaining the material. But most were excellent. It helped me to look up reviews before signing up for classes on ratemyprofessor.com"
Freshman,4,"Most professors really care about what they're teaching and about the success of students. Nice environment with tons of resources, free tutoring, 24/7 technical assistance, and friendly faculty."
Freshman,4,I enjoy my life at EDCC. With great diversity and academics I'm growing as a student. My professors are helpful and great mentors in my education.
College Junior,4,They have tons of class options and time options as well. Some times can be awkward though.
College Junior,4,"I'm transferring to finish my certificate at another school, but was able to get some class finish here too."
College Junior,4,"Lots of class offered both day and night, and has tons of clubs to get to know people."
College Junior,4,Has lots of caring professors and  career options for students.
College Junior,4,"Can lead to great opportunities and jobs, convenient and affordable for students, and can easily lead to a 4 year college."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The credits for the classes that I took, majority of them were transferable to campuses in the Washington state."
Recent Alumnus,4,"EdCC provides the internship and job opportunities. They have Center for Career that helps students to find jobs, improve their resumes and cover letters. Also, EdCC also has many classes, so you could choose with classes that work the best for you."
College Freshman,4,I have never been to the college but I am super exicted to visit over the summer. Its nice it has a beach near the college and tutors that are willing to help you. I really like the idea of having a library and study area. I hope to live a wonderful experience.
College Junior,4,"Edmonds Community College has great programs for students who wish to take courses that match their career goals. For example; that have an excellent Horticultural program here at Edmonds, and taking these particular courses will help keep me prepared for the Holistic Landscape Design course at the university I plan to transfer to. I chose to come back to EdCC instead of another school because of their Horticulture program."
College Senior,4,instuctors are vary helpful and frendly
College Senior,4,Haven't had the full experience yet
College Junior,4,"I am honestly amazed at the 'care' that is demonstrated to students by faculty.

I was very nervous about beginning college at my age, and also only having 2 months of sobriety from heroin when I took on my 1st quarter. I felt welcome and really like I belonged there. My past was not an issue....it was my future that was to be concentrated on.:)"
College Student,4,"I am currently working on obtaining my AA in business and Edmonds Community College. It's very motivating to know what it is you're working towards. Even if I decide to change my major later, I know I will have lots of learning experiences to back it up. Anyone can tell the business professors at my school are very passionate about what they're teaching. They include their personal stories and hardships to help students learn. Personally I have really enjoyed my major and am looking forward to learning as much as I can before I graduate."
College Student,4,"I am currently a Running Start student attending Edmonds Community College. This is my first year at a college and so far I have really enjoyed my experience here. The instructors are very informative and care about each individual. They give everyone the same realistic expectations which I think is very important. In addition to the amazing the instructors, the campus is laid out in a well organized matter. Although sometimes you do have to run to your next course across campus, it's worth it. Most classrooms have large windows and high ceilings making the it feel open and airy. I personally, am only attending EDCC to obtain my AA in business. After that I plan on transferring to a larger university. However, I will miss this college without a doubt. I would recommend attending whether you're going for a 2-year or a 4-year."
College Senior,4,Great instructors and love the program set ups with the Studies of selected course work.
College Junior,4,I'M new but so far its great!
College Junior,4,I love being in college.  The CIS dept. is very good.
College Junior,4,This is just a really fun school to go to. when I take a semester off all I want to do is go to class even though I'm not enrolled
College Junior,4,I really really like this school. The professors are there to help you and the other students are always willing to lend a hand with anything.
College Junior,4,I just started working towards the degree I've decided to go for and I can honestly say that I am so excited. The only classes I have to take the rest of the time I'm at EDCC are math and Chemistry.
College Junior,4,The professors are really nice and there classes are really fun. I wish that the school website would show the dates for class registration.
College Senior,2,Problems in their Financial Aid and Enrollment Services
College Senior,2,"It seems like it is becoming a pattern, especially when it comes to science classes that there will only be one class offered and it conflicts with other classes needed for a science degree."
College Senior,2,"I have had many problems during my time at Edmonds Community College. The cashiers office lost my payment for 3 quarters of tuition so far, and it has gotten to the point where I have to constantly prove I paid my tuition each quarter by sending the cashiers office an email as well as sending it to the office. The prerequisites for classes always change, making it nearly impossible to plan ahead for your schedule. Finally, the school does a terrible job at deicing the ground when it is cold outside, making it unsafe to walk on during the winter. I have to carry around my own salt shaker just to make it into the building when it is icy."
College Senior,2,"The actual aid amount is fine - enough to cover what I need covered. The processing is awful. Although some folks in the financial aid office can be helpful, some are nasty and even seem to go out of the way to trip you up. My award is almost always delayed, which does affect my education (I'm late getting books, etc.). If they need any additional information to approve your aid, they post it in the portal, but it's backdated. So once it shows up in there, it's already past due. Do your best to just have everything in way ahead of time. It'll still be late, but not as late."
College Sophomore,2,Not the best place to try and network. However there are a few notable people on campus.
College Sophomore,2,We have  allot of international student of Asian decent! Not a very diverse campus.
College Sophomore,2,"The college is mainly stem focused as almost all colleges these days, so i feel no love for my art degree."
College Junior,2,The Financial Aid office is one of the worst in the state! They have consistently told me things that were not true and at one point lost my file on the floor!
College Junior,2,Most online courses have a lot more work than regular courses. Therefor it's difficult to plan an appropriate academic load.
College Freshman,2,financial aid wouldnt support me
College Sophomore,2,"Great school for international students. But as a student receiving financial aid, it is extremely difficult to get a hold of the people in charge. Really slow in every paperwork process."
College Sophomore,2,"Edmonds is not much more than a place to take classes. The campus and students both reflect each other in the sense that neither appear to be making a huge attempt to stand out. Aside from the lack of motivation, at times given off by the bare landscape and old lighting, the professors do very well with what they have and give a great effort towards providing students with the help they need within the classroom"
College Sophomore,2,"My schools library has a large selection of computers, so there is almost always one available. But there are too many for their network to handle so internet can be extremely slow at times. Aside from their internet speed, the computers perform very well for offline work, and the only improvement I would suggest otherwise would be the spacing between them, leaving you with zero privacy."
College Sophomore,2,My school looks very old and the parking is terrible
Recent Alumnus,2,Most of the online courses I took at edmonds community college required little or no knowledge and I personally felt like I was wasting money taking them. Taking classes on campus will help you increase your learning dramatically.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The only reason I chose to attend Edmonds Community college was for baseball. I never found their curriculum very difficult, as only a few classes really challenged students."
College Freshman,2,"I am not discouraged at the thought of needing financial aid to complete my education.  While the financial aid I have received has been helpful, the process has been arduous.   The financial aid department has been slow to get slow to fund.  Moreover, financial aid that I was approved for paid for the classes, but did not forward the residual amount to me until a few months later thus making difficult to pay my bills and causing additional unnecessary stress."
College Junior,2,Some classes are only available during certain quarters.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The career service staff are not very experienced, and treat students like a number. But with 21,000 students annually they can still handle the demand very well."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Computer labs are small, and there aren't enough computers in the library to pick up the slack. Unless you intended to study very early in the morning or late into the evening it may prove very difficult to have access to a computer on campus. Well, you could always bring your own...not sure if they have wifi available. I would recommend having your own computer if possible."
Niche User,1,"More of a hands on student; kinesthetic learner, so it is difficult to work through online classes for me - especially science based classes."
College Senior,1,"There is no career center, and the alumni groups at the school are terrible at communicating."
College Senior,1,"There is not a decent alumni network, or employer recuitment at this school."
College Senior,1,My circumstances have been unique when it comes to money for college. My parents are more than capable of assisting me nut refuse to do so. And due to their high income I am not able to obtain financial aid. Leaving me in massive debt while attempting to get a degree to pay for my life.
College Junior,1,Wireless in most areas is by far the worst. There are times where you won't be able to get online.
College Junior,1,I changed my major from exercise science to Fire science to become a fireman. My college does have a fire scince program but its only for students that already have their 2 year degree in the program. I will be  going to Everett community college every tuesday and thursday night starting spring quater for my classes in fire science. So in Edmonds ill be getting my AA here and taking my core classes at this school because I live here and dont have the money to move.
College Senior,1,I chose this school because I felt that it had a good veterans association and the school had a focus on environmentalism. These two factors are most important to me.
College Junior,1,I have gone to a few colleges and every single time it has been simple to receive financial aid. Since i have been at Edmonds i have had problems every single time. When i first started i was not able to attend fall quarter because my financial aid did not go through. But apparently it was on hold and i was able to attend class but they did not inform me. I did not know this and i was charged for the classes i did not take even though i explained the problem they told me i had to pay it. After arguing with them for a month they got the charges cleared and i was able to attend school winter quarter. That put me behind schedule. Then i had to apply for financial aid the next school year. I turned in all my paper work the very first day i could. I waited and waited and I did not see a response. I finally went there to check what was going on after waiting in line for half an hour. They had a huge line with 2 workers. They told me that i was missing some electronic info session i had to go through. I went and did it. It literally took 1 min to do and was useless. After that then i had to turn in more forms and more forms and after the 5th time it finally got processed. They require you do a program requirement sheet and only allow you to take those classes. It is a waste of paper and they require you write out exactly how your going to take your classes for the next year. They just require too much paperwork compared to the other colleges. Some of the staff are nice but they are incompetent. They have no idea what they are talking about and keep giving students different information. They don't mail you things to notify you what is going on. Everything is kind of in limbo. You have to go figure everything out. I would avoid this place as much as possible. HORRIBLE experience.
College Junior,1,"Still Learning My Way Arround – I was ill, so they gave me medical leave and moneys back. I am intending to study next semester. At this time I cannot get into most of the schoo network"
College Senior,1,"Financial-Aid Needs to Get Their Act Together! The only negative I have found at this college is the financial-aid department. It boggles my mind that a college, who employs such top-notch instructors, can allow the slothfulness and error prone practices in the financial aid department. Getting all of the required paperwork into financial aid, months in advance of the deadline, is no guarantee that it will be processed timely or correctly. The first quarter I attended, I was lead to believe the problems were because I was a first time student. I had to go into the office five times to straighten out the information that they failed to input or put in incorrectly. The second quarter was worse. The department did not notify over 500 of us students that there was a governmental change in the processes, nor did they tell us we had to go to a governmental cite and take a new quiz and sign a new electronic agreement for our loans! Fortunately, I caught it by surfing the web, but my check was not released to me until over halfway through the quarter. Many students had to drop that quarter because of not being able to pay tuition and books. This quarter I was to request a re-evaluation of my income, as I am on unemployment (displaced worker) and a full time student. I received notice that financial aid would start taking the paperwork on September 1. Early in the morning on September 1, I went on line to download the form, just to see a message that they were not taking any more of these forms until after the fall quarter was over! No one had been allowed to turn them in prior to this date and it made me wonder if they accepted ANY of these forms. The short of the situation at this college, be prepared to pay out of your own pocket and hope to be re-embursed."

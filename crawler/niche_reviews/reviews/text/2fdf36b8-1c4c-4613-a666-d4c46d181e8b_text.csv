Sophomore,5,"El centro is a very phenomenal campus. First and foremost, let’s talk about the view!! El Centro is located at the heart of Dallas meaning that you have the best view in town. The campus itself is 9 floors and very clean. I love how they manage to keep the whole campus spotless! Aside from that they have very great teachers all around. Everyone is so helpful, welcoming, and kind. The environment is very pleasing. Lastly, there is a lot of police and security surrounding the area keeping all of us safe. Overall, this campus is extremely well maintained and have the best staff ever!!"
Sophomore,5,"I started on Fall 2019 as a freshman at El centro. I was doing in person classes until COVID 19 happened. Everything online has been great. I really enjoy having zoom meetings because although the class is virtual now, the teacher still clarifies and goes into detail with their lectures to avoid confusion! Overall, online classes have not been hard. The teachers are definitely amazing for making this year flow easy with online classes!"
Freshman,5,I like that El Centro has many majors to choose from and they have the best professors that will take the time out of their day to help you. The advisors are the most nicest and helpful people to help you get started on your future.
Freshman,5,My online experience is very good there are no problems with learning online it is pretty easy to learn and navigate through.
Graduate Student,5,Most of my classes was online and the professors did really well to keep up with the classes and the students.
Senior,5,"Online classes for me are not easy, but the professors helped me out in where I was failing and showed me how to visualize even while learning online."
Senior,5,"It’s an amazing diversified college, where everyone is welcome and no discriminations. It’s a fun place to be an I’m so glad I’m getting my Associates with them."
Junior,5,My online learning experience with El Centro College has been excellent. There's hasn't been a problem at all. I turn in my assignments on time and the tutors are very patient and helpful if you have any problems with your assignment.
Niche User,5,"The professors are really patient with their students because many of them understand are situation and know were here to get ahead of the rest, but for any student who is new to this kind of program the professor will  guide you to who you have to speak with to aid you in your case. Also thanks to classes being hosted online learning the course material has never been so easier to comprehend and accessible to access absolutely anywhere. Don't forget that with great tutors available to help you learn the material there's no way you can fail all you have to do is make an arrangement with the tutors the campus provides to speak to them about you issue and create an action plan course of action to receive the assistance you need. Also with systems such as blackboard and econnect checking your classes,applying for financial aid,and signing up for new courses has never been simpler. Not to mention aids you as a student to keep all your information safe and well organized for further usage"
Niche User,5,"I am dual credit student at LG Pinkston high and a student at El Centro College for you see the whole point of being a dual credit student means your still in high school but you take college courses online while following a pathway that by the time you graduate high school you can receive an associates degree. That's my situation at Pinkston high am a senior whom will be graduating from both schools by the spring of 2021 and let me just put it this way my experience at El Centro is and will continue to be awesome because am grateful for the opportunity they let me part take and because this community college cares for its student success and it will actively walk you through any help you need and ensure you have the resources necessary to triumph. Plus the college has many clubs and activities that keep the students entertained while allowing them to explore what their passionate about.  And the campus also has counseling, Care and health services if the student needs the advise."
Freshman,5,Online classes are new to me but teachers make the transition to easy. Video lectures and frequently emailing teachers also help communicate.
Freshman,5,"The advisors are very helpful and the programs are straightforward. Financially the classes are affordable, and now that books are included total tuition is known upfront. I like that they accept scholarships from various sources for students who are not eligible."
Sophomore,5,I took classes online by choice and due to the Covid situation. They have clear instructions and use user-friendly programs.
Sophomore,5,"My experience has been better than expected. They helped me connect and network with opportunities. Because of the school, I was able to attend a national conference in Washington, D.C. I was able to have a leadership role in a known honor society organization. They helped me get a job on campus when I needed it and allowed me to work a schedule around my classes."
Niche User,5,the campus was amazing went to the campus on a college trip to learn about colleges that i wanted to attend the inside was big and clean and well taken care of .
Niche User,5,I found and have heard that the Medicine Program at this school is great. That nurses from hospitals have worked with students from this College and they have been great at what they do.
Junior,5,Is a small campus which makes you feel comfortable but it offers a lot of courses and is cheaper than other schools.
Freshman,5,Very good education. Most professors are helpful and comprehensive. I would most definitely enroll again if i change my mind about my major.
Niche User,5,The reason I am with El Centro is because I am enrolled in the Dull credit program with Pinkston Collegiate Academy. I can honestly say that my experience with El Centro has been great. The professors were really kind and easy to work with. I truly believe that I learned something with being enrolled in this college.
Junior,5,"As a music major, specifically as a future Music Teacher; going to a 4-year institution isn't that necessary. El Centro has provided me with amazing professors that truly find the time and dedication to guide me with courses I need to take for my future. The campus is very comfortable and the food options are endless. The only thing I would change is for there to be more programs like Rising Starr, so students can have all the benefits of knowing what volunteer opportunities and especially have a personal advisor to help with career development."
Sophomore,5,I like the school is located downtown because if we get tire of the campus food we can visit local restaurants. The campus is very diverse which allows us to meet new people that are different from us.
Sophomore,5,My experience on El Centro College is that they offer us a lot of help and they guide us through the rights step.El Centro College offers many academic and has information on what we need to do. The professor are very good at teaching and they help us when we ask for help.
Freshman,5,"Academically I was happy with their knowledge of subject and their way of teaching, I went to an small offsite campus and the only thing I would change are the things being offered as a larger campus would. For example: rally's or transportation, exhibits from art class being displayed. I felt left out. I would also suggest a pop up food store for the students who do not have transportation."
Sophomore,5,I like El Centro major program there nursing program are amazing and the teachers there are really nice and help you accomplish your goals on where you trying to get .
Graduate Student,5,"This school was great. The teachers are very helpful. They had special events routinely. They also helped wit different services like day care, book loans, and tutoring."
Sophomore,5,"Really close to where I live, I enjoy the small campus, and that they have online courses. Admissions representatives are very helpful. Some of the things I wish would change are the availability of people to answer the phones but they are such a popular school a lot of people in the Dallas area and nearby apply here. They stay pretty busy here."
Niche User,5,It was really funa  dndsfjsfsdfhcwshdfchsdbcfhdshbchjsdchbsajdhcasjhdxbxhsbndiyysbcxhdb chsdb cfsdhbcf fcb sdejakcbs hc nza  bnczac bszd cb
Freshman,5,My experience in El Centro College is the best that I ever have in any academic institution. The most things  that I like are the ESOL teachers and the Math teacher Veronica Villa. Something that I would like to change is the elevator system especially in the A building.
Freshman,5,I would recommend going to el centro because it has a wide variety  od opportunities and different ways to relax.
Senior,5,A great place for the advancement of the individual and ideals. A very diverse area of learning. A sense of belonging.
Niche User,5,El Centro College is really easy to get to. Everyone is really nice and always help with directions.
Niche User,5,The nursing program at ElCentro is rated one the best for the cost. It is located in the heart of downtown Dallas. The Dart rail runs right up to the front door making it convenient to leave the car at home.
Sophomore,5,"It has a great atmosphere! Alot of food options ( or coffee if you are a coffee drinker). The teachers are very outgoing and really do care about their students. The student life always go all out on holidays with either decor or little parties. All the students lift each other up if we are depressed, stressed or personal struggles. We all have a part of our community and we definitely give it back our part by going to college and learning new things everyday!"
Junior,5,"El Centro is a diverse campus in the middle of downtown Dallas. The people are great, the staff is better. Everyone is helpful and encouraging."
Freshman,5,My overall experience at El Centro College is great! What I love the most of this college is that it is in downtown Dallas. The staff there is very helpful and kind.
Freshman,5,I Absolutely Love El Centro! Its  a great community college with a wonderful staff! When I came to visit everybody was friendly to me even the campus officers. They helped me around the school. I just love how I didn't Feel Left out or I didn't feel like an outcast. El centro is an wonderful school & I would recommend to everybody!
Graduate Student,5,"El centro college is a community college. It is located in downtown Dallas. I loved my advisor. I was in the rising star program, and my advisor was the best. She instructed me through our my years in college, and also helped me transfer to a university for the Fall 2018. The student life is awesome, it's a diverse college. Everybody is friendly. El centro tried to keep their students involved in their activities. There are a lot of places to have lunch near by. It is more secure , ever since the incident of the fallen police officers. 
They have a lot of help for students who need it. They help you succeed."
Senior,5,"Despite being downtown El Centro is a great College, it's very diverse, the teachers are very intelligent and sympathetic, though they dont baby you they just understand."
Niche User,5,I attend El Centro as a dual credit student studying to receive my Visual Merchandising Certificate. El Centro is located in downtown dallas which is a really nice looking area. Its lots of places to eat off and on campus. They have a nice food court with even better food. Personal I love it. Everything is close.
Sophomore,5,"I like the central location to Dallas, they provide DART passes so it is easier to get to classes instead of finding an expensive parking space."
Senior,5,"This year it will be 3 years being at El Centro College as a student. I have created many memories with friends, professors, and my advisors. There are many advisors that are willing to help students with their future one of the many things I love about this school. Another thing is that there are professors that are inspiring. They take time out of their schedule for any student when they need help also when they need someone to talk to. There many events that students can participate, and the school is safe they are many securities on every entrance of the school. Not just that, but they have alerts posters around the school where you can text, call, and email if you are concern about something that can danger your life or any person in the school. Furthermore, the best thing is that the school is at Down Town Dallas so there many places to go out to eat, and you can walk around. In my opinion I like the way they run the school and how you can meet a lot of people."
Sophomore,5,The teachers that I have had since I've been at El Centro College have been nothing but amazing. They are very understanding and they all want you too pass. Also they are willing to help in any way possible!
Freshman,5,Love how close the school is to where I live. The professors are incredibly helpful. They are able to simplify the most complex theories that are learned during our sessions.
Sophomore,5,I've been having a great experience at this school.Graduate in the near future and take on what I've learned here.
Freshman,5,I have not started to go there but my experience with advisors have been really great and ilook forward to attending here and being really successful in life
Freshman,5,"I really love El Centro mainly due to the fact that the college has a Culinary Arts program which fits perfectly well with what I want to do in life. The only two things I would like to see change is the Campus food because there is only a subway which is kinda on the pricey side. Secondly, I would like to see the financial aid office to be a little quicker on their jobs."
College Senior,5,"The courses offered are great, but they need to remember that most people who are attending have to have a work life balance and most of the people in the program are older."
College Senior,5,Going back to school and being 47 years old has been a great learning opportunity for me. You have all age groups so you can get a perspective from all different generations. Its been a journey and being a single mother it shows my daughter how hard you have to work!
College Junior,5,They are great teachers. I've learned very fast. Very understanding as well.
College Junior,5,They were very helpful and they knew there job very well.Very quick at it to.
College Junior,5,I will have the skills and knowledge I need to become a successful social worker.
College Junior,5,I like it because some of the professor's take extra time out of their day to give a student the extra help that they need.
College Sophomore,5,I attend church so I was offered a weekend class once a week on a sunday afternoon so I was able to attend church and make it to class on time
College Sophomore,5,El Centro has partnerships with the big local hospitals and businesses in downtown Dallas to help students find jobs after they graduate
College Sophomore,5,They have specific offices to help students find jobs on campus or close by. The work may seem like a lot to do but its all split up in weeks so it is easier to handle
College Sophomore,5,Free Dart passes! Student discounts from food to movies to arcades. Very well known for its medical programs.
College Junior,5,Very convenient and easy to manage workloads
College Junior,5,"I have liked all my teachers so far. They give decent amount of work and are strict. The class sizes are great, not too many students. There is a long list of classes that my college offers."
College Senior,5,"This is a great community college to go to. The staff and administrators all have students best intrest at heart. They go above and beyond to make sure you have all the tools you need to be successful in this world today. I particularly associated myself with the STEM CENTER here  because I am a Science major. The STEM center is the best of all places for STEM students to go and get help with your resume , homework,  get a breather before your big test, and make some life time friends. I would also say that Elcentro has many other ways you can become involved and get connected with the school and be prepared for your  next steps; weather, it is a four year university or a full time job. El Centro was great stepping stone for me and if I could go back and do it all over again, I would make a connection with everyone sooner than I did to have a better relationship and contact. So if you are thinking about going to El Centro College,  it would be a great decision."
College Junior,5,"Its more easier to access and also finish up workloads on time in order to concentrate on harder classes, it helps me in that way but cannot say for others. Textbook are provided by the teacher sometimes which is so nice and interaction with teachers are okay. Once you need any help and reach out to them, they would always help out in anyway they can and that's what I like about them."
Graduate Student,4,My overall experience at El Centro was a pretty positive one! Most of the professors was really nice and chill. The learning environment was fun and exciting!
Junior,4,"In 2017, I had an orientation as to know the college. However, I would have liked for an advisor to show me how to register for my classes. At first I didn't know there was clubs such as chess club, math clubs, and other resources. I would ask help but the people ,who were in the halls, were sometimes rude and not very polite if I had a question.  On the other hand, El centro college has improved better because there's more assistants and they will help you if you don't know where to go or what problems are you having."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, my community college  was and still is an amazing experience! All of the professors that I've had throughout my years of being enrolled in the institution were always very professional and helpful when it came to students needs while taking their course. Every professor went above and beyond to make sure I grasped the different subjects that were discussed if I ever at one point lacked any understanding. Not only are the professors very reassuring but all the rest of the staff such as financial aid advisors, counselors and security as well. Currently, I'm enrolled in the downtown location and although, all classes are now  online when I did actually take my classes on campus, I felt very secure and safe 24/7/.  I would definitely recommend this community college to any one especially those who are interested in a career in healthcare or culinary arts."
Sophomore,4,"The online experience with my community college  is actually very simple and rewarding! All my professors always provided a syllabus and calendar for the course to make sure students knew what to expect and to help keep students on track with completing all their work on time. If I ever had a question about the course, I would send an email and less than a few hours, most of my professors would provide a response that answered my question perfectly. Also, due to virus outbreak,  my school provided different tools for students who weren't used to taking classes online to better understand how to operate their courses through blackboard."
Sophomore,4,El Centro College I a good college to start at. The surrounding is really cool if you like the urban feel. The staff is really friendly from security to professors. Everyones there to help each other to become better. The view from the classrooms is so beautiful and really nice to study in. When it comes to students that are around they are all supportive. It like one big family in El Centro. They always have events to help their students and staff. There is never just a day of nothing to do. The library is a great place to study from the bottom floor that has open rooms to study with whiteboards. The second floor full of books and the law is open for everyone. If your not a library person there is plenty of places on campus to study and builds around with being located in downtown Dallas.
Freshman,4,I like the location of the campus. It allows for more opportunities to explore the city and learn. The size of the campus ensures that you can get some fresh air while making your way to your next class.
Junior,4,El centro college is a great college  due to their amazing teacher and staff. The college help me experience college life and it show me how important it is to ask questions. El centro cares about their students
Sophomore,4,"The area around El Centro College is in a fast pace area. The school is located in downtown Dallas. In downtown Dallas, there are many restaurants that students can choose from within walking distance.  El Centro College has great professors. The professors care about teaching their subjects and want their students to understand the subject matter. Some professors are willing to work with students one on one during class. The tutors here have taken the classes and helps them through the problems or any issues you have for your homework. El Centro is a very diverse place with many students, being different backgrounds and different ages."
Niche User,4,It is very affordable and is easy to navigate around the campus. The teachers were also very nice and also they made it easy to understand the materials they were showing us. The students there were also very friendly and you make friends very quickly.
Senior,4,"I like the inclusiveness of El Centro, the school never fails to support and provide the necessary materials to succeed"
Freshman,4,Just started with them but so far everyone from registration to my first professor has been very helpful....especially since this is my 1st year back in classes in 20 yrs!
Sophomore,4,The campus overall is great. It is set up really well and it is really easy to find your way around. The professors are all very helpful in not only academic issues but also personal issues. Every professor that I have had has been very understanding and kind. The lessons that I have learned are not only useful in the classroom but also in the real world. The advisors and other staff are also very helpful and understanding. El centro has great resources that makes things such as transferring very easy. Overall my expirience has been great and I totally recommend it especially if you want to get your basics out the way before transferring.
Niche User,4,"In the year of 2019 I attended to a college tour to El Centro. I got to observe the students while the professors teached. I also learned about their engineering program, El Centro is connected with Texas A&M therefore, the engineering students are A&M Students. However, my over all experience was great."
Freshman,4,"-Classes are flexible
- Professors work around your needs
-classmates are friendly
-the workload is ok
- rigorous classes
Good lectures"
Niche User,4,"El Centro college has been around for years and continues to grow, expanding the campus to different parts of the community while offering online classes. El Centro college offers opportunities for everyone not simply to move on to a 4year college but to have a career."
Niche User,4,I'd like to see a designated area for college students to park. It's difficult having to pay up to $10 a day to park just to go to school.
Freshman,4,This pass spring semester was my first time attending  El Centro and it was a good experience. I loved how hands on the professor were. They were so nice and willing to help you understand and pass their class. Especially if you showed them that how dedicated you were about actually learning and constantly involved in the class discussion/ lesson. Don’t be afraid to ask for help if your struggling with something in class. Most professors are willing to give you some really good advice on how to manage everything in order to succeed. One thing I would say they should have is more food places inside. And faster elevators . 🤣
Sophomore,4,"At El Centro, the atmosphere is very inviting despite being in such a busy part of Dallas. The teachers are very patient and willing to work with students to achieve the best. In addition, when there is time in between classes, you can check out the local scene, some of which give discounts for students. The building is well- protected, which  was an initiative on set by the students who went there. In addition, you can meet people from all races and cultures, and the diversity adds to the experience, providing different and valuable viewpoints. Overall, the school makes you feel welcomed in this big maze of a city."
Sophomore,4,"El Centro Community College is located in downtown Dallas, Tx. Being that this college is in downtown, it provides city life and allows students  to have access to many different places in the area. In regards to student life, it is very diverse."
Niche User,4,I like El Centro College because it is a very diverse college that offers a variety of different courses and classes. This college is very good when it comes to students graduating.
Freshman,4,El Centro is a great college with a lot of diversity. They offer a lot of help and have great events.
Senior,4,"El Centro has been a great school for me, and the rising program is amazing. It is affordable yet still gives you an amazing education."
Sophomore,4,"El Centro has a wonderful diverse student body. The professors care about their students engaging in the subject and are willing to answer questions and even spend time after class solving problems or explaining a topic. El Centro doesn't have free parking, but they do offer free bus passes. They don't have many food options, just a Subway and snacks, but there are plenty of restaurants in the office buildings across the street. There are always officers patrolling the campus, inside and outside, so bicycles are safe on the sidewalk."
Freshman,4,The teachers are very kind and will help you but you gotta look for the help which is is of course responsibility but a great community school.
Freshman,4,WELL MY MOM ACTUALLY WAS A STUDENT AT EL CENTRO COLLEGE AND HAD BEEN GOING THERE TO STUDY ABROAD IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE. SHE TOOK ME WHEN I WAS A LITTL LAD AND I WOULD ALWAYS WALK THROUGH THE HALLS WITH HER TO HER CLASS ROOM AND TO THE FOOD COURTS. I APPLIED THIS YEAR BECAUSE I WANTED TO KEEP THE DREAM GOING AND EVER SINCE IVE ATTENDED EVERYDAY I WALK THROUGH THE HALLS I SEE HER AS A REFLECTION IN THE SCHOOL MIRROR. ITS A PRETTY GOOD SCHOOL TO ATTEND THE PROFESSORS ARE GREAT AND VERY UNDERSTANDING ID DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS SCHOOL TO ANYONE WHO JUST WANTS TO HAVE A GREAT TIME WITH THIER CAREER.
Senior,4,"Although a community college, El Centro College has given me the opportunities I have needed in the last two years, and has prepared me to transfer to bigger and better affairs."
Junior,4,"El Centro is a great academic learning place. So far schooling there, I have seen their sincere interest towards students most importantly. Professors try their very best to help student whenever and however they can. They make you work hard to achieve what you want and that's the best part I love about them. I would really recommend anyone to go to El Centro."
Niche User,4,I loved how the professors allowed me to be in the classroom with my mom while class were in session. I also love how much great food they have to offer.
College Senior,4,Its great! I can do them when my daughter is asleep at night.
College Senior,4,Its great because  it an on line course and its self paced. I can take the course when my daughter is asleep and no distractions!
College Senior,4,The class sized are great! I am very happy with the classes and the overall program.
College Senior,4,"I am an Interior Design Student. I have been in the Contract Furniture Sales world for a great deal of time. I had to step back to take care of my mother who had Alzheimer's. After learning so much about the illness and working so closely with caregivers, assisted living facilities, I decided to go back to school. The program at El Centro is a respected one in the Dallas area. The work load can be over whelming but thats partly due to me being a single mother with a 9 year old."
College Senior,4,Proefessors always were approachable and easy to access
College Senior,4,Great..they prepare you for yur degree and to transfer to a university and be ready
College Senior,4,It is great. I like how the school puts money into the health occupation department
College Senior,4,"Teachers are helpful, alot of resources, and plenty of law enforcement to help you feel safe"
Recent Alumnus,4,It all depends on where you want to transfer to. That helps and talking to advisors to assist you on the process.
Recent Alumnus,4,I would only offer the advice that if you are very detail orientated and responsible to do online courses.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Once again, please become best friend with your advisors. They are there to help you in any way possible. You just need to ask."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Most students are commuters, and the school offers a discounted/free transportation offer to those who qualify, which most do."
Recent Alumnus,4,The school offers many options beyond the transfer one. Most students come to get into the working field with a one year or two year degree.
Recent Alumnus,4,Not a bad starting place to go off to university after the two years of schooling. Become best friends with your advisors!
College Junior,4,Sometimes it could be too many quizzes then test.
College Sophomore,4,They have so many classes it is insane! They have very professional but fun teachers who like to interact with their students. El Centro even offers hybrid classes which are classes that are half online and half in class lecture.
College Freshman,4,"We cook, get voulunteered for alot of different programs."
College Junior,4,"They offer a wide variety of courses, I do mine work online so I don't know about actual class sizes , and most of the professor seem to know a lot about the course I have had a few that didn't know some things or that were very vague with instructions."
College Junior,4,Some of the classes are fun and interesting
College Junior,4,"I haven't been at this college long, but in the STEM program there are a lot of staff members that are there to help. the workload is okay if you don't have a job. And, I know there are internship opportunities out there, I'm just not at that point in my career yet."
College Junior,4,I love my college because there are so many people there to help you. All you have to do is ask. It has such a welcoming environment.
College Junior,4,"My professors at school was great, my speech professor and English. I didn't like my Anatomy and physiology professor because I felt she was kind of a harsh with her grading but I guess shes just doing her job. Asides from that everything else is great."
College Junior,4,"Programs of the school are great , workload is what every student should expect and the curriculum and facilities are nice. I do wish more students would be accepted into more programs such as surgical technology and radiology knowing a lot of students goes to El Centro and that should be put under consideration."
College Junior,4,"El centro has good education and filled with lots of fun around the environment such as avenues to eat, which is important for students because students wake up so early to get to school without breakfast but gets the chance to eat when they get to school because they are places to eat. Free dart passes also helps a lot because students get the chance to ride the train knowing El Centro lacks packing spaces. Pretty much that's what I like about my school."
College Junior,4,Its been a struggle on my behalf trying to do it all but im getting thru it
College Junior,4,I've heard nothing but good things from past students!
College Junior,4,I havent bumped into anyone thats going into my field
College Junior,4,the proffesors communicate with you very well! I love that about them!
College Junior,4,They have my major which was hard to find in any other community college
College Junior,4,"Being a first time college student , everyone helped me get familiar with the school, had helpul resources as well. Very friendly staff. Which is a big plus beacuse it can be scary if you don't know where to go or what to do."
College Sophomore,4,The website breaks down the Diagnostic Medical Sonography very well. I have learned a lot about the program and have been able to form a good opinion about what I like to do for my future.
College Sophomore,4,I like all people here. They are working hard and very friendly!
College Freshman,2,The quality of employers recruiting on campus is pretty bad you  do not see any interaction from employers with any students.
College Senior,2,They do have career night from time to time but it's more like for someone who already has a degree or higher education so it is nothing really that current students can benefit from and there isn't really any networking that we can do.
College Junior,2,Barley anyone who works here except the teachers have a degree. The advisors don't even know what there talking about . For example we have a academic advisor 2  and he as a degree in kinesiology. I'm like no wonder why no one can answer my real questions about college and transferring!
College Senior,2,financial aid office is a joke
College Senior,2,"The majority of students who attend my school are older than me by at least thirty. They are all the same; they think that they know each other and that they are smarter than the teacher. In class they are very disruptive, always socializing with each other and participating in activities on their hand held devices. And then there are the high school students, they are there to get their work done, although they do talk, it is usually about what the teacher is explaining."
College Senior,2,"I have not applied to financial aid, but my cousin who attends to the same school did. The process was long and painful. THe reason is the horrible timing in which the school got the money and bad distribution. That is, i met many people who obtained financial aid but were using it for worthless stuff (that is clothe, phones, expensive food) abnd i find that a big problem in the distribution of financial aid."
College Senior,2,"It is an okay school. The teachers are great if you are lucky. But very rarely is that the case. The school is mostly centered towards job training rather than academics. The philosophy and math departments are just about the only good thing in the school. It lacks a great deal ( compared to other DCCCD schools) in science and computer science. Fantastic school if you want to become a nurse or want to study art and/or fashion. However, art and fashion are not what appeal to me. There is a lot to do downtown so that is another plus. But overall I would say it is okay could be better, could be worse.   "
Recent Alumnus,2,"El Centro does not have state-of-the-art technology, but it can be helpful sometimes. Every now and then a program would malfunction,preventing administrators from logging into their program."
Recent Alumnus,2,"El Centro doesn't have state- of -the-art technology, but it is helpful at times. Every now and then there would be a system crash, once there was a compromised program that prevented administrators from loging into programs."
College Sophomore,2,It is a good school and the class prices are not bad. But if you need to talk to financial aid it takes forever to talk to them. I have waited in line for a whole hour before to just turn in some papers. They usually only have one person at the desk assisting every student that comes in. Sometimes they have two people but its usually one person. If you call the school they never answer the phone it is rare. So if you ever go talk to financial aid office or want to see an adviser make sure you go super early because once it begins getting later more and more students show up and it takes twice as long to get seen.
College Senior,2,"This Ain't a Good Ol Boys Club – El Centro has a lot of things, but pull in the community/business world ain't one of them.  If anything, maybe they'll hire you out of pity or to give that ""community college kid"" a break.  I wouldn't expect to go to El Centro to have a strong alumni network or outstanding job prospects."
College Sophomore,2,"To me, the student body does not seem that diverse. Its located in downtown dallas so I see more african americans than I do other ethnicities."
College Junior,2,"There are definitely clicks.  I'd say overall, the ethnic majority would be African American.  They tend to stick in their clicks, and everyone else tends to stick in theirs.  It's about the same as any other school."
College Sophomore,2,"GI Bill Frustration – I wanted to go to this school for its nursing program. I am using my military benefits to cover the cost of classes. However, because I have not been accepted into the nursing program just yet, my current degree plan is an associates in science, which would then be switched to associates in nursing upon acceptance into the program. This means that I would have to be taking classes as if I was a science major in order for the GI Bill to cover the cost of classes. The VA will only pay for the classes the school approves, which must be from my degree plan. This is actually hindering my education since there are only so many classes I can take that will not be a waste of my time that the GI Bill will cover."
College Junior,2,I have yet to find someone who is very knowledgeable in financial aid. I have had to do everything on my own with rear direction.
College Junior,1,"Tired of Ghetto – people on phone, cussing in halway, agravating, and very tiring"
College Junior,1,"Lots of Unsavory People – There are students that distract teachers, do nt come to class, act like they own this school, you have students who dont follow rules, and dress like they walk the street. if it was not conveint location I would transfer to a different college"
College Sophomore,1,"Not Impessed! Fortunately, I have not had to use FA here at El Centro. I am thins semester and it's been a big run around and you can NEVER get anyone to answer their phone!"

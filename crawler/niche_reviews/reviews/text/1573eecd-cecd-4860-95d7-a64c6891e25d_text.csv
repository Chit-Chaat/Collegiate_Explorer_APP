Sophomore,5,Penn State Mont Alto is a very welcoming and friendly school. They look out for the betterment of their students and try to push them to success. With plenty of activities and opportunities to get involved with on campus. WE ARE!!
Junior,5,"Penn State Mont Alto is a beautiful college nestled in the Appalachian Mountains.  It has a top-notch nursing program and their forestry program is well known through-out colleges.  Being a nontraditional student it is very convenient to commute to, it allows me to make it home in time to spending even with my family.  The teaching staff is wonderful with being available to each student."
Freshman,5,Love the distance to home. The area is great. The campus size is small. Everyone is so so nice and makes you feel welcome always.
College Junior,5,"I feel the support of the program advisors is excellent. The other degree I received, I feel I had very little help from my advisors will finding internships and I don't feel the program set me up for success after graduation. I feel with my current program I will be ready for the work force, especially after I complete my clinical. What I find amazing is my advisor helps place you at a location to complete your clinical."
College Junior,5,All of my classes I have taken thus far I have enjoyed and I feel they all relate to what I will need in the work force. All of my professors have been amazing and they want you to succeed. They are willing to work with you. The class sizes are perfect. I find it a lot easier to learn with the small class sizes.
College Junior,5,This major is great! I feel courses will prepare me.
College Student,5,"When I walk onto the campus at Mont Alto, I see a highly diverse group of individuals. Everyone is accepted at Penn State, and it is easy to see that as soon as you step foot on the grounds. There can't be a description of an average student because every person is unique at Mont Alto."
College Student,5,"Starting at Mont Alto instead of going directly to main campus is going to save me a lot of money. I would definitely recommend the 2 and 2 program that Penn State offers if someone really wants to attend Main Campus. The education is definitely worth the money, as you will learn a lot at Penn State."
College Student,5,"The school guides you through your major, and they have given me a list of required classes and when I should take them, even before I stepped on campus."
College Student,5,"Penn State helps you every step of the way. They guide you through the registration process, and even call and check up if they are missing something from you. The professors are always available if you need them, and the workload isn't too much to handle if you are focused."
College Student,5,Everything is readily available to you and easy to find. The campus is small and it is easy to meet new people. The professors are sure to tell you about upcoming campus activities so you don't miss out!

College Sophomore,5,Very simple and not complicated to understand.
College Freshman,5,"I really do enjoy going to Penn State Mont Alto. The school is a beautiful little campus where the professors are really helpful and wanting you to succeed just as bad as you want to. They are always there for extra help if needed and do the best they can to make you understand. Enrollment was quick and easy just like paying tuition is. If you're looking for a school with a verity of different majors with professors who are there to help, but do not want a big campus life, Mont Alto is the place to go."
College Senior,5,The faculty is willing to help students with all their classes. Good curriculum.
Senior,4,"Small classes, the instructors know your name.  Adult Students aren't as common as at HACC. Since the classes are small, the instructors seem to take a personal investment in your education."

Sophomore,4,Great Penn State location that's close to home.  I like being able to be a Penn State student while still being able to live at home and save money.
Sophomore,4,"Penn State Mont Alto is a very good school. The faculty and staff are very nice and welcoming, ready to help you take on anything that you're having trouble with.  You'll be able to connect with the professors on a higher level then other schools. Mont Alto being as small as it is, it gives you a great opportunity to get to know the campus and make friends. The campus is 75% commuters in case you're a commuter and may need to make a commuter friend to help you get back and forth to school. The campus scenery is amazing, the trees, flowers, birds, etc. There isn't much to do around the premises of the campus if you are without a car, however, faculty and maybe even you will work to help bring fun activities to the campus for free or just a small fee."
College Junior,4,"I haven't used them often, but there is a strong alumni network. Also, there is access to a career network for one year post-graduation."
College Junior,4,I love this campus! Small classes and caring profs.
College Freshman,4,"Its a great atmosphere, but a lot more work."
College Sophomore,4,Walking. Walking. Walking. Your calf's will pump iron everyday on campus! All of the professors I have had have been amazing! They truly do care about their students! I am so glad I chose Penn State Mont Alto. Cannot wait for the next 3 years!!
College Senior,4,"Love the Penn State brand, yet in a small, rural atmosphere.  Most of the professors are wonderful, but there are always a few not so great ones, but that is anywhere."
College Student,4,Penn State students are looked at very highly on when it comes to job applications. Employers know they're getting someone with a good education when they see they have come from Penn State.

College Freshman,4,Most professors are interested and willing to help!
College Freshman,4,Difficult to stay on task if professor isn't available.

College Freshman,4,"As stated before, largest alumni network in the world, many career and job fairs, opportunities for internships, and very student-oriented staff and faculty."
College Freshman,4,"I am taking my first online course this semester and it is not as bad as I had anticipated.  I enjoy being in a classroom setting more, but the online course is convenient."
College Freshman,4,"For such a small campus, there really is a lot of diversity.  There are adult learners, commuters, and world travelers on campus which makes the student body more interesting to engage with."
College Freshman,4,"Penn State has one of the best records in job placement for graduating seniors.  The alumni network is the largest in the world, and there are many job fairs to assist students with obtaining internships and gainful employment in their chosen field before graduation."
College Freshman,4,As a small campus I am not competing with hundreds or thousands of students for a spot in required courses.  Professors are actively involved in preparing me for my anticipated course schedule.

College Freshman,4,For the size of the campus they have great resources.

College Sophomore,4,The faculty on the campus is very friendly and they will always try their best to help you.
College Freshman,4,"Being a French major, I find the main problem with PSU's Mont Alto branch is there aren't enough courses for me to take. There are only the three basic French classes, and if one is above those levels, there isn't much more to learn. I have to transfer to University Park to continue pursuing my major, and that costs much more. However, I still rated it great because the teacher we have so far, who's responsible for all three courses, gave me private work and lessons that have really helped me, for free."
College Freshman,4,"The PSU system has great academics all-around, and Mont Alto is no exception. The professors all care about making sure their students learn, and they enjoy their subjects a lot. The courses are all high-quality and have substantive topics. The only problem is the general lack of courses available to choose from because Mont Alto has room for fewer choices than some of the larger PSU branches and University Park."
College Freshman,4,"Going into the school, I was able to get a semesterly 4,000 scholarship in the basis of my proficiency in French. Though it still leaves some gaps, that's a load off already, and there are many scholarships exclusive to the campus that one can ask about there or find online. Because the campus is rather small, the tuition rates are lower than average."
College Junior,4,I believe the actual main campus of penn state has an amazing network and job prospects but I do not believe this actual branch campus does.
College Senior,4,"I've met many great students and faculty, and have learned so much."
College Senior,4,Great registration process and a good balanced workload.
College Senior,4,Many of the students are very career oriented and are serious about their grades. The faculty is very willing to help students in any way they can to help them succeed in their classes.
College Freshman,4,I can use my laptop anywhere on champus
College Freshman,4,I enjoy all my classes at Penn State
College Senior,4,The only problem that I have had with scheduling is not being able to schedule early enough. I wish registration would open up at 12 noon instead of 12 midnight so I do not have to get up in the middle of the night to make sure I get the classes I want. 
College Senior,4,It is a very hard program not only to get in but to stay in. It really does set you up for very good job opportunities. 
College Senior,4,The professors always seem to want to help you. You can always go to them for help.
College Sophomore,4,I love how the computer is connected to everything
College Sophomore,4,My professor Mrs. Colton was wonderful. The curruculum is okay but little disappointed that PSu didn't acknowledge some of my classes from Mercyhurst College. 
College Sophomore,4,People here have awesome school spirit
College Senior,4,"There is a wide diversity of students at PSMA.  Many of the students are involved in athletics, clubs, THON, and work-study programs.  Most are very accepting if you want to join one of these groups.  Everyone is there with the goal of a degree and students can help each other succeed."
College Junior,2,There is little diversity in regards to the penn state mont alto community. Our town is small and it really reflects on the population of our school.
College Junior,2,"The academic flexibility my schedule has is very poor, but honestly it is understandable for me considering it is a nursing program. There is only one nursing class offered so I have to be willing to adjust my schedule."
College Freshman,2,"Sometimes they have special awareness days, but only for certain groups.  They do not acknowledge some days for a particular group yet they observe others."
College Freshman,2,"The campus is so boring other then that the the teachers are really nice, and its just easy going. They have a lot of clubs that are really fun, the faculty try to make things happen on campus. I made a lot of friends here, since i am coming back next year it might not be that bad. The year is going by real fast, so i don't really like it here because i am a city girl, and it smell like cow poo most of the time."
College Freshman,2,"Penn State has the highest in-state tuition, however I was able to get enough financial aid to cover it so far.  However, having a degree from Penn State means a lot so i suppose it will be worth it to employers"
College Sophomore,2,"The Campus – The campus itself is a very beautiful place, I've had no struggles with my courses.  My only struggle this year is financial aid, which is very crucial for me.  I live in a single-parent household and could use all the scholarships/ grants I can get, but have received none. "
College Sophomore,2,Based Off Campus – network can be slow if you are trying to compile across the network due to the fact that our servers are located at the main campus
College Sophomore,2,Its There but Its Not Really Announced – there is a carreer services department but unless you know its there no one tells you
College Sophomore,2,"Gym Has Seen Better Days – the small lifting room is often packed, the use of one racquet ball room as a cardio room is great, but the use of the second racquet as an ab and streaching room is often never used and no longer leaves any room for what the room was ment to be use for."
College Junior,1,There is limited classes offered in terms of times per subjects. That makes it difficulty to schedule.
College Junior,1,"Although I love that I will soon be done with nursing school, the faculty has not made it enjoyable. Yes, nursing school is hard but it is a very unfriendly learning environment."
College Junior,1,"I hardly get any financial aid and it does put a huge burden on me during school. Penn state offers limited scholarships that you can apply for, I was told this by the financial aid counselor. I usually go online to apply for scholarships."
College Junior,1,"With just over 1000 students, we do not have hardly any activities. Most are nontraditional students so there is little to accommodate to younger students."
College Junior,1,We only had 110 prints a semester free but since a student complained the printing budget was bumped to 150. There are very few places to print from.
College Freshman,1,Teachers did not take the time to explain to those that were struggling.  Classes were constantly being cancelled and students told to do this or that online with no explanation of anything
College Freshman,1,"This is the worst Penn State campus you could ever go to. DO NOT GO HERE. This is a warning. This is a very high school atmosphere and experience. The people who go here are judgmental and drama starters. The dorms are dirty and loud, the people here have no respect for others. If you go here, you will have atleast 50 conversations with several people about how much you hate this campus and the people in it. The classes and professors make up for it. But overall the experience will make you either wanna kill yourself or transfer. "

Sophomore,5,The University of Arkansas has many great aspects to it. It is a very diverse place that allows for personal and educational growth. Most of the professors there are very nice and willing to go the extra mile to help students in need. Some professors have years of experience working in the field they are now teaching which can greatly help. There is also a great energy to the campus as people are always out and about having fun. There are many things you can do on and around campus for fun as well. Overall the University is amazing and I would recommend attending.
Junior,5,"Online is very good because it is self paced yet doesn’t let you fall behind. The professors are also good at teaching. However, it may depend on what class you are taking online that determines if that is a harder avenue."
Sophomore,5,"The number of online classes continues to grow, along with the quality and accessibility. Professors are accessible and helpful."
Sophomore,5,"Wonderful campus! Helpful and accessible professors. The NWA region is beautiful and has so much to offer, in addition to quality education at UARK."
Freshman,5,"Best staff and amazing teachers. They've done a really good job of implementing social distancing in school as well as setting up online classes. 
Unfortunately, they don't apply to the book credit system, so make sure you're able to buy your books. Anything FAFSA doesn't cover will need scholarships or student loans immediately at the start of school. Teachers are often willing to work with you if you can't afford your books though, it's just significantly harder."
Freshman,5,"Technical problems are taken into account. If something happens and you're unable to use your computer that day, use your phone to email your teacher and they'll almost always be back with you within the day, even on weekends."
Senior,5,"I like that the University of Arkansas is a large school, but the campus feels intimate and navigable. In my department, specifically, I have had several teachers more than once for courses, which allows a hefty degree of understanding and relationship building. I also love the historical aspects of my school, including old buildings that have seldom changed since the beginning of the University's existence. This place is my home."
Senior,5,"Since Covid-19 hit, my professors have been quite flexible with online learning. They are understanding when it comes to technical difficulties, as they are on the same level as us.  From Blackboard Collaborate to Zoom, I have encountered few problems with online learning. I also appreciate the fact that the University of Arkansas provides spaces on campus where students can work on their online classes, as this provides a connection to campus, even when many classes are not meeting on campus."
Sophomore,5,"online classes are okay, not the best since it isn't ideal and everyone is learning as we go. summer classes online were easy."
Sophomore,5,"great campus and school environment, dining halls are good sometimes but breakfast is not it.good tailgates."
Sophomore,5,I've just enrolled for classes and so far I'm very pleased with my experience there. The faculty are all super friendly and the campus is beautiful.
Sophomore,5,"I love the atmosphere and just the over all southern vibe of the campus. There is some really great people and the education is just fantastic. However, I would really love to see more lights put onto campus as it is quite dark and scary come night fall."
Junior,5,"I love my school! The campus is absolutely stunning. It is impossible to be in a bad mood when you're on The Hill. I love our UREC facility which includes a gym, sauna, courts, classes, etc. There are so many opportunities to get involved here at the UofA. Sororities, fraternities, clubs, organizations, intramural, etc. Food options include Chick-fil-A, Starbucks, Slim Chickens, Flying Burrito, and much more. Not to mention Dickson street is just up the road from campus! As far as academics goes, my experience so far has been great. Walton College of Business is one of the top Business colleges in the country! My professors have all been accommodating and passionate about educating. Despite the large class sizes, most of my teacher have gone out of their way to make personal connections with their students. The University has done a good job accommodating for online classes during COVID-19. I am confident that the University will safely transition everyone back to in person classes."
Junior,5,"I have taken quite a few class online through the UARK, especially since COVID. My experience with online classes has been wonderful so far. My professors have provided clear due dates and objectives from the start of class. Most professors have given us leniency when it comes to due dates to accommodate different schedules. Typically professors will require tests to be taken through ProctorU or with Respondus Lockdown Browser/web cam. Overall, I would recommend taking online classes through the University of Arkansas."
Freshman,5,"All of their online opportunities are incredible. Everything is super easy to access and the classes are very well organized. Even with a lack of resources due to covid, the Arkansas staff has done an amazing job."
Niche User,5,I do not have any online experience at this University. I have however heard many wonderful things about it from family and friends and how easily accessible it is!
Niche User,5,I frequent the U of A campus several times a year! Such a beautiful campus with so much to offer! Its beauty is definitely breathtaking!
Junior,5,I am excited about the prospects of learning online and continuing my journey in my academic career.
Junior,5,They have been very helpful to me and have exceeded all expectations.  I have had talks with my adviser and we have created a game plan for me.
Sophomore,5,I have taken several online courses and have genuinely enjoyed the experience. A few professors struggled to transition but for the most part it’s been good.
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at the University of Arkansas has been absolutely incredible. This past year I’ve been able to meet new people, join Greek life, and get involved in different clubs and organizations. The campus is incredible and allows for a lot of creativity inspiration and freedom. The opportunities at the University of Arkansas are endless. I am excited to finish the rest of my time in college at the University of Arkansas getting the best education out there. I would highly recommend this college to anyone and everyone who is interested in attending college. I have had the best time of my life growing as a person and individual."
Sophomore,5,"My learning experience at the University of Arkansas has been more extreme than I thought it would be. Even though coming in I knew that the University of Arkansas would provide me with an incredible learning experience, it exceeded my expectations and taught me things that I never thought I needed to learn. My professors were incredible and I am excited to continue my learning experience at the University of Arkansas. The learning environment including my peers, my professors, the learning environment, and the materials that have been used have furthered my education in such a great and positive way that I am excited to take those tools and use them for the rest of my life."
Junior,5,"It is a beautiful city.  It is a university in which the environment plays a big role in mind, and everyone lives in an atmosphere of  both and joy. After that, the UofA has not only several excellent facilities to strive for success but also great housing and athletics complex."

Graduate Student,5,So far everyone at the school has been very helpful and has been quick to respond to any questions or concerns I have. I am scheduled to begin classes in 6 days.
Graduate Student,5,All of my classes are currently online.  The professors and University staff have been very helpful throughout.
Freshman,5,They are very helpful and supportive of their students. They have the best academics and diversity because they support everyone no matter their background.
Junior,5,I love my school! It has charm and the students and faculty are all friendly and resourceful. Very happy with my choice.
Freshman,5,"The college is in a great city with many opportunities for jobs and connections. Large corporations like Walmart, JB Hunt, and Tyson have headquarters here and their presence if felt across campus.

My only complaint is the travel necessary for class. Do not make the same mistake as me and live downhill."
Freshman,5,I love the student life! It is so easy to get involved on campus! Everyone is so nice and encouraging! Definitely an awesome experience!!!
Junior,5,"I absolutely love the University of Arkansas. I am a Texas resident and moved to Fayetteville for college. I find myself not ever wanting to leave Fayetteville for breaks or for summer because I simply love my college so much. The campus is beautiful, especially in the fall. I have met so many new people and am so happy with my life there. Definitely the best college decision I could've made."
Freshman,5,"I feel so free and educated at the University of Arkansas, it can be really stressful at times but there's always someone willing to help you. no one here judges others rudely or out loud instead anyone you just talk to can actually hold a decent conversation. there is no bais, racism, hatred, or discrimination of any kind. the University of Arkansas is a really fun, helpful, and educational college and I would recommend it to everyone in the state of Arkansas."
Freshman,5,UArk is an exceptional state school.  Their professors are strong and interested in getting to know the students.  The greek life is southern in feel and runs throughout the student body.
Graduate Student,5,The university is a fantastic SEC school with great instructors and sports fans.  Football is fantastic and the hiring of Sam Pittman is really turning the program around.  WOOOO PIGGG SUUUIEE
Niche User,5,"As a high school student who’d always have to put a lot of thought into what university I’d like to attend after I graduate, I discovered that the University of Arkansas was the best and most appropriate choice for me because after looking at what the University of Arkansas offers me, I knew that it would allow me to follow my passion and accomplish my goals. When I decided to visit the university, I noticed how everyone there is always so nice and welcoming and that makes me feel at home. 
I haven’t spent enough time in the university to say that I would like to see some changes so for now, I still see in as an amazing place to spend my next four years as an art student!"
Freshman,5,"All of the students, faculty, and staff are extremely kind and helpful. Everyone is encouraging and wants you to succeed."
Freshman,5,"My experience here at the U of A so far has been great. Classes and school has gone off to a fast and interesting start, I am making a lot of new friends, putting myself out there and getting involved, as well as joining the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity here on campus. Overall, very nice people, beautiful campus, and nice weather sometimes."
Niche User,5,"I can't wait to start my Freshmen year at the U of A!  Student body diversity, great Greek Life, fantastic professors."
Freshman,5,The University of Arkansas has opened up so many doors to lining up a career already as a freshman. There are so many opportunities to learn about both things needed for my future career as well as topics that I enjoy!
Sophomore,5,"As a veteran, I’ve been surprised how courteous everyone has been. The Veterans Resource and Info center is great. The campus is pristine, and not too widespread."
Junior,5,"I love going here. There's so many amazing professors and classes, the community here is also great."
Sophomore,5,"I love the University of Arkansas! From the beauty of the Ozarks to the nightlife on Dickson, everything about the U of A is top-notch. I have made lasting memories and friends for life, all while pursuing the career of my dreams. With outstanding academics and a wonderful Greek life. The University of Arkansas has everything to offer. When I'm not too busy studying, I can attend SEC conference football and basketball games, or explore everything the Northwest Arkansas has to offer. UARK is a fantastic place and is helping me make my dreams come true!"
Senior,5,The University of Arkansas offers many things on campus. There are lots of things to get involved with and a lot of places to visit and sight see as well. Great college town.
Niche User,5,I visited the campus multiple times and have sat in classes and lots of my friends go there and have expressed how much they love this school. Also I know people who have transferred into Arkansas and the also love it and can not picture themself anywhere else.
Niche User,5,I absolutely love the atmosphere the students and staff are so friendly. Along with that Fayetteville is a lovely place with a  wonderful atmosphere.
Senior,5,The University of Arkansas is a great place to be. Fayetteville has recently been voted as one of the best places to live in the US. Just be sure you are pursuing a degree where you can actually make money.
Junior,5,Abaolutely Incredible. Attention to detail from faculty and advisors is wonderful. I have been extremely pleased with the University as a whole!
Junior,5,"As a non-traditional student, I have re-enrolled in college to finish after a twenty-five year gap.  The online Human Resource and Workforce Development program at University of Arkansas is incredible.  The professors are helpful and equip students to learn, excel, and succeed."
Niche User,5,"I am currently a High School senior and I have been on the University of Arkansas campus multiple times; from tours, to sports games, to overnight camps, to celebrity talks, etc. I have loved everything I have experienced on the U of A campus; the people, the facilities, the location, and so much more. I enjoyed myself and the atmosphere so much, I have decided to spend my next 4 years at and further my education here. Woo Pig Sooie!!"
Niche User,5,"The University campus is beautiful, there is a lot to do on campus and in Fayetteville and there seems to be a strong community with a lot of fun events throughout the year such as the ""Block St. Party"", Farmers' markets every weekend, and other exciting events. There is a perfect blend of community events and academic opportunities in Fayetteville. The University of Arkansas is close to home. Not only are the dorms well kept, but they also have an app for the laundry machines that will notify you when your load of laundry is finished. Within the dorm halls there are many opportunities to get to meet other students in the building. In Holcombe, which is very close to the Mullins Library and Union, there are cultural and international events that can help students get to know international students and learn more about their  cultures."
Junior,5,"The University of Arkansas is an incredible university. The campus is gorgeous, especially in the fall. Everyone is super friendly and its such a nice environment to live in. Most of the professors want their students to succeed and excel. There is always something to do, whether its something in the union or in the greek theater. I absolutely love this university."
Freshman,5,It's amazing. dsfthf gyjhfshjnk adhghjdg reghagjhkg gka dsfg fdgdfg dfgfd gdfgdfhdfgshfdhgdf hh dhgfhdfghghfghfdshdfsh dfghdfhdfhdfhdfhdfhhsdfgh hdfhdf gyjhfshjnk adhghjdg reghagjhkg gka dsfg fdgdfg dfgfd gdfgdfhdfgshfdhgdf hh dhgfhdfghghfghfdshdfsh dfghdfhdfhdfhdfhdfhhsdfgh hdfhdf
Freshman,5,"I love this university; epecially with the major I'm in. I find professors are very well versed in topics and have great ways of making less interesting topics appealing. The work has to be put in but I've found (at least with all the courses I've taken) that having a strong grade point and understanding of the content is very achievable. The university also prides itself on diversity and events regarding it can be found all the time. There's clubs and organizations for just about everything and if one looks, they will find a place they fit in. If I had to complain about something it would only be specific experiences that applied to me and in the big picture wouldn't represent the school. I really enjoy this university and would highly recommend it to anyone starting secondary education."
Freshman,5,I have only been at the University of Arkansas for a semester and I love it so much. There are so many ways to get involved on campus and meet people. There are a lot of opportunities provided to students to get help with academics and career development.
Sophomore,5,"I LOVE attending the University of Arkansas! The campus is amazing, and there is always something fun to do. I love attending sporting events. As far as professors go every one that I have had has been great. I couldn't have chosen a better school to attend. Go Hogs!"
Freshman,5,"UofA exceeds my expectations for a college campus. There are everyday opportunities on campus for volunteering, donating, contributing to protests, voting, and many more options to exercise your personal ability to help. UofA recognizes the mental, psychological, emotional, physical, spiritual, academic and public health of its students. There are multiple resources for students to help them succeed in all of these areas of their lives. Every day on campus there are guest speakers, free lectures, health education services, and other opportunities to teach not just those on campus but the community of Fayetteville, Arkansas."
Junior,5,"It was a really great campus, but they lack professors that know the material. They dint try to help. I had 2 teachers that were understanding and really helped my throughout the process, but I had a majority of them that could care less about their students."
Junior,5,The location is amazing. The Ozarks are just beautiful and give a nice frame to the green living that is growing in this region.
Niche User,5,"The University of Arkansas is in a beautiful town that has lots of things to do. It's pretty, fun, cultural, and an exciting place to be. Our Football team could get better with our new coach but our Basketball and Soccer teams are great."
Freshman,5,I love going here! The Greek Life here is amazing!! I have made so many friends inside and outside of the classroom. It is amazing how many relationships you can make that will last a life time.
Junior,4,"Overall, the teachers are fairly decent. A few of my professors seem “too smart” to teach. In other words, they aren’t suited as much for teaching compared to others. The great thing about having thess types of teachers, though, is they are readily available and open to questions."
Niche User,4,"While I am not a student there yet, I have grown up at the University of Arkansas. The campus is beautiful, many professors are great, and there are some spectacular research programs. There is a special Honors Program that provides students with study abroad and one-on-one (with a professor) research opportunity. In addition, there are nice student-led programs from cultural associations to diverse music opportunities."
Niche User,4,"Before the pandemic hit and all went wild. I was partaking in a research project. Professors truly care about you, and there are neat research opportunities available to you. While it is a public school and teacher to student ratio is quite big, most professors truly care and provide a lot of help during office hours."
Freshman,4,"I have loved my time at the University of Arkansas so far.  It has been a very different first-year experience during the time of COVID.  My classes are all online, but I have been able to be involved in several leadership groups and to Rush/pledge a fraternity (mostly online of course).  My dorn experience has been great with helpful staff and RAs.  The campus is beautiful, although a little colder than what I was expecting, being from Texas.  Being part of campus life during sporting events and ""calling the hogs"" has been really fun."
Freshman,4,"All of my classes have been online so far, due to COVID.  It has been tough, but I am making it work."
Senior,4,I love all the opportunities to get involved in campus and all of the events. I also love the diversity and support for it. I am hispanic and they have a great multicultural center with amazing resources and events.
Sophomore,4,"The professors are trying extremely hard to help students, and they are providing numerous resources to do so. The professors are also understanding whenever things do not go as planned. I do wish that they would make the classes more interactive and the tests would not be only multiple choice. As an engineering major I do not feel like multiple choice is a good representation of my understanding."
Sophomore,4,"I love the Fayetteville campus, it is extremely gorgeous in the Fall with all the trees turning different colors. I also love the people here. Everyone is open to talk, and you can make so many new friends. I do not, however, like the cost of tuition that the university charges. It is exorbitant and sometimes the quality of education and help one is getting is not reflective on the amount that you pay."
Freshman,4,I'm an incoming Freshman and excited to be on-campus but the communication and tour experience at UofA of the beginning was great!
Sophomore,4,I'm currently enrolled in online courses and so far everything has been going smoothly. Getting in contact with faculty is quick!
Sophomore,4,"The classes that were designed to be online went great.  The professors were well prepared and available to students.  However, during the first few weeks of the lock down whenever classes transferred from being in person to online, many professors had difficulty offering the same level of instruction that they were able to give in their classes."
Senior,4,"I personally am not built for online school, but at the end of my last semester when we had to move online, my professors were all really flexible and it was actually a great experience. I had a few classes that were online-only that I had to take for my degree and those went well! Professors were easily accessible and I still retain information from those classes!"
Senior,4,"I graduated from the U of A in May 2020 with my BS in Human Development and Family Sciences and a minor in Religious Studies. I would not trade this experience for the world! The advantages of getting a degree at the U of A (and arguably anywhere) lie in the ability to form one-on-one relationships with professors. I will be in touch with several of my professors for the rest of my life, I'm sure. Get involved with and attend fine arts performances! U of A choirs and ensembles are incredible AND free to students!"
Junior,4,"Due to the recent pandemic, we were forced to switch to online classes for the rest of the semester following a few weeks after spring break. The online experience wasn't hard, but I can easily see why it doesn't work for some people. Considering the unpredicted circumstances, teachers made the transition as smooth as possible. However, if given the option, I wouldn't choose to continue with online courses. I think I personally learn best in a face-to-face classroom experience."
Freshman,4,"Arkansas is just perfect. The scenery is outstanding, the people are amazing, etc. I could go on but you get the point, everything is better at Arkansas."
Sophomore,4,The Campus is beautiful and the students and faculty are very diverse. All the fun of SEC schools with D1 athletics and Greek life! Many degree programs and grad school options.
Sophomore,4,"I loved the beautiful buildings though I wish that they were not so far apart. It was fun to have a variety of classroom shapes and sizes. i wish that I had gotten a chance to explore all the nooks and crannies a bit better before the transition online. I wish that there were some more places to study that had cozy couches and soft places to sit rather than just another computer lab, and quieter that the lobby of the union."
Sophomore,4,"Most professors tried hard to make the transition to online learning easy and accessible to everyone. Some did better than others, using zoom or other programs as well as recorded lectures. While some professors only posted the powerpoints they used in their classes."
Freshman,4,Very solid school. To make the most of your time you should rush and probably major in business. WPS
Sophomore,4,"Good school, counselors are helpful but sometimes hard to get into classes you need. Not the best teachers but some are ok"
Niche User,4,"Although I don’t go to school there myself, I’ve heard super nice things about the college itself. I live in the same town as the college and it is always super nice to walk around campus, everything building looks very nice and some historical. Many of my friends are going there and hopefully I can one day. So I can join the group and see what does this college have to offer. I’ve ate at the cafeteria there many times super affordable and very very good, there are so many items to pick from. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner is there at all times. They will make sure that you are satisfied with your food."
Alum,4,If you are willing to invest yourself in the community the professors and advisors will be more than happy to invest their time in you.
Freshman,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at the university of Arkansas, there are plenty of event to be involved in that are constantly being advertised.The campus is beautiful and is right in the middle of the ozark mountains. The only thing I would like to see is change in diversity."
Niche User,4,I have really struggled with several other schools admission process but Arkansas was very helpful for me and my sisters. There campus is very pretty and they have great facilities!
Junior,4,It's a beautiful campus in a great area. The campus could be a little more diverse. There's a lot of great businesses and restaurants in walking distance from the campus.
Freshman,4,"The university is very nice and while most of my professors have been great some are not very good at teaching lower level classes and explaining it in ways a beginner would understand. Also, the dorms are way over priced and not as good as they should be for what you have to pay. The dining halls are good most of the time, but during lunch there can be a line out the door just to get in."
Freshman,4,"So big it can be over-whelming and occasionally feel like you're lost in the crowd but a lot of opportunities and resources. Basically a small city within Fayetteville, tons to see and do on campus once you find your friend group"
Sophomore,4,"As someone who grew up just down the road from the university, I am not blown away by the campus or athletic scene since I grew up here. I do still love the university and would highly recommend it to anyone. The town is full of fun things to do and the campus life is incredible. Whether there is an athletic event, church event, or even just going hiking to see Arkansas’ natural beauty there is so much to do around Fayetteville and Northwest Arkansas."
Freshman,4,"The University of Arkansas campus is beautiful, modern, and easy to navigate - especially for a clueless freshman like me. I just completed my first semester of college at the UofA and I love the people, places to go in Fayetteville, and the weather, most of the time. My professors for the most part have been good and know how to teach freshman intro level classes, but some are not as talented in helping freshman transition into college. Word of Advice: ALWAYS find your professors on ratemyprofessor.com !!!"
Sophomore,4,The University of Arkansas is a beautiful campus in a great location with plenty of restaurants and bars. There’s always something to do around campus.
Junior,4,"I have loved my experience at the University of Arkansas thus far! Being a junior, graduation is creeping up faster than hoped. I love the volunteer opportunities and greek life participation on campus."
Niche User,4,"I participate in a Trio Program on campus during the summers, it is for college prep. The campus is inclusive and the staff is always friendly and willing to help!"
Niche User,4,I loved seeing UK. I went on game day and got to see a football game. The students were all so excited and the school spirit was great to see. The campus is amazing and gives a homey feel.
Sophomore,4,"Greek life and the social scene are amazing! Sports are pretty average. Most of the teachers seem like they are over worked but if you check the rating on the teacher before choosing his/her class you can find some amazing professors, especially in the Walton College of Business."
Sophomore,4,"The UofA is sometimes a great school and sometimes it seems to be my enemy even though I'm throwing thousands of dollars at it and going into debt because of it. The transit is a breeze, everything is walk able (as long as you can find routes around the hill) and the professors are fantastic. The communication however has much to be desired. A phone call will lead you to be transferred multiple times (in my case 5), my adviser cancelled my appointment with her, and a meeting with financial aid has a good chance of ending where you began. I wouldn't say it's safe as 3 rapes have been reported in 1 month and that's just the ones that have been reported."
Graduate Student,4,The UofA is a safe University. You can meet people from all over the world. It has great professor and many fun activities to do during each semester
Junior,4,"My experience at the University of Arkansas has been pretty good so far. I have started on my third year and everything has been going great. The professors are willing to help incase you need it, and will not make you feel stupid. The classes can be large but thanks to the drills and labs they can make it easier. The teaching assistants are also pretty helpful when they are needed. The sports team might not always win but they always try their best. Overall my experience in the University of Arkansas has been pretty good."
Junior,4,UARK is an awesome school to go to. Lots of cool people. Most teachers are good with the exception of the bad ones but that is anywhere.
Freshman,4,The campus is really nice and beautiful. The campus is always clean and well put together. The classes are tough and makes you challenge yourself. There's also a lot of different variety of classes.
Sophomore,4,"The faculty are usually really helpful. There are always events going on, but there are issues with communication between some departments and students. Particularly the transit and parking department struggle with updating students on changes and events that could change our normal day."
Freshman,4,"I love the beautiful historic campus. One of my favorite parts is either Old Main or the sidewalk that trails names of alumni for miles. The food and scene is great along with its scenery around. Fayetteville is a perfect college town with many restaurants, activities, and outdoor events. The University of Arkansas also provides great scholarships to out of state students."
Junior,4,"A lot of good spirited energy from the students at tailgates, parties, and ways they're involved with the school. The staff is always do fun stuff to keep up this energy during hard school days with little food tents, fun activities, and more ways to actively involve everyone. Even the residents of Fayetteville who aren't in the school itself, are constantly rooting for the Razorbacks and always very genuine."
Senior,4,"I love being a razorback, I did their R.O.C.K. Camp both as a mentee(Incoming freshman) and as a mentor, I was a mascot on the spirit squad, and have loved my psychology classes."
Freshman,4,"One of the best things about the University of Arkansas is probably how amazing the students are treated. The student life is highly praisable, as it provides for the student's educational, emotional, social, and physical needs in various different ways. For example, If one wants to play a sport, but doesn't want to join the college team or is worried they won't make it, Uark has club sports and intramurals such as soccer, basketball, volleyball, and more. Another thing I really like about Uark is the greek life. The fraternity and sorority houses are beautiful, and the various events hosted by them are full of life, and really bring in people and show them Greek life in a new light, so that people realize it isn't just parties and girls."
Sophomore,4,"The UofA is a great choice for any student. The Honors College is one of the best in the country and they truly care for you and for your future. Living in the dorms your first year can be rough but the RAs go through so much training to help you though it all. Arkansas truly has it all for everyone. Whether you’re there for the academics, sports, parties, social scene, you will find it all at the UofA. I really love being a student here and I brag to just about anyone who will listen. Fayetteville is one of the best places to live in the country and being a UofA alums is one of the best honors there is. It may not be perfect but it is our sooie home."
Sophomore,4,"I was wait listed at my dream school, and the U of A was only my fall back. During my first year, I felt very thankful that I wound up where I am. I have had great experiences so far and am eager for the following years."
Junior,4,"So far, my experience at the university has been really good. AT every school you have your ups and downs but, its up to you to determine the kind of experience you have. The students there are friendly and the staff is nice. I wouldn't have chose any other school. Not to mention how beautiful the campus is. #WOOPIG"
Senior,4,I didn't expect a great school situated in the south. I enjoyed meeting people from all different walks in life. It showed me that the value of education can be found here.
Sophomore,4,"I love the University of Arkansas. Many of the on-campus amenities provide for a great college experience, including the library and the Union."
Niche User,4,"The University of Arkansas is a very nice campus and features a wide range of opportunities and activities for students. The University of Arkansas has affordable school programs and connects with the youth through the use of band, engineering, and other camps. The campus is friendly to locals and open to anyone. It's a worthy investment for the quality."
Sophomore,4,I think the UofA is a great place that balances the academic world with a nice amount of flora for those who love trees and fresh air. The people are friendly and there are always events to go to and free stuff at every corner.
Freshman,4,"Overall, my experience at the University of Arkansas has been very good. I enjoy my classes and the opportunities that the campus provides. However, it is difficult to get a full campus experience if you are not part of Greek Life. My roommate is part of a sorority, however I am not. I have recognized that she has made many new friends and has been part of a lot of extra curricular activities. Besides this, the university has been really good. The resources it provides, such as the diverse amount of classes, recreation/gyms, and the food choices, have benefited me in many ways."
Freshman,4,"I really appreciate how the University of Arkansas actively puts forth effort to assist all students in achieving the goal of graduating. Whether it be academic or economic in nature, the U of A will help."
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love the University of Arkansas! Ever since my first visit to the U of A, I fell in love with the campus and the city of Fayetteville. After being at this university for over a year and a half, I'm still as in love with it as I was when I first stepped foot on campus. Of course no college it perfect, but one of my only complaints with the U of A is parking. There needs to be way more parking on campus and it needs to be better accessible to its students. Despite its flaws, I could not image going to a different university, and I am so glad that I get to call this place my home."
Freshman,4,"It is a very inclusive university and very diverse. What I would like to see changed is the funding for the theatre, art, and music majors, and to some of the dorms; there is not enough currently, and some of the dorms are in need of repair, such as Humphreys Hall."
Sophomore,4,"Great outdoor activities in the area. Supportive environment for students who need assistance. 
Opportunities to excel."
Sophomore,4,"It has been very good experience with University of Arkansas. So many different options of majors and classes. I was transferring  from community college to University of Arkansas, at that time, it was really hard to focus on study. 
When I first attended University of Arkansas, I was a Computer Science major then changed to Biomedical Engineer major. I just did not have the passion for those fields. I decided to give the College of Education a try and found human interaction is my calling. I am a very patient and focused woman. As a special education teacher, I have a direct impact on special education students. Giving them opportunities and resources, they might ever achieve. How will I leave the community and the world in a better place after the University of Arkansas? I will help people to achieve their dreams."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Arkansas is a very beautiful school. There are some of the best professors that you’ll ever meet in your life here. The business school is top notch, but there is so much to take advantage of for every major.  It’s beautiful to see all of the seasons change. I have very few issues with this school. Most of them being with the transportation as I live off campus. It’s also very nice if you live in the surrounding states as you can still receive in-state tuition. The cost is reasonable for a college, but the education you receive is very much priceless."
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus and the administration, nothing to improve that I have noticed. When there is any security issues the university is quick to send out alerts and keep everyone safe and updated."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Arkansas has excellent research programs and some qualified professors.  The campus is very beautiful, especially during the fall when the leaves change."
Senior,2,"I have been doing online learning in the HRWD department, and it has been one of the most aggravating and problematic processes I have been through. The classes are extremely easy since there is zero teaching, just writing of papers. You honestly do not learn much, much less master it. The worst part is trying to contact personnel for help when you are having issues. Feels like you have to jump through hoops just for a little assistance."
Sophomore,2,"Pretty campus, but don’t judge a book by its cover. Some of my profs were decent, others not so much. Poorly run... administrators distant and uncaring. My concerns were not taken seriously nor given any consideration, likely because I voiced them in a personal way rather than a public one. Administration are more concerned with countering bad publicity than addressing fundamental human rights issues. Blatant discrimination is tolerated. Needless to say, I have transferred schools."
Alum,2,"I've been through the university for different programs in psychology, political science, and engineering tracts, and I can say that this school is no good if you're looking for any practical training to get a job. This is a research university, which means the good professors/classes are focused on theoretical knowledge while the terrible professors focus on their research at the detriment of their students. Lots of boring slide-readers and ""nobody passes my class!"" professors here. Good luck having anything credible from academics to put on a resume. Only your extracurricular projects can help you there, which makes me question why anyone seeking practical experience to get a job would pay for classes here. 90% of my coursework has been self-taught from Youtube, Khan Academy, and other online resources."
Graduate Student,2,There is a lot of room for improvement in the graduate school here.  Graduate students get poor stipends and still have to pay fees to the school.  Department heads are anything but transparent and do not often help students.
Junior,2,"The nursing program is extremely small. I had a 3.6 gpa, and I wasn't accepted into the program. There are 800 applicants for only 200 spots. I had to change my major to public health as it was the only major that took that credits that I had. The public health department is a joke. There is no guidance for future careers and it is incredibly difficult to get into classes.  The counselors are apathetic. Greek life rules the campus and if you are not in greek life,  good luck. Many people in greek life look down at those not in greek life. The fraternities are sexist and the sororities are really fake. Both lack diversity.  The campus is pretty and the football games are fun, but if you are looking for down to earth, globally aware, accepting people,  go somewhere else. This campus is extremely conservative. I am vegan, and it is hard to find vegan options or other vegans"
Freshman,2,"I was so excited about going to U of A, but my experience there was horrible. The teachers were great. They worked well with me and reached out to get to know me, but it was the administrative offices that really messed up my opinion on the school. If I would go to the Financial Aid office, they were always rude and acted like they didn't want to help me. Same thing with the Registrar's Office and the Treasurer's Office. You'd think that at a place where you're paying so much money, there would be people working there that have better people skills."
Junior,2,"I only attended the UofA for a semester but I can honestly say I disliked it the entire time I was there. It's outrageously expensive, even if receiving financial aid, you may still be in debt. It is a very good school and a good education, but maybe only for those whose parents make over $50 to $100k a year, which is sadly not the many of us who would like to attend."
College Junior,2,"Dickson street is not worth trying to walk down on Thursday and Friday. With the bars and Greek life active on those nights, it's packed with drunk people and people headed to bars."
College Sophomore,2,"I pay to be taught by a professor, but I get a teacher's assistant instead. Also, some of them are unfair in their treatment of students and how they expect to be treated."
College Junior,2,"I really disliked where I lived because it was the athletic dorm essentially, though no one would come out and say it. The athletes stuck to each other or remained locked away in their rooms. I had no friends in my dorm because of this."
College Junior,2,"I find greek life rather obnoxious. They think they're in charge or super important in every situation. Fortunately, I rarely had to deal with them as I am in the sciences."
College Junior,2,"I gave this one two stars because as of today, our number one event (ROW) of the year got cancelled. DO NOT COME TO ARKANSAS FOR GREEK LIFE. As a result of negative press coverage and a change in campus regulations here at Arkansas, Greek life is dwindling and is about to die at the University of Arkansas. Nearly all of the fraternities are in debt due to unnecessarily strict sanctions from the University. It's sad that this is happening. As previously stated, If one of your top reasons for wanting to attend U of A is Greek Life, don't do it. Go to Ole' Miss or Alabama."
College Junior,2,People are pretty segregated. Greek life is huge and it seems like everyone is involved when in reality they are a minority on campus.
College Freshman,2,"I'm non-greek and they are trashy people, I roomed with 2 of them."
College Freshman,2,Scholarships are not readily available to many students.  There are scholarships available to minority students and students with obscure majors.  Students must go to the financial aid office multiple times and usually write essays and get recommendation letters to be considered for scholarships.  Start looking for scholarships early as there are many hoops to jump through.
College Freshman,2,I'm supposedly overqualified for just everything or I don't fit the specifics. And also the department over my major's focus doesn't have any in-house aid.
College Senior,2,The financial aid advisors are useless and unhelpful. As an international student I face a hassle every year.
College Freshman,2,"I hate the school's financial aid office. It's very poorly run and not very organized given how many people work in that department. I still have an outstanding balance to pay, and I have no idea where I'm going to get that money from."
College Senior,2,Off campus meal plans just aren't a thing.
College Senior,2,Unexpected expectations are sprung upon students.
College Freshman,2,"The out-of-state scholarship is really nice, but you need to double check EVERYTHING. Check to see if you can apply for alumni scholarships early, check scholarships with your college, your major, and the entire campus. Talk to an advisor as soon as you can or the admissions office or you might end up with a headache, applying for scholarships to god-knows-what at ungodly hours of the morning."
College Sophomore,2,"In the winter its terrible.  Forget about transportation when it snows and it snows too much.  

Summer weather is very pleasant"
College Sophomore,2,"This school BOWS before snow. While the senior walk is a pretty addition, it's a perfectly flat, impermeable surface and if it snows, it WILL freeze into a slippery pane of invisible death. With all the hills, the streets are often pretty limited too. Rain can be annoying but nothing affects campus like snow. Serious advice: If you're living on campus, DON'T TRY TO DRIVE IF CAMPUS IS CLOSED. They closed down so that people who live elsewhere won't have to risk their safety trying to get here. But the roads are still gonna be bad each direction. Snow days are basically just campus wide games of bumper cars."
College Sophomore,2,"It's gonna sound like a rant, but it's absolutely unbelievable what the university allows the student body to get away with. I'm not against having fun, but at times it seems the university actively promotes underage consumption. Just this week, there was an ASG mention of a student tailgate lot. In addition, the frats/sororities are nothing but gateways to booze. I wouldn't say there's a lot of peer pressure outside Greek life but there's practically zero enforcement (other drugs included). On more than one occasion, I've walked down residential halls that smell like something out of a Snoop Dogg (/Lion) concert. I'm guessing that, like myself, most of the students don't really care, but I don't think that excuses the university's flagrant dismissal of the amount of drugs on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Short of bugs and mold, I can't really imagine a scenario in which I could be more frustrated with U of A housing. Sometimes it's just fine! Air conditioner does its thing, internet works, etc. But this week alone we've lost hot water for almost a full day, our internet has gone out twice for a combined total of around 24 hours, and the AC has failed to register the cooler weather and blasts an already 60* room with cooled air. It wouldn't even be that big of deal if housing were there to fix it/at least HEAR the complaints. Their offices are closed during the weekend so cross your fingers and start hoping that it'll all go wrong during the week instead."
College Sophomore,2,I didn't get into my program when I wanted too because I failed one section of the Praxis Exam by one point and got stuck waiting a whole year. I wish they could have the application process set up for every six months instead of having to wait a whole year so that you could at least get some of your required courses out of the way.
College Freshman,2,"Non Greeks hate Greeks, constant rivalry. Greek life rules the campus. Guys are often cocky and rude. houses are gorgeous for the most part"
College Freshman,2,"When it's raining, It makes the 15 minute walk from the dorms(maple hill area) to classes a real pain, but other than that it's not too unbearable."
College Junior,2,I could never seem to get a straight answer from anyone and it took five different trip talking to five different people to figure out my financial aid.
College Sophomore,2,Getting scholarships at the U of A is hard. I'm not an athlete which doesn't help my situation. Almost every athlete has some type of scholarship from the U of A. Getting any kind of academic scholarship without having above a 30 on the ACT is unheard of. Even if you do have a 30 or above (which I do not) is hard.
College Junior,2,"Diversity is great, but there is too big of divide."
College Freshman,2,"The athletes and different sports teams get just about everything they need or want. Instead of building more parking spots for students, or making it easier for students to park on campus, the athletic department builds yet another unnecessary training facility. Every sports game (football and basketball) we have to move our cars or we get towed. Sometimes we forget and as broke college students, $50 tickets take a lot out of our pockets. We either buy the cheap permit and make up for the cost in parking tickets or we buy the resident reserved permits that are very expensive."
College Freshman,2,"I hate how cold it is most of the time and the wind is awful. During winter/early spring, we would have occasional days where the temperature was nice. But on those days, it was extremely windy. I do not like the weather of the mountains."
College Sophomore,2,Recovering from Bobby Petrino scandal/embarrassment
College Junior,2,I personally don't feel safe walking by myself at night
College Freshman,2,Winters are cold and we have had lots of snow and ice.
College Freshman,2,My dorm doesn't have wifi dorm wide
College Freshman,2,Most all parties have underage drinking and drug use happening.
College Freshman,2,"When trying to choose your schedule for  new semester, there is never any open classes. We need way more classes and teachers."
College Sophomore,2,"It's in Arkansas, so just be patient with the weather. When it's cold it's reallllly cold and when it's hot it's very hot. But campus is beautiful regardless of the weather!"
College Sophomore,2,Lots of people do them. Hard to enforce
College Junior,2,Terrible connection to Wifi throughout campus
College Freshman,2,"For non-Greeks, the scene is overwhelming, but for Greeks it's impressive."
College Sophomore,2,"If there is ice on the ground, everything closes. Usually at least a week per year. But no worries, the dorm is the best place to be in that case."
College Freshman,2,"Its extremely cold during winters, snow and ice is all but certain. During the summers, it is of course very hot. Its bearable in my opinion, but it also unpleasant."
College Freshman,2,"There are very strict rules on whether or not you can have a wireless router in your room, and only a few of the dorms have wireless. The ethernet cuts out and will not always let you connect. The tech support takes 3+ days to get to your problem. While you do not need a personal printer, i would recommend it because it makes life much easier. I would also suggest having your own computer because teachers will post last minute updates/assignments that you need to do."
College Freshman,2,Permit costs are outrageous. $85 for a student pass which can get you various places on campus but usually a mile or two away from the main part of campus. The resident reserved parking is $500 and is fairly close to the dorm that you are staying in but spots can still be hard to find that are actually near it. Garage parking is more than $500.
College Junior,2,Parking costs are outrageous and sometimes you can't even find a spot. Ticketing is strict and not enough notice before ball games and can get towed.
College Freshman,2,"This campus isn't diverse at all...this coming from a minority. I feel like there is a lot of segregation among different ethnic group, not saying that it is racist but as a minority, I can't say that you feel ""welcome"" up here "
College Freshman,2,Finding a good parking spot is close to impossible unless you're prepared to pay hefty fees.
College Freshman,2,I'm not the party type. I focus on school and getting a good job and having a good life with a family. Academics is my priority. 
College Freshman,2,I'm not the party type. I focus on school and getting a good job and having a good life with a family. Academics is my priority. 
College Sophomore,2,"Parking kind of sucks. Resident parking is extremely expensive. To park in the parking garage it is 1.50 an hour ( it racks up trust me) and if you don't live on campus, parking seems to fill up very quickly. "
College Sophomore,2,I have had no advise on how to find off-campus housing and have not seen any advertising for it. 
College Freshman,2,"I have applied to many scholarships, but none of them ever give me a response."
College Sophomore,2,This is one area I wish the school would improve on. Yes there are a lot of parking lots but they aren't always in the best locations. The parking and transit employees have no problem writing tickets either. 
College Sophomore,2,"There is an airport about 30-45 min from campus but very expensive. The next airport is 3 hours away, so very inconvenient."
College Freshman,2,Greek life is really the ones that show the alcohol. Kids do drugs but it's not overly used and you never see it unless sometimes you're at a fraternity party. 
College Freshman,2,"Parking here really does suck. But because of how close everything is on campus, you don't always need a car. Just don't be lazy to ride your bike or to walk."
Recent Alumnus,2,Parking is very strict. Parking permits increases each year and garage parking fees are ridiculous. Meter parking is also beyond expensive and parking has become difficult to find now that there is an increase in student body.
Junior,1,"With Covid-19, I was forced into all remote classes for this semester. I have always hated online classes and prefer to work with pencil and paper at a school desk. There is less distraction. After 20 years, I know myself and I know that I cannot and will not do well when forced to listen to people online on topics I don't find engaging. There should have been an option by the campus to take a semester off without dropping out, or have some online classes, or anything really. There was not any of that. They just gave us the finger and sent us online. This is not optimal for a subject such as calculus, which I struggle with. Of course I want to learn, but I simply don't care anymore. I have no engagement with digital classes and am actively put off by it."
Senior,1,"My classes online were extremely easy considering we mostly wrote papers. There was never any actual teaching from any professor, and no learning.  I would never recommend online learning from U of A to anyone. Better off going to a CC for an education."
Sophomore,1,"In class courses finished on line. Was lacking in substance,  professor involvement and instruction. Do not recommend."
Niche User,1,"I only came here for a semester because it looks good online but don’t be fooled this place is not all that it seems to be. it is gorgeous sure, the food is fine, they make it look great, but it’s not. worst semester of my LIFE I do not recommend this place"
Freshman,1,The class were backwards and drills were not able the subject or based off anything learned in class.
College Senior,1,Football comes above all student's needs. A new massage facility will be built in the center of campus with the rest of students having to park 30 minutes away and get the bus. The HPER facility for all student's fitness needs is old and dilapidated but the football facilities will be updated yearly.
College Senior,1,"People go on accasional drinking, but nothing else."
College Sophomore,1,Could be more forthcoming with money and have more options
College Senior,1,I haven't had to much luck to this point. I did receive one scholarship two years ago for two semesters.
College Senior,1,Cars are literally parked on top of each other.
College Junior,1,Never know what's going to happen!
College Junior,1,"Because I'm not a minority, I can't receive any scholarships. I need funding and it isn't offered to me. I hate it."
College Freshman,1,Big Brother is always watching
College Senior,1,ifthere is inclement weather i cant attend class because i cant drive my wheelchair on snow or ice.
College Freshman,1,Living in a dorm has literally been the worst experience of my life.
College Freshman,1,it is the worst. it can change from shorts and a t shirt to putting on 3 layers in 12 hours
College Freshman,1,"there are enough parking spots for about half of the students who attend here and if you are lucky enough to get a spot, you have to move it once a week for some sporting event"
College Freshman,1,I haven't heard of anybody getting in trouble this year.
College Freshman,1,The university is very greedy with their money even though they have a ton of it. 
College Freshman,1,"It is terrible because it is expensive, even for an Arkansas resident. "
College Freshman,1,"Drugs are EVERYWHERE up here. Almost anybody you ask has something. If people are not getting high, they are belligerent drunk and it is very easy for underage students to access alcohol.If you have a strong self-discipline then you will be alright, but if your weak minded, you may be on cocaine by the time you get out of here...fair warning...i dont know how we get away with it either because UAPD is extremely strict and they are everywhere...lurking"
College Sophomore,1,There are international students that tend to keep to themselves.  Most students go to christian events regularly.  Greek life seems to be primarily well off white kids.   
College Sophomore,1,The parking permits are rising each year. There is hardly any available spots to park. The fines are extremely expensive. Out of everything that is wrong with the university this is the number one problem. I get multiple tickets a semester and just because i parked in the wrong spot when the sign clearly states that it is a student lot.
College Sophomore,1,"The process with financial aid is getting easier,  but only because this is my fourth time filling it out. I seem to get less aid every year and it is frustrating."
College Senior,1,"Most of the dorms are old and crappy. Restrooms are disgusting, housing is way too expensive. It's cheaper just to live off of campus and eat meals at home."
College Freshman,1,"Absolute nightmare. I don't even have my car here but if you aren't willing to pay the $500 for the parking garage or resident reserved, good luck. Students constantly have to move their cars on weekends whenever there is some event. If you are even one minute late, you get a ticket, or your car is towed."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is crazy due to the number of students. If you get a garage pass you're fine, but if you don't then it is difficult to find a spot to park."
College Senior,1,The majority of the parking is out by the sports facilities as far away from classes as one can get while still being on school grounds.  The costs are reasonable $85 for one year of student parking.  There are higher and lower cost options available too.  Resident students can avoid a vehicle since the halls are actually closer than the parking lots.
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is a nightmare. I had to leave my apartment that was 1 mile from campus at least 20 minutes early if I planned on parking near campus. The machines that take your money sometimes decide not to work, so that makes you late as well. The pit where everyone parks is a nightmare. It's way too small and they make you leave every weekend for games, which is annoying."
College Junior,1,Parking is awful unless you are rich then you can park in the parking garages. If you live on campus parking is a bit better but if you live off campus you have to park at least a mile away. There are buses that come pretty frequently but they need more due to the increasing population every year. If want to walk to class you have to walk a mile uphill and upstairs.
College Student,1,Parking is horrible. The people are absolute terrible!
Recent Alumnus,1,Some buildings are nice... some. Most are in sad need of renovation.
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is a compete nightmare. It is very hard to find a parking spot in the ""green lots"" that are usually available to students if you buy the ""green parking pass."" After you find a spot to park you usually have to take one of the Razorback Transit buses to the Union station to get closer to where classes are actually held."
College Freshman,1,"Drugs are everywhere, lots of dealers, wide variety. The demand is high, the supply is high, the buyers are practically everyone. Weed, ecstasy, acid, a huge variety of prescription drugs including vy-vance, adderol, hydro, practically anything. People smoke weed all the time, in the dorms, around campus, everywhere. It's normal for everyone."
College Junior,1,ride the bus! don't drive. it cost too much to park on campus. LIVE WITHIN THE BUS ROUTES OR WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE TO ONE!
College Junior,1,"They keep building new buildings in the parking lots without really replacing them, but that doesn't stop the school from selling more passes than there are spots. Finding off campus parking is a big hassle, so if you live off campus live on one of the bus routes as the bus system is excellent."
College Junior,1,Parking on campus is almost non existent. Make sure to get to campus at atleast 7 AM if you want to park your vehicle.
College Sophomore,1,The parking here is awful. Parking passes are extremely over priced and they hand out parking tickets constantly. There are barely any places to park without a parking pass.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is really difficult to find or expensive. They give out tickets very frequently and there is almost no free parking. Walking to class is your best bet, or buying a parking garage pass if you live off campus."
College Junior,1,The parking is ridiculous!! They told out all the free parking so now most people have to pay like 500 dollars to park in the garages which is stupid because most college students do not have that much money!! Plus even when you pay to park in the garages you can barely find a parking space.
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is awful, if you want to park and get to class, you better get there at least 30 minutes before your class. It takes a long time to walk to class from the only open parking spots."
College Senior,1,"The parking at the university is horrible, especially now with all the construction going on. The student parking lot is downhill from the campus, but there are buses that run to take students uphill. You have to move your car by a certain time before the big games on Saturdays. The prices for a permit to park in either of the garages are outrageous! This is my biggest headache with the school."
College Junior,1,There is never anywhere to park.  It is sometimes hard to find a spot in the big parking lot where you have to ride a bus to get to the union station (LOT 56).  They let the freshmen park in the pit and all the close parking spaces.  These students usually never even move their car.  It is VERY rare you get a parking space where you don't have to ride a bus to get even near campus.  It's not fair that the freshmen (or people who live on campus) get to park their cars close when we have a huge lot by the baseball stadium that could fit all these people.  Freshmen should not be allowed to even have their car on campus or they should have to have a designated spot.  The parking is probably one of the most annoying things about the U of A.  But it would be so easy to illegitimate this problem.  I'm hoping they fix it soon!
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus... You might as well just sin over your soul if you do not have a parking pass. They're expensive to begin with but they will save you heart ache. If you do not have a parking pass just park off-campus and stay there. And if at all possible, just do not use your car, try biking or walking!"
College Freshman,1,"SUCKS but Not Really Needed. Because of all the on campus transportation most people don't drive. Parking is awful but right now U of A is in the process of making more parking lots for students. Thankfully everything is in walking distance or you can catch the bus for free, so even bringing your car to campus isn't a hassle or a necessity."
College Sophomore,1,"It's Part of Everyday Life – Frat life is a big part of our university, so drinking happens every single day. A lot of people smoke marijuana now too. Both of those plus Adderal and other stimulants are readily available for sale and not hard to find."
College Junior,1,"I'm from another state known for its major metropolitan cities. If you're a person like me, you may not be comfortable with the areas and building styles of the apartments. Alot of apartments are nice but situated in sketchy areas. Alot of houses situated in the first mile of the university...the houses look as if they never passed inspection. I'm living on or across the street from campus until I graduate"
College Freshman,1,"I received a small amount of financial aid, but I had to pull out two loans to pay for my school."
College Freshman,1,"Parking space is very limited and a permit for a student with a car, living on campus, is $500! It's a nightmare!"
College Sophomore,1,"Deep South – There is very little diversity. Your run-of-the-mill student is a white, financially stable conservative Christian, but there are organizational opportunities for diverse groups of students."
College Freshman,1,"IT SUCKS – My roommate complains so much that, even though I don't have a car on campus I already despise it entirely. Having to leave campus by car is ridiculous unless you want to walk a thousand miles or pay $500 for a permit at a place that is covered, granted, but far away as well."
College Freshman,1,"There is very little parking unless you would like to pay a very high price for decent parking, although if you don't live in campus housing it's all pretty terrible. Don't expect to pay less than $60 for a parking permit. Don't even think about trying to park without one because there are tons of parking police that patrol the lots. It's better to try to learn bus schedules."
College Freshman,1,"Dorms and Parking on Campus – One of the downsides to the University of Arkansas is it's lack of housing for students and parking because of such a massive increase in admissions the last few years. It is required that all freshmen live on campus their first year. Unfortunately they do not have the space available to house that many people. Upperclassmen are out of luck when it comes to living on campus and instead have to look for apartments or other housing in the surrounding area. 
This also poses a problem because there is very limited parking available on campus. If you do not pay the $450 for a resident reserved parking pass you are subject to moving your car off campus regularly for athletic games. 
Over all these factors pose a real inconvenience to the over all college experience."
College Freshman,1,parking on campus is so difficult and there are really no good places to park if you are trying to get close to your dorm.
College Sophomore,1,"Way Expensive – I would not personally buy a meal plan. They are way overpriced and I can save money by going to the local grocery and finding good deals there. I have not tried the food on campus so I cannot say whether it is good or bad, I only know that the pricing is outrageous!"
College Junior,1,Parking is crazy at the U of A. Student parking passes are $70 and if you park there you have to wait for a bus to take you to campus. Resident parking passes are close to $400 a year and the parking garage is $13 a day or $700 a year. Even if you pay $400 a year for resident parking you can't be guaranteed a paring spot and the university is always quick to hand out tickets.
College Junior,1,Greek Overrule – Greek life is a huge park of the U of A. I have never really enjoyed that part of the campus. I find the Greek students unfriendly and snobs. They party all the time. The U of A is known for having lots of Greek housing and making sure the Greek students needs are met.
College Junior,1,Parking at the institution is not that affordable and it is very restricted. yes there are parking garages but its a distance from where your destination is.
College Freshman,1,"NO SPOTS! Parking is awful. A student must purchase a $50 permit, and that never secures a parking spot. You will find yourself walking 20 minutes from your parking spot to your destination, or have to ride a bus to get there."
College Freshman,1,"To get a regular parking pass it costs $75, there is almost always somewhere to park, but that spot may be nearly a mile from campus. Parking basically sucks.

You can buy a pass to a parking garage for around $600-900, there is always a spot in there, but that price is insane.

There is a thing called resident reserved. It costs around $700 and must sign up early to get a spot. This spot will be guaranteed and next to/behind/in front of your dorm."

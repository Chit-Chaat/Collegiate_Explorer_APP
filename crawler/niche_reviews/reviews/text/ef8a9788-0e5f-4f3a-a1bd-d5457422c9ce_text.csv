Senior,5,I prefer taking my classes online because I feel that I do much better. I take more time studying and professors are very nice about the work because of the pandemic. There are there for us more and are doing a great job handling the online courses.
Senior,5,"What I liked about UMBC was that there's a lot of different cultures present and/or to engage with. I love how small it is, too, it helps to get that sometimes needed one-on-one time with professors."
Senior,5,"I took some classes online. My last semester is completely online because of COVID 19. Overall, though, they've done very well with communicating and ensuring we get our education."

Sophomore,5,"I shockingly had even more learning resources offered to me through the online learning experience than when classes were in-person. The school and its professors had a great transition, despite the difficulties."
Junior,5,It is a medium-sized campus that creates a sense of familiarity right away. The students and professors are all welcoming.
Junior,5,"I actually have not had an online class yet, so I don't have anything to review. So far all of the college online formats have been relatively easy to use."

Senior,5,Online classes at my college has been challenging but fun at the same time. Professor are learning how to really help the student get the best academic experience and my school has been really open to student's point of view on how well the online transition is going.
Junior,5,"UMBC so far has been an excellent learning experience for me. The faculty is incredibly helpful and always willing to point you in the right direction, as well as having an entire space dedicated to career success once you graduate college, or if you're trying to look for an internship during the summer. The quality of education is astounding, and you will have multiple sources to go to if you ever get stuck on anything. All the professors have office hours outside of class as well!"
Sophomore,5,My online learning experience at UMBC was smooth. The professors really prepared us in what to expect and how much time each assignment would take. They were also very accommodating I you had any technical issues along the way.
Sophomore,5,"UMBC is an excellent university, staffed with amazing professors who care about their students and their knowledge about the subject and the world around them. UMBC is a small campus and I have not met anyone who is unfriendly or not willing to help you if you need it. The campus is filled with students and faculty who come from different backgrounds. Dorms are pretty basic but they are nice, clean and easy to decorate to your taste."
Freshman,5,"I have not studied online at UMBC. However, the professors on-campus are very friendly, helpful, and genuinely want the best for their students. I am very appreciative of them."
Freshman,5,"I love UMBC's diverse, lively, and welcoming community. I believe that there is something for everyone. As an African American Muslim woman, I find it difficult to fit in at times. Therefore, I am very glad that I was given the opportunity to attend UMBC, as it really is the place for me."
Alum,5,"Loved my time at UMBC, as a biology major, I had so many opportunities for research, teaching, and community service work. Highly recommend this school for anyone interested in going into the medical industry as a profession, from healthcare specialists like doctors to biomedical engineering. A lot of student empowerment by many opportunities to be a student researcher, student teaching assistant/learning assistant!!"
Freshman,5,Overall I fell in love with UMBC its all a big family and everyone is out to help everyone. The professors are also great at helping everyone be great.
Junior,5,"Supportive and Understanding of its students. I came here as a transfer student, have had a pretty good experience thus far."
Junior,5,I love the environment. It is a very upbeat school with many organizations and clubs for great student life. I was always sheltered in high school and UMBC allowed me to break out of my shell.
Freshman,5,"As a freshman at UMBC, I truly found an environment that allowed me to thrive academically and grow as a person. The faculty truly care about their students' success and the school in general provides various resources to do so."
Senior,5,"I loved my experience at University of Maryland - Baltimore County. It is a very diverse campus that is just the right size. You see people you know when you walk through Academic Row, but you still feel like you are getting the full college experience. I got an exceptional education at one of the best schools in the nation and for that I feel incredibly lucky."
Junior,5,"The campus community feels very safe. The campus police are easily approachable for help, and the professors work with students as best they can to help them succeed"
Niche User,5,I love UMBC. The campus is a good size and cozy. The clubs and social networking opportunities are amazing. The living spaces and resources are also very good. I would recommend UMBC to anyone who wants a perfect sized college with amazing academics and social events.
Niche User,5,The University  of Maryland Baltimore County is by far one of the best schools in the United States. University of Maryland Baltimore County cares greatly about success of students in their future career paths.
Freshman,5,"Despite being a freshman,UMBC has already shown me what an amazing institution it is. At first, I thought that there would’ve been no difference between UMBC and High School but I’m glad to say I was proven wrong after being exposed to helpful and caring staff, varying and equally loved communities, and thoughtful curriculums."
Sophomore,5,"Though it is a small campus, UMBC creates an environment for students to be focused on their academics. The professors I have had thus far have been great! They are all approachable and truly want the students to succeed. I enjoy what the college has to offer."
Niche User,5,"In March 2019, I went on a tour of University of Maryland - Baltimore County. I instantly fell in love with the campus. As we were walking around the campus, the sight of the students caught my eye. All of them seemed happy, no one was sad. This truly persuaded me to apply to the university. After the tour, I was able to meet some of the professors of the college. I talked to the Computer Science professor and learned that UMBC has one of the best Computer Science programs in Maryland. Another thing that makes me want to go to UMBC is the location. It is only a short drive from my house."
Niche User,5,"I have just toured the college. It was a very welcoming environment, easy to navigate, and people were serious about their academics. Not an ivy league, but just as good!"
Junior,5,"I used to attend Salisbury University. My major is Computer and since they did not have a good program there for my major, I transferred to the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). After transferring,  I immediately could tell that UMBC is where I belonged for my Bachelor's degree. I found many other students with the same interests as me and started to make friends. It is a friendly campus where you can always find new people with the same interests and hobbies. There are a lot of spots to study, do some collaboration, and make your ideas a reality."
Sophomore,5,"After one year, I love University of Maryland, Baltimore County. It was a little difficult for me to adjust at the beginning of the first semester, however, after the beginning of the second semester, I loved the campus environment and sense of community. I have had a great experience with most of my professors and have enjoyed going to class. The food was average, but there are some changes coming. Overall, I would recommend the school to others!"
Junior,5,UMBC  is a wonderful institution which consists of a friendly community and the professor go above and beyond to ensue that their students can reach their maximum potential.
Sophomore,5,"UMBC has a very nice and perfect size campus, it's not too big where you feel like you are a tiny person in a big world and it's not too small. The campus has plenty of nature which gives me a fresh breath of fresh air every time I arrive there. The teachers and staff are always nice. You always feel safe on campus."
Sophomore,5,"When I was a senior in high school, all of my friends tried to discourage me from going to UMBC. Despite all of their discouragement and negativity, I decided to commit and it was one of the best decisions of my life. Not only does UMBC have a fairly large campus with lots of choices for food and exploration and studying, the people are all very supportive of each other and it is not hard to make friends as a freshman (as long as you actually go out and actively look for them)."
Sophomore,5,Beautiful campus! Education driven! People there are very easy to work with and it is obvious that they care about their students.
Graduate Student,5,"I am on the Rockville campus and its a gorgeous campus. Everyone is friendly and willing to help. The tuition is affordable, nice library, classes are a good size."
Sophomore,5,"umbc is great, has a vibrant campus, an outstanding faculty and staff, a wide range of extracurricular activities. Most impressively, their Mock trial team."
Junior,5,"Lots of diversity and great, challenging academics. Especially good school for those in the STEM field and those who want a nice, quiet, relaxing campus."
Sophomore,5,"Freshman year at UMBC can definitely be a struggle. The most important thing is getting into different clubs and activities. Luckily, UMBC has an extensive list of extra curricular activities and strongly encourages students to get involved. There is also a wide range in class size allowing students to take classes in environments best suited to their comfort level. If a student prefers one-on-one time over large group settings, they can definitely find accommodations for their learning style. It is a highly diverse campus that allows everyone to feel safe and comfortable at all times."
Freshman,5,Really amazing school. Great swim team. Good food. Nice dorms. Good classes. Pretty campus. Fun environments. Baltimore is a really cool town. Safe campus. Very enclosed. Nice pool. Nice classrooms. Good teachers. Not a huge Greek life. Great resources. Good library
Freshman,5,I've recently been admitted to this school and since then they have been super interested and im extremely happy with my experience with UMBC so far. I'm looking forward to spend my college years there.
Sophomore,5,UMBC is a great place to study and learn. The campus staff and students are very nice and eager to help. There are countless opportunities to make the most out of your time here from an educational standpoint.
Sophomore,5,"I love how small the campus is and how involved everyone is, ranging from basketball games, to campus events, to even protests."
Junior,5,I go to the Shady Grove campus of UMBC and they are amazing! Willing to go out of their way to help you and the professors are great!
Sophomore,5,I loved the environment and the students. I had a chance to visit and sit in one of the classrooms. Professors are so interesting and professional. It was such a great university to visit.
Niche User,5,I love it! The vibe and the people are amazing. There is no place like UMBC! The housing and the food is delicious and fun! There are so many activities sports and clubs to be apart of to get you active in the community. I love the atmosphere and all the diversity and acceptance in this school!
Sophomore,5,"I really have enjoyed spending time on this campus. I am a college sophmore, and I really appreciate eveything the university has to offer. I love the clubs, the teachers, the students, and the faculty. There are a lot of resources available for those who need a little push or are struggling in the class. Even though it is excruciatingly difficult for STEM majors, there are enough bright minds to help push you through to the next level and get through your coursework."
Junior,5,"The one thing that stands out in UMBC is the diversity. You can always feel included no matter what. I meet awesome people, loved most of my classes and joined an incredible christian organisation."
Junior,5,I love it here at this school. I am currently a junior studying mechanical engineering and am currently applying to the five year masters program for systems engineering. This campus is a perfect fit for me because there are great academics and it provides you with an opportunity to find your niche with a group of friends.
Alum,5,Maryland is home to many wonderful schools and UMBC is among the finest of them. The school is of middling size but the diversity of majors it offers is incredible. The professors are overall incredible especially those involved in History and Ancient Studies. Our strong suit rests in the technology fields but our social science schools should not be underestimated. The dorms located on campus are precisely what you would expect from a college and the on-campus apartments are similarly well-received. My time at UMBC has been incredibly fulfilling for it has given me the necessary tools and connections to succeed in the wider world.
Niche User,5,"Well , I am currently a senior at High Point High School and UMBC is my top choice. I went on a college tour this summer and I most definitely fell in love with the campus and University. The campus is quiet and a perfect place to study. The campus life is great and they have a ton of different foods from different cultures. The staff and students there are so nice and outgoing , especially our campus tour guide. The dorms were also amazing and it felt like a safe place. The campus is also extremely close to the Mark Train. I love the University of Maryland - Baltimore county , hopefully its were I could receive my undergrad."
Alum,5,Its a small but mighty school. The campus is small enough to not be tired walking to classes. Professors are super helpful and your best resource.
Senior,5,"UMBC has a very welcoming atmosphere. From the President of the college right down, the staff and faculty make you feel as if the school is your home and are willing to work with you to make sure that you succeed. The classes have a good pacing, the schedule is set up well, and the education is well worth the money."
Junior,5,At UMBC academics are very important. They put so many opportunities in place for their students to be successful.
Senior,5,"UMBC is a highly acclaimed academic institution. Their strenuous programs push students to their highest potential. This ensures that the students being molded at UMBC, will be ready to succeed in their careers and will be given all the tools to get into top graduate and professional schools. Diversity is a core concept UMBC expresses to its staff and students. UMBC has many international students which increases the diversity pool on campus. They have many student organizastions that express and embrace different cultures and want to share with the school activities to show glimpses of a different culture."
Alum,5,I loved my time at UMBC. My classes were challenging but most of the teachers were amazing and willing to help. I was very prepared for grad school after leaving UMBC.
Junior,5,The environment at UMBC is awesome. I feel like I fit right into the crowds of students working towards their degrees. The professors are good and help you out when needed.
Sophomore,5,"Every college fulfills a specific niche of incoming students. University of Maryland Baltimore County was exactly the right college for me and I will tell you why. UMBC is a small campus compared to state schools which is why I like it so much. Every class, residential hall, and restaurant can be easily reached in no more than a 15 minute walk. Another benefit of such a small campus is that you get to know and meet people easier. It is rare that I walk to class and not run into a friend, or at least a fellow classmate. There is a good variety from 300 student lecture halls to 15 student classrooms that keep each class feeling fresh and different. Just like almost any college there are a variety of sports clubs, academic clubs, and miscellaneous activities available. I can comfortably say this is one of the best colleges in Maryland."
Senior,4,I attend the Shady Grove campus and I am happy with the decision I made. The professor's are great and and I enjoy how the classes I take are taught.
Junior,4,I took a class online during the 2020 Summer Semester and had to switch to online classes during the 2020 Spring semester. From my experiences I believe UMBC is equipped for active online learning. The professors were prepped during the spring and my online class over the summer didn't feel lie busy work or that it was limited due to no in person classes. W've used blackboard collaborate for most classes so we never had any zoom issues either.
Junior,4,"University of Maryland Baltimore County is a great option for the students whose interests align with the school's strengths. If you are a rising senior who is interested in Tech related fields, then UMBC has alot that caters towards you. Research opportunities, networking events with industry leaders, a campus location surrounded by multiple industries interested in investing in students, professors who not only now the material but are also excellent at sharing it, and plenty of on campus job opportunities. The campus life on the other hand can be seen as lacking. UMBC has a large percentage of commuters and the out of class experience can feel lacking at times but it is based in an area close to other schools, UMBC also has excellent transfer programs or community college students looking to boost their GPA then come in with a stronger background. Lastly UMBC is very diverse, the population on campus is mixed to the point where you can spot someone who looks like you every few feet"
Alum,4,"I only experienced online classes for a month or so towards the end of my senior year, so everyone was still adjusting. I had a lot of professors who prepared for online classes before in person classes were shut down. Overall, my professors were very understanding during the transition. I also feel as though recorded lectures were just as useful as in person lectures."
Graduate Student,4,"Great school, very intellectual professors and a lot of ressources for students. The advisors did a great job guiding students throughout their program."
Graduate Student,4,I did not take classes on line during my program at umbc but I am sure there were a lot of ressources for the students that did.
Freshman,4,"I have never had online schooling before, but the teachers worked with the students to create a system in which we could be successful."
Freshman,4,I have enjoyed my time at UMBC. The professors listen and will help you through the various problems you come across. I also have enjoyed the atmosphere of the campus. There's a group for everyone and plenty of campus wide events to keep you busy.
Sophomore,4,I love the overall atmosphere of UMBC because the students as well as the professors and staff are welcoming and always happy to help.
Freshman,4,It is a very good school. Really science and Technology based. The courses are a bit challenging but its a great school.
Alum,4,"My experience at UMBC was great. Most of the computer science professors cared about their students and gave all the necessary resources to succeed. During my time they improved the food options, such as adding Dunkin Donuts and built the Event Center. I wish that there was more parking, sometimes it would take 30min-1 hour to find a spot. There are various organizations to get involved and I felt welcome. If you are more focused on academics than parties, this is your place to go."
Junior,4,Professors worked hard to and did their best to convert classes online in this pandemic. They make it easy and offer extra help outside of the lecture.
Sophomore,4,"Every professor has adapted to online learning very smoothly, the transition as almost unnoticeable."
Sophomore,4,"Very work focused, little to no distractions such as parties. If you're looking to get a degree and don't intend on getting distracted, probably the best place to be."
Alum,4,"Took a few classes online, went pretty smooth. Whenever there were issues, the professors were very helpful in fixing them."
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed my first year experience that came with a very welcoming community as well as challenging courses. I found the course selection to be somewhat above average but I wish there were more to choose from.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is on the smaller side which I prefer, but food options are fairly narrow and the dorms are lackluster. The courses themselves vary in difficulty and their credit transfer process is a pain to go through."
Freshman,4,"It has been stressful, but for the most part the school and it’s staff have made an effort to make it easier on the students. Most of my professors were more flexible with their deadlines and many major requirements also became a bit more flexible."
Freshman,4,"My time at UMBC so far has been wonderful! The people are very friendly and although it is a quiet campus where many people keep to themselves, once you start mingling with classmates it’s quite easy to make friends. I have had some horrible professors and some amazing ones. I can say that most of the professors truly care about each individual student’s success."
Senior,4,"I went to UMBC for the diversity which I definitely got. There is a club for everyone no matter the interest, religion, race, ethnicity, and major. The food is alright and the dining hall gives a suitable amount of choices. My teachers have been okay or amazing. Luckily no one in the Social Work department have been terrible. Though be on top of your own degree requirements."
Alum,4,"UMBC is a great campus for experiencing a very diverse community. While it does pride itself on academics, it can sometimes be difficult to find the right professors. However, the diversity component of the school gives an opportunity to expand your mind and be challenged to grow and change during your time here."
Freshman,4,"The school is small, but the professors are nice and make sure you succeed. The people and students that attend this school are nice and welcoming."
Sophomore,4,"UMBC is very strategic and honors university. The academics is very rigorous but at the same time it feels like home. i love the people i am surrounded with and the school as a lot of resources to help you academically, spiritually, and financially."
Junior,4,"I’d like it to be safer on campus at night as well as have more vegetarian and pescatarian food options around campus. The WiFi, electricity, and water need to be addressed as well. The professors are okay but the classes are challenging and motivating."
Niche User,4,Great campus and mostly great teachers. Transferring from a small community college was a bit startled by size of class and requirement to register for classes way in advance
Sophomore,4,"As an art student concentrating on animation, I enjoyed my time at UMBC. They had professors that worked in the industry (gaming, film, animation, etc.) There were many resources for students to ensure a positive experience in their classes, like 24 hr labs. Some things I wish were different was having more classes catered toward film and 3D animation as well as not requiring students to take classes that are not beneficial to their career goals."
Senior,4,"Nice community of academic-minded students. Tough classes. Heavy funding in life science areas. Expanding campus buildings and resources. New, nice dorms. So-so campus food but improving. Could have more food options though."
Niche User,4,"I did a college tour of this place. Although off to a rough start, the environment and community still felt very homely. I think that the students here really enjoy it and the college doesn't want to leave anyone out. My brother currently attends this place and he has nothing but praise for the school. I was very impressed with everything the campus had to offer."
Sophomore,4,The professors and resources available for students make this a great university for those who want to succeed. The campus is a bit small but that’s perfect for those who don’t want to get lost in the crowd. The school values every student and the hundreds of clubs available make finding friends less intimidating.
Sophomore,4,The campus is beautiful and the teachers are encouraging and try to help students succeed. The dorms are clean and problems are dealt with in a timely manner. There is a variety of places to eat on campus. There are many helpful student resources available as well.
Sophomore,4,I transferred to UMBC for my Sophmore year of college and I like it better than my last college. The classes are interesting and the professors are smart and willing to help you.  There was one professor who I did not like but he is retiring soon. The campus has a mix of old and new buildings but has lots of trees and good hang out places. There are lots of options for food and a dining hall that serves various kinds of food. Some res halls have very small rooms and some have bigger rooms with a living room type space – it depends on your year and if you are in a LLC.
Freshman,4,"I liked the fact that my classes are easy to get to, and all the buildings are connected to each other. The teachers are friendly and care about how much you learn. But this isn't a party school so if you want to party in college don't come here."
Freshman,4,"It is a small campus, which I like.  It is very easy to get to any of the places you need to get to without taking a car or a shuttle.  The laundry is free! The academics here are phenomenal and you will not underwhelmed, it is challenging.  There are little to no parties here but Towson University is very close and there are frats that are off campus that are easily accessible."
Senior,4,They offered everything that I needed to graduate in a timely fashion. The campus is beautiful and very welcoming.
Sophomore,4,"The University is much better than what I expected going into it. There’s everything you look for in a college here and a bit more.  The food in d hall sucks but other than that the food is good with you being able to use you meal any where on campus. There are frat parties and they’re pretty typical college parties. In terms of reputation the school is more along the lines of UMD than Towson. Our school gives out a lot of scholarships and financial aid and most students including me are here because of that. My advice is if you go here join some clubs, make some friends and if you still hate it here than think about transferring but don’t come in comparing this school to other universities as all have pros and cons and here is no different, but I like it here even though there are something’s that may annoy me about it. Make the choice that you fell is best but I can say personally I didn’t make a bad choice."
Freshman,4,"The campus is great, and everyone is very invested in making student life enjoyable and worthwhile. The professors, at least in intro classes, are very well oriented on making sure their students succeed. I do think the transit system needs to be updated and changed, and there needs to be more lights and emergency kiosks around campus. D-hall is great, there are always tons of options to choose from, and if D-hall is boring you out then Commons also has a good selection of restaurants. Also, Chick-fil-a just opened up, so it's getting a lot of business. The communities around campus are not very robust, but students are working on connecting the surrounding towns together with campus. I have heard that Giant provides a 5% discount if you show your gold card :)"
Senior,4,I love the small class sizes and the campus morale. At UMBC I found my place to explore and research my passions. The campus is always changing and you can see the effort by the university to improve
Junior,4,"This college is good, this one of the the few colleges that has an interest in preparing students outside the world of academia. The college prepares students well. The campus is small, so there is a connectdness"
Senior,4,"UMBC is a solid choice for aspiring undergraduates if they are focused on building efficient STEM skills for their career. The academics are great in this school, but in contrast the social scene on campus gets a little stale. It's the perfect school for students who want to get the biggest bang for their buck in the hard sciences."
Junior,4,UMBC is a small community if you want it to be. The psychology department is amazing and the professors are very interested in your success. I recommend trying to find research positions ASAP.
Sophomore,4,"The size of this school is perfect! Not too big, not too small. And you can tell that at least most of the professors really care about your success, even if you're in a 300+ person lecture hall. If you seek help or guidance they will offer you what they can or send you in the right direction."
Junior,4,"I transferred to UMBC from my local community college, so it was a big change for me. The academics and professors are very good, but it would be nice if there were more activities to do on campus."
Sophomore,4,"UMBC is a great university that has the resources to propel a student academically. The student body is extremely diverse and accepting, filled with very interesting and relatable people. A nerdy as the populus can be, we also have an active group of students. As a division one school we have good sports team. Our basketball team is one of the best in our league (Big East) and and our swim team is amazing. All of our teams are competitive in their divisions and make impacts in the playoffs. We have competitive intramural sports i.e. Rugby, Ultimate Frisbee and basketball. Some of the professors are trash but I now realize that applies to 90% of all universities. If you pay attention and talk to your TA you can get through any of the classes at UMBC. There are a lot of way to get tutoring for every kind of subject so if you really want to succeed you can and will. Overall UMBC, in my opinion, is a pretty good university."
Sophomore,4,"I just completed my first year at UMBC and I really enjoyed it! I had great professors who were able to help when I needed it, as well as some interesting courses. The academics here are rigorous, but there is plenty of support. The campus is walk-able; I can get from my dorm to most of my classes in about ten minutes (an I can be a slow walker). I would hope to see them improve food options for people who are gluten free. They have plenty of vegetarian options and some halal options, but fewer ""avoiding gluten"" options. Overall, this is a great school."
Freshman,4,UMBC is an engaging and academically strong college. The classes are interesting and the professors are great at what they do and they are passionate about their work. Not only are the academics great but they offer so many clubs and sports for students to do outside of class. Overall the campus and the college are great!
Junior,4,"I am excited about the opportunity to gain a sustained research experience through the university. However, I would like to see more options available to conduct clinical research at my university"
Sophomore,4,I first went to this university as it was the only one giving me a substantial scholarship. I gained a wholesome experience in my time there. There are some minor issues but they are being dealt with as you go. I really like it here.
Freshman,4,"I love that UMBC is a small campus, but there is still a lot to do and so many ways for someone to become involved. Being here has brought me closer to my filipino heritage after joining FASA, the Filipino American Student Association, and has furthered my passion for biochemistry. The environment here is so friendly and helpful."
Senior,4,UMBC is overall good academically. It is a school that focuses on academics more so than athletics. It is not a party school.
Niche User,4,"Although the community is small, the people there are easier to get along because they are almost all cool nerds. UMBC is in 5th place in the United States for their undergrad education. They are ranked at the top for their computer science programs and diversity. Although you would be likely share a dorm with someone, the LLC (Learning living Communities) help you be with the person who has similar interests like you if you get accepted into one of them (such as STEM or Honors etc.)."
Junior,4,"The community I've found here is honestly great. Great people, great professors - the Visual Arts program is great and I feel like I'm being prepared for my future.  I've been able to find great opportunities through the university and it's taught me to be more independent and how to put myself out there.  The food could be better, but you can only ask so much of a college campus.  It's also sometimes difficult to find proper support, but that seems to be getting better."
Junior,4,"I am a transfer student and I have enjoyed my time here at UMBC so far. It is a great commuter school while actively trying to get students involved in the events and academic life. Overall, I think that UMBC has given me a great experience academically and socially."
Sophomore,4,"UMBC is a great place to go if you are very academically focused. However, the dorms aren't that great, and there isn't much to do one weekends, most students go to UMD or Towson for parties. The academics are great, but difficult for most stem type classes."
Alum,4,"UMBC was an incredible experience. Student life is great, you'll meet some awesome people. Professors are always ready to help. The whole atmosphere at UMBC is very diverse. The organizations/clubs on campus are a great way to get involved."
Freshman,4,"I have been going to UMBC for a year now and really love it, the school environment is fairly small, the teacher really want you to learn and succeed and there is tons of academic resources out there. Some down side is that classes tend to be harder than needed especially 100- level STEM classes, UMBC is not an easy school and you really need to work hard to succeed, the social aspect is pretty low but there is definitely fun stuff to do ! I am in greek life and surrounded by amazing people not at all stereotypical, there is also some “low-key” parties and tons of clubs and student organizations to get involved. Because UMBC is a stem heavy school there is also a lot of on-going research on campus and tons of way to participate as an undergraduate. The career center is also really helpful at helping you find internship, jobs and build a network and a resume."
Junior,4,"Pretty good place to get an education. It is one of the highest rated schools in terms of professor student relations for a reason, so the professors are pretty good at helping students. Campus is pretty safe and the local area is alright, but just be careful in the Baltimore city area. You can meet people from all walks of life here."
Sophomore,4,I like the environment of UMBC and the faculty. The faculty really cares and most students really do wish to succeed and do great things in the future. The campus is a little small and could possibly use some expanding and renovating as some of the buildings are somewhat old
Senior,4,"I absolutely love being a student at UMBC. Since transferring from Frostburg State University where I was a biology major to Howard Community College where I found a new love for psychology, UMBC has since furthered and intensified my love for psychology and the many paths the field of psychology has to offer. UMBC has excellent professors who care about their students and students who support each other. I would love to further my education at UMBC's graduate school once I graduate with my Bachelor's."
Junior,4,"This is a great university, especially for STEM majors. The classes are tough, which helps to actually learn the material. Professors are very helpful, most of them will give as much help as you need, as long as you go see them"
Junior,4,"University of Maryland Baltimore County is a really good school. I just finished my first semester as a transfer from another community college and it was a good semester. The teachers were really nice and helpful. They were also available out of class and during office hours. Other class members were also helpful when you did not know what to do in class. The environment seems like a really friendly environment, and I hope it even gets better during the spring semester. There are also many resourceful information or groups and organizations that can help you out if you need help, if and when needed"
Sophomore,2,Many professors found the transition online to be troublesome. Some professors only turned to lectures that involved only speaking instead of writing their notes down on something like a blackboard. Many professors cancelled office hours and were slow in replying to emails when asking for assistance.
Freshman,2,"I like the academics, very good actually. However, the academics cannot make up for how depressing the whole atmosphere of the school. It is a sad, boring, lonesome campus."
Sophomore,2,"UMBC was a great place for me to study and learn in terms of my major (biochemistry/biology) but that is about it. If you are majoring in anything other than stem then this school's educational programs aren't that great. Many comp science and business majors have a tough time here due to the lack of quality of education available. The only thing you can really do here is study which gets very boring. I want a place I can call home and really feel happy in. I value my education above all else (3.7 gpa) but I know I can receive similar education elsewhere while still being able to have fun and explore other opportunities outside of the classroom. For that reason, I'm actually transferring."
Junior,2,"I didn't feel like the advisers and professors really cared about you as an individual, with the exception of maybe two."
Sophomore,2,UMBC is a very diverse school and has various activities that can appeal to anyone. They have few teachers in certain subjects which can be a disadvantage considering scheduling conflicts.
Graduate Student,2,I got kicked out with a 4.0 GPA because the chair was hurt I didn't want him to be my adviser anymore and someone else did - when the prior semester he didn't want me to be mine anymore.
College Junior,2,"Other than soccer and lacrosse, nothing else is important here."
College Junior,2,We do not have a Greek life because I go to  community college. But ones I transfer I into a four year college I will participate more in school events.
College Freshman,2,I am a non-athelet and the athletic support and supplies are really subpar for non-athletes.
College Freshman,2,It's too expensive compared to the quality of the housing.
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot of interest in Greek life
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot of school spirit or support for sports teams
College Freshman,2,"Our Greek Life isn't super huge, There aren't many frats or sororities and we don't have frat houses on campus. There is usually one or 2 different frats that do something outside our common area and have a little event but nothing huge. I can't say much about it since I don't know a lot about it, but it isn't big and people tend not to like the Frats for some reason."
College Junior,2,"i only rate its great because i have more than 39 credits and would like to stay in walker because its the best but i did not like how you had to pay for rent, deposit and even the utilities really?? Like school isn't already expensive. but i say that because i cannot live in a hall because of the bathrooms."
Recent Alumnus,2,"As a school which caters to the wide volume of continuing education and GI Bill students in the area, UMBC lacks sufficient infrastructure to support the large commuter population. They've clearly grown quicker than they can keep up, and it's showing, with the experience devolving year-over-year. As a ""don't let you hit the door on your way out"" gift, too, they stuck me with an additional $500 bill for a class I had to drop because they processed my GI Bill too slowly.

I simply do not recommend this school to veteran students."
College Freshman,2,I've never seen or heard anything good or bad about it.  I feel like its just kids paying for friends.  No housing available.
College Senior,2,I do not know anyone who is interested in our athletics
College Freshman,2,Its bad considering that even the gym has 5 bikes at its disposal and there are like so many people that want to use them. The gym isn't very big for the price we pay
College Sophomore,2,"Students barely party. Unless they are in Greek life or in a different social organization, the party life is practically nonexistent."
College Sophomore,2,There is absolutely nothing to do in Arbutus and Catonsville.
College Sophomore,2,Most people are very nerdy and maybe not as social.
College Sophomore,2,"We have no football team, and there is really not a lot of school pride if any at all."
College Sophomore,2,"Disorganized - hard to work with, slow operating"
College Freshman,2,"In my experience, the financial aid process has been an ongoing headache. I never received much financial support from the school and for the incoming school year I have not received any aid at all. I have tried to make an appointment with my financial advisor but the financial aid office seems to not want to deal with me. I have gone for support a few times and have found that the students at the front desk are designated to deal with people coming in for financial support and to try as hard as possible to not bother the advisors. With the rise of tuition in the next school year as well as the lack of any grants or scholarships, I might be forced to drop out of school. I am very disappointed that a student like myself who has worked very hard to upkeep a great GPA and who partakes in several campus activities cannot receive the financial aid that I absolutely need to continue my education."
College Sophomore,2,They can get really annoying.I feel like greek life is all about the party and pride of being in a chapter.No one is actually there for the service and making a difference part.
College Senior,2,"A very academic school, so not too many people party every week. The best thing to do if you were interested in partying is join an athletic team or greek life"
College Sophomore,2,"I ordered a cheeseburger and they gave me one with mold on the bread. I gave them another chance and they quickly gave me one with raw meat and expired cheese. Pretty much the only thing there is to eat is the tenders and fries combo, and they make it in small batches despite the fact that it's all anyone wants, so you have to wait in line for 15-20 minutes, then push your way through a crowd of people who don't know who is first in line to get their food."
College Junior,2,"If you want a social life, do not attend UMBC. Period."
College Junior,2,"There are very few academic scholarship available. Even though my family can not afford to send to college, I received no financial aid."
College Freshman,2,Many people are inconsiderate of others and expect complete silence even during quite hours. Some people are just rude.
College Freshman,2,Not very many students care about sports on campus and most of the teams are not notable
Recent Alumnus,2,"We don't have parties here... If you want one, you host one."
College Senior,2,"I think there is somewhat of a sense of school spirit, and some people do go to games (esp. lacrosse and basketball?), but there isn't as much a driving force behind it as at other schools. As a former athlete myself who is no longer in the sports world, I actually found this refreshing.

Also, the facilities right now are pretty small and usually crowded, but they're apparently renovating parts of the center to keep up with how fast the school is growing."
College Senior,2,"UMBC is an honor's college. Most students are serious about their academics. Hard core partying generally doesn't happen, but down time is spent through involvement with clubs, sports, and hanging out with friends. Holidays might mean a party held somewhere on campus, but in general, it's not a weekly routine to search out the hottest party of the weekend, every weekend."
College Sophomore,2,"We don't really do greek life here at UMBC. I mean there are a lot of fraternities and sororities, but no one really takes them seriously. When I see a greek sweatshirt or something, I just assume that student is a deuschbag and move on."
College Sophomore,2,The Baltimore Ravens offered to build us a football stadium. We told them to leave us alone.
College Sophomore,2,"If you want to party, you should not be going to UMBC. We have fun, but not big crazy rager style fun."
College Senior,2,"Do it early

be clear in communication

dont waste your money on failing classes"
College Sophomore,2,There's not much fun to be found in clubs
College Senior,2,The athletics at my school is pretty bad because my school is strictly an academic school. Everyone is more focused on their schoolwork which is why there is not much school spirit and fan support.
College Senior,2,Its very hard to interact with the guys and girls at UMBC because it is a very small school and everybody gossip about each other. As a result of this it is very discouraging to engage with one another at this school because it is very drama-filled.
College Senior,2,Men's soccer and basketball games are the only sports that students will attend. School spirit is mediocre at best. The athletic facility is very nice and filled with a variety of equipment that the students can use and is open for most of the day. There are many student athletes that attend the school and they seem like really nice people.
College Senior,2,I've run out of financial aid and in desperate need
College Sophomore,2,The greek life is very big on campus because it seems like unless you are in a greek organization you will never have anything to do. Greek people are really the only ones that do things on the weekends and they are very cliquey in public so they don't necessarily have a good reputation towards the general population as they don't seem accepting of other students.
College Freshman,2,"Well, UMBC doesn't really have much of a night life atmosphere. The bigger events are pretty fun, though, and there are occasional parties, if you look for them."
College Sophomore,2,I have literally no idea where will take my campus cash off campus other than the grilled cheese and co. and I don't even know where that is.
College Sophomore,2,"The sidewalks aren't well taken care of on campus, especially the outside staircases, which there are a lot of."
College Freshman,2,"I'm a commuter, I'm only 15 min away and I can't get public transit to the university."
College Junior,2,"No one gives a care about anything UMBC when it comes to sprts. Our soccer team is the best in the nation this year or something like that, and our chess team is still ranked up there, but our basketball team is like D4 and low ranked. We don't have football. Anything americans watch on tv we either don't have or suck at so no one shows up to any games and ports pride is low. Academics though, thats another story!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"No one really cares about Greek Life other than the people in Greek Life. I know a lot of people have made lifelong friends doing Greek Life but yeah it's barely a blip on the radar for most people. Also, there's no Greek housing available so that's kind of a bust for anyone who wants to be a part of that. I wan't in Greek Life so my opinion is probably skewed."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I like sports and even I didn't really go to any of the games. There were people who did attend and loved it (especially basketball and soccer) but it still wasn't very exciting on campus. Most of the time people weren't even aware a game was going on. Also, while I love the RAC (the gym on campus) just because it was such a great walking distance from the dorm, it desperately needs an update, although they did buy new equipment a few years ago (and I have to say the 'new' treadmills are amazing)."
College Sophomore,2,"On campus, there are almost no parties (except people drinking in their rooms) but there are a bunch of clubs in Baltimore that people can go to. There are also TONS of cultural dance events on Friday and Saturday nights but these are student organization run events so they may not technically count as parties. I love these events tho and would shift my rating up to a 3 (""It's okay) if they counted."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't receive any aid from the school. I do, however, from my program and fasfa but it is no enough. I still pay around 10,000 dollars a year and it increases each year."
College Freshman,2,Not many off-campus dining options that are cheap.
College Freshman,2,There's not much to do within a walk away.
College Freshman,2,They need transportation into the city
College Junior,2,"It needs to change, to accommodate more people."
College Freshman,2,"The scenery of outdoor hangouts is bleak, and the campus events are okay, but the library is a great place to get studying and work done."
College Freshman,2,"If it rains or snows, I just have to be more cautious when driving."
College Freshman,2,The communication between my private scholarship and financial aid counselor is still an issue to date.
Niche User,1,"This school is very obsessed with trying to improve their ranking and reputation as an ""academic challenging"" school at the cost of the students. Most students do end up here because they were rejected from UMD, if not they received more scholarship money. The academics are not bad and the school even received recognization for its teaching, but they still need to realize they are not in the same category as the top schools in the country and should adjust their academic expectations accordingly. Especially in the STEM majors, they overwork their students, lowering their gpa's compared to their effort and other schools similar in ranking. This ultimately lowers their value when going out into the job market."
Niche User,1,Horrible school. Smoking and drinking everywhere on campus daytime or nighttime. Would not recommend if you don’t like to party
Senior,1,"Will it prepare you for higher education or the scientific field of your choosing? 
Sure, if you study. 
Is it diverse and accepting of all varieties of people? Absolutely. 
Are the professors competent and respectful? Like 60% of the time.
Will the school work you to death in weed out classes, make health services and ADA requirements inaccessible, falsify fees before semesters so you can't contest them and register for classes, blame you for your inevitable mental illness, expel you for attempted suicide in order to avoid liability, and cover up numerous sexual assault charges while employing the police chief that did it, then address subsequent outrage with puppies and 'taking suggestions from external review panels'? 
Without fail."
Freshman,1,"i hate it here! no social life and the courses here are hard for no reason like if you take chemistry or biology you will fail! Plus there is a-lot of sexual harassment at this school, like i get notifications almost every week about a crime on campus. DON'T go to this school if you want a social life!"
Freshman,1,"The schools academics are decent if you're part of the honors college. But other than that the school is boring and dead. This school turns into a graveyard on the weekends. If you want to have fun and enjoy yourself and have fun this isn't the place, but if you're a commuter you'll love it here."
College Junior,1,"No one pays attention to them, and we actually tried to vote for the student government association to spend less money on them--they didn't pay attention to our vote by the way. 

The teams also really suck, they don't really win anything. We beat College Park at soccer once, and that was about it."
College Freshman,1,"If there ever was a party, everyone had to study instead."
College Freshman,1,"Even if there ever was party, no one would go to it."
College Senior,1,cannot get a job as a media studies major
College Senior,1,"I am a Media/Comm Studies major. My suggestion is only declaring majoring in MCS if you're interested in studying and taking theoterical courses. This major doesn't give students interested in broadcast journalism the opportunity to take tv/video courses as its not offered at UMBC. The dept is run by two idiots-Jason Lovligio and Donald Synder (as well as Rebecca Alderman, Fan Yang, Bryce Peake, Rita Turner, Bill Shewbridge, Elizabeth Patton, Kristen Anchor, Stephanie Mavronis, and other staff both full-time and adjuncts) who can't teach and does not know anything about their field and broadcast journalism at all!!! MCS don't have their own career fair and journalism/communication recruiters do not visit UMBC. Get ready to teach yourself editing software (they don't teach it properly in MCS 101L and you just learn outdated/old equipment. They just hand you a book or bring a speaker and expect you to do it yourself. Students are not able to obtain internships during their time at UMBC nor a job after graduation meaning you will be unemployed. MCS (Media/Comm Studies) is easy stupid and pathetic. It is mostly research classes. Go to another university. UMBC sucks! MCS sucks! President Freedom Hbrabowski sucks!"
College Senior,1,it sucks. nobody is outgoing and they go home on weekends. umbc is a ghost town. this is a commuter school.
College Senior,1,"UMBC is very bad for communications and journalism majors. The media and communication studies program do not have hands-on courses. All of the courses are theoretical! The classes, the professors, the program, and UMBC will not help you find or obtain internship or a job after graduation in the media industry, especially the sports industry and the news industry. You will not have the required skills to get a job if you want to be an multi-media journalist / one-band reporter / reporter or a producer. The same applies to internships as well. You will be unemployed after college graduation. 

I hated my time at UMBC and eventually transferred to another school. If you are interested in doing journalism or broadcast journalism, please go to another university such as Mizzou, Northwestern, Syracuse, UMiami, University of Southern California, American, Ithaca, UFlorida, and the University of Maryland, College Park among others. UMBC does neither has a journalism nor broadcast journalism program. 

The media and communication studies program and UMBC is a joke. You will be seriously disappointed. The MCS major will make you unemployed after graduation and beyond. I sincerely regret coming to UMBC. I hate UMBC and this is the truth!"
College Sophomore,1,"What parties? The school is anal about drugs and alcohol, everyone here is socially awkward, and people go home after 3 pm."
College Freshman,1,There is no social life
College Senior,1,"UMBC, is strictly an academic school so there are really no parties here. Overall, the nightlife at this school is very poor and it doesnt help that umbc is a commuter school. As a result of this,  there are not a lot of people that are on campus on the weekends which makes it hard to throw any parties."
College Senior,1,"I have not received any financial assistance at my school. All that I have been offered are endless loans. By the time I graduate, I will own about $88,000 in student loans. At this point, I need as much financial assistance so that I can lighten the amount of loans that I have accumulate over the last 3 years."
College Sophomore,1,"There is nothing near this campus, at least not walking distance, and for a school with crappy transportation this causes issues for students. The scenery on campus is nice but there aren't many food options, and there is really nothing to do outside going to classes."
College Sophomore,1,"There is absolutely nothing near my school so if you want to do anything but sit in your room and stare at the walls you need transportation!! However this school has terrible transportation hours, and many of the buses only run on the weekends and end running at 10PM! I think that students would be willing to pay a bit more for buses if they had better hours and went to more locations."
College Junior,1,"Unless you have a car your options are subway... yup, and that closes before 12."
College Junior,1,We go to Towson to party. All dorm parties on campus are sausage fests or third wheeling getting drunk with a group of close friends who will be doing homework afterwards.
College Freshman,1,UMBC has no known nightlife. Simply having a full suite almost qualifies for a party.
College Junior,1,They don't inform you on a lot of offers.
College Junior,1,Not much goes on because commuters do not stick around and many students live close enough to home to leave for the weekend.
College Senior,1,"They have public transportation but it sucks. There are designated areas for bus stops, but they are imaginary. You have to remember where you are going. Even though it says online where all the bus stops are, you still have to tell the bus driver you want them to stop there. They never actually stop at the bus stops that are said online and there are a lot of them."
College Junior,1,There is no nightlife at my campus. It is an honors university so majority of people spend there weekend studying. Or in contrast the remainders just chill in the aparrtments and drink. There are not a lot of parties and if there are they are off campus at a club about twenty mins away. The nightlife mainly consnist of social gatherings or nights in your dorms watching a movie.
Recent Alumnus,1,"It is difficult to find parking, and you have to arrive on campus around 8:45am in order to get a decent spot. We lost a lot of parking to an incredibly beautiful performing arts building, but the parking has been replaced only at a bare minimum."
College Junior,1,"I have been ticketed, a warning, for having my correct permit and being in the correct spot. I try to get on campus extremely early so I have parking anywhere I'd like, but if not parking gets a little tedious depending the time of the day. I have spent 10-30 minutes looking for a parking spot, unless I'd like to park a mile to a half away."
College Junior,1,"The surrounding cities of Arbutus and Catonsville are trashy at best. I would not walk around these places after dark and there have been occasions of muggings on campus while people are walking/jogging around the UMBC loop. The Fishhead Cantina is the local club and the people who go there who are not from campus are equivalent to the surrounding area, trashy."
College Senior,1,"UMBC is not near any community hot spots and is very secluded. If you do not have your own transportation it is very, very difficult to get off campus. Simple errands like grocery shopping can take several hours if you depend on public transportation and there is no night life."
College Freshman,1,"What night life? Honestly, if you're looking for a good ""party school"", UMBC is not what you are looking for."
College Sophomore,1,"UMBC does not offer many scholarships beyond some of the major programs here like Meyerhoff, and the financial aid office is sometimes frustrating to work with. All it takes is some hard work (and staying on top of your finances, scholarships, and loans, [bother the financial aid office often to get stuff done]), and you'll have school paid for, no problem. It is best to request an adviser in your Major and then ask them if there are any offered applicable to your major."
College Sophomore,1,"It is very hard for commuter students to find a good parking space if they don't arrive on campus before 10:00am. The campus will get packed near the center of the campus so the only option is to park near the Stadium parking lot, which is far away from all the academic buildings. The parking gets better toward the late afternoon when most people have finished their morning classes."
College Freshman,1,Freshmen parking is two miles away from campus. Commuters have a hard time finding good parking.
College Sophomore,1,Go to college park if you want a FULL campus experience.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking is horrible during the weekdays. I would advise students to get to campus 30 minutes before class.  Recently, the parking spaces around the loop have been divided into sections for different groups and that makes it harder to find parking.  As a freshmen, you get the worst parking spots and will probably have to park in a satellite lot to take the shuttle bus to campus.  It would be best not to drive until the weekend if possible."
College Junior,1,Everyone seems to have same fashion sense and personality type.
College Junior,1,The seem to assign your roommates and suite-mates based on color and a good amount of the personalities that live on campus are the same so if you don't mesh you won't really enjoy it here.
College Junior,1,"Other than the huge mall that's about 20 minutes away and the Orioles and Ravens stadiums, there is not much to do. My car got broken into one week into the school year. As far as the town is concerned the students don't even exist, you would never even know there was a college near the town."
Recent Alumnus,1,None Really Except a Few on Campus House Parties – Nightlife is mainly at DC or downtown Baltimore with a few students partying with friends from other schools at Silver Spring etc. Most clubs in DC are for 21 and older. Some on campus apartment parties exist and are for everyone. for students who are 21 or older.
College Junior,1,No Help at All – I have not gotten any help from the financial aid office at all.  Thats why I am filling this out!
College Sophomore,1,Freshman parking is barely near the school. They have to take a shuttle that runs every hour to and from their car. It is very hard to find a parking spot due to the great amount of commuters. Students without permits end up parking in the near by parking lots as well.
College Junior,1,"Oh No – Pardon me while I get on my soap box. First off the financial aid office at my school is like playing a game of Russian roulette. Will I get a person who cares and calls back?Will I get the right information?Its arduous experience centered on hour phone calls and horrible office hours. Even worse when I first started as a transfer student, they completely let go the majority of their staff for budget cuts then replaced them with people who were completely incompetent.  Recently was sent an email saying my tax information must be in despite the fact that taxes are to be due in April. After freaking out and rushing to do my taxes ""on time"" I got an email saying opps they sent out the wrong info."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking at UMBC is notorious for being horrible, but it seems to be a general problem at most universities."
College Freshman,1,Living on Campus – Living on campus is okay during the week dorms are small campus is empty on weekends ... good place to be if you want to avoid big parties and get a chance to study
College Freshman,1,"the same few parties happen every weekend, and are usually always busted by the cops. not a partying place at all."
College Freshman,1,"Just didn't like this school...at all! UMBC is a very cliquey school. Athletes stick to athletes, honors kids to honor kids, and basically no one ventures out to meet people that are different than themselves. There is absolutely no campus life, many students go home during the weekends. This school in my opinion lacks social life and openness. Whenever I stay on campus, it feels like a prison and mostly every dining facility is closed over weekends! Granted, this school does focus more on academics than anything else, but it should take some hints from schools like University of Maryland, College Park. Maybe that way more people would like to stay here all 4 years than transferring their sophomore year. I know I definitely am."
College Freshman,1,"UMBC is a school for students that want to study 24/7 and never leave campus.  UMBC is basically a commuter college as everyone goes home on the weekends.  There is no football team, and no pride for the school whatsoever. Almost every amenity on campus is hassle. If you are looking for a real college experience, don't come to UMBC."
College Freshman,1,"Get Use to Fast Food – It is nearly impossible to get off campus without a car.  And when you finally do manage to get off campus, you have a wide selection of fast foods.  Hello freshman 15."
College Freshman,1,"Baltimore = Bad – UMBC is located between the highway and Baltimore.  It is literally impossible to get off campus without a car, and the surrounding neighborhood is dangerous.  It is dirty, and the people there are some what hostile.  Be careful when you venture off campus at UMBC."
College Freshman,1,"One Huge Headache – Parking for freshman is a huge, huge hassle.  Freshman are only allowed to park at the Satellite lot which is 2 miles off campus.  

Parking for all the other students is a battle, space is limited and it is rare to find a parking spot.  Just finding a good parking spot can be the highlight of your day, as most of the time, people have to park far away in order to get a parking spot.  

The worst part is, since UMBC is right off a highway, it makes it nearly impossible to get off campus without a car."
College Junior,1,"The training center of UMBC does not accepted federal aid, and there is only one loan option available. Scholarships are accepted but students must research them on their own through scholarship search engines."
College Freshman,1,"Basically a Commuter College – The only real plus about UMBC is the rising level of academics, especially in the science field.  There is no pride, no football team and definitely no fun.  A commuter college in disguise, almost all the students go home on the weekends.  It is a ghost town on the weekends, the facilities close early or are just closed because no one is on campus.  

UMBC is a small campus, isolated off the highway and the surround neighborhood is worrisome to say the least.  Working with housing is always a hassle, and finding a parking spot is near impossible.  Don't even consider driving if you're a freshman.  Freshman park are restricted to the Satellite parking zone which is 2 miles off campus. 

UMBC is for strictly academic students who want to be studying 24/7; if you looking for a real college experience, you will not find it at UMBC."
College Senior,1,Not a Good Choice – Would most definitely not choose this school again. Most of the student population does not actually want to be there. The quality of the professors varies greatly. There is no school spirit. Almost all the students go home during the weekend which leads to lack of community on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"You have to really be determined to find something to do for fun. There are clubs to go to, but they all are relatively far away. Everything that is worth doing is off campus, which requires a car."
College Junior,1,"Sports Are Overlooked – For those involved in sports, they are a big deal, but to the rest of campus they don't play that large of a role. Our school has no football team and I feel that affects how we are seen by other universities and even within our campus. There is not much pride on the part of the student body about our sports. However we are division 1 in several sports."
College Senior,1,"Offered Courses for Major Requirements – They attempt to cookie-cut students with streamlined efforts by limiting the classes offered that can fulfill a major's requirements, it does not inspire students to venture out of the box. Personally, I find this very disappointing because University is for exploration."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There wasn't much from which to choose just the usual tacos, chinese, and coffee spots. Every spot was always jammed packed with students and there were never enough people working to support such a demand. Also, everything was overly expensive ($4 for one bagel and $5 for a small cup of coffee). The best place I found to eat was the Yum Shoppe located on the bottom floor of the Commons."
College Freshman,1,"this school sucks. living on campus means sitting in your room playing xbox all day.  weekends are terrible as 2500 of the 3000 people that live on campus go home, and even more leave for athletics.  Education is great here, but if you're looking for fun it isnt worth it for anybody"
College Freshman,1,nobody watches games because everybody commutes.  basketball games usually have about 100 people attending and half are parents. there is NO football team. umbc is a terrible choice for a college experience
College Sophomore,1,Night Life – the night life is not very good.. UMBC is not a school with good parties most of the parties are shut down by the cops and a few bars in baltimore to go to.

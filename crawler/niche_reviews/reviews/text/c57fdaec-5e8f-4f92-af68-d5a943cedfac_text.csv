Alum,5,"Moving to online classes was heartbreaking, since it was my last semester and I have grown so close to the LC community - but what made it ""Excellent"" was meeting with my advisor everyday, continuing class discussions via virtually, having RD's and RA's continue to support us virtually, and of course having virtual Zumba every week on top of other activities. Landmark reminded us everyday that we were still a community."
Alum,5,Landmark has been my home for the last 4 years - I never expected to gain so much confidence and skill. I LEARN how to strengthen my reading and science abilities through teachers that engage and care. I've had life changing experiences though studying abroad and leadership roles. The location is great too - it rural and quiet but still only a couple hours from major cities.
Alum,5,Landmark College is an amazing place that changes people's lives.  It changed my life.  I graduated Landmark in December of 2009 and miss Landmark every day.  I made many friends for life.  Some of them I still go and visit today.  Others that I only see once a year but we have the best of time together.  Landmark helped me to learn what my Learning disability is and how to work around them.  Everything I learned at Landmark I took with me and was able to get my BA in hotel management.  I made friends with many teachers and staff to.  Landmark is my second home and I miss it every day and wish I was still there.  If you have LD's or any type of learning difference than Landmark is for you.
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a sophomore at Landmark College and coming here was the best decision I ever made! I struggled in high school and wasn't even diagnosed with dyslexia until I was in my junior year. Since coming here, I have learned so many valuable skills, like self-advocacy. I'm finally happy to go to classes and don't dread them like I did in high school. Plus, I've met so many people here with similar stories to me and have made so many friends!"
Sophomore,5,"I am a current student at Landmark College, going on my fourth semester. 

Landmark college is an amazing place. I can understand some of its negative reviews- especially when talking about the high price, but all in all this is an amazing college for students with learning differences. I myself am just diagnosed with ADHD, and landmark changed my life. I've made many life long friends- and Its given me the confidence and experience I need to transfer to another place, that fits my area of study better. 

Student life- Honestly, Landmark College tries its best to give the students lots of events and clubs. Emily North- the leader of the Campus activity board is one of the nicest people I've ever met, and will listen to any ideas for events and will put her all into making it happen. 

Diversity- There are rooms dedicated to diversity. There's the Center for women and gender, the Rise up center (for students of color), and the Stonewall center (for students identifying as LGBTQIA+)"
College Sophomore,5,"This school is expensive, REALLY expensive, but the skills you leave here knowing are definitely worth it. Plus the school provides you with health insurance and a shrink if you need one."
College Sophomore,5,Honestly the teachers here are awesome. Definitley one of the only reasons why i stay here. I used to go and get a beer with my psych proffesor after class and discuss my grades
College Sophomore,5,The career center staff is awesome and super helpful but being as that it is a small school there is only like 3 maybe 4 people on the staff so you better make an appointment
College Sophomore,5,Its a small campus so its REALLY easy to get around places and the buildings are almost always open. I know that the gym never closes.
College Freshman,5,They give you some flex here.
College Sophomore,5,"If you are a student with a learning disability, the opportunity to attend Landmark College is better than winning the Mega Millions.

If you are a student with a learning disability who has always felt like the 'adopted child' in most, if not all, other educational settings, welcome to what is the equivalent of Truman Burbank's Seahaven Island --- everyone is like you. They may not have the same challenges as you, they may not have had the same experiences, they may look different or sound different, but they all understand what it means to be different, to learn differently, and that means everything when it's something you've never had."
College Sophomore,5,"Life Changing – Before Landmark I had written myself off as a failure. I've always known I was bright but high school was a disaster, as were my various stints at different colleges.  I had completely lost confidence as my ability to succeed in academia despite my intense love of learning.

I'm happy to say that I've gotten some of that confidence and academic swag back.  The professors literally root for you from day one.  They try their hardest to help you grow as a student and will fight you tooth and nail to make you believe that you are worthy of education.  

Because of the size of the school certain classes are not offered every semester and often do not have more than one section.  Sometimes you have to pick a second or even third choice instead of the class you actually wanted.

There is also a special seminar called First Year Studies that ALL students must take and pass if they want to graduate. Everyone hates this class, I actually failed it the first time and had to retake it. But it is the single most useful class I have ever taken in my life. Its focus is to challenge your notions of yourself, LD, education, and learning. To anyone planning to attend Landmark, pay attention to and pass this class. Once you understand its purpose your outlook will completely change."
College Student,5,"Landmark's student body is diverse ethincally, economically, politically, religiously and sexually. The one thing all Landmark students have in common is a learning disability diagnosis."
College Student,5,Traditional Classes – Landmark incorporates technology into every class and has online modules in traditional classes. Giving a low teacher to student ratio and one-on-one mentoring/coaching sets Landmark apart.
Junior,4,"During my time at Landmark, I have always felt like they understood me. They also have a great support system.  This college feels like most typical colleges I've ever went to which was good sense of structure and whenever you are lost there's always someone there that can help you. Their Drake Center I'm at is a little lacking sometimes when it gets overbooked and they have no time for me but when you get the help did, they give you you're always satisfied. I always found them to be very flexible and when it comes to picking my classes and my major they offer great advice and support."
Niche User,4,I haven't seen it yet however id taken a virtual tour and the campus is beautiful. Im very excited to be given the chance to visit next week!
Sophomore,4,Landmark college is great for students with an LD that otherwise would not have been able to succeed in college.
Alum,4,"There is definitely a lot of negatives to this school but it's the place to go if you need to work on your skills to go to a real college. Most of the professors are  knowledgeable, but a lot of the students will ruin the class and make it hard for the teacher as they are always disruptive, or asking too many questions.  The school tolerates a lot of behavioral issues, however this is a school for kids with LD's and having kids who might make a lot of racist remarks or be extremely anti-social comes with the LD factor. Come here to get college skills and to learn more about your LD and how to deal with it, but don't come here for the degree or social life. And do not get a bachelors unless the program is comparable to other schools. You will not be challenged enough in the Bachelors programs to make it in the real world. If you are someone with an LD who is uncertain where to go, check out  Landmark, as long as you can be sure you can pay for it, don't go into debt over this place."
Freshman,4,I went to Landmark College two years after I was diagnosed with a learning disability my senior year of high school. I was kicked out of prep school and had many personal struggles before I bounced back and realized I wanted to learn again. Landmark has helped me achieve my potential. You will get out only as much as you put in here.
College Junior,4,"Honestly the credits transferred much better than I ever anticipated. A lot of courses are Landmark specific, since their focus is on LD students' needs, and I was pleasantly surprised by how many credits I could transfer."
College Junior,4,"Some of the courses are unexpectedly difficult to students coming from highly rated academic backgrounds. However, Landmark students are all the better for that because it forces them to try new study methods that can maximize their performance while minimizing procrastination. The professors, for the most part, are extremely willing to get to know their students and address their learning needs. I encourage each student to develop a strong rapport with their professors, as their recommendations will be very valuable when applying to other schools or jobs."
College Junior,4,"The school does the best with what resources it has. The reality is that it serves around 300 students with excellent technological resources, and teachers who are extremely well versed in the needs of LD students. Many complain about the high tuition, but with only 300 students and without state funding, it's only logical. For students who cannot afford the tuition, there are definitely ways that they will help you afford the school, provided you have displayed a high work ethic and desire to succeed. At this point, Landmark is not meant to be a place where students go to have fun and the full college experience. It is a two-year school with an Associate's Degree offered. They put their money back into the school, in order to constantly adapt to the evolving landscape of higher education as it concerns LD students. If a student goes in with a strong desire to learn about themselves, and a willingness to make improvements in their academic approach, they will leave her prepared for long term success in education, and in their careers. I recommend this school to parents with LD children, whether high or low functioning, who have just graduated high school and not yet applied to college. The high cost will undoubtedly be worth it in the long term for your children."
Recent Alumnus,4,"It varies, some teachers are great and care about students and want them to pass. They were my favorites. I had plenty who were the worst, and high school teachers were better then them. My advice if you hate the class and teacher, get out as soon as possible."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Depends on the teacher, and the material."
College Freshman,4,"I am a student with several learning disabilites and I am on the autism spectrum so Landmark is a great school for students like me. i am currently on the Deans list for my midsemester, but my tuition is very expensive for my family, so i would like to help any way i can and a scholarship would be great."
College Senior,4,"Teachers are very flexible when it comes to issues associated with a person's LD. The administration (other than the advising department) is much less flexible, the president in particular. The school also tends to reward a very specific type of student with jobs/awards/etc, usually those the perceive as hard-working and not necessarily the best or most deserving."
College Sophomore,4,Its a two year school. I was able to get my entire A.A. within two semesters there. This place makes you want to buckle down and focus. Well either that or sleep all day.
College Sophomore,4,If you aren't looking for the traditional college experience and are looking for someone to help you either transition into a traditional college or just need to have someone help you learn than this is the place for you.
College Senior,4,"Different kinds of students, however there is a majority of the typical awkward kids. However there are plenty of students who are more relaxed and are outgoing enough to hang out with."
College Senior,4,"Since a lot of students here have executive function difficulties, they do the best they can to help and fit time for their students - if they make the effort to meet them."
College Senior,4,"Transfer and Career Services really helps with finding, and applying, to colleges for further studies. They offer programs and websites that helped me find a good list of colleges for me to apply to."
College Senior,4,"Plenty of resources to help students learn and study. An excellent library with great staff. The DCAS is very helpful for getting homework, tests and projects done. However, I have not used much of the campus resources."
College Freshman,4,"Great gyms and they got a climbing wall. Buildings are ugly, modernist, and bland."
College Sophomore,4,"At Landmark, it's all about you. What works, what doesn't; you decide. You have the support and guidance of your Advisors and Professors. Together, you will find the plan that works best for you."
Niche User,2,"I am currently a student at Denison University, but came here to work on things.  However, it is not helping in the way that I thought it would.  It makes me miss my other school, the classes are easy.  I found their summer program to be helpful to a degree, but the bridge semester is not worth it.  There is little to do unless you bring a car to campus or have a friend with one.  This school is also extremely strict and lacks with social events."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I didn't use financial aid, my friends had mixed experiences, the tuition is very high."
College Senior,2,"The school has recently been renovating, but the buildings look and feel like 70's USSR projects sometimes, especially the dorms. The student center is practically useless for studying and hanging out. The head of facilities is great, but the school isn't able to do a ton to make the buildings better. The gyms aren't great and need updating. Being in nicer housing costs $500 to $1000 extra per semester, and it often separates the rich kids from those on financial aid in a way that isn't beneficial to the campus culture. Many students also have issues with personal hygiene and cleaning their dorm rooms, so the dorms always smell pretty funky. There is practically no social life on campus. There are only 500 students, but I only saw about 200 of them regularly and only knew the names of about 70. Many people don't leave their rooms except to go to class. Students are generally nice, but if you're fairly normal (and I hesitate to use that word, but I'm not sure what else to say), you need to search pretty hard to put together a friend group. If not, you'll be among peers."
College Senior,2,"They just replaced the entire college and career counseling, and they're a little clueless as of now, but I'm sure they'll improve once they figure out the school. Landmark is a very unique school to be transferring/getting a job from, and I feel like the staff needs to get a better idea of reasonable expectations for the students. Plus, Landmark doesn't have very many connections/alumni to draw from, so that's no help in finding a job or internship. Everyone is very nice and easy to talk to."
College Sophomore,2,"One word. WEIRD. If you are even slightly normal than congratulations, you're one of the five of us in total. If you are far from the social norm than have fun at the mothership."
College Sophomore,2,"it has everything you could need, but the network is slow"
College Sophomore,2,"Quirky but Male – Everyone at Landmark has some sort of learning/developmental disorder so the students are generally quirky and fun-loving(to the point of too much fun).  We range from the fringe kids to the party animals you may have known in high school.  It isn't hard to find an entire table fighting over who the best Doctor from Doctor Who is or if the Patriots will beat the Giants.
That said, the population is overwhelmingly male and Caucasian.  This combined with students who typically have low frustration tolerance, have difficulty understanding social cues, and come from homogeneous areas often result in incidents of ignorance and intolerance.  
Being either female or a minority (or both) can be difficult unless you are willing to stick up for yourself and are able to find others who will stand behind you."
College Senior,2,Career Center Not That Impressive – the goal of this college is preparing you to move on to a 4 year program so there is not as much focus on career services as transfer services.
Junior,1,"I have been going to Landmark College for 3 years (5 semesters). Last semester they last semester they hired a new person who runs all of the supports for all of the classes.

This has caused majority of the mathematics support to disappear. 
From having it Sunday night through Thursday Nights, changed into only Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursday.
Because of this I was forced to drop my Calculus class because it was on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

There was no heads up from faculty that any of these supports where going to change from one semester to the next and from having 4 compete semester with all the support I needed. Change so drastically I am scared for the future of my college experience here at Landmark"
Alum,1,"In the 21 or so years since I attended this “institution”, I’m shocked that it still hasn’t been the subject of some investigative journalism piece.

Do not send your kids to this bullsh*t school. I don’t care how rich you are, you’ll just be throwing away your money. Ivy League prices for an associates degree from a for-profit institution? If your kid doesn’t finish, don’t hold out hope that whatever credits they may have accumulated at this pseudo-academic institution will be accepted by whatever college or university your child attends next. There are no quick fixes for learning differences. Don’t fall for the scam."
Recent Alumnus,1,"It's barely existent, but it isn't the point of the school."
College Senior,1,"The student body is hard to accurately describe. It's probably the most diverse school in the nation in terms of academic ability and intelligence. When I was on newspaper, there was a guy who wrote an article about the empty bowls fundraiser for the food bank and through the entire article spelled it empty bowels and did not write in complete sentences. He sat next to a girl who now attends Haverford. 

Socially, the school is just as complex. Many, many students don't leave their rooms except for class and gaming. Many have social difficulties associated with their LD and it is important to learn to set boundaries (note: do not give out your phone number unless you're sure you want that person as a friend). There are also many people who are social and on the better end of the social skills scale. Almost everyone is nice, although you have to watch out for the very few people who are easily upset. There's a vibrant gaming and movie watching community and the RAs and RDs do a great job with programming and making sure all their students are doing as well as possible."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have any online classes
College Sophomore,1,"It's Pretty Ugly – The campus is small and unsightly, point blank.  The buildings are hideous on the outside and most of the dorms are horrible. When it rains everything turns to mud. When it snows everything turns to ice.

The Student Center has a decent game room and just opened up a Meditation Room on the second floor.  The gyms in Aiken and Frost are decent, as is the Click Center gym.  Unfortunately we only have a tiny pool.

The library has an AMAZING Learning Disability section and a great comic book/graphic novel section. They are also able to order books from nearby colleges if they don't carry what you need.  The library staff is also very helpful (and extremely tolerant) but understaffed.  The library also has the worst hours I have ever seen on any campus. It is never open past midnight and on the weekend in closes in the afternoon.

Campus activities need more variety and heavier promotion.  Last year students took it upon themselves to organize and DJ several raves and those ended up being the best activities."
College Sophomore,1,"The Guys to Girls Ratio – While Landmark is a small college, the ratio here sucks when it comes to guys to girls. There are 3 guys to 1 girl here, and at a school with over 500 students it really shows. here and there are attractive girls, but there is just too many dudes here. This school needs to work on that a little bit to keep the student life a bit happier here."

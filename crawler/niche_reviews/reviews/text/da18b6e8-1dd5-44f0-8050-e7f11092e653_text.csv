Sophomore,5,"During COVID-19, all the on campus classes became online classes during the middle of the spring semester in 2020 for safety reasons. All my professors kept in close touch through email and made sure they were able to help me. One professor even did Zoom video calls."
Sophomore,5,"I am an intravert I love here i feel safe and secure. Since I been here haven't been bullied or teased 
The teachers are amazing"
Sophomore,5,"I love this school. It truly has a diverse liberal arts education experience. Not only do you get the small school experience with a tight knit community, but you also are able to meet so many people from different cultures. I also like how God is at the core of the education."
Senior,5,Methodist University is a great school. They have great staff and teachers that are guided by the schools morals and Christian values. I would recommend this school to anyone searching to further their education. The school is slightly expensive because it is a private school but the faculty justifies the costs.
Freshman,5,"I like that it's a smaller campus. Another thing is that it has smaller classroom sizes. The dorm rooms are nice. If you ever need something to do there are pool tables, ping pong tables, a gym, clubs, and even events that are held."
Niche User,5,Great college and atmosphere. Teachers are very open and student life is amazing.  It is a closed community and a small college so everybody knows everybody.
Freshman,5,"So far, I have loved my experience with Methodist University. The staff is wonderful to work with, and they are very helpful in the starting process. I not only was able to contact my advisor and get a response promptly, but they were able to set me up to succeed in my coming years at the University. My classes were picked out for me, so I know what I need to take to get me Gen Eds out of the way, and not worry last minute to get them done."
Junior,5,"It is a smaller community which makes it feel more like home. The community is great, as well as the staff. It is easy to get around campus and the energy during sporting events is great."
Sophomore,5,"Methodist University to me is the perfect place for those looking for a smaller university than the giant mega colleges. As someone who has a lot of problem with interacting with strangers, having a smaller amount of people to meet has been amazing."
Niche User,5,"I was recently accepted to Methodist University, therefore, I have only had the pleasure the meet the admissions, financial aid and veterans assistance staff at Methodist University. My experience with the staff, up to this point, has been fantastic."
Niche User,5,"I am currently entering into Methodist University in the Fall of 2019.    I was there for a College Tour.   Everyone I met - Students, Professors, Administration Staff and Counselors went above and Beyond to provide me with all of the information needed as an incoming student and they made me feel very welcome ."
Niche User,5,I LOVE THIS UNIVERSITY! It is the best university in North Carolina. The staff is super nice and so are the students. Their ROTC programs  are fantastic and so is their DPT program.
Niche User,5,I love how Methodist university is very welcoming and have a family background and wants to help it students
Niche User,5,"When I went on a college campus tour, I was stunned by how beautiful it was! And the programs that they offer are amazing, and with all of the construction plans for the future, it will be even more amazing!"
Junior,5,"Methodist has staff which genuinely cares for your success and wellbeing. The professors are all very qualified and there are so many kind people all across campus. The small community makes you more than a face in the crowd, teachers remember you and what you are good at."
Junior,5,"A great school with caring people and professors.  Small enough, yet large enough to find lots to do.  Overall, it has a great atmosphere in friendly North Carolina."
Freshman,5,Methodist University is a perfect college for anyone looking to be a physician assistant. Their campus is very strict on safety and security by allowing only one way in and one way out after 10 pm. The dorms are much bigger than any other college. Campus food is very good and the community is extremely friendly. I would highly recommend this school.
Alum,5,"Methodist was a great experience for me. It was a small school setting, and I loved that my professors actually knew me by name. I would recommend MU for students who want a personal college experience with a quality educational outcome!"
Freshman,5,My transition to college life in the fall of 2017 has been great.  Methodist if very welcoming.  The other students are very nice and i enjoy my time there.  The professors have a very open door policy that is nice for extra help or talking to them about my plans for the future.
Sophomore,5,i love how active the school is in the students education. i love how much the professors go out of their way to help their students
Freshman,5,"Methodist University has the best campus where  you could make  great friends, the atmosphere is positive and warm welcoming."
Freshman,5,Methodist university is a great school for students that like small classes and a small campus. I really like how involved the professors are and also the pride in the school overall! Greek life is a big part of my life and it is growing very fast. The one thing I'd like to see change is the cafeteria food. It is not the worst but not the best. I wish there were more options for the students.
Freshman,5,"I am in my first year of college, and it was a tough start being that I have just retired from the U.S Army, and there is a large age gape between me and my peers. One of the great things about Methodist University is teacher to student ratio. most of my class' have less than 15 students. All of the teachers that I have had are easy to talk too, and will bend over backwards to help you understand any material that you may have not comprehended."
Junior,5,I love that it is a small school. You get personalized education with professors who understand their field. Most professors are also leaders in the community who can help with acquiring employment upon graduation.
Junior,5,I enjoy the small class sizes for a more personal experience. Most of the teachers really care about their fields and I enjoy their lectures.
College Freshman,5,"I love Methodist, and I can't wait to attend in the fall!!"
College Freshman,5,I feel extremely safe at MU. we have the best security.
College Freshman,5,MU is home. I wouldn't rather be anywhere else.
College Freshman,5,"I love Greek life at Methodist, they are all very kind and do anything to help others and the community."
College Freshman,5,I have no complaints. A mass variety to choose from!
College Freshman,5,I love the interaction with professors.
College Freshman,5,I don't have any issues concerning campus safety.
College Freshman,5,I love the instructors I've had so far. They genuinely care about the student's academic progress. The instructors are also intuitive to the student's needs.
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are great. I am a Nursing student and love them. They continue to help us all and if we are ever stuck on anything, they will take the time to stay after and go over anything we need until we understand it better."
College Sophomore,5,"I think the student career prospects are good. Like I said, I am a nursing major and feel very confident in getting a job right out of graduation just from graduating from here. They really help you find internships and jobs."
College Sophomore,5,"I enjoy having the security guards on campus that check our IDs before going on campus to make it safer for someone to not be able to just get onto campus without permission. I do feel safe, but I would like to have more  cops at night during night classes around when everyone is walking back from their classes to the dorms or even vehicles"
College Sophomore,5,"I believe that the best dorm is Weaver Hall as far as overall, but the cleanest is North Hall. I enjoy living in Weaver just because it is cheap. If I had more money, I would choose better dorms to live in due to them being cleaner."
College Sophomore,5,Greek life is more of a community based gathering of girls and boys that come together to help out the school. They are not big into partying or drinking together. They do intramural sports together and go to sporting events together. They even have bible study once a week.
College Sophomore,5,So far Ive really enjoyed this school. The school is very unique as far as everyone gets along even if the diversity is so big. I would absolutely choose the school again if I ever had a second choice to do it again.
College Sophomore,5,Baseball and Lacross both are one of the top in the state. They are great and continue to win titles.
College Sophomore,5,The health and safety is strictly enforced by campus security. One of the great qualities of this school.
College Junior,5,Our Career Services center is definitely one of the best. I can walk in there and get an appointment within that week. Students also receive email about jobs and career fairs very often.
College Junior,5,I am apart of Greek life and I think it is one of the best decision I could have made.
College Junior,5,Because we are division three our sports tend to include a big part of out population. Which I think is good because it allows students who weren't able to play sports at a division one level to still play the sport they love.
College Junior,5,I love MU! It is truly my home away from home.
College Senior,5,"Because the size of the classrooms are small, that gives students an oportunity to react in class and uderstand better the courses. Students have a very wide range of available courses they can take"
College Senior,5,One of the best services at Methodist University is the areer services. Students receive all the possible attention they need. The career services looks for jobs and internships for students. The personal helps students build their resume
College Senior,5,Methodist campus has a perfect control about campus crime and personal safety. The police department is always around to make sure that everybody is safe
College Senior,5,My experience in that school is so relevant that I'd like to spend more time with that family. The attention that I receive from professors and students make that school a unique one
College Senior,5,The athletic facilities pass with an A+. Students involve a lot in the activities.
College Sophomore,5,"This school is expensive, but it is worth it. I love the small class setting and the amount of one on one I have with professors. Also, the campus is small, which makes it feel safe and more like a community."
College Sophomore,5,"Well...I'm a part of it, so I'm a little bias (:"
College Freshman,5,The apartment off-campus are conveniently near the school so it helps with time and you have your own personal freedom area which is a huge plus.
College Freshman,5,Methodist is located on Ramsey St. and there are restaurants all along Ramsey St. There are so many options to choose from.
College Freshman,5,My school is the most strict about our honor code and drinking. We are an alcohol-free campus so drinking it not permitted. Methodist expects the students to respect the rules and follow the honor code to be the type of students we need to be.
College Freshman,5,My freshman year was helped a lot by my financial aid administration.
College Freshman,5,I don't live on campus but I love everyone there.
College Freshman,5,I love living In the forms!!
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is equal here no one bothers anyone else.
Recent Alumnus,5,Academics at MU are top knotch. The fact that we are a small university means that we have a bigger family atmosphere. Everyone else know everyone. The president of the university comes and has lunch with the students on a regular basics. Depending on your major the workload varies. If you choice the sciences you will be pretty busy but that's to be expected. Some of the arts keep you going but not as much. There is tons of student lead tutoring sessions in all subjects.  Methodist is simple put one of the greatest schools in the country and I am proud to call myself a Monarch.
Sophomore,4,"I stayed on campus my freshman year and I had a great experience meeting new people from all over the world and making many new friends. I liked that there’s a small number of students in each class, so that I could get more attention from my professors."
Sophomore,4,I would like the administration to not be so strict on residential students when it comes to visitors and for there to be more campus events
Sophomore,4,"I did take online classes for half of my spring semester, but this was due to the rising threat of the corona virus which forced schools to shut down and to begin virtual learning.  I had a great experience with this.  It was a situation where everyone was learning to adjust to the new learning system, the professors included.  Students and professors held each other accountable but understood there would be mistakes and rooms for improvement and that we needed to work with each other to get through the dilemma together."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Methodist University is that it reminds of the small town I grew up in when I lived in Middlesex, New Jersey.  Whether it is in class or I am participating on campus for school events, it is a personal experience and that I am not just another body in the school that goes unnoticed.  What I like the most is the small class sizes that gives the teacher the ability to help me out with class material one on one.  What I would like to see change at our school which is currently being talked about with our Student Government Association is the attendance policy.  For some classes you can only receive a handful of absences, no matter the reason why you missed class.  I believe this is unfair to students, especially with the threat of the corona virus, that there should be excused absences due to illness or inability to get to class due to physical injury or other valid reasons."
Freshman,4,"Methodist University has amazing faculty, but poor facilities for most parts of the school. It is slightly outdated and needs remodeling. But as far as academics goes, very very good."
Alum,4,Professors are amazing and professional. I have been inspired to gain my DPA in Public Administration and come back to instruct courses myself in hopefully 2-3 years
Sophomore,4,I like that it is a small campus with everything in walking distance. The classes are not packed with students so it is much easier to communicate with the professor. Its a pretty good though the food could be better.
Sophomore,4,Methodist University is a good campus and has a lot of outside the campus things to do. Methodist University isn't really a party campus since it is small and its doesn't serve any alcoholic beverages at sporting events.  I think that Methodist University would become a better campus if the staff or administration would have more entertaining experiences around the campus. My experience with athletics is that the teams are leaning towards the right direction into becoming a school that contends for conference championships in all sports.
Freshman,4,Very nice campus. Although its very expensive they give out lots of financial aid. Athletics are taken care of nicely and they also take care of the arts program. Overall a good school
Junior,4,"Methodist has an outstanding staff of professors and advisors that are readily available to assist their student body. The curriculum is challenging and engaging. I'd like to see improvements to the facilities and overall ""look and feel"" of the campus."
Graduate Student,4,The PA program works with the students.  They help students stay on task.  The program wants to ensure every student succeeds.
Junior,4,It has a small-school feel on campus with the degree offerings of a large university! It's been a great school and they're improving every year!
Niche User,4,"I plan to attend Methodist University, beginning the Fall 2019 semester.  I plan to major in education and will also play football.  I have visited several times and it seems like a great fit for me.  The campus is nice and there is a good amount of diversity on campus."
Sophomore,4,Methodist University is a wonderful school and has a great education program. Methodist offers great activities and a home atmosphere.
Freshman,4,"It’s an okay school, little to no party scene, the foods okay, but the dorms are pretty bad. Too expensive for what’s offered."
Sophomore,4,"Methodist is awesome. I love playing baseball and being apart of campus. Besides the food, and the freshman dorms, it is an awesome place to learn and meet new people."
Sophomore,4,There is so much involvement. Whether it be the professors doing their best to help students or the student sponsored activities. There is always something going on and there is something for everyone. Our international program fills the school with diversity. The one thing that I would like to change is having the library open later on Fridays. It's difficult to finish all of my homework for the weekend and make sure everything is printed by 6pm on Friday.
Senior,4,"I love the variety of opportunities available at MU, from Greek Life, to Religious Life, to athletics, to other clubs and organizations.  Diverse experiences are encouraged, and there's always something going on around campus."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Methodist University was very eye opening. Methodist was very diverse with many different races and cultures with their international program. Also I had to make college what it is, here's an example during the second semester of my freshman year there was not a lot of activity going on during campus so I called up a few friends to come and hangout."
Sophomore,4,"What I love about Methodist University is that it is a small University. Professors know their students on a more personal level and it makes it easier to build relationships and communication. I also love that the campus is beautiful and everything is together, its not all spread out. I feel safe here and the people are super friendly. I would like to see the parking change, there is limited parking and confusing hours as to where you can and can not park."
Freshman,4,It's a good school  for the local area. I'm not sure I would move a long ways to go to school here. Small classes make the learning environment a little easier. It's more personal with your processors which I enjoy.  It's not really  great for people who need daycare since there isn't one that's the only downside.
Sophomore,4,"I really liked my first year at Methodist University. The professors were all very friendly and helpful. My favorite part about Methodist is the small community feel, you could walk into a building and see someone you knew basically any time. What I'd like to see change is the food in the cafeteria. It wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't unbearable."
College Senior,4,Increasing with number of students
College Senior,4,improving more and more each year
College Senior,4,lots of one on one teacher student time
Recent Alumnus,4,"School has been a great experience for me although, there have been some challenges I have over come them and looking forward to graduating."
College Freshman,4,As someone going to play a sport I think the program is great
College Freshman,4,The sports teams are amazing
College Sophomore,4,i loved all my teachers but it gets harder after first semester
College Sophomore,4,`we do not have much crime because our campus is small and the school cops always on us about everything we do
College Freshman,4,Methodist University is a very organized and unique school. The professors know what they are doing and help when asked for help. I fell comfortable at that school and I am glad I do to this university.
College Freshman,4,Career/Services helps out in any way possible they are great!
College Freshman,4,Our athletics work very hard and they have won a lot of titles showing their hard work and dedication.
College Freshman,4,"I absoluely love Methodist University. I wouldn't want to go anywhere else, this place is my home."
College Freshman,4,I have no idea how gGreek life as I don't participate in it.
College Sophomore,4,"The students, staff, and faculty are extremely friendly and strive to help wherever help is needed. The curriculum is not as great as I imagined. The classroom settings were similar to high school classrooms, but the labs and the library were fantastic. The overall quality of this private university was similar to a public high school in a highly populated area."
College Sophomore,4,The opportunities available for students who wished to travel abroad or receive internships were decent. There are a number of career opportunities that this school offers.
College Sophomore,4,All sports teams are incredibly talented
College Freshman,4,I have not had a problem with any professor and they are always willing to help you out if you show them that you are trying. Some professors are my harsh with  grading than others but if you sit down and talk to them about it they will lead you right way.
College Freshman,4,"The career center helps students develop resumes, schedule job interviews, and also have practice interviews so you know what to say."
College Freshman,4,"I play lacrosse here and many students who have never seen a  lacrosse due to their school not having one, have come to the games and enjoyed them so they continue to come back. The intramural games are amazing. Everyone comes out to watch their respective area team to play. They are competitive and fair."
College Freshman,4,You have to make the most out of the school. This school is great but my experience here hasn't been the same due to my lack of inactivity in the different functions the school offers. This semester with me playing lacrosse school life has been better and the school is a place I enjoy being at. Also getting involved intramural sports and different clubs like FCA and SACC has made this semester tremendously better than the last. I have no doubt that next year when I return that my Methodist will be a great school for me.
College Junior,4,Most professors that I have had have been very hands on and easy to talk to. They really care about you receiving a quality education.
College Senior,4,The professors work explain very well. The registration process is well-orientated.
College Senior,4,"There are Phi, Alpha, Lambda, Pi, and Beta. They influence non-Greeks a lot by organizing activities that preaches how students must interact each other to build strong character and good personality"
College Senior,4,The athletic section on campus is good. There are good selections of different sport activities that students can check into.
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of apartments near campus that fit the college kid budget
College Sophomore,4,Cook out is always the way to go
College Sophomore,4,"They are good at what they do, and are pretty sympathetic."
College Sophomore,4,"If you need the money, Methodist will do almost anything to give it to you. They just take a VERY long time and you have to remind them often"
College Sophomore,4,"I have loved living on campus because the housing staff is beyond amazing. They're always there when you need them, the rooms are pretty manageable, the apartments are the only buildings that make going to class difficult, and the ability to hang out with your hall mates is super easy (:"
College Freshman,4,"The residence halls are not all great but the one that I personally lived in was very nice. I loved the amenities, the social atmosphere, the comfort and homey feeling. The housing process was not difficult at all however, the cost is relatively expensive since Methodist is a private school."
College Freshman,4,The off-campus dining is great.
College Freshman,4,"My financial aid is good except that it doesn't cover everything. For example, it doesn't cover summer classes and holiday housing."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is great as it is a good transition to maturity. I learn how to plan and do everything without my parents. In other words, it help me to be self-responsible and to make informed decisions."
College Sophomore,4,I live in the apartments and am satisfied!
College Freshman,4,There is apartments galore. Also sorority houses ??
College Sophomore,4,The RAs are trained on how to deal with all situations and campus security are quick to respond.
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of regulations and policies to help the students excel.
College Sophomore,4,The housing options are too small and the dorms are old. It is a good community. Really expensive school.
College Sophomore,2,All but one Residence hall are old and low grade.
College Freshman,2,"Methodist University is extremely high priced for the level of education you are getting. In my short time here my advisors have been terrible and pretty much forced me to transfer. Athletics aren't very good outside of the Golf teams, Lacrosse is a new program, I was recruited for lacrosse and played a year here, good atmosphere, good team, good skill level, not competitive enough. Food is pretty good usually, every now and then there is an off day. All and all its a pretty bad experience, really wish the school was more conservative with the number of conservatives that are on campus, but universities are all liberal now a days so what can you expect."
College Junior,2,"tiny school, very cliquey. It was like being in high school again. The football coaches recruited me and when I got to campus there was a freshman class of over 100. There were things I liked about the school but overall I didn't enjoy it."
College Freshman,2,The food is not that great. There needs to be better variety and better cooks.
College Sophomore,2,Never got it worked out.
College Sophomore,2,Not many parties at all.
College Sophomore,2,"The only healthy thing that I can eat in the dining hall is a salad. I usually go to a station with grilled meat to put on top, but they usually get mad when I just ask for a grilled meat and want me to get the sides as well."
College Sophomore,2,theyre pretty annoying and they once ticketed me for not having a parking pass and I had a pass.
College Sophomore,2,The area of Fayetteville is a base town. Lots of crime and nothing to do.
College Junior,2,"Methodist University changed their catering service at the beginning of Fall 2013 from Sodexo to Aramark. In the beginning, Aramark seemed to be doing well and we were quite pleased with the change. That was short-lived. They were trying to get good reviews then they started slacking and now the meals are monotonous. I eat in the cafeteria EVERYDAY, and sometimes I just grab a bowl of cereal and fruits for dinner, maybe a salad. You just get tired of the meals and they lose their novelty. There is a Chick-Fil-A upstairs in the Bern's Student Center and Provisions On Demand (POD) kiosk to buy snacks, frozen meals but nothing too exciting. Oh The Wedge is also available and they sell $10 salads that are not worth the price because they pretty much have what is in the cafeteria below with a few exceptions. People really do cookout runs at 1am because they're hungry."
College Junior,2,campus security is more worried about drinking and parking tickets than our actual safety. I once watched a car with no parking pass be waved onto campus by a security guard at 2:30 AM after sitting at the gate for ten minutes because they did not know how it worked.
College Junior,2,"very cliquey, and don't even get along with each other. They do not add to the family atmosphere that MU prides itself on"
College Sophomore,2,There isnt any unless a special event is going on.
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you know a friend with a car, can afford a taxi or are okay with risking your life on the public bus, you're not getting off campus."
College Junior,2,"we have Chick fil'a, we have a mcdonalds and starbucks."
College Sophomore,2,"Mass Communications at my school is pretty bad. We only have two professors and they are complete opposites of each other. The one literally teaches the same class through out all of his classes and tries to hard to relive his glory days and refuses to listen to students if their ideas or opinions don't match his own. The workload, for me is fairly easy. The facilities are outdated and our department chair has to constantly update things on his own without help from the school. Essentially our program is dying off and it's really sad. "
College Sophomore,2,"The weather at Fayetteville is almost always wacky. It rains one day, it's 80 degrees the next, then falls to 34 degrees. It's like it can't make up it's mind what season it wants to be or what temperature.  "
College Freshman,2,There is a lot to choose from but it is very expensive and they are not to far from the campus.
College Freshman,2,"It is average weather. It gets hot during summers, fall is nice and breezy, winter is cold lowest it gets is like 20 degrees Fahrenheit, and spring is nice and pleasing."
College Freshman,2,The buses do come to the university but the bus stop is far from the campus. It would be unsafe to ride the buses at night for students that do not have a car. The buses are dingy and old.
Freshman,1,"I personally dont like online classess, so I dont have a good comment on that. It was like most online classess but with most students not showing up."
Freshman,1,"If you are an international student. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. They do not care about their international students at all. They separate them from all the other students in one of the worst dorm as it is the only dorm covered by scholarship. Non of the international students like it and mostly regret coming there. The college is in middle of nowhere in a military town which nothing happens in there, and if you dont have a car you are stuck in campus. Students dont care about academics and even attend classes affected by drugs or just sleep in classess. You can find some nice professors but  thats the only good you will see in this Uni. There where cases of staff members gossiping about students and sharing their personal information with random students in their talks.  This place is awful and the scholarship is not worth the mental damage they do to you..."
Senior,1,If I could I would give out zero stars. Nobody in their right mind would come here. Whoever is writing all of those good reviews are ssilly.
Senior,1,Nobody wants to come here. Whoever is writing these reviews are idiots and silly. If I could give it zero stars I would.
College Junior,1,"they worry about silly things like visitation or legal aged students drinking, when there are real concerns like random people on campus, break ins, maintenance issues, and failing students"
College Junior,1,The parking here is horrible. They make you pay for a parking sticker $95 for a semester and $145 for the year and that does not guarantee you a parking spot. By 7:00 pm everyday all the parking spot are filled i literally have to drive around to find a parking spot that is not in front of my dorm. They also give out tickets for ANYTHING! As for commuters who are trying to find parks for class GOOD LUCK TRYING!
College Junior,1,i did not receive much financial aid at all! I thought i would get a lot more considering my circumstances. I have to submit the same paperwork every year which is a pain. The office is always pack and the waiting time is horrible .
College Junior,1,Being a Biology major is extremely hard.
College Freshman,1,"The showers were always dirty and I had clothes, shoes, school books and a IPOD stolen."
College Freshman,1,"The Cafeteria food was the worst. everyone warned me about gaining the freshmen 10, I lost 20 pounds because the food was so bad I refused to eat it. "
College Junior,1,"I used to go for the flavored waters. I am a commuter student though, therefore I do not eat in the caf often. I feel bad for students on campus who did, but there is little variety and the taste of the food has been below my standards the few times I have gone in there to eat. I hear next fall there will be a mongolian grill and some chick fil-a food and some Starbucks."
College Freshman,1,"Freshman dorms are awful, but upperclassman are nice"
College Freshman,1,"Extremely strict. No drugs or alcohol period, and it is heavily enforced"
College Sophomore,1,"Too Much Growth – 1. Residents parking is not commuter parking.
2. Commuters Parking is small and hard to find, come early commuters.
3. May have to walk but one parking lot has barely any students and faculty park in there."
College Junior,1,"The Small City of Fayetteville, NC – Methodist University is located in Fayetteville, NC which is a very small millitary city. Therefore traffic is always hectic and it would be impossible to try to walk from the school to anywhere."
College Sophomore,1,"None Noted – Haven't seen any transportation for anyone, not even handicapped students"
College Sophomore,1,"Speeding Is Not Control – Unfortunately, police are not strict on the speed limit inside campus. I see everyday students speeding where they should be slow driving. Students do not respect the crosswalk. I see police officers pass by and there is no actions by them."

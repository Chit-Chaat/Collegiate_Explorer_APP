Junior,5,The online experience at New College of Florida is highly organized and flows quite well. The professors were able to quickly adapt their classes to an online format and I've had not problems completing coursework.
Junior,5,"Great place to be a student, easy to adjust and lots of classes to take, very welcoming environment."
Niche User,5,"I loved New College! The atmosphere, small class sizes, the abundance of opportunity in academic research, and overall independence."
Senior,5,"Amazing faculty members and an innovative academic environment. I think I have learned not just to do well academically but also to thrive at NCF. The classes are intellectually stimulating, and professors have the goal of not just teaching students but to encourage them to face challenges and develop independently."
Niche User,5,"he first thing that i noticed was the beautiful and breathtaking campus. The ocean is literally right next to the campus along with gorgeous architecture of the former home of Charles Ringley. It was no surprise to hear that weddings, parties and many events are held at this mansion. I learned about the senior thesis that the undergraduates complete and how dedicated the school is to helping each student. I saw many student projects on campus such as the self run student cafe and many cool sculptures. New college of florida emphasis its unique and untraditional school system as students get one month off in january to work on a project related to their major and their thesis. Another very appealing thing to me about the lack of tradition in new college of florida is that students are free to wear whatever they want to for graduation."
Junior,5,"NCF is a safe space. Most anyone that feels disconnected or ostracized from their community will find a family at New.
The food sucks, but there's tons of cheap, local options near by (but you definitely need a car to get there). 
Party scene is pretty active. The police will not mess with you for minor stuff (drinking/smoking), especially in dorms (though there does seem to be some racial profiling by officers). 
Academics are outstanding. Professors are helpful and compassionate. You quickly build relationships with teachers since classes are small.
There seems to be a lot of disconnect between administration and students regarding NCF's future. Lots of students want to maintain the (counter-)culture of New (which you will understand once you get here) while admin is moving in a different direction."
Freshman,5,"Very inclusive, welcoming. Small class sizes allow for a lot of specialized help and attention. Lots of opportunities for students design their own curriculum and pursue what they are passionate about."
Alum,5,"If you are especially self-motivated, this could be the place for you.  If is often a feeder school to the best graduate schools in the country, and the lack of grades allows you to focus of academics, and not a 4.0 grading system.  It has a beautiful campus on the bay of Sarasota, a 15 minutes drive to the pristine beaches of the ocean.  The academic program focuses on written narratives from the professors that attempt to communicate an improvement in the quality of the students work, culminating in a senior thesis.  Many pre-med/business/law/PhD students get into their first choice of grad. school, & even out of state students are eligible to qualify for in-state tuition after the first year, meaning you are unlikely to leave with a high debt level.  When I was there I was not so happy with the rigorist program, but 20/20 hindsight made me appreciate more fully what the college offered me."
Junior,5,"There is no other school that I would have learned as much in every way. The professors are amazing, classes are small, rigorous and engaging. This is a school for brilliant passionate sometimes quirky, always engaged students. It’s not for everyone. You need to be self motivated and willing to put in the time.  The community is accepting, liberal and passionate about every aspect of social justice. I have met some of the most amazing peers here, and so much less hypocrisy and privilege than my friends at other schools complain about. I turned down Penn, Amherst etc to come here and comparing my education and life to my former classmates I have zero regrets. I expect to be competitive for an elite fellowship overseas followed by attending a top tier law school. More than that, I have grown immeasurably as a person."
Junior,5,"I am so glad I chose to attend NCF. The professors are amazing and the classes are intellectually stimulating. The course load is intense and I know I have had to read more academically and write more essays than my friends who attend UF and FSU (I cannot speak on behalf of all majors of course). But I'm grateful for this and I feel well prepared for graduate school.

I was worried when I first came her that the atmosphere would feel toxic because of other reviews, but in my experience if you are polite and respectful you can have many interesting, stimulating, and eye opening conversations with all members of the student body. Just maybe not on the Forum."
Alum,5,"I can't imagine a better school for me than New College. I went to two other colleges beforehand and neither of them can compare. The self oriented nature of the school is amazing (if you are self motivated, I've seen brilliant minds flounder here because they couldn't handle its mixture of freedom and rigor). The level of undergraduate thesis's produced here is truly impressive, some of the work my peers were doing my final year was absolutely top notch. My friend wrote an english thesis on the On the Temporal Effects of Colonialism in the Epic, another wrote a math thesis titled 'The Stability of Theories from Categoricity to their Spectrum'. Right now I'm working on publishing the results of mine. 

The entire experience from start to finish was incredibly fulfilling. I feel like I've come out the other end a whole person.

Also B Dorm is sick. It's where New College's hottest redneck intellectuals congregate to split dip and share ideas."
Sophomore,5,"New College provides the perfect environment for individuals who truly care about their learning. It is very independent and lenient. The social scene and size of student body could be better, as well as diversity."
Sophomore,5,"New College of Florida is the best college for those who are actually interested in learning the material, rather than getting an easy A and moving on. The amount of students in each class is fairly small which allows for great seminar discussions on the readings we're assigned. The professors are also very considerate and appreciate actually interacting with students one-on-one. We have a really helpful Writing Resource Center where students who have taken Pedagogy in Practice are assigned as Student Writing Assistants; this helps students feel a lot more comfortable with sharing their writing because the SWAs are students too. Our Counseling and Wellness Center is so helpful for both physical and emotional concerns- they were actually part of the reason I made it through this year, the other part were the professors. There is also a huge LGBT+ and body positive vibe/culture at NCF that allows both students and professors to really be themselves."
Alum,5,"I can't imagine having gotten a better undergraduate education anywhere else! Sarasota is a warm beachside city with plenty of great shops and restaurants, and New College's beautiful campus sits right on the bay. Class sizes are small, education is individualized, and the narrative evaluation system keeps the coursework very rigorous. New College students work hard and play hard!"
Alum,5,"New College was a terrific education, and the personal relationships I developed with my professors resulted in letters of recommendation that launched my graduate work at Stanford and Harvard. After I received my PhD I came back and taught a course at New College just for fun and it was so rewarding to see the other side of the educational process there. I highly recommend this school for intellectually curious students who want to be challenged to grow beyond what they thought possible. In terms of my career path and return on investment, I received scholarships and graduated debt free and now have a job where I use my degree and skills and live (very) comfortably. "
Graduate Student,5,I highly recommend this school.  It has small class sizes and professors encourage students to come talk to them about anything that would help them succeed in their classes.  Written evaluations are great because students get to know exactly how they need to improve regardless of what level they are at. It's a great personal touch and much more useful than letter grades.
College Sophomore,5,my experience with the classes and professors is nearly immaculate
College Senior,5,"There really are no groups like this. LLCs are closest, and that's whatever."
College Sophomore,5,"Professors are almost all great, especially in the sciences. Class styles make sense and are rigorous, so I learn a lot."
College Freshman,5,"I really enjoy attending this institution, and would highly recommend it for anyone who really wants a sense of community. It is very liberal, and you have to be pretty open minded to go here, but other than that, there really is a niche for everyone. The professors and academics are really nice, and not having grades really makes for a different education."
College Sophomore,5,"New College is very safe, and they provide endless resources to help students remain healthy and safe on campus. This is something we do very well."
College Freshman,5,"This college is everything I was looking for. Academically rigorous, with teachers who care about and are knowledgeable in their subjects and who genuinely care about students' ambitions and will assist them in their goals. Socially open, with virtually all students friendly, intelligent, introspective, passionate about learning and goal-driven. Plenty of class options as well as capability of students to design learning opportunities for themselves, including traveling and studying abroad or interning locally, out-of-state or even internationally. Definitely prepares students for success in the real world, much more so than any other college I considered."
College Freshman,5,We are very weird and unique but when we come out to play it's all fun and friendly and you can do whatever you want with no judgement.
College Freshman,5,"There isn't any greek life on campus. And most people like it that way. Alcohol is plentiful and there is no pressure to drink, parties are to be had but there isn't a history of sexual coercion. A lot ofFolks here flipped when someone dared to suggest the idea of bringing Greek life to NCF."
College Freshman,5,"we have almost no sports except for the sail team. People play basketball and court soccer casually, but its more drunk athletics than true competition!"
College Freshman,5,"The parties are more like raves then uncomfortable binge drinking. It's a very safe environment for doing drugs and drinking though, and it seems like people look out for each other if they've had too much, which allows people to really let loose and go hard on the weekend nights."
College Freshman,5,"I think it's beautiful, some of it's a tad expensive due to the area, there are serveral activities, lots of movie theaters, mini-golf, shopping, local attitude seems nice - you just need a car to get to a lot of these things."
College Freshman,5,"I haven't had an internship but they are focused on here, it's important to have one, so yes, I plan to have one eventually. No concern, they seem to have a pretty concise list. Majors here seem to be pretty tailered to the individuals, double majoring is pretty easy from what I've seen. Requirements for Humanities and Social Science majors seem pretty reasonable, Nat Sci classes have a lot more requirements. On the up side, the general requirements are fairly non-existant (chances are that you'll meet all the requirements by the end of four years without even trying) and math is not a requirement unless it's in your major :D"
College Freshman,5,"I brought alarms for doors to the dorm when I moved in because I'm paranoid, I wound up feeling so safe and have continuously throughout the semester that I haven't even bothered to install them. I never would have expected to feel comfortable walking from the library back to my dorm alone at night, but I do. You pretty much know everyone on campus which really helps."
College Freshman,5,The campus is not very strict at all. If you are responsibly drinking you should not have any trouble.
College Freshman,5,"I believe this campus is incredibly safe. The campus police have a strong presence and the relationship between them and the students is strong. We have emergency call boxes all around campus, and if you need an escort to your dorm room you can use them to get one."
College Junior,5,"For Chemistry, registering for any class is easy as classes are often never capped. I have found it easy to get into any of my classes, the workload has been quite heavy (especially for Advanced Organic Chemistry) but manageable, and the curriculum was deep and extensive. Facilities were adequate for all of them, though we could have made use of a bigger room for Organic I and II. Job opportunities for chemistry are great - my advisor has provided a steady stream of internships that have boosted my CV - an NSF-funded and a different NIH-funded internship over the past two summers.

Computer science has also provided me with many internship opportunities, and real life programming opportunities with local and out-of-state firms, like Star2Star Communications and the Mind Research Network. The curriculum has been very challenging, and the workload heavy, but not as extensive as I'd like. We do not have sufficient facilities for distributed computing on campus, but we do have enough for small programming projects."
College Junior,5,"Don't let the lack of grades fool you - the classes are extremely challenging, work loads can be massive, and a lot of people crumble under the stress. The professors are demanding, some are intimidating, but ultimately almost all of them are very approachable and will talk with you for hours about the subject because of the intense love for their work. I am proud to call this college my choice due to the strength of the professors and the depth of their material. Curricula tend to be extensive. Registration can be difficult for classes that are capped low (this is a particular problem in Anthropology courses), and it is difficult to know far in advance what classes will be offered in the future, but overall the system works well and registering is as easy as showing up on the first day of class, deciding that you like it and telling your advisor about it, then signing a contract saying that you will stay in that class all semester. If you can't handle the pressure, you can renegotiate the contract and drop the class, or change to a different level - it's all tailored to the individual."
College Junior,5,"We don't really have any varsity teams, the only teams that compete outside of our own school are fencing and sailing, and even those do so sparingly. We do not have much of a school sport culture. However, the flag football team has been gaining traction over the past few years."
College Junior,5,"The library is very well set up and has plenty of resources and study spots, and I quite enjoy the campus atmosphere. Walking down the path to the bay going to class every day is a beautiful sight; it cheers me up every day. We don't have much of an athletic center, but it's enough for my fencing team. There's plenty of green spaces on campus since a lot of space is undeveloped. Unfortunately our current dining provider is one of the worst in the country, but this may change once the shift in dining happens at the start of the coming Fall semester."
College Junior,5,"I love it to bits. Thanks to being in computer science and chemistry, I've had a thesis project lined up since the end of my first year, and I've gotten into internships at the National Institutes of Health without breaking a sweat due to the connections my advisor has with other universities. I am very happy with the opportunities I have. The workload is tough, and the curriculum is extensive, especially after the new computer science requirements, but the classes are interesting (I loved Advanced Organic Chemistry), and I've learned a lot from them. The facilities are a bit cramped due to us being a fairly small school, but small class sizes means there's been plenty of room as soon as I got into more advanced classes than Organic I."
College Junior,5,"The buses don't run past 6, and neither do most restaurants on town. The food is amazing though, especially Yummy House, Pho Cali and Queen of Sheba. Absolutely fantastic stuff."
College Junior,5,"People on campus are quite attractive overall, and some of the most clever people I've ever met are on this campus. A quite vibrant community, really."
College Junior,5,Well the airport IS within walking distance.
College Junior,5,I did an internship during ISP and was able to continue it 2nd semester.
College Junior,5,This is the sunshine state after all
College Junior,5,"It's college, kids experiment. Students tend to look out for each other."
College Junior,5,You can create your own major!
College Junior,5,"Houses are passed down from generation to generation. Some well known ones are: Jungle House, Bayshore House, Pup Haus, Maps House, and Flop House"
College Junior,5,My experience at new college has been insane... I could have never conceived the opportunities New College would offer me before coming here. It's a microcosm of the American youth.
College Junior,5,"As a former RA, New College housing is very... unique. Pei is super cool. The letter dorms are nice but over-priced. B-Dorm is where all the cool kids live."
College Junior,5,"As somebody who has thrown a PCP, the night life is completely up to the students' creativity and desire. If you want a cool underground band/musician to play, get the SAC to fund them. If you want to throw a rave in your dorm room, ask your neighbor or the EQTA's to borrow their laser and sound system. If you want to build a giant tent fort in the dorms and watch movies inside, you can do that. Basically the sky is the limit. However, I've noticed a general lack of creativity amongst New College students lately. I heard it has to do with wifi and cellphones radiating our brains... but who knows ; )"
College Junior,5,"My field of study is Chemistry/Computational Science. I'm overall satisfied with my major, but I wish we had more/varied computer science courses. I came to NCF in a time between computer science professors so things have been a bit rough on that end, but we now have a tenure-track professor and will soon be getting another- making this much less of an issue for future students interested in programming. On the chemistry side, all the faculty are extremely competent and I couldn't have asked for better professors. In fact, the reason I switched from biology had to do in large part with encouragement from my chemistry professors and the fascinating world of molecules that they revealed to me. I plan to work for a few years before enrolling in grad school, relying on my thesis, projects, and letters of recommendation to get me in. New College alums have a phenomenal acceptance rate into graduate schools so I am not extremely worried on that end. My field is a bit ambiguous and the job I take will depend on the topic/success of my thesis and what graduate program I enter into."
College Junior,5,"New College doesn't really have different Major ""programs."" You declare your Area of Concentration (major) during first semester of third year either from the suggested majors or by making your own based on curriculum from other colleges. Your advising professor and at least one other professor for your field of study must approve whatever major you choose, which means that ""Master of Underwater Basket Weaving"" isn't going to fly. However, it does allow for combinations and specializations that you'd be hard-pressed to find elsewhere, such as Chemistry/Classics and Music/Biology. Of course all the normal liberal arts majors are supported and you won't be scoffed at for following a standard class progression- if anything your life will be easier and involve less scrambling to meet niche requirements."
College Junior,5,"The New College of Florida has unparalleled academic opportunities for those willing to work for them. Unlike most other undergrad programs, New College puts you in direct contact with your professors- who actively encourage you to visit them to talk about the classes and possible projects. If you have a dream, New College will work with you to make it happen. There are a lot of stories of this on the NCF website and they're anything but uncommon among students. Having written evaluations rather than grades takes a lot of stress out of the courses and encourages students to take classes that would normally fall outside their comfort zone. Professors will write truthfully about your participation and exam scores, though, so don't think you can just slack off. As an honors college, the curriculum is generally a cut above what you'd normally expect and frequent essays, class presentations, and mountains of problem sets are a fact of life. All graduating students must write a thesis relevant to their area of concentration (major) which is strictly judged by your professors. The stress and workload of fourth year is a well-known endeavor which shouldn't be taken lightly."
College Junior,5,New College is a fairly inexpensive school for in-state students and has great value for the amount you pay. NCF provides some scholarships itself and also qualifies for bright futures and Florida Prepaid. There are also some scholarships given out by the student body to help enrolled students who are in need.
College Freshman,5,"If you feel unaccepted or like a 'freak' come to New College. 
This school is very very accepting of people from all over, with different sexual orientations, and if New College has one thing, its diversity. Because of just how much diversity we have in our school, we are very careful and caring I would say. The faculty stress acceptance as our schools motto and this is one of the things that makes us truly unique. New College: where all of the smart outcasts arrive to thrive. "
College Freshman,5,"This school is the best thing that has ever happened to me. It is very difficult to explain but the people, staff and even the actually physical part of campus is just wonderful. This school encompasses an energy of eagerness that oozes off of the students and staff. I have felt truly re-inspired after feeling as though my life energy was drained so much during my high school experience. My first day of classes at New College had me writing essay on topics I was passionate about and getting feedback immediately. 
The best thing about my school?? The lack of a systemized, lingering grading system. If you did terribly at the beginning of the semester and improved dramatically towards the end your grad will not suffer. New College is a pass fail system. In the situation I just described, the professor would most likely pass that student as they had showed improvement and effort. This means that the issues that you have in class, but work on to overcome will not forever haunt you. I never believed in the grading system of American high schools. I do not believe that this is a good environment to learn anything, and therefore I am so grateful for New College of Florida.  "
College Freshman,5,"The energy on campus is like nothing I have ever experienced. I believe college to be, not a means of getting a better job, but a chance to find yourself, find good friends and expand your mind. If you are a person who believes the same thing then I urge you to come to New College of Florida where I finally FEEL INSPIRED again! This school is unique, because it knows how to teach people. It is hard work a lot of the time but I want to be here, and everyone else here wants to be here too! It makes for a wonderful place to learn."
College Freshman,5,You're an adult and they give you the freedom of one. It's one of my favorite things about the school. Even at 4 in the AM you can see people wandering around and studying and stuff like that
College Junior,5,All PhD professors who are passionate and driven to help students succeed. The work load overall is very heavy but students design their own course load and schedule so you only ever tackle what you know you can handle. 
Recent Alumnus,5,"The psychology program is great. All the professors are really knowledgable and helpful. It's very research driven and you get ample opportunity to do your own projects and learn how to write research reports. However, because of the size, it lacks the impressive lab facilities large universities can offer. But that is offset by the attention you get and freedom to pursue your own research, rather than having to do whatever the lab director decides."
Recent Alumnus,5,"It's really challenging, but really rewarding. Professors are great teachers and very accessible. You can literally study anything because you can make you're own independent study classes."
Recent Alumnus,5,"People are independent and laid back. Mostly hippies and hipsters though. Very small, intimate community. Make some of the best friends of your life."
College Sophomore,5,"If you are motivated and dislike the degree-mill system, then this place is for you. I am a self proclaimed Bioinformatics AOC, and I have had no trouble finding internships in the field. I get a lot of personal attention from my professors."
Junior,4,Great for students looking for small classes and rigorous academics with a focus on independence and personal achievement.
Senior,4,"New College has changed my life for the better. I feel a more well rounded person because of it. If I had the option, I would stay four more years."
Sophomore,4,"New College of Florida is a very affordable in-state option for Florida students. It is smaller than the usual university, but the professors are very involved and there is room to build relationships with them. If you live in the local area, it is a great place to commute to like myself, but if you live on campus, it seems to be a bit pricey for the housing and food options. There have been problems with mold in the affordable dorms and a number have been closed. There is really only 1 place to eat on campus and the options are limited... and often disappointing. The student experience for social life is mixed. If you are't the ""typical"" student, then you may feel left out and even demonized. This is more the student body's fault rather than the  faculty's. 
TL;DR - GREAT academics and one-on-one experience, but campus life can be disappointing and the student community  can be a bit toxic."
Sophomore,4,"For academics, New College is one of the best places to go. The professors will know you and you can take classes you want or make your own classes. Nevertheless, it is a small school and therefore some aspects are lacking."
Niche User,4,The new college of Florida contacted me for a marine biology program they have there. I was very interested and hope to tour the campus soon. They have amazing teachers as I have seen and wish they would accept me into the program.
Sophomore,4,"New College has one of the most incredible social atmospheres that I have heard of in a college. The student body is small, and the school works to foster a sense of connectedness and community both within the school and within the local area. The biggest downfall is a lack of organization that makes it difficult to function at peak capacity, and a desire to expand with no real plan to support a higher number of incoming students."
Sophomore,4,"The student life and course selection is very well put together. I'm able to take the courses I am interested in and meet so many new people who make each day that much more bearable. Although the campus is not in a new design, it is still pleasing to look at - especially as you walk down to the bay."
Freshman,4,"New College is a very unique school; I love it here. I believe it is a very different experience here than at other colleges in both the academic world and the social sphere. I wish there was more tolerance of beliefs that do not align with the traditional young college liberal ideas; before I came here I considered myself a progressive liberal, although after living here for 6 months it is obvious that the political awareness on campus is directed towards social injustices in America. This may sound like it is not problematic, but the attitudes here are extreme. I have known friends who are people of color (Hispanic) and have been ostracized for straightening their hair and ""denying their heritage."" On the other hand, I have developed a close group of friends and am very happy with all the great people and interesting characters I've met."
Sophomore,4,"The small campus lends a great feel to the whole experience, from social to academic. If you want to know everyone you see this is the college for you."
Freshman,4,"The academics are great. There's also research opportunities if you are passionate about it. 

The party scene at New is decent. Big parties are held in public areas, so the atmosphere seems safer. Substances on campus are adundant. There's a ton of safety resources. We have an amnesty clause that makes sure no student is disciplined for getting help.  Talks are held about drug safety, especially for people who may experiment. 

The downsides: New is a great school for people who are very passionate about one/a few topics. It's not great for people who haven't figured out what they want to do. I knew people who came here because they didn't have to choose a major right away. They had a hard time and most transferred. Also the classes are hard. You have to be interested in the topic to be willing to put in the work."
Junior,4,"New College of Florida welcomes diversity, passion, and individuality. It allows you to tailor your education to your specific needs, and choose your own path to your degree. The narrative evaluation system allows you to be judged not based on the performance of other people, but on your own progress. The small size of the school allows each student to be given individual attention from professors and staff. The academics are challenging, and engaging. It's a good school to attend if you like learning!"
Sophomore,4,"New College of Florida is a really small school. With under 1000 students,  it is possible to form close, personal relationships with professors and advisors. These tight bonds lead to incredible opportunities that aren't always available at large schools. However, the small size also presents some disadvantages. Although the connections are very personable, unfortunately they are not quite at plentiful. "
Freshman,4,The people are super friendly . There's a lot of good resources on campus if you're willing to go and find them. CEO building has a new program called a life couch program. Its quite useful for a first year.  
College Sophomore,4,I truly believe that anyone that is familiar and understands the school understands its great value as a school
College Sophomore,4,"The school is amazing however, there needs to be more and better housing as well as more students to help dilute some of the extremism that is prominent at New"
College Sophomore,4,"New cCollege has nearly no assault and the one time I was close enough to witness the process, it was taken very seriously, though not as quickly as it should have been"
College Senior,4,Not much to say for NCF sports?
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of opportunity to use connections the school has to obtain internships, and to get job and internship advice from professors."
College Sophomore,4,"It's great, but it still has a way to go. While it's strong with LGBT diversity and acceptance, there are still several flaws with the administration treating students who identify as a sexual minority. Racial diversity is severely lacking and that is one of my biggest issues with the school."
College Sophomore,4,"The courses are so wonderful and unique as they're classes professors want to teach. However, it doesn't get 5 stars because many courses are only offered once every 2-3 years, which sucks. Class styles are really interesting, and small class sizes are good, until you have 60 kids wanting to take an intro course with one professor who caps the class at 20. The rating would be higher if they hired more professors to offer multiple sections of introductory courses."
College Sophomore,4,"My experience with New College has been really good. It was my first choice school when I applied and I can't imagine being anywhere else. However, like all good things, New College has some flaws that need to be tweaked. Our campus is very accepting of LGBTQ+ identifying individuals, yet administration still does problematic things like not referring to students by preferred names, pronouns, and using legal names for emails. There are issues of lack of diversity on campus and an obnoxiously prominent substance culture"
College Junior,4,People have high opinions of NCF.
College Junior,4,It's what you make of it.
College Sophomore,4,My overall experience at New College is really great. I feel as if I am getting a quality education for an affordable price. I'm quite happy that I decided to come here.
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus is great. I really enjoy the social climate here. However, housing is becoming more and more prevalent as the years go on. It's almost as if housing is acting as a police force, and that makes many students uncomfortable."
College Sophomore,4,"New College is very unique. I am glad that I chose New College because I fit in here, but I have several friends that are unhappy with the school because they don't fit into the social climate. It's not for everyone, but it is for me. I feel as if I am being adequately challenged here. Besides, you can't beat this price for a liberal arts education."
College Freshman,4,"The athletics are small (as appropriate for an 800-student college) but generally good quality. Students are capable of running ball games with sufficient gear, and there is plenty of grassy space for games. There is very little sports competition."
College Freshman,4,"The professors are mostly great.  They are knowledgable and approachable.  I wish there were more times and and availability of classes, but it's a small school so there aren't.  I enjoy the small size of classes."
College Junior,4,Some things could be better but I like it enough.
College Freshman,4,"I'm very happy here. My one anger is that the courses offered are only once or twice while I'm at New College, so I have to scramble to take the class I must take for major."
College Freshman,4,"New College is definitely not for everyone- the classes can be extremely rough and demanding, the climate can be aggressively liberal, and the entire layout of the school's academics is different than any other institution; however, I wouldn't want to attend school anywhere else. If you are a minority in any way, whether it be race, gender, or sexuality, you will find acceptance and love at this campus. The people are generally very nice, but some can be unforgiving if you say something they deem to be offensive, but the best thing to do is to admit you were wrong and ask how to gain more knowledge on the subject. This school academically is widely respected. The courses offered are really interesting and challenging. Many people transfer in their first semster of freshman year because the academics are very rigorous, but professors are very understanding and just want to help. One of my favorite parts of New college is the free counseling service available on campus (this school is  very good about mental health and there is no stigma associated with mental health problems here on campus). The counsling services are really good and many students use them. Overall I've been really happy so far."
College Freshman,4,"The school is pretty lenient when it comes to drug and alcohol policy, which is good, but there is a currently a task force that is reviewing the drug and alcohol policy due to recent events. Things should be somewhat different next year, if not drastically different (which i doubt)."
College Freshman,4,"The school actually tries pretty hard to get everyone the financial aid that they need. It's very nice in that respect. I haven't had much interaction with the financial aid office though, so I can't say much."
College Freshman,4,Policies are very lax and many people experiment with substances.
College Freshman,4,"most in-state students get bright futures and incoming freshman get another merit based scholarship. I'm getting about 6k in scholarship money from the school. On top of that, the buisiness office does a good job of working with outside scholarship things, like the office of vocational rehabilitation."
College Freshman,4,"The rooms are really quite large, larger than any other rooms I saw on campus tours. Many first year rooms in Pei have a porch or balcony, and it's quite comfortable even with 3 people (chances are you'll be tripled as an incoming student). The community is great though there is a ton of smoking, so if you have asthma, the doors are not insulated and it will come in - this is something that's an issue for me. I can't speak for the upper year dorms though apartment style living is availble by second year and occasionally for first years."
College Freshman,4,"They seem to be pretty reasonable - they will answer your calls promptly and they just try to make everyone safe. You never really see them around the dorms so they're pretty lenient, they do patroll around campus, just for safety."
College Freshman,4,"If you like that kind of thing...personally it's just a bunch of smoking in a ring, some dancing, alcohol all to incredibly loud music. There are parties pretty much from Thurday to Saturday every night with the occasional one on a Tuesday. I'm not part of the crowd that attends walls (the names for parties) so I can't vouch for 'quality'."
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of options for off-campus dining. You can get food at almost any time of day. There is even barbeque at the gas station right next to campus. There are plenty of places to choose from.
College Freshman,4,"I have lived in Sarasota much of my life. The beaches are beautiful and there are a lot of events that happen downtown. If you like nature there are a lot of things to do outdoors around campus, and the bus system is really reliable."
College Sophomore,4,"The off-campus dining is pretty varied, with options ranging from Thai to Indian to seafood to Mexican. That being said, most Sarasota restaurants are pricey and so going off-campus to eat is generally not a regular thing. There are a fair amount of fast food restaurants within close driving distance, and a few student-friendly establishments."
College Junior,4,"Most of us are white Floridians, however, the diversity in sexual orientation, gender identity and political views can be quite striking."
College Sophomore,4,"Every Friday and Saturday, we have a party at Palm Court called the ""Wall"" - it's a hit-or-miss. Most of the times it's great."
College Junior,4,"Compared to other schools, our parking situation is great."
College Junior,4,My internship was great. I was able to do it because of ISP.
College Junior,4,love it! I've gotten 3 paid summer-internships!
College Junior,4,"Rideshares, free bus pass, bikeshare etc"
College Junior,4,"Security is pretty good. Bikes get stolen occasionally... But New College students are very honest and well-intentioned. My friend lost 50$ and had it returned to him! I've lost my id 3 times and had it put in my mailbox! Students usually request personal property, unless it is tasty curry left in the communal kitchen (somebody is going to take that!)."
College Junior,4,"Housing at New College is pretty decent. Our rooms are larger than average and most are pleasant to live in. There are four housing options at NCF: Pei dorms, Letter Dorms, Dort/Goldstein, and B Dorm. The Pei dorms are usually reserved for first years and each of its three courts has its own unique community and personality. The letter dorms are more quiet, spacious, and the newest housing option available. Dort and Goldstein have large common rooms and a kitchen with a stove, fridge, microwave, and sink. B dorm is old and run-down but also cheap and has a strong community- or a lot of bitter thesis students- depending on the year. NCF allows mixed housing and every residence except pei has separate rooms for its occupants (either apartment-style single or with a shared common room). There are also a limited number of studio singles available in the letter dorms."
College Junior,4,"There is an airport (SRQ) bordering campus which makes long distance travel fairly convenient. It is usually easy to get rides to local destinations from other students. There is a bus line that stops by campus which is free to use for NCF students, most people just ride-share though."
College Junior,4,"Students don't get school health insurance but the wellness center is open every day of the week and it is fairly easy to get an appointment. They can't fix a broken arm or put you under the knife, but they will give free medical advise and can prescribe medication. There is also counseling available to students who request it."
College Junior,4,"New College tends to gather people who feel very strongly about diversity, acceptance, and feminism. This generally makes for a environment truly without walls where any forms of discrimination are quickly condemned and the offenders harshly judged. Sometimes, though, the student body can be a bit overzealous and blow events out of proportion. It's a very controversial topic and people have a wide range of opinions on the matter."
College Junior,4,"The vast majority of parties stay on campus. Every Friday and Saturday there is a themed party called a 'Wall"" which often involves costumes or decorations. These events are great for new students trying to find friends and have a good time. Older students usually attend walls semi-frequently to blow off steam and recover from a particularly tough week. There are plenty of non-wall-goers so if parties aren't really your thing you'll still find plenty to do.  Drinking isn't strictly regulated and there are no rules against having alcohol in dorms. However, underaged drinking is still very illegal and persons under 21 should weight the risks and rewards of such drinking carefully rather than blindly relying on the school's free-going attitude to protect you. The palm court parties (PCPs) are tri-annual themed parties that are funded by the school and are usually quite elaborate. They attract friends from beyond New College and are typically the liveliest nights of the year.

All this being said, New College is not a party school and if your aim is to get stoned every day and smashed each night- you'll find yourself at odds. Partying is generally done only on the weekends with very few exceptions. Making a ruckus during the middle of the week when others are trying to study is unanimously frowned upon."
College Freshman,4,There's a reason this school's consistently ranked as a Best Value.
College Sophomore,4,"I was looking for a school with no emphasis on sports, and I found it."
College Sophomore,4,"As far as sexual orientation and LGBTQ life, students are very diverse and accepting. The population is mostly white, middle-class, but minorities are respected and accepted for the most part."
College Sophomore,4,Off-campus dining almost makes up for how awful on-campus dining is.
College Sophomore,4,"It's very hot during the beginning and end of the school year, but there's lots of sunshine year round. When it rains, it pours (making some of the tiles life-threatening)"
College Freshman,4,"I am pleased with the priorities that my school has in place. They are not a campus that monitors everyone who enters onto campus (therefore visitors are welcomed) but they are very strict when it comes to anything that can affect peoples safety. They seem to realize what is useful to intervene in and what should be left alone, for now."
College Freshman,4,I am only a first year at New College and I cannot say that I can answer this question well as I am not in a specific program as of just yet. 
Sophomore,2,"This school has a ridiculous habit of escalating situations dramatically and rapidly.  Students form cult like clicks, and if you anger anyone of their members its over for you.  The school only supports this by forcing therapy and mandated group mediation down your throat.  Within 2 years here I have been constantly outlasted and aggressively attacked for pointing out when I myself have been treated unfairly.   Academics are great, but student life is an unbearable cycle of beating attacked and fighting just to be left alone for a few days.  
The drug culture is dangerous, but hey what else do you have to do on campus!"
Freshman,2,"The academics and professors are great at new college, but the campus is in shambles. Almost everyone who lives on campus has something wrong with their dorm room that the college will not fix."
Freshman,2,"Oh, New College. So much potential yet so problematic. Pros: academic freedom + ISP opportunities, engaging classes, kind and approachable professors, gorgeous bayfront, affordable. Cons: lack of racial diversity (isolating as a POC), lack of food options (RIP 4Winds), boring campus with ugly buildings besides CHL, inconvenient location (only airport & Shell nearby), overrated party scene, terrible student life in general. Tip: Bring a car and explore downtown Sarasota, or even St.Pete/Tampa. I would've lost my mind if I hadn't brought mine. If you want to attend a hippie haven that doesn't prepare you for the real world, come to New College. NCF really isn't for everyone... some bloom, some suffocate. I can't endure another year here."
Sophomore,2,"the housing is horrible. there is mold, water damage, and flooding (in the dorm and the entire campus) many of the pei dorms have small crevices were covered in dust and dead insects, even on the first day. the campus pretty much the same everything is basically rundown from underfunding. while i the professors are great, the rest of the staff is incredibly underwhelming. while this school claims to be very lenient on deadlines and very flexible and relaxed,there are many issues with the bureaucracy, mainly financial aid. the school claims to care for their students but they dont. My roomate, one of the top math students, was threatened to get kicked out due to some financial aid typo. I had many issues with receiving disability accommodations and having them be respected by my professors. while the LGBTQ+ community is vry large and well treated at the school there is not much diversity in ethnicity/ race but also in mindset. student life sucks. overall, I am glad I left this school."
Sophomore,2,"It's difficult to gauge your own progress because there are no grades. The students have an odd culture and can be very judgmental. The teachers, for the most part, seem to be very good. There are no sports. The dorms are very bad. There is very little to do in the surrounding area."
Niche User,2,"The social experiment that is New College has a multitude of flaws. For starters, there is a severe lack of interest by faculty and staff regarding college safety; the number of sexual assaults that were actually reported in 2008-2009 were met with dismissal and overall ignorance. Disgusting. The curriculum, however ""diverse"" it claims to be, is in fact incredibly narrow for freshman students (almost every class that can be considered a ""core-requirement"" for a major is intended for upper-level classmen). To top it all off, the grading system is pass/fail, meaning the success or failure of the individual student is entirely subjective to the personalized method of the professor. You want to go party? By all means, go to New College. You want an actual education that can lead to larger job opportunities? Go elsewhere."
Alum,2,"New College is definitely a place for select individuals. I highly suggest taking a tour of campus and, if at all possible, get to know some of the students at the school before attending. They say that they are a very diverse campus, but they really aren't a diverse campus. They just attract individuals with diverse lifestyle choices."
Niche User,2,"I absolutely hated it here.  The ""no grades"" gimmick attarcted me because I believed the campus would be one that inspired creativity and learning.  However, despite all of the individuality the school claimed to support, I felt the entire school experience was like living in a bubble.  With only a few hundred students attending, it was very easy to stand out if you did not fit the ""New College"" look.  Learning, studying, and generally caring about anything was highly discouraged.  Also, the drug atmosphere on campus was so ridiculous and rampant that it was hard to find anything to do on campus.  Everything was highly overrated and I left as soon as I could."
Freshman,2,"Take into consideration exactly how liberal you truly are when you apply here. The people here are intense, there is literally one ideology at this school and if you don't believe in it they'll ostracize you. THERE IS NO DIVERSITY! The rooming situation is HORRIBLE, and there's literally nothing you can do about it. Personally, I had like the worst possible rooming situation ever, she literally made me feel unsafe. When I informed the head of housing they basically said that I had to deal with it. The main portion of campus looks pretty rundown. The only parts that are presentable are the bay side campus and the letter dorms. The positives of the school are the instructors, like I do feel like I have learned a lot from them and I'm definitely smarter than I was when I arrived. But with that being said the cons definitely outweigh the pros. Like I said in the beginning, reflect on how liberal you actually are, because if you're ""normal"" you'll literally go crazy at this school."
College Sophomore,2,Don't have greek life and highly doubt the school would be able to handle the greek life
College Sophomore,2,"I am not particularly concerned but our sports are virtually nonexistent and though few of the current students are bothered by it, I think it would help diversify the student population if there were sports. However, our gym and pool is definitely good in my opinion."
College Junior,2,"It's great for those that just want to enjoy playing some kind of athletically related game, or want to just work out occasionally. Otherwise athletics are nonexistent, but the club sports are a great deal of fun and are typically well attended (for such a small school)."
College Junior,2,"Ok, so, first year was fantastic. I found a warm and loving community and didn't really see too much wrong with it. I made friends, I loved my classes - all good stuff. Academically I feel the school is fantastic, and most professors are always willing to talk with you about pretty much anything and teach in engaging manners. I will say I feel the school needs *way* more professors than it has, most departments are tiny. If you don't care for one professor, good luck figuring out how to avoid them if they're in your field. Many degrees have requirements that make it impossible to move from field to field in a true liberal arts environment. The work load (coming from someone who has passed every class they've taken) is ridiculous. Good luck having a life outside of New. By second year the political scene grew incredibly prominent to the point that I felt uncomfortable discussing anything, even non-political, with people I didn't know extremely well. When someone does something 'wrong' the entire community jumps in to tear them down. Students who are well known or in prominent positions face unfounded accusations and abuse. There is one status quo and if you don't stick to it, those with the louder voices make life hell. Personally, I could handle either the workload, or the social sphere, not both. New is either for people who don't want to be part of the social scene at all, or are radically - and I mean radically - liberal (from a highly liberal person). It's really sad, this school has fantastic potential and I felt great my first year, I love the pass/fail system, the general acceptance of any minority, and the idea of the close knit, neighborly community. It just fell through for me."
College Sophomore,2,"There is so much visibility of drugs and alcohol on campus. You can see people drinking from their dorms all the time, smoking weed visibly outside, ect. This was one of the biggest issues I had with campus."
College Freshman,2,"Ham is gross, that has been established. Four winds food isn't bad but they run out of things quickly and the atmosphere at that place is awful and it's a long walk from the residential side. The continence store was a good addition though."
College Freshman,2,"while some dorms are nice, others are in sad disrepair. Community members are sometimes destructive and damage public spaces. The housing staff is overworked and as a result they are often very ineffective. Housing frustrates most of the students on campus."
College Freshman,2,"The food is majorly overpriced and not nutritious. 4 winds is okay but it takes forever to get your incredibly tiny portion. The convenience store has decent weekday hours and the substation can be a life saver, in terms of getting portion size and nutrition."
College Freshman,2,"There really aren't sports, just the occasional fun game beween NCF and Ringling, but the facilities are nice and useful, and there are exercise classes."
College Sophomore,2,"The gym is okay, but definitely not the best. The only sport team we have is sailing."
College Sophomore,2,"The international student population on campus is nearly nonexistent. However, starting Fall of 2014, New College of Florida partnered with Daughters for Life to invite Middle Eastern women for a 4-year exchange program."
College Sophomore,2,Students' interests vary and you definitely don't want to get into a controversial or political argument with them. Most of the students are very hard-working during the week. On the weekends most of them go out to parties but people are definitely not pressured to go out.
College Junior,2,Restaurants close early. Sarasota dining is expensive. Car required to reach anything other than Subway and McDonald's.
College Sophomore,2,"The school is in desperate need of money. That will fix most of it's problems, including the majors. There simply is not enough money for all of the majors the school offers. This results in subpar majors across the board."
College Sophomore,2,"As a non-drinker, non-smoker, non-drug user, I felt pretty uncomfortable. I didn't feel included in many aspects of social life because the emphasis was often on substances."
College Sophomore,2,"The Freshman dorms at New College are beyond terrible. All through August and September, my room mates and I had no air conditioning. It was horrific. The school was very slow to fix our problems, and they weren't upfront about moving us to a new room so we could have A/C. After that was fixed, the room was still kind of a mess. Pei is falling apart. And those rooms are really not big enough for three people to live in comfortably."
College Freshman,2,"Really outdated computers, and the internet is always under maintenance."
College Freshman,2,"Very homogenous politically and religiously, practically everyone is liberal."
College Freshman,2,Seems like everyone does it. There's very little peer pressure.
College Freshman,2,"The cafeteria is often barely open, and there is no variety to be found."
College Freshman,2,"You should probably do a rideshare thing. Because even though there's an airport right next to the school, it's expensive as hell and there are no buses or trains that take you very far"
College Junior,2,"Not good at all, but the students are working to improve it. "
College Sophomore,2,"I have personally only lived on campus, however there are many neighborhoods within walking distance or a short-bike ride away from the school, and most will end up much cheaper than paying for on campus housing. Safety is an issue in the surrounding neighborhoods however- burglaries in particular are not uncommon. Getting permission to live off campus is known to be a bit difficult, though not impossible."
College Sophomore,2,"Sarasota is pretty lame. If you've got a car or money, you'll have fun. If not, prepare to go to the airport a lot--it's the only fun thing within walking distance of the campus. (Or the Ringling Museum, but that loses appeal quickly.)"
College Sophomore,2,"Sarasota is full of old people and everything in the city is overpriced. The local beaches are nice, but it's very tourist-y and snowbird-y."
College Sophomore,2,"They don't offer a ton of majors. However, although there are not a wide range of majors you have very knowledgable faculty. You feel like you are getting challenged and learning a lot. I found it easy to get into the classes I needed as a Nat. Science student because they give you priority based on your contracts. I think that it is not important to know what you major in when first coming here because they want you to explore all of your options before deciding on an AOC. I would say that NCF admission is based on the student overall. You could have lower test scores than others, but the activities you were involved in may show that you are a leader. I would suggest keeping in contact with admissions so that they know your name and they will remember you when they get your application."
College Sophomore,2,"Can't Expect Much from Such a Small School, but Pcps and Walls Okay – There's not a lot in the area since we are so close to the airport and Sarasota is a retirement community. Nightlife is bad for college students, as this is not your typical college town.  There's a lot to do but not at night. 

NCF students throw their own parties called Walls and a couple times of year bigger parties (that outsiders come to)  happen, these are called PCPs. Lots of all-night dining and drug use (for which NCF is known) but the cops are pretty cool about it, they know the NCF students keep it under control, it's the outsiders who go crazy."
College Freshman,2,"Noticeable lack of hot men – The vast majority of men are incapacitatingly nerdy, don't bathe or wear dirty dresses and skirts every day to class.  If you're hoping for men who are charming, handsome, built or even masculine, you'll have to wait four years.  If you are a gay guy or transgendered, you will feel accepted and loved.   

Most of the women are beautiful, just a handful are incapacitatingly nerdy.  Aesthetically, ""hipster"" and ""hippie"" fashion is most common.  Dyed hair, dreads and shaved heads are considered cool, not odd.  But there is definitely not a lack of cute girls.  Girls at this school also seem to be more open to bisexuality or lesbianism than at other schools, which is a plus to me as a bisexual girl. :) "
College Sophomore,2,"There's really only one place to get food on campus with your meal plan, Ham Center. The other option is the student run cafe, which is delicious but isn't open very much and costs almost double the meal plan points. Ham food is generally too oily and too salty and there's little variety. Oftentimes they run out of an entree before dinner is even over (most times the only vegetarian/vegan option for the night). Finally, their hours are bad on weekdays and almost impossible on weekends."
College Freshman,2,"Its normal to see girls with unshaven armpit and legs, no make up, and very short hair. However, nudity is very popular on campus so you'll see naked girls on a fairly regular basis."
College Senior,2,"Looking for More – New College is an extremely accepting place. However, it is mostly white. The college, led by students, has made a concerted effort to increase diversity and tolerance."
Freshman,1,"Worst school ever. The food sucks and is overpriced, it’s pretty much a food desert. The school is badly managed, they spent 300k on a useless library renovation and had to shut down the only good cafe on campus because they went broke. The students are weird bordering on creepy, they’re all depressed because of the rampant self-victimization culture. This school is a bubble for tumblrinas who look for “safe spaces” instead of preparing themselves for the real world. Everyone has the same ideology and acts like they’re part of a cult, most of them are deluded into thinking they’re “oppressed”, “non binary”, and “mentally ill”. Party scene is sad. As a Miami native who’s seen good nightlife, these people just play 80’s music on repeat and get half naked while being monitored by campus police. The whole year I spent here I felt my mental state and social skills degrade."
Freshman,1,"NCF is insufferable. It's a toxic, negative, poorly kept, and regressive place where students find a lack of self care to be ""cute"" and ""aesthetic"". Jokes are often made such as: ""if you're not severely depressed, you're not at NCF"". In addition, it's a given that upper years will hate you on principal. They'll call you stupid and uneducated simply because you haven't spent time at the school. They'll also tell you that ""you'll hate this place too after four years"". The drug culture is rampant. Every 3rd person is tripping acid in public places. Self care is frowned upon and if you don't fit the aesthetic of being poor, hungry, sad, and dazed: you're not ""new college"" enough. No matter what admissions tells you about this ""diverse and passionate"" community: DO NOT CHOOSE THIS SCHOOL."
College Junior,1,"I am not okay with the drug situation on campus, not for me, but the person next to me. While there is no direct peer pressure, the availability of pretty much any drug you could want is ridiculously high. There's always a friend-of-a-friend who can get you access. Heavier drugs like cocaine and heroin are Not. Safe. on this campus, due to the surrounding area of the school. Marijuana and mushrooms are the most common, I would say, which doesn't bother me, it's just the attitude towards heavier drugs that I find truly disturbing, almost encouraging. Students are quick to defend drugs like LSD as 'traditional' New College drugs. Policy enforcement has mainly wound up in the arrest of student drug dealers, which I find worse, as it means students are driven to find drugs in the surrounding Bradenton area which is just a terrible idea. It's the attitude that needs to change."
College Junior,1,"From what I have heard, while the campus feels strongly about sexual assault,the school does a lot to cover it up. This would not surprise me. The drug situation on campus is incredibly strong, and unsettling in some cases. The county the school falls into is, I believe, currently the nation's leading overdose capital. While there is no pressure from other students to do drugs, you *will* see other students using them. Campus crime is pretty low, although theft has been on the rise. This school has an incredible problem with smokers. As someone with asthma, this isn't great. Smokers are everywhere, will sit directly outside your rooms, be in the middle of crowds at important or mandatory events, and be outside the entrances to places I need to be, like the library, the cafeteria, and narrower walkways to my dorm. I spent 6months with a lingering cough due to the constant smoking around me. If you have the confidence to approach people in order to ask them to stop smoking, people are general quite amenable - but won't change their behavior and will be right back in the same place the next time. I've found the social response to any stop-smoking initiative to be volatile and somewhat threatening."
College Junior,1,Housing staff: awful except for nate.
College Freshman,1,"This is a school that thinks they know how to party but they really don't... I went to a few of the 'walls' as they like to call them and they always suck, without fail. PCP which was made out to me to be this huge campus party with a bunch of people on campus and stuff to do, both of the ones I atfended were bad. I heard the question 'what are you on' too many times, people aren't really approachable, it's just not fun. I honestly have nothing good to say about the party scene at this school... But then to be fair I don't have much good to say about this school generally."
College Freshman,1,Rarely are students allowed to get off campus housing and if they are it's a nightmare of a process. It's not worth it. Just get an apartment in Dort or Goldstein and stay there.
College Junior,1,"We were voted #2 worst in the nation, and with good reason. The hours are erratic and often food runs out hours before the dining hall closes. The options are fairly distasteful, limited, and somewhat unpredictable. It was often a challenge for many of my friends to eat, especially those who required vegan options. I had trouble as well, even though my dietary choices were mostly unlimited. I commend them for trying to resolve some issues by selling ice cream and organic produce, but it was not enough to outweigh the terrible food quality. Hopefully with our new food provider, some of these issues will be resolved."
College Junior,1,"I haven't had that many bad experiences with it myself, but almost everyone I talk to at the school has terrible problems getting any financial aid in spite of extensive (though misguided) efforts on the part of the administration, and they provide fairly useless suggestions for resolving financial aid problems for those students who are in a lot of trouble."
College Freshman,1,"MY campus dining is TERRIBLE! We are served the same food nearly every day (if they are even open to serve) and even though there are options for vegetarians, they are not healthy in anyway, nor do they taste good. "
College Freshman,1,"Nonexistent. There's an attitude of 'anti-sports' that really discourages people interested in sports. Minus the one soccer fundraiser, there's barely any attention paid to sports, and the facilities are nonexistent."
College Freshman,1,"While there is a vegan and vegetarian option for every meal, the choices are so dismal and the food so repetitive that the food seems really bad, even if it isn't that bad-tasting. Late night is every night until pretty late, but it's always pizza. Often with the topping of that days meal. Meatloaf pizza. Mixed vegetables pizza. Stuff like that. If you get really lucky there'll be overpriced chicken wings or strips. As far as lunch and dinner go, there are two lines. 'Ethnic' (stir fry or pasta) and 'homestyle' (turkey, mashed potatoes, vegetables). They're either not seasoned enough, or over seasoned. It's the actual worst. There are however many drink options. Those are better than the worst. The cafeteria runs on a point system where one point = a dollar. And students can sell and transfer points amongst themselves"
Recent Alumnus,1,You have to apply for Off-campus housing and the school is reluctant to grant it.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The school cafeteria is abysmal. Well, it has good snacks and stuff, but the food they make will make you sick. The Boar's head Sub shop is pretty good, but super crowded around lunch time."
Recent Alumnus,1,"We are severely lacking racial diversity, and have fewer out of state students than other Florida Universities."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I'm glad I didn't come here looking for my future husband, because I would be so out of luck"
College Freshman,1,Disgusting.  HAM is horrible. Get ready for -15.  The food is expensive and gross.  But perhaps this will change.
College Freshman,1,"Ham food is the worst. Honestly, the only thing that they do right is the bacon egg and cheese croissants for breakfast. The pizza at late night is okay sometimes. Other than that, it's expensive, greasy, and disgusting."
College Sophomore,1,"There is one team at our school which competes, and that is our Sail Team, which I am a member of. If you're interested in casual competition and having fun, Sail Team would be for you. If you're looking for something more as far as academics, there are very limited sports options. There is a flag football team, a swim team which doesn't compete, and pick up soccer games."
College Sophomore,1,"So. Incredibly. Hot. We're talking *averages* in the mid to upper 80s 365 days a year. It's ridiculous. Sarasota has no autumn, no winter, and has a negligible spring. It's summer ad vitam aeternam in Sarasota. And not the good type of summer; the ""Oh, it's 8:00am and it's already 94 °F ... and it's January 14th"" type summer. Miserable. "

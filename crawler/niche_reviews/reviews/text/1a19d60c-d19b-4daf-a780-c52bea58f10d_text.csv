We have hands on classes and we are really being taught our craft and that we can immediately go into our field of study, even before we graduate. The staff have been so attentive and understanding of the students mental and physical health, and I am so grateful to them for it. They are also under understanding and make an effort with learning everyones names and gender pronouns."
Senior,5,"I enjoy the friendly and helpful atmosphere that Southern Oregon University has to offer. Every time I step onto campus I am greeted by smiling faces and warm, welcoming faculty and staff. I would like to see the cost for online students improve, as well as the student government and clubs create the capability of working with the distance ed. learners."
Freshman,5,Southern Oregon University is an amazing school that supports me as a transgender man as well as a theatre student. The class size is perfect with a small student to professor ratio which feels like a community college with a university title.
Senior,5,The southern Oregon campus is a beautiful place located in the middle of historic Ashland.  My favorite part of SOU had to be the student activities.  Our student committee has always been a highly active group.  They are responsible for so many outreach programs that make every last student feel welcome and included in the campus life.
Freshman,5,I love Southern Oregon University! The staff and people there are very kind and helpful. The town is super cute and very pretty with lots of scenic spots. One thing about the school is we don't have Greek Life which doesn't bother me but may bother others. The school is small however I enjoy that aspect because you get to know more people and the student to professor ratio is small. The overall experience has been amazing!

Senior,5,"My overall experience at SOU has been a very positive one. My instructors have been more then helpful in my journey thus far. I only hope that whomever decides to attend this school also has the same experience as I have had. From registration to applying for work study everyone has been awesome and super helpful. I am so glad that I was convinced to return to school when I did. As being in my 50’s I had thought why do I need a degree, but once I got here I wouldn’t change it if asked too. Thank you SOU Staff you have been amazing."

Freshman,5,"Coming to Southern Oregon University, I was a little nervous since it was my first time out of my comfort zone, I was scared I wasn't going to make any friends, the usual case of cold feet. However, I made friends the first day I was here, the community here at Souther Oregon University is amazing. Since classes are small. there's one-on-one options to talk to your professor. The professors here want you to succeed in the world of academia and outside of it. I love my campus and I'm beyond grateful for all the connections I've made while here and will continue to make. Did I mention there's tons of jobs on campus? To y surprise, it actually wasn't that hard to get a on-campus job. Overall, if a university surrounded by tons of scenery and amazing people is your tea, come take a sip."
Junior,5,"My experience here at SOU has gradually increased and has become the best decision of my life. The school is small and you get well connected to lots of people and professors. The class sizes are small, and you can easily get to know your professors well if you choose so.  The people in this community are welcoming and the culture down here is somewhat diverse and open to everything. The student life could be more lively, however, we always seem to make it happen. This university has changed my life and I'm so thankful that I decided to stay here for my undergraduate degree!"

Senior,5,So far I am thriving at Southern Oregon University. I am a psychology major as well as a GSWS minor. The professors are great. They really want nothing but the best for the students and they prove that with their teaching abilities.
Sophomore,5,"Southern Oregon University is a liberal college located in a beautiful town with plenty to do and explore in your free time. Ashland is home to a diverse and inclusive population. There are many majors, classes, and clubs to choose from at SOU. All professors I've had have been incredibly helpful and always willing to push students to their potential."

College Junior,5,I had an internship during my senior year of studying for my undergrad. I was offered full-time employment before I graduated and had a very competitive salary compared to my peers. I have no doubt that even more doors will open for me once I earn my MBA.
College Junior,5,I am choosing to go back to the same university that I completed my undergraduate degree at because of the highly educated and experienced professors. I received one-on-one time with professors who had worked in their respective fields and were able to bring real-world experience into the classroom.
College Junior,5,Health and safety are of utmost importance!
College Junior,5,Amazing experience!! I've felt welcome and praised for my GPA.

College Student,5,"I live in Shasta Hall and absolutely love it. It's spacious and clean and new. The people can be noisy, but I got used to it."
College Freshman,5,"For the past two terms I have personally had night classes that got out around 9 pm. Even though that seems scary I have never been scared walking home because I always see the ""Help"" phones around campus. These phones and all of the street lamps help me feel safer when walking home."
College Freshman,5,With every course I have taken at Southern Oregon University the professors are always willing to help you. Each of the classes offered are diverse in nature. Even the class sizes are easy to get used to.

College Freshman,5,"The campus is a pretty small liberal arts college that focuses on inclusive and accepting spaces. There are many activities for students to do, clubs and organizations are abundant, and the teachers are very friendly and approachable."
College Senior,5,Career networking is good on campus. There is a web page for campus career services where students can perform a complete job search and create resumes and cover letters. Industries from around the local region and the country list job openings on this web page for graduates. They also list available internships. Professor support in helping students network is great.
College Senior,5,"The quality of courses is great. They provide up-to-date knowledge and in-depth areas of study. There are a wide variety of options of courses. Some class sizes are too large. But overall, the experience with professors and courses have been positive."
College Senior,5,SOU is a great school. It is welcoming of students of all different backgrounds. It is accomodating to students with different learning abilities. The professors are understanding and knowledgeable and genuinely engage with students in helping the succeed.
Freshman,4,I appreciate the effort being made to give value to students regardless of the pandemic and have had a relatively easy time adjusting.
Freshman,4,"Overall, I have really enjoyed going to SOU and participating in my classes. The staff is very helpful and available frequently."
Junior,4,Online classes have proved difficult for everyone including professors but at SOU they have really tried to make things as accessible and affordable as possible with student fee reductions. There are still major improvements that need to be made to the online learning platforms but they work decently for now.
Alum,4,"Southern Oregon University is a very accepting school and allows its students to focus on their studies. Ashland is small so if you prefer a more city-like scene, SOU is not for you."
Junior,4,"Southern Oregon University is a beautiful campus full of lively students. There are always petitions, activities, study groups all throughout campus. Could use some more dedicated professors, but there are also plenty of professors at SOU that do a wonderful job educating students."
Junior,4,I prefer online schooling here at SOU. Each class gets its own webpage where we can discuss with the professors and other students about what we are learning.
Junior,4,"Taking classes online is difficult no matter the school you go to, although the website SOU uses for online learning makes the experience much more enjoyable. It’s an easy to use platform and the teachers are committed to teaching and making sure we get something out of the class. Through forums, online calls, and individual feedback, online learning is made possible."
Junior,4,I really appreciate the diversity on campus and how accepting everyone is. There are so many clubs to join that you’ll never feel left out. Staff is kind and wants you to learn.
Freshman,4,"I finished my freshman year online because of COVID. Zoom was helpful and most professors kept up with teaching and the work. Some had some issues that got in the way of them teaching. One unfortunate outcome was sitting on your computer for two hours listening to a professor lecture. Other than that it was fine, and I didn't have any problems."
Freshman,4,"I love the environment and inclusivity, but I wish to see more student involvement, there aren't many clubs and activities."
Freshman,4,"I took roughly half of my courses online and I loved them. I liked how flexible teachers were, how understanding they were, and the ability to learn on my own."
Freshman,4,SOU is in a beautiful area and there are a lot of things to do outside. Teachers are very understanding and classes are great.
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the fact the college focuses on teaching and not research. The Professor truly want the students to learn and get into the profession they are pursuing.
Sophomore,4,"SOU is a great school, I picked it because it is close. Dorms are very big, some of the largest I've ever seen. Academics are great so far, few professors to stay away from though. I intend to stay here."
Junior,4,"SOU is very liberal and embraces diversity for students of every race, gender, age, economic status, background, orientation, or any other designation. The community is small and the location and climate couldn't be better with the forest mountain  setting and rarely below  0°C all year long.  The only wish I have or Improvement would be to increase the amount of courses offered for some of the disciplines that could use additional options, but I believe that concern is already noted and with revisions underway."
Freshman,4,I am currently apart of Southern Oregon's Cross Country team and I have found that I have met some of my best friends through the program. The team also enabled me to meet more people than I would've without them. The housing situation is really good but all the fire alarms in Shasta Hall are a huge downside. I have had some amazing professors however and I really enjoy attending the school.
Freshman,4,"The college is very nice, pretty, and clean. The dorm halls are comfy. The local area is cute and walkable. It is a nice town to be in and is close to Medford. The are grocery store in walking distance. Over all and wonderful college."
Freshman,4,It's been good so far! I enjoy my classes and all of my professors have been really awesome so far. I also love that I get to live in the beautiful Siskyou valley.

Niche User,4,Southern Oregon University is the most welcoming and friendly school within the state of Oregon. Every time I step on this campus I feel at home.
Freshman,4,The campus is welcoming and beautiful. I have met many people who are unapologetically themselves and it is refreshing. The staff wants you to succeed and it shows through their work.
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed my experience at Southern Oregon so far. I wish there was a more diverse selection of class in the computer science major, but otherwise, I will finish on time so all is good."
Sophomore,4,I like the people of Ashland and the beautiful scenery that surrounds the school. The mountains have a calm comforting effect and all the people here are laidback and compassionate.
Freshman,4,"Although I've only attended SOU for a couple of months, I've enjoyed my time there. The surrounding area is gorgeous with easy access to camping and hiking spots nearby. The professors and counselors I've interacted with have been helpful and supportive, and my classes have been enjoyable. The only downside is the campus food, which can be accurately described as mediocre at best. Otherwise, my experience at SOU has been a good one, and I look forward to continuing to attend."
Niche User,4,This college is really beautiful and in a great location. I have toured it twice and fell in love with it. This is at the top of my list of colleges in Oregon. I love the programs it has to offer as well as the safe secure area. They offer a wide range of majors and intramural activities to those who would like to participate. This college is not a huge campus either so it is a easy transition. Lots of people love this campus because it is very accepting as well as the fun activities they offer. The list goes on with things to stay busy but also to get the help you need from difficult classes.
Freshman,4,Southern Oregon has wonderful faculty and students. The facilities are all very good and the cost is reasonable.
Niche User,4,"Southern Oregon University is a great school for anyone looking to go to college. You can get the same education anywhere. I'm very happy about how much everything was. The yearly cost of how much everything was, was half of what my sister had to pay at her college. The life on campus is awesome! Everyone is friendly and it is all a nice community. Ashland isn't a very big place so you get to know everyone."
Freshman,4,"So far, the admin has been very helpful and patient with all of my questions. It's very easy to talk to all of them, and when you're in need of an answer, it never takes longer than a couple of days to gain a response. The students are very involved and like to contribute back to the campus through mentor programs. The overall atmosphere is super friendly and it makes it easy to make new friends and become very involved. The classes are also not too challenging as there are many students who are willing to help."
Sophomore,4,"In a small school setting, you get to know your professors and peers one-on-one, which has REALLY benefited my overall experience!! The campus is gorgeous and there are so many outdoor activities to participate in."
Freshman,4,Southern Oregon university felt like a second home. Offering countless opportunities to get out and enjoy life for a young adult.
Senior,4,"Excellent Chemistry department - as there are no graduate students, undergraduates get experience working on the instrumentation. Commuter school, so a lower amount of on-campus community engagement."
Sophomore,4,"As a first year student coming from Hawai'i and living in a dorm with a broken heater, was hell. Academics and professors are awesome. Big focus on diversity which I love. Little to no party scene."
Alum,4,"Great for people pursuing business or theater. Very small town but excellent art, culture, and nature opportunities nearby. If you want to pursue a BFA or career opportunities with OSF, this is the place to go. Also extremely LGBTQ friendly and is one of the top 25 schools for trans acceptance."
Niche User,4,"Very nice, open campus. The town of ashland is beautiful especially in the winter. The althletics are amazing."
Senior,4,"I really enjoyed the program I was in: Communications (Digital Cinema) and Emerging Media and Digital Arts. I was able to get two degrees here because I had an advisor who helped me make the most of my time in University while being able to study abroad, take part in jobs, internships, and clubs in my major. The Digital Media Center allowed students to reserve really nice equipment for no cost, to create our own projects and SOU has multiple student professional positions to help us gain experience in our field."
Junior,4,"I would like my college campus to be more inclusive and accessible for all body types. SOU already does a great job with being accessible with (dis)abled bodies, however there can be more ramps available throughout campus for those who have difficulties with stairs and there needs to be more automatic door openers on campus for all locations that have heavier doors. The campus can continue to progress by having more gender neutral bathrooms in all the buildings on campus, so everyone can use the restroom comfortably without sacrificing one’s gender identity by choosing the men’s or women’s restroom options. While this campus is doing great in many fields, there is always room for improvement and to further progress the university."
Sophomore,4,Southern Oregon Univeristy has a very nice and clean campus. Professors are very helpful. Many clubs and activities are involved.
Freshman,4,"If you want a school that loves other sports as much as they love and support football, this is the school for you. there's all types of athletes scattered around the campus, and nearly everyone seems to get along. I was jumping between quite a few schools for softball and this one stood out the most; overall AWESOME!"
Senior,4,"There are many opportunities to help advance your career, you just need to be very proactive and find them all yourself. The staff is not helpful in achieving students goals but there are some professors and librarians who will go above and beyond to help you find a good career path."
Senior,4,Coming from an urban environment and adapting to a rural environment show a different aspect of living and really enjoyed the opportunities that lead me here. I told myself I would not go out of state but I did because of a scholarship and did not think I could handle not having every commodity in hand. It just showed me over the past 4 years to appreciate what you already have  and the values.
Freshman,4,"Honestly, I love this school. It's a small, intimate school, and the professors are helpful and care about the wellbeing of their students. The campus is lovely, though filled with hills, and the sense of community is incredibly welcoming, which is nice at a small school. Most of the students, clubs, and sports are eager to connect with other students. Many of the issues on campus, however are structural, such as parking and the never-ending construction that the students must pay for. I would say that, as a community, SOU is great. Academically, it is a wonderful school for arts and STEM. But there is a disconnect between administration and students."
Senior,4,"It was okay. There isn't too much to do here so make sure you make a lot of friends.  The surrounding area is an amazing if you are into hikes, outdoor environments and Shakespeare plays."
Alum,4,Southern Oregon University is a great place for a small town LGBTQ person who is looking to get out on their own for the first time. There is not much to do around town at night but plenty of good shows to see and the community is fun and supportive.
Freshman,4,"Great school, just wish it had a few more majors such as Electrical Engineering and others. At least pre-professional programs that don't involve the medical field."
Freshman,4,"Southern Oregon University is an amazing diverse campus full of opportunity. It is also located in Ashland Oregon, which offers tons of activities, cute shops,  and restaurants, all while being surrounded by beautiful parks, trails, Mt Ashland Ski Area, and Emigrant lake."
Sophomore,4,"SOU is a great school. The professors there seem to care about their students. It is a Very diverse school, and it makes me feel like I belong there."
Junior,4,Great school with small class sizes. Offers most mainstream majors. Professors are well qualified and caring. Only downfall would be limited and very expensive housing options.
Niche User,4,The campus is wonderful. The diversity is welcoming and the courses offered are quite amazing. The theater program is excellent and connected to the Shakespeareian festival which is really amazing. Overall it is a perfect school for many students.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at Southern Oregon University and love attending this university. The school is a smaller University, but offers great diversity. The people are friendly, the professors are great,  and Ashland is a cute town. The party scene is not huge and dorm life becomes annoying through people smoking in their rooms and being loud in the hallways, but that is found almost everywhere. Football is highly prioritized and the campus food is good, but gets old after awhile. The campus is absolutely gorgeous and there are plenty of activities to get involved in on campus."
Alum,4,Great small liberal arts college.  Tuition is affordable and the area has a lot to offer.  Professors are available and friendly.  Great education comparative to larger schools.  Love it!
College Junior,4,"SOU has a very large campus, so walking from one side to the other at night can be somewhat scary. SOU has done a good job of putting in lights on all the major walkways, and students can call campus safety and be escorted to their car/dorm/classroom if they feel unsafe for whatever reason."
Junior,4,Overall a great experience. The classes are small allowing for a decent teacher-to-student ratio. The town is beautiful and has a lot to offer. 
College Junior,4,Cuesta College has a strong theatre program with modern facilities and resources. The theatre professors are passionate and extremely knowledgeable. The overall campus is welcoming and nice to be in. Student services seem to be well managed and every professor I have had has been thoughtful and engaging.
College Junior,4,It's great! I don't dorm but the amenities are amazing for those that do.
College Junior,4,The raiders are amazing. We have a great football team and we will quite frequently!!
College Junior,4,Mr college is amazing. They have helped me every step of the way with my transfer from a community college. I'm very confident that when I graduate I will possess all the tools needed to be a successful business person.
College Senior,4,"I find the safety on campus is great, they give tips on how to keep safe and important numbers are posted all over for the safety of students, the email alert and phones calls are a great support system on how to keep safe."
College Senior,4,"I find on this campus they hold job fairs and career paths every other month. They have school districts that visit campus and make sure they are up to date with the education field. They also have many schools and daycares that others can work at while going to college, this goes for all other career paths from this school."
College Senior,4,I don't live on campus but I have toured the facilities and they were a place I would stay if I lived on campus.
College Senior,4,Great individual attention from professors! Strong community feeling
Niche User,2,Severely overpriced! Hard to make lifelong friends. Teachers don't care about students grades and tell them to go to the library to get help. The library and the scenery are the only good things about this school. The fire alarm went off 8 times in the middle of the night in one semester!
Alum,2,"The business end of the school is terrible. If you need information about anything regarding paperwork, transcripts, enrollment, or otherwise this school is eh. I watched this school leave families in ruin and have zero compassion for people going through a tough time. This is a ""no other option"" school and they know it."
College Junior,2,"SOU banned all Greek Life in the 1970's. In 2011-2012 the school allowed one fraternity to start a chapter on campus, Alpha Kappa Psi, a professional business fraternity. I do not know of any other fraternities or sororities that are currently on campus and affiliated with SOU."
College Freshman,2,The cheapest residence hall has many issues including leaky roofs.
College Freshman,2,Most people who aren't on a team also aren't fans of sports.
College Freshman,2,"Socially, this is a wonderful school full of diverse and accepting people.

Academically, it is not challenging in the slightest.

At SOU it is about fulfilling the requirements. The process of acquiring a degree here has little to do with learning."
College Sophomore,2,"I really don't like my roommate, so it's not the best for me, but the room in general is great and my RA is great."
College Freshman,2,Nightlife consists of going to taco bell and coming home.
College Freshman,2,There is no party scene here! All parties on halloween night get busted and are done by 10:00 p.m
College Freshman,2,"The school itself is beautiful but being at SOU you see the same people every single day. If you dont want to see someone, you probably are going to see that person. The school is just too small and not everyone there is friendly. It is a strange atmosphere and I dont plan on coming back next year. If you like the small highschool vibe this school is perfect for you. My roomates are super cool though and are nice people."
College Freshman,2,Being at SOU is like being stuck in highschool again except you are stuck there for both day and night. People are loud and cliquy there and it is pretty hard to make friends because a lot of the people were snotty.
College Junior,2,Southern Oregon University doesn't have a Greek Life
College Freshman,2,"People shouldn't be out drinking in the middle of the week, but thats none of my business"
College Freshman,2,Some people make bad decisions
College Sophomore,2,The food in the hawk is not great.
College Junior,2,Hard for students to obtain rentals
College Junior,2,Not a lot of options
College Junior,2,There is very limited options for dining and scarce stores as well
College Freshman,2,"If you live in the old dorms, its like living in a cheap motel room. 

very unpleasant to be living there.

curtains have holes from age

floor is flat old carpet

walls are bland 

ceiling reminds me of my high school classroom ceilings

bathrooms are old

but the shower rooms are awfull

they have cement painted black on bottom half and yellow tiles for top half.

so gross

BUT

we do have kitchens on each floor

comes with microwave, stove, oven, sink, and a trash can(incase you need to throw somthing away that you dont want to get in trouble since they wont know who on the floor threw it away) 

these aren't in the nicer dorms 

ra's try to do social events with just one floor and multiple floors

people are friendly and have doors open for visiting"
College Sophomore,2,"If you live on campus, housing is strict. They have quiet hours and they patrol around the dorm rooms. I personally hate that."
College Freshman,2,"SOU has a very low amount of the diversity. However the staff as well as the students are very accepting to those of different beliefs, background, religions, etc."
College Freshman,2,There are a lot of parties were alcohol and drugs are present.
College Freshman,2,"The salad, sandwiches, and the burgers are good but the specialty foods are not so great."
College Freshman,2,As far as I know there are not any transportation options at our school.
College Junior,2,Small town with a small selection of bars. There is only one nightclub.
College Junior,2,The school is too small to need a shuttle. All the classes are within 10 minutes of each other.
College Junior,2,I am unaware of any Greek fraternities or sororities.
College Sophomore,2,"In my opinion there is not enough health conscious options in the dining hall. All the food is of low quality, inorganic, and saturated with oils. "
College Junior,2,"Depending on your major, the workload differs. But each major has to do a senior capstone. "
College Junior,2,"Town is small and very nice. If you are underaged there is not really much for you to do unless you love the outdoors and enjoy hiking and snowboarding. Also if you have an interest in theater and Shakespeare, Ashland's Shakespeare festival is very popular. "
College Sophomore,2,There's nothing to do and it's a hippy town
College Sophomore,2,"There are a lot of small restaurants that are easily walkable from campus, but they sell the exact same things that are in the dining hall, that we are trying to escape by eating off campus. The restaurants that offer more variety are expensive."
College Senior,2,"Greek life is not overwhelming at SOU.  I enjoy the activities they put on, but they do not dominate the campus.  There is not pressure put on students to join and they all seem to be really nice people."
College Senior,2,Freshman be warned! If you are going to be drinking/using in your dorm room... You best be prepared to be quiet or deal with the consequences. RA's seem to know everything that goes on and they will bring in Campus Security to take care of you. CPS will confiscate anything in sight and you will be written up.
College Junior,2,Run down. Needs care. Costs way to much for what you get
College Senior,2,"There aren't many options for housing, and the available selection is old and dingy. The landlords are fine and the maintenance is average. The most positive aspect of the off-campus living situation is that you are close to the school and to downtown from the majority of areas. The rent is over-priced for the quality of apartment you are getting. It is really a matter of spending money on gas to live outside the city and commuting, or being willing to spend more on a lesser-quality apartment but have the proximity to the campus and its amenities."
College Senior,2,The drug scene at our school is much more prominent that one would think because it is such a small school. Drugs are literally every where and extremely easy to obtain. Especially right now because it is finals week next week and every body is getting stuff to stay up all night and stay focused. It is quite appalling the amount of students you see taking these drastic measures just to get through finals.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I am in the business program. I have two complaints: 

First, the classes NEEDED for a degree are not offered every term. So this forces some (many?) students to put off graduating until the class is offered again. What I find ironic about this is that when the class is offered, it fills up so fast that if you are not sitting at your computer waiting to the clock to strike midnight so you can register, you are out of luck until next year! But paradoxically, if demand is so high for the class, then why is it not offered more often?

Second, it pisses me off to no end that we have had tuition increases for the past 2 years, and can expect ANOTHER this fall. Yet, in the Business department, many of the classes are held in classrooms with tiny little desks.... you know, the kind you have in high school. And many of the classrooms are HOT in the spring and summer. Is this what I am paying for? The local community college has nicer classrooms"
College Sophomore,2,Well most of the apartments in Ashland are expensive and they are not great quality for your money.
College Freshman,2,"As an underage student, after 10 there is nothing to do"
College Junior,2,"There are no options for the under 21 crowd and parties are few. If you are interested in live music it is a little hard to come by, but every once and a while a decent artist will come through. There are only a couple decent bars in Ashland which tend to have the same crowd (so you will probably see the same people often). There are more bars/nightlife opportunities in Medford but it's 20 miles away so the only way to get there is through a DD or taxi, since public transportation shuts down around 10pm."
College Freshman,2,"Unless you have a parking permit it's pretty hard. You'll have to park a few blocks away unless you get there after six pm, or before eight am. The permit is expensive, but if you have to drive and don't want to walk then it's necessarily."
College Freshman,2,"I don't ride the bus, but I know the buses here in the valley only run on an hour schedule, and they don't run past a certain time, which can be difficult for some people."
College Senior,2,"I worry about women walking through campus at night because it is not very well lit and there is not a large security force.  

During the daytime I feel extremely safeon campus, though.  People are very friendly."
College Junior,2,I only lived on campus my Freshman year and my dorm was small with cold cement block walls.
College Junior,2,"Financial Aid staff are amazing at their jobs!!! Average access but serious lack of information for funding that is free. Basically the burden is placed on students and families, otherwise loans are available. And don't have a Career Center for placement after graduation"
College Junior,2,"Average. This is a small town. But Medford has more options for nightlife. Have to have access to a car if living in the NW. Bus runs about every half hour until 6pm, less on weekends; but doesn't service half the town."
College Junior,2,"Costly, run down and difficult to find as well. Family housing has been great for us!!"
College Sophomore,2,"There is not many things to do at night in Ashland for people who are underaged. Lots of people go to the movies, or just hang out with friends. Many people who are of age to drink go to the clubs and bars in town."
College Junior,2,"Not a Party School – SOU is not a party school. There are house parties off campus, but one must be in the loop in order to hear about or be invited to those parties. There are no night clubs, but SOU does have its own that holds pretty entertaining nights."
College Sophomore,2,Better Just Leave the Car at Home – I would recommend just walking to your classes and parking far away from campus. The parking permits are too expensive for the parking you'll actually get. I would also just park in the residential areas near school and then just foot it. There aren't any time limits in the residential areas so you can be at school all day and not worry.
College Junior,2,From What I Can Tell – I am a grad student and live off-campus but have heard that drugs are easy to come by in this geographical area and the campus community seems enthusiastic about its parties and drug/alcohol use.
College Senior,2,"Football, Eh – Our football team isn't very good. The stands reflect this statement as well. The football experience at SOU is similar to a medium sized high school in Northern California. The Rugby team is decent, and our Volleyball team is good. So over all C."
College Senior,2,Sodexo is a company that is clearly more interested in making money than quality food. I'm surprised the students aren't sick with the nutrition that this company provides. The waffles aren't bad but everything else is mediocre at best.
College Junior,2,"University Safety – Never walk alone through campus at night. There seems to be sexual assaults on campus on a regular basis. Since there seems to be a lack of safety officers on campus, try to walk in a group. The campus security does send out regular emails alerting assault warnings on campus. For this reason, student should check their emails regularly."
College Senior,2,"Expensive, Sold for Tourists – The best place in town to go for food that can actually be afforded by students is Louie's. They have burgers and fries for $4 with a student ID. Other than that, you're looking at either fast food (Wendy's, Taco Bell or Burger King only), or places set up for tourists, with prices from $15-30. Even for a simple plate of pasta. It's not very convenient, either, to get to these expensive places, as parking is terrible in the whole town."
College Senior,2,"A Bit Cramped – Not really available during finals week. Hard to find outside of the library. Usually very crowded, and most don't care about being quiet, even in the library! Oh yeah, and don't go in on a time crunch it takes about 20 minutes to log in and load up after putting in your information. All classes require a computer, at least at home, as most assignments are kept online."
College Senior,2,"Not the Best, but Not the Worst – Security on campus is okay. It's in a tiny town, where a lot of stuff rarely happens. Students come back to dorms and apartments extremely drunk, security doesn't care. Campus theft is rampant, and security does not care about it. I had $700 stolen from my on-campus housing through the school, I knew who did it...and neither the school nor the Ashland Police did anything about it. Always lock your stuff up, and/or don't bring anything valuable with you. It's best to have a safe, or something along those lines.  The town itself is fairly safe, as only 1 person has been murdered here in the last few years. I guess that's a plus. The campus security supposedly will drive you to your car if you go to the blue light areas. I say supposedly because I was on crutches, leaving the library to walk home at 10pm, and tried it--and no one showed up after 20minutes."
College Senior,2,"Getting Worse Every Year – The first year I came here I would have given this an A- (2008)
the second year (2009) I would have given it a B+
The third year (2010) I would have given it a B-
This year and looking toward what they are implementing for next year I am going to give it a C-. How can the teachers teach you if there jobs are constantly threatened or being cut? The administrators that are not higher ups are less friendly each year as their jobs are also on the chopping block all the time !"
College Senior,2,"The Food Is Not Healthy or Tasty – This place is Not handicap accessible like they say it is! I have personally spoken to two people who have been thrown out of their wheelchairs due to uneven terrain where the map of the school says it is wheel chair accessible. Also almost no classroom is designed to allow a person in a wheel chair to get in and out of the room easily. The Science building is built on a Earthquake fault line, the science building also has rust that frequently comes out of the water faucets in the bathroom, Taylor building looks like a prison and is not safe in the event of any emergency. The food is gross, unhealthy and too expensive to actually sustain its students, it is also not open for enough hours, also there are No other options except subway."
College Freshman,1,"It is non-existent, with the exception of one business fraternity."
College Freshman,1,Since our school in the past had a huge reputation for the Greek life that was on campus they shut down all affiliated parties and got the reputation to get back to a better state. Currently people are trying to bring back fraternities but I do not foresee that happening in the near future. Everyone on campus is in mutual agreement that Greek life is not needed on our campus and that we have good times without it.
College Freshman,1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. Students are inconsiderate, classes are a joke (seriously--I skipped one of my classes 80% of the time and still got an A because it was so easy), no variety in the courses, food is awful, the Ashland/Medford area is as exciting as a root canal. I could go on at length, but I'll save everyone the strife."
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek Life
Recent Alumnus,1,I don't think SOU has greek life because the frats in the 70's partied too hard so SOU got rid of them to try and clean up their image.
College Sophomore,1,Well sadly SOU does not have greek life. There are no fraternities or sororities.
College Sophomore,1,"They are old, but they work"
College Junior,1,"The police on campus is strict about drugs and alcohol on campus. The first time is a warning, the second is a fine, and the third is eviction. Most of the time people who smoke or drink in their rooms generally don't get caught, just because they know when police and staff make rounds."
College Sophomore,1,"I have not had an internship, but I definitely plan to in the future. With this being said, I don't believe the area surrounding SOU has that many opportunities, so I plan to transfer to a larger school with a more diverse network."
College Sophomore,1,"The varsity sports as SOU are not very well known, nor are they very popular. We have football and basketball, but our teams are never that great. IM sports are a little bit more popular, but still not too exciting."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I am a poor MALE student with no dependents, and I don't qualify for a damn thing except grants and loans. Scholarships? HA!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"I think that a college campus should encourage open discussions. I am not impressed with the Administrations recent decisions to curtail certain venues for free speach, including some that were not directly affiliated with the University in the first place."
College Freshman,1,The dinning halls on campus are not very good. I only eat there when there is no other choice. The food isn't very good.
College Freshman,1,"My process went fairly smooth, though there were quite a few forms I had to refill out and I had to have multiple meetings with the faculty in order to get the money I needed; but the things I have heard from my friends and other people are not so simple. There are many horror stories of forms being lost frequently, or just ignored. It takes so long for the offices to respond, especially to out of state students, that many people gave up trying to work with them until they were physically IN Ashland to deal with them. I am just grateful my process was an easy one and wish others the best of luck."
College Senior,1,Almost none-existent.  Especially if you don't drink or do drugs.
College Junior,1,Horrible opportunities for students to get money to go to school. SOU ROBS YOU BLIND!
College Junior,1,Not a big fan of the town. Spent more time in dorm than around town.
College Junior,1,"The staff is friendly, but I've had continued problems with my financial aid over the last 3 years and they don't seem very organized with their financial records. I'd make sure you keep good financial records yourself and stay on top of them."
College Freshman,1,"There are sometimes dances and such in our schools basement called Diversions, but other than that, unless you're 21 or you want to drive to Medford, there is not much going on for the younger crowd."

Junior,5,I love my university! I‚Äôve been here since I graduated high school and I am not in nursing school here. It is an awesome campus. Everyone is so friendly and kind. I would like to see more variety of restaurants on campus. It would be awesome if we could get a Chick-Fil-a on campus and maybe like an good burger place like Steak and Shake on campus.
Sophomore,5,"I have had a wonderful experience at the Mississippi University for Women thus. I have met wonderful people, joined organizations, and made the Dean‚Äôs List. I like that The W is a small campus, which means the classrooms are small. This gives people the opportunity to interact with professors more. I one thing a would change about The W is the food options, because we only have subway and the cafe."
Sophomore,5,"I love how friendly everyone is. Every professor is there to guide you on a successful path. The environment is great and positive. It‚Äôs a peaceful, well organized, successful university and I would recommend it to any and everyone."
Sophomore,5,"I love Mississippi University for Women has to offer.  The classes are challenging, but only because  they want the students to be the best they can be.  The professors are amazing.  They are very understanding and willing to help you with anything.  The campus is absolutely amazing, not too big and not too little.  The location is amazing."
Junior,5,MUW is a very small campus. I enjoy the small class sizes because this gives you one on one time with your professors. Professors are very helpful and the atmosphere on this campus is like a family.
Alum,5,"The W is a school that I would recommend to anyone! In fact, three of my family members currently attend the W. The W's small classroom sizes and beautiful campus is what drew me to this school. I felt at home when I stepped onto campus. The professors are phenomenal and they always respond to emails in a timely manner. I am grateful that I was fortunate enough to attend this school!"
Alum,5,"I loved the small class sizes, and the professors commitment and investment to the university. Many of my professors in speech-language pathology were alumni themselves. They thought so highly of the university that they wanted to continue the high quality education they received."
Junior,5,Small student-teacher ratio. It has a friendly environment. I would like to see more practical research based opportunities.
Sophomore,5,"The best thing I liked about Mississippi University For Women is the caring and helping nature of Professors. They know when you are absent, when you do not get involved on class, and when you have problems in class. They know you personally. So, if someone wants to learn and try to better, then he/she is in good hands of professors. If you miss any concept to catch in the class, you are always welcome to visit professors in office hours. I feel like I am getting 100% what I can get from professors."
Senior,5,"Excellent online RN to BSN program - very helpful instructors, good orientation. Give examples and resources to complete assignments."
Junior,5,I love the way that the professors are so helpful and inviting. I love how they take out the time to really break material down and I love the flexibility of the school. The classrooms are not big at all...so the professor has time to teach individually when necessary. I have really learned so much since I've been attending the W! Most importantly I just got accepted into the ASN RN program! I am so thrilled and excited!
Junior,5,The Mississippi University for Women is like home away from home. The staff and faculty is very supportive.
Junior,5,"I am a current student at the W. I love it there! The campus is beautiful and culturally diverse. Also, the classes are small so the teachers get to know you as a name instead of just a number."
Sophomore,5,The campus is full of different things. It‚Äôs a nice size which makes getting to class and campus events easier. Being in the center of downtown makes shopping easier for college to shop and be apart of the town festivities
Freshman,5,Great college! They are kind and always willing to work with you regardless ofor anything. Inexpensive for college as well and gives plenty of scholarship üëç
Freshman,5,"I love how they make me feel like family, although they are not your real family. My adviser feels like a mom to me. She makes sure I'm on the right track with classes, teachers and grades. When you are struggling in a subject, the teachers, counselors, and your peer will help you. The campus is very peaceful and beautiful. Everyone basically stays to themselves, and mind to their own needs unless someone else needs help. You get to meet a lot of new people who are very different from you, and you can learn so much from them. I love this school!"
Freshman,5,"It's a pretty good college to go to if you aren't looking for parties or distractions. Academically, we are TOP NOTCH. Our councilors make sure you are where you need to be and make sure you get your education. College life is actually pretty calm; you'll never see any arguments, parties, drugs, or fights going on. I encourage people to attend this very safe environment for their education to better their lives."
Freshman,5,"The Mississippi University for Women is a good store. When you are a freshman, they make you feel like your family when you first enter the gates. They are respectful, kind and helpful. They have a beautiful heart. I don‚Äôt believe theirs one thing I would change about my school, because it is prefect the way it is now. Although they don‚Äôt have many sports we still have many fun activities to participate in, such as: baseball, tennis, swimming team, softball and soccer. This is my home away from home I really enough it up here. Coming to the W was a very good choice for me, I feel like i‚Äôm at home with another side of the family! I love it up here and I believe anyone would!"
Senior,5,"My experience at MUW is awesome. It's a campus friendly place where people don't mind helping others. I love my instructors. I can contact them at any time if I have a question or issue and they will be sure to respond. The classes are 30 students or less, therefore, the instructors know who you are by name and not by a number. I wouldn't pick no other university."
Senior,5,"This is a wonderful institution where you can learn in a positive environment, mingle with other students, and further discover yourself."
College Junior,5,Courses are great to manage & complete assignments for. The professors are very supportive and understanding. They are willing to help with anything.
College Junior,5,The security is Great! I feel very safe on campus.
College Junior,5,I LOVE the dorms! They are wonderful!
College Senior,5,It's best and cheapest school
College Freshman,5,The professors and students at MUW are very nice and respectable. The students are always willing to help you when you are lost around campus. The professors are more than glad to help you when you are struggling with a concept in their class.
College Sophomore,5,They always have something for you to do so have as much fun as you can
College Senior,5,"The registration process is awesome and the faculty/professors help in advising students when registering for courses.whereby each student is assigned an adviser and the university strictly enforces by reminding students to always visit their academic advisors, and professors have an open door policy where they welcome students to those that are in need of assistance."
College Senior,5,The accounting department has friendly faculty professors that know each need of a student and invest their time to make sure each student succeeds.
College Senior,5,Turn in the required application with the supporting documents as early as possible to the office of admissions.
College Senior,5,"While some architectural work is needed, it is a very beautiful campus. Throughout the year the school provides a copious amount of social campus events, and have many traditions that have been respectfully upheld through the years. Students have several study spots and social hangouts on campus to take advantage of. Overall, very well kept."
College Senior,5,"It is hectic at times, but the results, more often than not, make it worth it.  I thoroughly enjoy the studio arts program here. The workload is not bad unless it is not attended to appropriately. Art projects are not tasks to be taken lightly. Beyond this, there are opportunities, but for the most part, the artist must make the effort to do what it takes to find that work."
College Senior,5,"The professors here work closely with students even outside of the classroom. There have been several times when this has proven most beneficial. I am most pleased with this aspect of my experience, despite the almost equally enjoyable experiences on the other topics. I feel that because of the more personal time discussing assignments and projects, has helped me to better understand my field of choice, and has opened doors to even more experiences."
College Junior,5,"Although I did not apply for financial aid I did receive two scholarships. One was a university scholarship and the other was a tuition guarantee scholarship. The only complaint is that the scholarships do not post until September so I was confused to whether or not I would be able to start school. However, when I called they were very helpful and answered all my questions."
College Junior,5,Small classes and professors willing to help you succeed. They do everything possible to help you pass and do well
College Junior,5,Everything was made very easy
College Junior,5,Many different types of folks from many different types of backgrounds
College Junior,5,Many services available to students in these cases
College Junior,5,I have not yet had one but would make the assumption that it is great
College Junior,5,Their Majors are turning out some of the best students in the country
College Junior,5,They are strict from what I understand and that is just because they have a reputation to uphold
College Junior,5,Very friendly and willing to help in everything and anything.
College Junior,5,"Again, everyone raves about the career prospects and how the school helps you find a job when you are done."
College Junior,5,Although I do not start until August every student that you speak to just raves about the classroom size and the professors.
College Junior,5,This campus has most everything for the average student including getting involved in many different social clubs. Would recommend that everyone come to visit this campus. Beautiful grounds and campus!!
College Junior,5,"I was admitted and accepted in an amazing amount of time, and have been welcomed kindly."
College Junior,5,"There is a variety of amenities that appeal to me, and this is very welcoming compared to my old colleges."
College Junior,5,"I believe in self-expression, and I have seen it here without any restrictions of dress code."
College Junior,5,The diversity here is exceptional. It opens doors and provides a solid collegic experiance.
College Senior,5,"As I said before, the college makes sure that member of the LGBTQ community feel safe and respected."
College Senior,5,Our university takes a very great deal of interest to ensure that members of the LGBTQ community feel safe and have people to go and talk to.
College Senior,5,We have a great gym and there are always student events going on.
College Sophomore,5,"The students are given the best quality safety through visitation hours, closing gates at dusk, and police being on duty 24/7."
College Senior,5,"At Mississippi University for Women it is unlike many other universities considering it is located in an older city, but as a student you will feel as if MUW is your home away from home."
College Sophomore,5,Historic Columbus is beautiful! There are many places that a student hang out and have a good time. 
College Sophomore,5,In Mississippi the weather is unpredictable. One day it might be nice and sunny the next it will dark and raining. 
College Sophomore,5,The school does not allow any kind of alcohol or drugs on campus. For the most part I do not hear anyone talking about participating in that kind of scene. 
College Sophomore,5,the financial aid department is more than willing to work with each student and is very helpful.
College Sophomore,5,I have not been accepted into the nursing program yet. 
College Sophomore,5,Mississippi University for Women offers an array of academics. Each professor has their own style of instructing and will work with the student if they need assistance. We also have many places to study on campus that does not include sitting in the residence halls. 
College Sophomore,5,"The nursing program is fantastic. It is one of the most recognized in Mississippi. Once I graduate, I know I will be more than equipped to take on the role of being a nurse. "
Sophomore,4,"I would like to see some more student events on campus. Overall, I have had a good experience and am glad to be a student at MUW. Dorm life could use a few improvements and I wish there was more to do on campus."
Junior,4,"I absolutely love the W so far! The staff are so welcoming and nice. They offer so many scholarships that benefited me very well. It so many opportunities for growth here! I just wish it was not so far from home. Someone was always available to answer any questions. If one person was not sure of the answer, they made a way to figure it out. The W always had events to invite you to come out and have a good time, and provided for friends and family as well. The staff members have great communication skills. They always notified students in a timely manner of and issue or events for our convenience. I recommend this school to everyone!!"
Sophomore,4,"The W is an amazing college for students to attend after graduating from high school. The staff, food, and academics is great for a variety of students. Even though we lack sports, it is still a great college to attend."
Alum,4,"The environment is supportive and people are friendly. The university contains great professor and even the administrative department are very helpful. The University gives its best to support its student in every way possible. It provides transportation to the nearby international airport which is helpful for both the domestic and international student. In addition, the university provides temporary accommodation for an international student, which allows the international student to understand the difference between living on campus or off campus."
Junior,4,"Most of the teachers care about their students. I have had ones who are always ""too busy"" to every be helpful. There is always something going on around campus and the classes are no larger than 25 people. Great school. People are open to hearing opinions"
Junior,4,I have had a great experience at MUW so far. The teachers are very helpful with any questions you might have. I am so glad I am attending MUW.
Senior,4,It was a good school thus far. I learned a lot. There is a lot of clicking amongst peers. I wish there was more to do outside of social clubs.  It everyone wants to be in a social club
Junior,4,"MUW is a great school to go to. It is a small university, but because of that students can get one-on-one help from their professors. The university is beginning to expand with the addition of a few sports, with more to come in the next few years. With tuition being one of the lowest for a university in this state, it make MUW a great choice."
Junior,4,"My overall experience has been great. The faulty is great and the campus is safe. I like the atmosphere of the university. It's pretty quiet and the perfect environment for hardworking students. The party scene is very limited. Nothing really happens on campus party wise, most of that activity happens in Starkville. If we do have parties it is organized by a school club."
Junior,4,"I have really enjoyed my time here at Mississippi University for Women. It is a really nice campus and it is very diverse. I also enjoy going to social gatherings to support the different clubs and social groups. What I would have have to like the most about this campus are the cherry blossom trees. In the spring the cherry blossom trees on campus bloom to perfection. The only thing I would change or add on to are the selection of eateries or the lack there of, on campus. That's just for on campus though. On some days I would like to eat more than just Subway."
College Junior,4,Everyone is very involved. They attend each other games. They support each other.
College Junior,4,"Security on campus is relatively good, but our campus is easily accessible so that is were the worrying comes in"
College Junior,4,Overall the individuala who work for this school are very helpful and caring at the same time and they will help you do what's best for.
College Junior,4,Drugs and alcohol are practically non-existent on campus. If people are caught they have to visit the Dean of Students.
College Junior,4,Kincannon is the worst place to live at on campus but once you go to the upperclassmen dorms they are better.
College Junior,4,Campus is a safe place to live but once you leave the gates it becomes unsafe. Columbus is notorious for their crime due to the lack of respect of their own community.
College Junior,4,I have heard of many people getting internships and jobs after graduation.
College Junior,4,The W is a great school to attend. It is an unsafe environment due to the surrounding areas but the education they provide is one of the best in Mississippi. The most I have ever had in a class is 50 which is a lot for the W - it was a class everybody has to take.
College Freshman,4,"MUW does not have Varsity sports teams. There are only intramurals which I enjoy because although I enjoy playing certain sports, I did not have the chance to play for my high school's team, therefore, I would most likely be cut from other school's teams."
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy attending MUW because the Professors really care about students' success and are willing to help in any way they can. Class rooms are also small which gives rise to the opportunity for a genuine student-professor relationship.
College Sophomore,4,"I love MUW! It has been great so far, and I have learned so much in my first semester."
College Freshman,4,The people on the campus really care you.
College Freshman,4,"The schedule is much better than high school, for I can choose my schedule and have time to work to save money. My university was once an all women's school, though now it is coed, and I find that very interesting. If I could do it all over again, I would keep the size the same, but many a school in a different area."
College Junior,4,The W is a great school for Nursing. I have heard nothing but great comments about the Program.
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is a great experience. You have a chance to make new friends and get a feeling of how it is to live without your parents. It shows your maturity level. You get a chance to see how well you handle things on your own without having your parents by your side through every decision you make. The dorm experience has its pros and cons. My dorm room was pretty small. Being that my roommate and I both had a lot of belongings, it took some getting used to. Living on campus was very convenient because you do not have far to walk when trying to get to class on time. Over all campus housing has more pros than it does cons. Although it takes some getting used to it is definitely a great experience."
College Sophomore,4,Its not easy because its not meant to be easy
College Sophomore,4,We never really have any problems on campus
College Senior,4,"Turn in applications as early as possible

Always follow up."
College Senior,4,"The process was surprisingly more simple to get into. However, the quality of the work was a major factor in order to make it into the BFA program. As for admissions, definitely need to make sure that all required paperwork is completed beforehand, that is feasible to complete then."
College Senior,4,"Though it was a pain to get the process started, however the office of financial aid helped me and answered every question I had. This made the process more worth it."
College Senior,4,"In simplest terms, this school's administration takes care of their students. They do not, however, take any case such drinking, drug use, hazing, etc. lightly, and administer the consequences appropriately. They take their student's academics very seriously, and provide students with the proper help they need."
College Senior,4,"Many students take a part in intramurals, as it provides both a outlet and social opportunities for them. While we do not have a varsity team, we have many students who take advantage of the recreation center's gym. I would go as far as to say that athleticism is highly encouraged among a good portion of students."
College Senior,4,"Diversity is widely recognized on campus. For the most part, everyone is accepting of the various lifestyles of each other. Social life here is booming. With several on-campus social clubs, sororities, and fraternities on campus, along with many other organizations, there are plenty of social opportunities in which to take part."
College Senior,4,"There are a lot of cultural opportunities to experience. Once a year is the Market Street Festival, which host a variety of musical talent, crafts vendors, games, and the like. A definite attractive here is the River Walk, which gives several opportunities to take long or short walks, bike rides, take photographs, or just relax. It is a very relaxing atmosphere. This city is very student friendly, and on occasion, helps them out through offers and promotions."
College Senior,4,"Living on campus is satisfying. As for the dorms, they are well taken care of, and on-call maintenance is there within reasonable amounts of times to fix any mechanical issues. Though I am more introverted than most, I do enjoy the copious amounts of social opportunities to promote a positive social atmosphere. Overall, my campus experience has been primarily positive, and it has been very enjoyable thus far."
College Junior,4,We do have shopping available here but you will find a better variety of shopping if you travel an hour to the north or an hour to the east. More shopping selections.
College Junior,4,I am an older student so I do not partake in this but I would say that the clubs or bars are very nice with reasonably priced food and drinks
College Junior,4,The university just a few years ago become co-ed so the sports have not yet become the forefront of college life on this campus and I do not believe they ever will.
College Senior,4,"Being in the program is fantastic. I have the opportunity to live and work abroad, I take a range of classes to help further my professional development and being able to perform with other theater companies in Europe is something I am looking forward to and part of the program."
College Junior,4,I see no harsh restrictions on this campus. It seems reasonable.
College Junior,4,I am able to have a real four-year experience close to home.
College Junior,4,I love the off-campus dining in this college city.
College Junior,4,I feel like the security of the campus is just what is considered enough.
College Senior,4,"I think it's pretty fair. However, at night the guards at the watch house don't do any more than wave us on, even if it's like two in the morning. Luckily no one has let in a murderer or anything."
College Senior,4,"I'm happy to attend a very diverse college and to share classes with Christians to Buddhists. The general student body seems very tolerant of different religions, sexual orientations, etc. and for that I'm very happy."
College Senior,4,All of the professors are great and willing to help. Everything gets pretty hectic around midterms and finals just because any project a professor gives is going to be due around that time.
College Senior,4,"Since I'm majoring in history, the workload around midterms and finals is pretty overwhelming. Fifteen page essay here, ten pages there; It's all very difficult if you don't manage your time properly."
College Sophomore,4,Friendly staff. Diverse meals. Delicious treats. TV entertainment and sometimes live entertainment. Clean and flowing. Always up for recommendations.
College Senior,4,"It is an older town. If you take the time to explore you'll find entertainment outside of the normal ""college scene""."
College Senior,4,"There's a lot of ethnicities, lifestyles, religions, etc on campus. There's always someone outside of your comfort zone worth meeting and becoming friends with."
College Senior,4,The psychology department is awesome.
College Senior,4,MUW has a wonderful security system in place. Can it be improved? Yes! Nothing is perfect.
College Freshman,4,Food and dining options are great here. 
College Freshman,4,"The teachers here are very helpful. Since there are not a lot of students in the class, the teachers teach their lessons like one on one. "
College Freshman,4,"The weather here is just a mixture. When it is raining, sunny, cold, hot, cool, etc. it does not effect our attitude. "
College Freshman,4,"The computers are pretty decent. There is only one printer in the computer hall though.
"
College Freshman,4,"Mississippi University for Women is located close to the town area of Columbus, MS. The people here are nice and always interactive. There are many places that you can go to eat but not such a great mall here. Mississippi University for Women make you feel like you're at home with your family."
College Sophomore,4,"Small campus, You basically know everyone there unless it's someones guest."
College Sophomore,4,The people here are okay. I don't talk to most of them but they ones I do know are nice.
College Sophomore,4,"My overall school experience is great because the people are friendly and the environment is great as well. I like that it's a quiet town and there is little to no crime in town. I will choose it again because it's close to home, I feel safe, and I'm able to learn everything I need to know for my degree. "
Niche User,2,"Not much to do so your social life will suffer. School is right next to bad neighborhood, so rapes and shootings are always happening. My biggest issue is the college of nursing. The associates degree program has terrible first year professors and faculty. If you are an ethnic minority, be careful because you will be discriminated against. I do not recommend."
Freshman,2,"Mississippi University for Women is very nice campus for people who like small surroundings and small classes. It's not a very big campus, it kind of reminds me of high school. One thing I would like to see change about the campus is the dining. We have very little restaurants to eat and choose from. Our only main option to spend our flex dollars at is Subway, and not everyone likes Subway."
College Junior,2,We actually are just now getting a athletic department thus year.
College Senior,2,I never had enough money for my books throughout my semester. I always had to go out of pocket to buy books. My loans were always the lowest amount and when i tried to up the amount they said I couldn't because it was already maxed.
College Senior,2,"The cafe food has went downhill since my sophomore year. At first it was okay but now they try to decorate the food to make it look appetizing. It only makes it worse. The only I eat is mostly fries and burgers , and occasional sandwiches."
College Sophomore,2,Parties here are kinda boring so its best to just chill out with friends instead
College Senior,2,"There is limited funding available to support the students in the MFA program, but there is something."
College Senior,2,Not very much nightlife around town.
College Freshman,2,Everyone here hardly go partying.
College Sophomore,2,The food isn't the best. That's as nice as I can possibly be about it.
College Sophomore,2,The school has many computer labs for the students and printing areas. The internet is slow at the moment but they are looking into making it better. 
College Sophomore,2,On campus parking fills up quickly for commuters. Finding parking off campus can be difficult also. 
College Freshman,2,"It is best to get an apartment, for they are cheaper and nicer, as well as give the option not to live with so many people in one place. The dorms definitely need some work, so it is advised to look into apartments either freshmen or sophomore years, since the dorms for them are the worst on campus. If you like being able to cook for yourself and not have to rely on a questionable cafeteria, get an apartment. Cooking is severely limited in the freshmen dorms, and only slightly better in the sophomore+ dorms."
College Freshman,2,"To say the least the main cafeteria does the least. The food is not that great most of the time. I usually go to the sandwich line or the pasta line. I get tired of burgers and fires so I don't go to the grill too often, and I don't really like pizza. I go to the salad bar a good bit too. Fried chicken Tuesdays are the cafeteria's busiest days. The chicken really is good. The faculty even comes to eat the chicken. There are also two other little places on campus. One place is the science building called On The Go and a Subway tied in with the dining plan."
College Sophomore,2,There isn't any transportation here at the W . Students have to provide there on transportation.
College Sophomore,2,"Hard to Find Spots on Campus ‚Äì It is a small campus, but there is still barely any parking spots on campus. if you are running late, you might as well not go because you probably wont get a spot"
College Senior,2,"Athletics are not a big part of MUW, therefore, there is not much school spirit or fan involvement."
College Freshman,2,"Late Again.. Parking is also another issue. I never realized that there were so many teachers at the MUW campus based on the amount of green parking sections available (green is for the teachers and white is for the students). It makes it a bit harder to actually find a closer parking when things are hectic on some mornings and often we students have to park on the opposite side of the campus to the class we're trying to get to. This makes us late, and because we're late we suffer the consequences."
College Junior,2,Dining Hall ‚Äì the dining hall is somewhat big. The students have to do a rotation schedule where a few classes go to lunch at a certain time then the other classes come in at different times. The dining hall is well organized with two lines for the students to go through.
College Sophomore,1,"When it rains it floods bad on campus. Sometimes if the weather gets too bad, the fire alarm goes off."
College Sophomore,1,I am not eligible for financial aid because they said I already have a degree and my loans are maxed out.
College Senior,1,"The parking for administration and professors are great...but student parking sucks! There is not enough efficient parking for the students enrolled at MUW. The parking that you may happen to run across is ""miles"" away from the class buildings and the ""parking lots"" are filled with pot holes and gravel that is harsh on your car tires."
College Senior,1,"You can use your flex plan at subway and simply to go.If you don't have time to eat in the cafe you can get a to go plate for 75 cents and take it out. It's all you can eat in the cafeteria. The menus are  different except for Tuesday where there is always chicken day. It's all you can eat for 7 dollars, but the food isn't worth it, and you more than likely will not go back and get 2nds."
College Senior,1,In my opinion we need transportation for the campus.We need a shuttle to and off campus for the people who don't have cars and not enough money to call taxi's.
College Senior,1,"If you do not have class at 8 and are there on time, terrible luck finding parking!"
College Senior,1,"It is a small campus, but there are no transportation options other than your own car."
College Sophomore,1,"Boring, Lackluster Options ‚Äì There is very little to do around here aside from going out to eat. The options for dining are rather limited with only a handful of really good restaurants in town. There are no real clubs, only one movie theater, a bowling alley, and a skating rink. THAT IS IT!!!"
College Student,1,"Here you need some type of transportation to get to stores, espeically once it gets cold outside. Not all the good stores are close by campus. They don't even have buses."

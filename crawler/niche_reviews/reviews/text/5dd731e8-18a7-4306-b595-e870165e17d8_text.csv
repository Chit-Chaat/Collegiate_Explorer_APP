Sophomore,5,what I like about this college is that it is not to big but also not to small so you can can get to your class on time. what I also like is that all the teachers really want you to learn so they will take time out of their day to help you.

Freshman,5,"I've taken three college courses as a high schooler through Lewis-Clark State College.

I highly recommend for other high school students wanting to get a head start in their career to take college classes through LCSC."
Freshman,5,There is such an amazing environment and feel for the school and it makes the whole experience great.
Freshman,5,"Even though it is only my first year, so far it is all that I expected it to be. The professor's really do care about you and know you by name, the student workers are so very helpfully. All around a great collage"

Sophomore,5,"I love the small class size of all my classes, it is nice to have professors who are always there for you and who want to see you succeed.

Senior,5,"The nursing program is amazing. They couldn’t possibly find better professors! Very thorough teaching with the most up-to-date information. Highly interactive and many opportunities to serve the community. Also very affordable. The only downside is there is limited parking, which I think is an issue at any college."
Freshman,5,I think it’s got a good way of helping each and every student. It’s been a great choice so far. Being Able to email professors and hearing back from them shows that they care. And want you to feel validated and important enough to help any way possible.

Freshman,5,"The teachers are understanding and willing to work with you! Plus, its smaller classes so you really get to know the subject."

Sophomore,5,"The atmosphere is great! My experience at this college has been nothing short of excellent! I love the small class sizes, the town it's in, and their exercise science program is phenomenal."
Freshman,5,I am the first one in my family to go to college.  So far it is a great experience.  There is plenty of assistance given when needed.  I have received help with tutoring and choosing classes for upcoming semester.

Overall, I believe Lewis-Clark State College is one of the best colleges to go to for a higher education."
Sophomore,5,"Lewis-Clark State College is a great college that has many fun activities and great professors that really care about you and your education. They are always willing to help and come in for office hours to help you. And if you are in baseball then we have one of the best teams in the country! The community is great and there are good walking/running trails, hiking trails, and a Wal-wart (hey that matters to college students)!"

I have learned a lot so far about a wide variety of topics, such as, who painted the Sistine chapel and how to calculate interest on loans. The knowledge I've acquired while attending has been practical and applicable to my everyday life. I would recommend this college to potential students because it is easy to apply and on top of being beneficial to future career goals it is a lot of fun."
College Freshman,5,All the staff work to give the best experience to the students
College Freshman,5,We have a lot of support for any kind of emergency situation including our security staff who help any time they are notified or called. There's also a room on campus called the blue door that if you aren't comfortable or feel like you're In a bad situation you can lock the door and call security and they can come grab you and take you back where you need
College Freshman,5,Everyone is supportive. The teams have great fans.
College Junior,5,Applying was great- they're so helpful & genuine.
College Junior,5,I have been to several schools- this is the best!
College Freshman,5,"I love living on campus for the social atmosphere, but we need more housing on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"Very high grad school placement, s\one of the best in the Northwest"
College Sophomore,5,Professors work with local businesses to help students get a job/internship in their desired field. This helps students make sure they enjoy the work they are getting a degree in.
College Sophomore,5,"I love the courses that are offered at LCSC. I love the professional technical programs, because they give you a chance to earn credit for the work that you do in that specific field. It gives you real life experience that otherwise you would have to get after you graduate."
College Sophomore,5,"Safety is great at LCSC. I have never felt unsafe, even while walking to my car at night. There is adequate lighting and security is very present."
College Sophomore,5,My overall experience has been out standing. I love everything about it; the energy of the professors to the support for one another. My program was filled with people from all types of backgrounds. We could all come together to help each other an make sure that we succeeded as a group/class rather than looking out for only ourselves. You really feel like a family at LCSC!
College Sophomore,5,LCSC has the best fans and supporters. The whole community is involved in the sports teams. It is a great thing to be apart of!
College Freshman,5,We don't have it here.
College Sophomore,5,"Lewis-Clark State College is such an amazing school to attend. All the professors I have had so far treat you as a student and not just another number. They all want the very best for you and are willing to help you in any way they can. I like how small LCSC is, it is the perfect size and in a way the school and students there become your second family."
College Sophomore,5,There is a large variety of places to go to and many of them are open late!
College Freshman,5,Lots of restaurants to choose from and great food!
College Junior,5,Its a great set up they gave me the map and course checklist and let me decide how and what pace to go at.

College Junior,5,They are all their individual persons. and their actions reflect their personalities.
College Junior,5,They understand being young but at the same time keep campus clean and enjoyable.
Senior,4,"Lewis-Clark State College was not my first choice but it was arguably my best choice. The location of the college is well centered and the size is good for individuals who are looking for a place that is quiet and comforting. At LCSC, I have found that students are not just numbers to the staff, but they are people. Everybody knows everybody even though the numbers are constantly growing. A big part of why I came to LCSC was the cost. It is very affordable and it gave me the opportunity to continue my passion for athletics as I am part of the LC State Track and Field team. It has been the best experience of my life to be part of this team. The academics are powerful at this college and the small class sizes really help the students learn. Each and every professor is well driven to their practices and it shows that they care for the students. Even though LCSC is an older college, it is still a college worth looking into."
Niche User,4,"Great school, everything on campus is close together and feels very home-like. Looking forward to living there."
Freshman,4,Lewis Clark State College focuses solely on academics and supports you from admission to graduation.
Freshman,4,The thing I like about LCSC is that its more of a 1v1 with the professors than in comparison to many other schools. One thing that I would like to see a change to the school would be more diversity!
Sophomore,4,"I am in my second semester here at Lewis-Clark State College. I have really liked my professors and classes. I am happy with the smaller student population and campus. I am planning on staying here to get Bachelors degree in Publishing Arts. 
The facilities aren't too great, but that is because the school is old and it's a non-profit school which I understand."
Sophomore,4,"Small college, understanding proffessors willing to help work with you to succeed. Small area so easy drive times."
Niche User,4,I enjoyed the campus life very much. Student involvement and academics were extremely important to the faculty and extra curricular activities and very much encouraged.
Sophomore,4,They work with students with disabilities and make it so everyone can achieve their dreams.  The professor's work hard at grading farely and allowing students to work in team settings but also holding the teams accountable for making sure everyone on the teams do their part and don't slack.
Sophomore,4,My first semester of college was very different. I grew up going to a very small school so it was a big change. What I love about LCSC is they have so many tools and different tutoring labs that give students the chance to reach out if they are struggling in certain subjects. What I would maybe change in certain classes is more hands on time with the students from the professors.
Freshman,4,My experience that LCSC is very helpful to get into and the people at lewis-clark State College are very nice. faculties very helpful and they really try to go out of their way to help you graduate or even to get a better grade. I took me no time to get into the LCSC. The sports programs they're great! I may even do my Graduate Studies here too! I have several counselors that are willing to be there day in and day out tell me through any process. The food there is pretty good in the cafeteria the locals around the area are great. You can even raise a family here and it be a great place to live in. the only real problem I ever had was getting parking space but that's like and you were you go a great college has lots of people thank you sincerely Daniel Jackson
Senior,4,The professors are amazing and really care about each individual student. You an expect to have the same professors over and over and to build lasting relationshiuips with those studetns in your classse.
Sophomore,4,"Lewis-Clark State College may not have a very large campus, but the professors and staff care greatly about the success of current and future students. There are numerous opportunities for academic, social, and community activities to better students as well as the community as a whole. Overall I am very pleased to say that I am a student at Lewis-Clark State College."
Senior,4,"I like the flexibility of LCSC. I am able to take interesting and engaging classes online. When I need help, they are always willing to help in any way that they can."
Senior,4,"I am a student athlete at LCSC and I love it here. It's fairly easy to get into classes you need. Advisors are not much help when it comes to student athletes, they need specific advisors for athletes. Most professors work with schedules and missed work but some really don't."
Niche User,4,I loved the small campus and they have great professors that are very attentive and want to help you succeed!
Senior,4,The campus was very homy and felt like a good place to be. The people there treated me with respect and did not treat me like I was a child.
Senior,4,"I wish they would put less money into sports and more money into newer buildings, better equipment for the gyms, a more up to date library, and more women's activities and opportunities for intermural's. The teachers, on the other hand, are phenomenal, especially in the nursing program, and go above and beyond to help students when the need it."
Junior,4,"Most teachers show enthusiam when teaching their subject and take time out to help their students one on one. They try to get the students together and always have great campus events for everyone to attend. They have a great, clean campus."
Junior,4,Lewis-Clark State college is a good four year institution that has allowed me to experience important obstacles in my life. I feel like I am always able to talk to someone if I need help with something relating to school. LC and people here have given me the confidence that I will graduate with my BA. I have met many good people here and will continue to do so till I graduate.
Sophomore,4,Lewis-Clark State College is personable to say the very least. It is responsive to the concerns of it's students. One quality that I've always admired is the ease of communication with professors and staff. There has never been a problem that couldn't be resolved by simply talking with the correct person here. LCSC has the resources of a larger university and the quality interpersonal touch of a community college.
Freshman,4,"I love going to Lewis-Clark State College. I graduated from a small high school, so going to LC wasn't much of a big change for me. The class sizes are pretty small, which I like because I get more one-on-one time with my peers and my professors. When I have back to back classes, it's easy for me to get to the different buildings in time for my classes. The professors are always extremely helpful whenever I have a problem or need help. Everyone at the college is very helpful. The dorms are very well taken care of and maintenance is always kept up. Overall, I would say that my college experience has been amazing at LCSC. One thing that I would change about the college would be to make clubs and groups easier to join. It seems to me like the clubs were already full from previous people in the years before, so I would make them easier and more available to get into. This would help to increase the how freshmen can involved in the college experience."
Junior,4,"I really love this school. I love that the teachers know you on a first name basis, and will help you achieve any goals you make. I love knowing that there are so many services that are there to help you. In fact, I am apart of TRIO, and they have helped me in so many ways. They helped me enroll in school, plan my courses, find a job, find a house, and they even are there to tutor me when I need help. At this time LCSC is undergoing a shortage of teachers, which has made my experience a little less satisfying. However, it is still an amazing school."
Sophomore,4,"I like the help you can get from the teachers. If you are struggling, they really seem to want to help. As long as you show you want to succeed, they will try their hardest to get you where you need to be. My math teacher is the first one since I was in junior high that could explain math to me in a way that makes sense, and that means a lot because I always felt like I couldn't succeed due to the fact that I just could not get math. I also work weekend swing shifts, and my auto body instructor has made an exception for me so I can go to school and keep my job."
Freshman,4,"I like the smaller setting, it really allows me to have more one-on-one time with my professors. I would like to see the campus expand though, and become a bigger school. "
College Freshman,4,Not really any issue with drug or alcohol and in situations where they may be present there is no negative peer pressure
College Freshman,4,Teachers generally care about their students and their understanding of topics. They actually want to see everyone do well.
College Freshman,4,The only part that isn't so awesome is the walk to campus. It's about a mile or so.
College Freshman,4,There is a lot of student involvement in the sports and a very high school spirit. The sports facilities are clean and big enough for many students to use them to stay fit or train while on a team. The people at Lewis-Clark are very encouraging to students to get involved no matter your skill level. The sports scene is competitive and fun!
College Freshman,4,"I would choose this school again because the professors care about you as an individual and want to help you be as successful as you can. I love how everyone does their very best to make you feel welcomed your first year there. The people are friendly, helpful and considerate."
College Freshman,4,There is great security on campus. There are also many phones on campus you can call for a security guard to take you to your dorm at night. There is also great lighting at night.
College Freshman,4,There is a great variety of courses offered. The class sizes are small which allows for more one on one time with your professor.
College Freshman,4,There are many opportunities for internships and jobs available on and off campus.
College Freshman,4,I loved living on campus. There were many activities always going on and a it's a great way to meet new people. It is also a short walk to class.
College Freshman,4,For athletic activities there is a lot of student envolvement. The athletes have great sportsmanship and are passionate about what they do. There is a ton of school spirt. Our teams are some of the best teams in the nation.
College Student,4,The basketball court is a little small but but really cool and the weight room is well supplied
College Student,4,A lot of the upper classmen are helpful to the incoming freshmen
College Sophomore,4,"I've always felt safe on campus. The campus is well lit, security does 24/7 patrolling, and there are emergency alarms placed periodically throughout campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't had a course yet that I haven't learned something from. I've had many great professors, and a few that aren't so great. Most of the not so great professors were found in the humanities department. They were relatively nice people, just kinda self-absorbed. There are a lot of different types of courses offered at this school. I do wish they had an orchestra for people who play stringed instruments like me. Class sizes are remarkably small, which I think definitely helps in the learning process. All of my professors have known my name and little bits of information about me, which is nice. Online classes have always gone smoothly for me without major technical issues."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm a nursing major, so I know that my degree will allow me to get a job quickly after graduation. For many other degrees, internships in the applicable field are required during the junior or senior year in order to graduate. I think that this helps graduates earn a job since they have some experience built into their degree that is relevant. I've never used the career center."
College Sophomore,4,"There's always signage and flyers going around campus about upcoming baseball, volleyball, basketball, etc. games. We don't have a school football team, so I think that definitely has an impact on school spirit and turnout to games, but it's still always hard to find a seat at any varsity game. There is also a lot of community turnout for games as well. The NAIA World Series is hosted at LC, which is always a huge deal on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I really love how small and intimate the classes are. I've never had a professor that didn't know my name. The quality of the education I'm receiving compared to the cost of tuition is amazing. LCSC has the cheapest tuition out of any of the four year schools in Idaho, which is something I definitely appreciate. The library and library staff are always amazing and very helpful when it comes to research. There are so many great ways to get involved on campus."
College Freshman,4,I love living in the dorms. My roommates are nice and almost every bodies freindly. The social atmosphere is great. they have lots of events you can participate in which helps with making friends. All the events I've been to have been really fun.
College Freshman,4,Lewis Clark State College is a great school. Everyone is friendly and is willing to help you if you need it.
College Freshman,4,"We have a lot of student athletes, and they are really devoted to their sport."
College Freshman,4,"We have great security services, but we still have had issues with people damaging cars parked on campus."
College Freshman,4,Professors really care about their student's success; good variety of classes.
College Freshman,4,lots of Indians and asians
College Sophomore,4,"We have security available 24/7 who offer anything they can do to ensure our safety. Several things may include walking students from their car to the dorm in the middle of the night, letting students into their dorm if they lost their key and providing a phone service for any emergency at all hours of the day."
College Sophomore,4,"Although I have not pursued looking into job/internship prospects, I know the school is very focussed on helping students be successful with their future career goals. Almost all of the staff is extremely friendly and willing to work side by side students to help them succeed."
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy my classes, professors and overall atmosphere of campus. I value how all of my professors are passionate about what they teach and make it a priority to get to know students on a personal level. My classes sizes are relatively small (15-30) which makes learning much more personal and motivating."
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the dorm I live on campus! It's about a ten minute walk to the school, but I like having that small distance to separate my school life from the rest of my life."
College Sophomore,4,"I have been involved in three intramural sports so far. They include: soccer, basketball and volleyball. I have attended multiple basketball and baseball games and have always enjoyed my time with friends supporting our school! Our baseball and basketball teams have both won our division (NAIA) championships and it's been an incredible time to be part of such a successful sports school!"
College Sophomore,4,"I thoroughly enjoy the atmosphere at school. I love that the classes are small enough for me and my professors and classmates are able to have personal relationships. I would definitely choose this college again due to my satisfaction with class material, relationships built, affordable costs, etc."
College Sophomore,4,"It's good, but there's hardly any cases of assault or anything"
College Sophomore,4,"Good school but little party scene, athletics are okay"
College Sophomore,4,"Good, everyone knows everyone, but not much goes on as far as partying goes"
College Sophomore,4,"Good teams for the level we're at, but not much school spirit and pride in sports, unlike other schools nearby"
College Sophomore,4,"Good school and athletics, but no social life and nowhere to party"
College Junior,4,"It's safe in here, barely see crime in here, the campus is the safest."
College Junior,4,I get really good advice about the future from my advicer.
College Junior,2,They don't help with off campus living. They want us to live in their dorms.
College Junior,2,"I can't afford to live on campus anymore and am forced to do online classes only because ""I ran out of resources."" When we called financial aid to get help, they didn't help at all and said that I'd have to wait until I'm 23 in order to apply for loans."
College Junior,2,There is not much of a choice when it comes to restaurants in Lewiston. There are a few pretty good local restaurants but they do not give many student discounts. You will pay the same at any of them as you would in other places. To get to them you defiantly need a car but once you do get a ride or something it like a less than five minute drive to mostly any of the restaurants.
College Freshman,2,Its either someone has a car that can drive places or its walking. Calling for a taxi or a shuttle is too much money. So if the weatheer is permitting then walking is an option but not in the winter time.
College Junior,2,I wish there was more variety. There are some really cute locally owned places though.
College Junior,2,"The airport is close, but the bus is way out of town. I'm not sure about trains, I don't think we have that here."
College Freshman,2,"Being a smaller town without gold mines surrounding it, and that being the field I am going into I am not complaining though."
College Junior,2,"The campus dining is not open all day, therefore cannot accommodate all students and their schedules. The food is rather bland, and very expensive."
College Junior,2,"In a lot of ways Lewis-Clark is strict, especially when it comes to the academic  success of students. They do take role in on-campus classes which counts towards your grade. If you miss too many classes, you will fail the course. 
In other ways, there is leniency in students private lives. There is not intense campus security so people are able to live their lives as adults."
College Sophomore,2,"I love Lewiston and there is a lot you can do! You just have to be creative and think outside of the box. There is a good party scene in the LC Valley but there is going to be a party scene almost everywhere you go, it's just up to you if you choose to be a part of it or be creative and find something else fun to do such as: walk/run/bike on the levvy, go bowling, go out for froyo, ice blocking, to the park, ultimate frisbee, hiking, dollar theatre, etc."
College Sophomore,2,"There are some places for 21+ students to go for ""nightlife"" but I don't think there is much out there for underage students. I am a non-traditional student and I don't have much of a ""nightlife"" anyway so I am not really up on what the kids are doing."
College Junior,2,"Lewiston, Idaho Sucks – I love my school. However, the town where the school is located is NOT a college town. It is a retirement town. There is not much to do and the people are not kind. Pretty much the only way you can have something to do on the weekend is if you are 21. The town is generally pretty safe and secure, it's just boring."
College Freshman,2,There isn't really any housing close to campus.  The houses/apartments that are close are expensive and not very clean.  They look like they've been abandoned or completely trashed.  The nicer houses are further away from the college and shouldn't be used unless the student wants to drive everyday.
College Sophomore,2,"Not Many Greeks – The Greek ""scene"" at LCSC is little to none. There are a few fraternity and sororities but the overall presence is not like larger universities."
Junior,1,"I do not think words can properly express how much I have hated attending this college.  The administration has been completely unhelpful with resolving any of the issues I have ever presented to them, and the faculty is lazy and doesn't bother to provide any amount of instructing to its students.  Now I find out the bookstore is taking advantage of its students by ""up-selling"" textbooks that aren't actually required for courses.  Run, don't walk away from this college!"

Niche User,1,"Worst college in America. 100% acceptance, 30% graduated. That's gotta be a record.

Worst place I have ever worked, and for the lowest pay. 

Broken promises, awful faculty,  and a crappy looking campus rounds out the high points the place has going for it."
College Junior,1,None that I am aware of.
College Sophomore,1,"We only have one sorority, and they do not have a house or anything like that. You can also only be in the sorority if you are Latina."
College Freshman,1,There is no party life at Lewis-Clark State College at all.
College Freshman,1,There is no transportation provided by the school.
College Sophomore,1,I don't believe there is even a Greek Life. 
College Junior,1,There is no transportation option at my school.
College Sophomore,1,"There are two coffee places that are fairly good, but the actual dining hall isn't very impressive. It has the basic pizza, hamburger, and taco bars, as well as the daily menu items, but little to no vegetarian options."
College Sophomore,1,"There are about 5 party houses in town, several of which are pretty weird and/or sketchy. There are very few bars, and absolutely no options geared toward underage students."
College Sophomore,1,"Very Few – LC has very few scholarships that I know of.  A good, big scholarship can make the difference between me being a struggling student and me being a superstar student.  If I had a good 20k or so scholarship I could easily get all A's and all the things I need and wouldn't have to worry about having a place to live, like I do now as I'm homeless."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Cold in the winter, hot in the summer, but the low altitude prevents any significant snowfall."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Food is...meh, some places but on a students budget nothing worth harping about."
College Junior,1,Expensive to Cheap – Last semester the parking permits were an about $50 and now they lowered the cost to only $5. this has affected the parkign situations in a big way. There is almost no where to park because everbody was able to purchase the parking permits this semester.
College Junior,1,The school doesn't allow skateboarding on-campus which I think it should be okay for students to use skateboards to get across campus as long as they are safe and respectful.
College Junior,1,"Housing Options – There are too few on-campus options, there should be more summer housing options and familes/couples' options."
College Student,1,There is no off campus dining close to the campus !

Niche User,5,"Everything I have learned about WKU has been so amazing. Also, there virtual tours were awesome, and the people were so nice."
Niche User,5,"I did two virtual tours for WKU and they had so many different tours. You could learn all about the specific department you wanted to go in, and you could also ask questions. There virtual tours were never pre-recorded. All of them are live."
Junior,5,"Such a great school to go to, the tuition is great, the campus is beautiful, and full of student activities and all of the teachers are super kind and helpful."
Niche User,5,"I have only recently been accepted into the university. Therefore, I cannot give a proper claim or opinion."
Niche User,5,I've only ever toured them and had one on one conversations with the professors about programs and I already know that this school provides upmost support when it comes to education. The school offers great study abroad options. I wish they had more opportunities for need based scholarships.
Sophomore,5,"Amazing parties, people, and campus. Always lots to do and plenty of things to get yourself into. Great learning opportunities and resources. Let’s you be independent without going cold turkey."
Sophomore,5,"A little difficult since classes are online, but professors help as much as they can and are very laid back about things, as we have never had to meet this way before."
Junior,5,"Online is okay, not my favorite. I learn better in a classroom setting. Given Covid and the transition to online, it's been smoother than expected."
Junior,5,I'm a non traditional student. I am 37 years old and WKU has done an amazing job helping me to acclimate back into a school without feeling overwhelmed.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love going to school here. My freshman year was a great experience! I struggled in the beginning like any other freshman, but the support system I had/have here at Western was/is unbelievable. There are so many free resources that other schools don’t offer; for example tutoring, shuttle service, 24hr computer lab, etc. I love being a HillTopper and I can’t wait to finish my educational journal here!"
Freshman,5,"My online experience has been very well with getting ready for my first year of college, the staff has done a great job getting the freshman class ready and prepared."
Freshman,5,Western Kentucky University is a very reasonable school for students that live far from Kentucky or even students that live right here in Kentucky. Going to Western for me is a surprise to all of my family because I have lived in Bowling Green Kentucky my whole entire life. Whenever I step foot onto Western's campus it feels like I'm far away from home because the staff at WKU and the structure of the buildings give me a different feel than the rest of Bowling Green.   WKU is an affordable school that has many opportunities for many students to get many scholarships. I would recommend Western for one of your options for your college experience.
Freshman,5,I like wku because the environment is very friendly and I enjoy campus life i also like that all of my friends attend.
Freshman,5,The online classes were easy to follow and very flexible! The professors are very generous and the instructions feel like they are just as hands on as being in the classroom. I love having the option to do both because it works with my work schedule.
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy the campus and the student life at Western Kentucky University. Very diverse school! There are a lot of extra curricular activities to enjoy at Western.
Sophomore,5,"I took in class and online classes at Western. Each were fine, reall just depends on the professors."
Junior,5,I took some online classes due to COVID and the professors adjusted extremely well and worked with their students to make sure their needs were met for the switch to online learning.
Senior,5,"I love WKU, i cannot imagine being anywhere else. I feel at home when i am at school. everyone is inviting and the professors are great"
Senior,5,"I had to take online classes this semester of course due to COVID, I was very successful in doing so and the professors worked hard to helps us obtain our grades despite the change"
Sophomore,5,"There is so much to do at WKU as well as around town. The professors are wonderful, and they very much care about their students' success. There are so many different courses at WKU that there is always something for everyone."
Senior,5,"My experience overall has been great. I have been doing online school for some time now. I do online school for computer information technology. The instructors are helpful and quick to get into contact with you. They make students know all the upcoming updates. If there is a job opening, an instructor will inform you. The blackboard website is user friendly. I never had a difficult time using blackboard. The online experience is cheaper and less time consuming than leaving on campus."
Senior,5,It is amazing. The professors help you on every little detail. The professors are very punctual. The professors grade the assignments on time. The professors makes sure why you get the grades that you got. Blackboard is easy to use.
Alum,5,"I loved the campus atmosphere, the professors and advisers were amazing, and I made lifelong friends!"
Alum,5,"The most beautiful thing about WKU is the view. In Spring the beautiful trees are in blossom the air is clear and sun hits Guthrie bell tower just right. It’s all beautiful. The campus is truly alive and in full bloom as students are out and about relaxing on the yard, organizations are out talking and hanging out with students and it just seems like all your worries just vanish"
Graduate Student,5,"I love the connections that I have made while at Western and the fact that I actually feel that I am learning important information that I will use in my career field. My professors have become some of closest contacts, I have gained so much character through attending this college. It has taught me a lot, not just education related. It has taught me that there are still many kind people in this world and that you can do anything that you set your mind to. Thanks to WKU, I have gained a work ethic that has brought me multiple opportunities with internships in Accounting. I have gained friendships of a lifetime that I know will always be there. I have gained so much knowledge. Lastly, I have gained a place that I can forever call home."
Junior,5,"I have attended WKU for almost three years now and have absolutely loved it. About 95 percent of the faculty I have worked with have been wonderful and I genuinely feel like they care. WKU is a school where the staff and leadership care for their students and you will never just be a number. The student body also has lots of school spirit which makes sporting events along with other campus-wide events very enjoyable.  In the years that I have been a student at WKU, they have made improvements, and continue to do so to things such as housing. In the coming years they will have an all new housing unit that will surely bring in more students."
Freshman,5,"Western has a beautiful campus, genuine and friendly students and staff, and a competitive spirit.  I wouldn’t want to go to any other college."
Freshman,5,WKU is an amazing university. My favorite thing is the professors. They always take the time to help and make sure every student understands what is being taught.
Freshman,5,I love the professors for my major and my campus is very extensive. This allows for great walks and beautiful scenery. Making friends is not hard in the beginning because theres a program where you meet new people and learn all about campus and our traditions. Big Red is great. He is our campus mascot. He brings tons of joy to everyone who sees him.
Sophomore,5,I transferred to WKU fall 2019 and I have never been happier. WKU is a amazing school with great programs and has so many clubs and organizations. I was never a member of clubs in high school but I’m currently involved in two clubs and one organization at WKU.
Senior,5,I love WKU-O it is very educational. We have awesome professor's. There are many individuals that will stick by your side through both the good and bad events that happen throughout your life. My father died a year ago today and many people were very supportive. We do not have a book store
Freshman,5,Very good set up. The atmosphere is very opening and welcoming. I just love it here. I would highly recommend it to any who is looking for a college who accepts up to 95% of their applicants.
Niche User,5,"Both of my brothers have gone to this college along with myself soon, and the whole process with them has been very positive! The campus is beyond beautiful and the staff has always been nothing but friendly to me in every interaction with them thus far. They also have been very good at keeping me informed on every step in the process which is always very refreshing."
Junior,5,I love this school. It's not too big but not very small at the same time. The dorms are getting renovated and the things are relatively close to each other on campus. Ive never had a professor that I didn't enjoy having for class and have even had three professor all twice because I enjoy the way they teach. Every teacher has been willing to help when I needed it. Campus life is nice and have made great friends.
Junior,5,This school is amazing. They have great staff that are there for their students and want their students to succeed.
Freshman,5,Wku is amazing. Lots of diversity and bowling green is a very friendly town. The agriculture department is absolutely fabulous. The student life in my opinion is great. Lots of networking for post graduates and future entrepreneurs
Freshman,5,"I'm getting my degree online, but so far, I'm pretty happy with Western Kentucky University overall. The classes themselves are very interactive, and most of the professors are extremely helpful. My one complaint is that there are a couple of professors that are a bit too strict. They have many options for online degrees and On-Demand which is very convenient. I'd definitely recommend Western Kentucky University to anyone who's considering it."
Niche User,5,I loved this school as soon as I visited. The campus is so pretty and there are lots of majors and minors to pick from.
Sophomore,5,"I love how Western Kentucky is like a home away from home. They have a wonderful campus. It has a good diversity, there is a great variety of majors and minors that are available for students. So therefore you can experience many different social interactions, and test the water for any possible majors. It isn't too large, but isn't too small. It is located in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Hilltoppers know that life at the top is always worth the climb."
Junior,5,Western Kentucky University is a beautiful campus. You can just walk around everywhere and see all the diversity and it feels at home.
Freshman,5,"It is a home away from home, as anyone would say. All of the professors are willing to help the students succeed their future goals. I do not think I would go to any other school around here. Go Tops!"
Sophomore,5,"One thing that I love about Western Kentucky University is that there is always a way for you to be involved on campus. Whether, it’s sports, clubs, or working on campus, they always come up with something for you to not feel left out and alone."
Freshman,5,People are really nice here and very polite. I would like to see more campus events though. It’d be nice to connect with more people that aren’t in band
Freshman,5,"I have enjoyed getting to know not only the fellow students, but also the welcoming and friendly faculty and staff at Western Kentucky University. They are all very helpful in pointing me in the right directions in my life, in my academics, in my social life, and in my career path. The honors freshman dorm (Minton Hall) could be better as the bathrooms are not always very clean, but I have otherwise had very few complaints. I have no doubt that future students will love it here on The Hill!"
Junior,5,"When I went on the tour, they had a very welcoming environment. Everyone was so nice and they made sure to tell us everything we wanted to know. The students there introduced themselves, gave us some advice for if we lived on campus, about their professors, sports, sororities, etc."
Alum,5,"I felt like a part of a family. These were the best years of my life. The school spirit, support, level of education, and sense of community are incredible."
Alum,5,"I loved my time on the hill. I had amazing professors and not so great ones but the good far outweighed the bad. I absolutely love the campus and while they aren't the largest school, they do have some great programs."
Senior,5,"I absolutely love WKU! Everyone is always so friendly. Plus, the campus is so beautiful year round. I truly feel at home whenever I am at WKU."
Sophomore,5,WKU is amazing! I love the size of the campus and the resources available to the students. The food options are great as well as the housing options! Go tops!
Sophomore,5,"Excellent school, definitely allows me to discover who I am whilst furthering my education. Going into my second year , I have earned very quickly how to efficiently navigate on campus. The professors are easy to work with and make learning an absolute joy! Being someone who is more reserved, I have definitely been able to make new friendships and form life-long bonds with ease. The programs offered are also very diverse. 
I highly recommend Western Kentucky University to anyone who is wanting to have fun in college but maintain a high GPA without excess stress!"
Senior,5,"I am very happy with my choice of university. I do not attend the main WKU campus in Bowling Green, I am a student at the Elizabethtown Fort Knox campus. This is just what I needed, and they do everything within their power to help, whenever possible. It is close to home, and much more affordable for me( I don't have to pay to live on or off campus in BG, and it's a much shorter drive)I tell people all the time what they can accomplish here at the E-town campus, I want everyone else to realize their opportunities for places close to home."
Junior,5,"I really enjoy Western Kentucky University! Everyone I have came in contact with is very helpful and considerate, professors, staff and students included."
Sophomore,5,"Attending Western Kentucky University has been the best decision I have ever made! WKU is such an amazing campus that offers many opportunities for it's students. No matter where you are around campus everyone is always so nice and helpful. While being at WKU I have learned so many things and have met some of the best people. Our university offers many academic programs as well as many clubs and sports to get involved in. This year I became involved in WKU's TOP Guide program which is a leadership group that helps in hosting Orientations for incoming students. Through this program I have had the opportunity to better my communication skills as well as grow as a leader. It has also helped me learn more about my Univeristy which makes me want to get more involved. Overall, WKU is a big campus with a small feel that has endless opportunities for its students to grow as people."
Niche User,5,Really sweet and nice people working! I love the school spirit!! I go here for choir festival and I absolutely love it!! Has such a cozy atmosphere I would highly recommend
Senior,5,"I am currently a transfer from VSCC to WKU. I just finished my first at WKU, and it was great. The staff is very helpful, and there are multiple resources that are available to a student. Its a very beautiful campus."
Niche User,5,The Campus was really open and seemed like home even though I was only on a campus tour. The buildings are easy to get to one another as well. Not to mention the students and staff alike treat you very well like you're already a part of the WKU Hill Top family.
Freshman,5,WKU is a great university that truly is a home away from home. It has made taking this big step in my life something easier to do. Being at Western I can accomplish things that I have never been able to before.
Niche User,5,The staff are helpful every email was replied to and really helped me in the application process. I had a few questions about my fasfa and they called me on my time. with my other problems like finding money to pay for it.
Alum,5,"WKU was a great institution. The campus is very clean, friendly, and safe. There were always several things to do on campus. The professors I had in my program were great. The experiences I had in greek life were awesome."
Niche User,5,"Beautiful, clean campus! People are very nice, they have recently built new buildings that are nice. I enjoy watching WKU football and basketball."
Freshman,4,"All of my classes have been online for my first semester. This learning style is ideal for me, but there are some classes that are self-manage meaning that the professor does not meet by zoom or anything. For those types of classes, I have to make sure I am on top of my work and paying attention to new assignments."
Junior,4,"My online learning experience has been great, the flexibility is great with my work schedule you just have to stay on task and keep up with your assignment due dates."
Sophomore,4,"Learning online was a difficult transition for me personally. However, professors here do really well with communicating to ensure that I have full understanding of material and homework deadlines. They are sure to reach out if they see that I am struggling and need a little help! Most professors use our blackboard website which makes online learning a lot easier!"
Alum,4,"I graduated before the facelift on campus, when tuition was much cheaper. It provided a good, local education. Can't complain."
Freshman,4,"Covid has made things a little different for incoming freshmen however, WKU has tried to make the best of the situation."
Freshman,4,"All of my Western Kentucky University online meetings, courses and registration have all been really easy to navigate. Easy instructions to follow through. COVID has made things a little more complicated but the university has done a great job with their instructions. The school website and school WKU APP, both work well in the direction the student and families need to go. The online course work and the online meetings have all been really good to learn, navigate and communicate through.  If ever a problem, send an email. Even in large zoom meetings, they give a great number of time slots to choose from. I have been very pleased with the online activities that Western Kentucky University has offered. Again, things have had to be different or out of the normal due to all the restrictions that have been handed down from our state government. Western Kentucky University has done a phenomenal job handling, following guidelines & making sure the students understand the changing  process."
Sophomore,4,"Western Kentucky University is such a great school all around. I loved how everything and everyone always made it seem like we were a giant family. I honestly wouldn't changed anything about the overall school. Most of my  professors are very understanding and fun, but they were made sure we always completed our task in order to succeed. I don't believe there is one teacher at the university that doesn't want to see you go far in your career path."
Junior,4,My overall experience with Western Kentucky University has been very pleasant. The campus is beautiful and the people are friendly. The professors are always willing to put in extra effort to help their students.
Junior,4,"As a student, I am a major fan of WKU so far.  I have had amazing opportunities to branch out and discover what I am interested in studying.  When not in the classroom, many of us are involved in organizations that we are passionate about and grow us as academically and personally.  There is an outlet for everyone on ""The Hill.""
The schools is a beautiful, well-maintained, and safe campus.  It is home to an amazing body of students and faculty that are constantly aiding your development and education.  Amazing opportunities exist at Western.  This is a quality education received regardless of your path. GO TOPS!
I have few complaints about the university itself and I find that most agree."
Alum,4,"Western Kentucky is, overall, a great college to attend. A positive of WKU is that they have several smaller campuses located within community colleges makes a 4 year degree more accessible. Another benefit of this is they offer transfer scholarships when transferring from the community college to the university. Typically when attending the community college you don't have room and board expenses leaving tuition the most expensive part. These transfer scholarships are only for the first semester but provide help for those paying for their own education."
Junior,4,"Concerning Western Kentucky University, the university has been exceptional.   From professors who are there to help you invest your time and effort in and out of the classroom, to the friendly staff who help keep the university clean. Student life has been for the most part, very good. Of course, as with life, there are many challenges to being a college student, but with the help of the supportive faculty, no challenge is too great.  As many praises that can be accounted for, to the university, I have many recommendations for the university. Some of which can be related to parking. Parking at Western Kentucky can cause many predicaments for many students. For example, the new topper bus route. The wait time for the buses with the new route is extremely inconvenient."
Freshman,4,Love love love. Great experience! The campus is so beautiful and amazing. The location is perfect. The city surrounding it makes it the perfect college. I am able to go downtown and experience bowling green in an amazing way!
Senior,4,"The campus is wonderful with a lot of opportunities for academic achievement and extracurriculars. Professors are more than willing to discuss all aspects of their courses and list their office hours on every syllabus. And Bowling Green is a beautiful flourishing area with options for both entertainment and community involvement. I especially like their access to low income healthcare, green/eco friendly initiatives, and fresh meat and vegetable crop shares. The only thing I would improve is their ability to transition into a well-paying job from college. There aren't as many resources as I would like for after college full time jobs that are willing to meet and discuss open positions."
Senior,4,"There is a lot of diversity and the facilities are great. The football team, basketball teams and volleyball teams are very competitive. Faculty is nice. I would like to see Mens soccer program. There is a womens program but no mens program"
Freshman,4,WKU is a great mid-sized college. It is very welcoming and safe.  The campus is not spread out and navigating around campus is a breeze. There is lots to do and see.
Freshman,4,"Lovely school! Western was my answer to the search for a well-funded state school that wasn't too big or too small. I find western to be the perfect school for me. There's students and faculty from all over, and lots of opportunity for extra curricular activity and learning."
Freshman,4,I have been going to Western Kentucky University for about a year now and it has been a great experience. I’ve never thought I’d meet really great professors who actually care.
Junior,4,Campus is very nice. The hill is massive but if you don't want to walk it buses provide transportation to the building on the hill. Some of the buildings are older but that is to be expected on most campuses. Overall a nice school.
Niche User,4,I really love how the campus has a  open layout and how everyone is nice and friendly.  another thing I  love is how you have lots of food choices on campus so you can grab something to eat on the way to classes.Along with all of that I love how the University has all these cute little traditions.
Freshman,4,"I chose this college because they have a very good program for my degree. From what I've learned while at Western, it seems that every degree has a very good program associated. As well as many options as far as extra circulars and campus activities to get involved in."
Alum,4,"Western Kentucky University is an incredible school! Great academics, lots of diversity with a focus on international reach, as well as quality campus life. There is always something happening on campus as well as off campus! There's plenty of clubs and groups to be a part of and you will always feel welcome to the Hilltopper family!"
Senior,4,"I wish the administration would care more about students as people, rather than as moneymakers for the university."
Freshman,4,"WKU has offered me plenty of wonderful opportunities and new ways to move forward with my perusal of higher education. The school is full of wonderful communities and activities, and you can do anything you want here it feels like. My biggest problem with WKU however, is that they seem to leave students who live off campus like myself out. It’s hard to find out when something is going on, and the social activities of the school seem to not include non-traditional students or students who don’t live on the campus premises. I’d love to see this change and expand my social horizons with the school."
Senior,4,I would like to see more communication between the different education departments. I would also like for student advisors to be more knowledgeable about different requirements for different degrees.
Junior,4,"I haven't visited yet, but I've talked to many students who have/are attending there. I have heard many many people say that they love it on the hill. I really want to go to Western Kentucky University!"
Sophomore,4,This is so far one of my best college experiences. The college is great and has lots of opportunities if one was to change majors. The mechanical engineer faculty is great and are very set on helping each student graduate and have lots of experience in preparation for the real world.
Freshman,4,The campus is beautiful and they have so many resources for students to ensure their success during their college career. The staff are very helpful and always try to ensure any questions you have are answered to the best of their ability. They also have at least 300 hundred organizations and clubs to choose from so that every student has something that they are interested in that they can be involved in.
Senior,4,WKU is a local college that offers the flexibility I need to obtain my bachelors while also maintaining a full time job!
Sophomore,4,"Western Kentucky University is a diverse institution which offers a different college experience for each student. From its wide range of majors, to beautiful campus scenery, and amazing clubs, I would recommend every student look into attending the university."
Niche User,4,"Western Kentucky has a very outstanding campus with smart and respectable faculty and responsible students. The dorms are clean, the food is good, and the campus is amazing."
Niche User,4,Western Kentucky has a very good college campus. It is very big and has lots of different buildings including dorms. They host great summer camps including volleyball and basketball. Their campus is very up-to-date and is very clean.
Freshman,4,The faculty and staff is wonderful and there is a great campus life. The only thing that needs some work is the cafeteria food.
Junior,4,I love the pride that I feel when I tell people that I go to WKU!! It is such a great environment to experience and learn new things.
Sophomore,4,WKUs campus is absolutely beautiful! Most classes are small so you can get to know your professors and they are willing to help. While majority of professors are amazing there are a few that should not be teaching and I wish the university would listen to the students reviews regarding those professors.
Sophomore,4,Beautiful campus and always so much to do there.  Freshman housing isn't the best. Don't recommend living on campus if you're allergic to mold. Ok for vegetarians but not for vegans. Plenty of on campus jobs and very safe.
Freshman,4,WKU is a great campus with lots to offer students! It is easily one of the most beautiful campuses around with a great city surrounding it. There are so many options for degrees and so many wonderful programs. I feel very lucky to be a WKU Hilltopper!
Freshman,4,"Studying at Western has been an interesting and insightful experience. My one issue, however, is a lack of classes in the Glasgow Campus. I am only able to complete general education here, and would've appreciated being able to at least start my major closer to home."
Graduate Student,4,"I have really enjoyed most of my classes through Western Kentucky online. The teachers, for the most part, are very knowledgeable and do a good job of conveying their expertise. I wish that the online cost was less mainly because as an online student I am not getting the full benefit of being on campus, but the overall quality is still good."
Freshman,4,Western Kentucky University had the perfect amount of diversity that I was looking for. It has great a campus life and dorms. There is constantly things to do around the college that will keep you busy.
Senior,4,The campus is beautiful and clean and safe (as far as my experience) great place to start off on your own away from family while in college. Tuition is continuing to rise though.. the school is in a ton of debt and financially unstable.
Sophomore,4,This place is awesome. There is a lot of things to become involved in on campus. The food choices are amazing and most teachers are very good.
Junior,4,"I am a 100% online student. So far it has been a good experience, as a non-traditional online student I am not on campus, but have been there and am familiar with the area. WKU is a well-respected school with many opportunities. I have had a few issues with adjunct professors, however, these were quickly solved by the department heads."
Junior,4,"The campus is simply beautiful.  There is no doubt you will get your exercise walking up ""the hill"" if you have any classes in the science/math building's.  Any of the staff I had the pleasure of working with were very friendly and helpful - which is a big plus in a university setting!"
Niche User,4,"Beautiful campus, friendly campus, easy everything such as housing and scholarship applications. Their band program is phenomenal and is growing at an exponential rate."
Niche User,4,"I would really like WKU to become more funded, it will allow more opportunities for students to become successful and more engaging. However, they have really good programs and lots of opportunities for work experience. They are one of the very few colleges that set you up with a job according to your major. The staff is very friendly, and they are always willing to help!"
Freshman,4,Western Kentucky University is a very good school. Although the school is not that diverse it gives all students an opportunity to be successful.
Freshman,4,This schools is really fun to attend. There are plenty things to be apart of whether they are clubs or just football games there are so many thing to do. The food on campus is healthy for about the first three weeks so they have popular restaurants on campus to make up for the cafe. The class are hard yet I am only a freshman so I am still getting use to the college experience. Overall this is a very good campus.
Niche User,4,I have been there for many events. WKU is a college with spirits and wonderful professors. I always do feel welcomed when I talk on the campus. The student are very diverse and I feel like I am home when I am on campus. My only concern is the condition of the dorms especially the mold situation.
Sophomore,4,"I love going to school here. All of the teachers I have had are super caring and want to help you succeed. If you are failing, you aren't trying. The food choices are nice and people generally just want to help. The atmosphere is super welcoming and the school is small enough that you can actually get to know the people around you."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy going to school here at Western Kentucky University. The campus is beautiful and the faculty and staff are wonderful and genuinely care for us students.
Freshman,4,"I am in the latter half of my first semester, but it so far I love it. It's a great school with many interesting topics to choose from. The food is good. They provide transportation to classes, and anywhere else on campus."
Junior,4,"This is my third at Western Kentucky University and I recommend this university to future college students and even present; if your interested to transfer? Athletic events and games where students engage in sports fun and support their fellow Hilltopper  athletes. A campus of international acceptance and a diverse student body, a thriving campus with a constant growth each new school year. WKU, where Spirit makes the Master!"
Junior,4,"It started off great, but unfortunately has come into significant money trouble in recent years. The Campus is great, and the hill is great exercise. I Would recommend a philosophy major but they just cut. Many teachers are great, and a willing to work with students to accommodate their needs."
Niche User,4,Very nice campus. The perfect size between not too big and not too small. People were friendly and willing to help even if they were just everyday students.
Junior,4,"Beautiful campus, Professors are generally approachable/knowledgeable. Student life is great, many nice facilities."
Freshman,4,"I like the campus,  the town and the academic and athletic potential. I heard that it is one of the safest campuses in the US. Looking forward to being a Hilltopper."
Sophomore,4,"Western Kentucky University is overall a good school, even though they are facing a large financial crisis right now, it is being handled as well as can be expected.  There are many good, even over-qualified, teachers here and it is a beautiful university."
Sophomore,4,I LOVE Western’s Campus and the surrounding bowling green area! Food choices are very plentiful and yummy! most professors are nice some not so much! GREEK LIFE IS AMAZING! Such a good environment all in all.
Senior,4,I have had a wonderful experience at WKU. I have had the best educators minus a few here and there and many people here supporting me. I am apart of the Greek community and it was one of the bet decisions I made. One thing that I could suggest to WKU to fix is that I struggle every year finding classes to take or getting into a class I need to graduate. For this upcoming semester I had a class get cancelled that I needed to graduate this spring and I won't find out what I need to do to fix it until I get there in the Fall.
Senior,4,WKU has strong academic programs. I enjoy my nursing professors and the courses that I am available to take. Academic advisors could be more organized. They seem to put students in courses that they do not need. Student life is average but there is a lot for students to do on campus. There are a lot of events that are free and allow them to use their ID's to gain entry. The food is good and they are always updating the campus and bringing in new vendors.
Freshman,2,"I am a freshman at this university and it truly is a beautiful campus. When you hear people talk about ""the hill"" it is no joke! A handful of the classes are up on the hill and if you want to put in your daily steps on your way to and from, then Western Kentucky University is the place for you. Because of the pandemic, all of the classes are going online--aside form labs, which means that being on campus is close to being unnecessary. The housing costs should be lowered for that specific reason. From what I have heard, though, is that the quality of the housing units are poor. There are maintenance problems and things like that. The dorm I am staying in is also on the small size for two people. A lot of the times there are long wait periods and limited space to stand in regards to getting food. That is hazardous in this pandemic."
Alum,2,"I only had a few online classes, but it wasn't a very good experience for me because I learn better in class."
Alum,2,"Western Kentucky University is a great school, but they have issues when it comes to giving students the right information regarding to their online programs. They send you into a dark abyss of emailing continuous people, who will send you to another person, so on and so forth."
Senior,2,The professors I️ have had are the only reason why I️ am still here. The TOP guides are neck and neck with PTS people. Both groups are a waste of my tuition dollars.
College Senior,2,"They do not help out transfer students at all. In fact, it's harder for a transfer student to be successful at Western Kentucky University. The campus is beautiful, but the administration is extremely greedy."
College Sophomore,2,"Considering my roommate showed up at midnight wanting to move in one weekend, I can't justify ranking housing too highly. Dorms, even honors, are relatively loud."
College Freshman,2,Don't choose Bemis Lawerence Hall!
College Sophomore,2,"I am not a part of Greek life, and most of the people with whom I associate are not either. It seems to be a big thing on campus, and I often see fraternity and sorority members dressed up for their events. Most participants of Greek life are harmless, but certain organizations have gained a lot of negative attention for their sexually exploitative parties (Pike)."
College Sophomore,2,The Greek life means well here but the social atmosphere of it affects non-greeks.
College Junior,2,"Honestly, I dont expect to get a job after school."
College Senior,2,The amount of work that students are required to do in the education program is over whelming. I am a hard worker but its nearly impossible to get all of the work done. There is so much going on during  each semester and the homework makes the class very stressful. It is not very likely that you can work and and be in this program which is very unrealistic because of bills and cost of living. I feel that the program could lesson the homework load or have another day of class because every class is overloaded because there are so many topics to cover. This makes the homework at home sometimes hard to do because you may still have confusion over an assignment. I personally know 2 people that dropped out of our program because of the stress.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The odds are good, but the goods are odd."
College Senior,2,I was a transfer student and the process of switching over my aid took several months. I did not receive financial aid from the new college this first year. A tip will be to do it early because summer time the financial aid process seems to go slower and you don't want to get stuck right before the first week of school and its not finished processing yet.
College Freshman,2,I am in desperate need of financial aid and have not gotten what I needed.
College Freshman,2,So tired of the same foods
College Freshman,2,"Living on campus in Pearce Ford Tower is terrible. The people who live here are very disrespectful by slamming doors all hours of the night and day, screaming in the hallways all the time, and not cleaning up after themselves. The size of the dorm is spacious, but they are filled with ladybugs."
College Junior,2,I sort of dislike it here. I wish that there were more recreational activities for students (especially in the arts).
College Junior,2,"Although the dorms are decent, the prices to live on campus are horribly expensive. The quality of living in the dorms do not match the amount of money that students are paying for residence. The on-campus apartments are also ridiculously overpriced. In all, everything is to expensive for the less than average, dare I say poor, quality of life on campus."
College Junior,2,"The selection on majors is not too difficult at this university. However, the university neglects to care for smaller programs (mostly in the humanities and arts). As a student involved in two majors in the smallest programs on campus, I have noticed this neglect firsthand. The university as a whole accepts mostly EVERY applicant (along with each program that requires special admission, e.g. nursing). Because the university has a tendency to care for the number of students enrolled and retention, they do no particularly care for providing a good education for the students in the large programs on campus. For example, knowing many nursing/education majors on campus, I would never want them to stick me with a needle or teach my future children (respectively). The university neglects the smaller programs with excellent professors so they can boast about their numbers in programs that are providing abysmal educations."
College Junior,2,"The dining hours are not accommodating to student schedules. The dining options that are open at late hours are run by poorly trained service members. The prices for campus foods are horrible expensive for poor meal options. I quit my meal plan as soon as I was able to, for it did not offer many options for my dietary restrictions (other students have also commented on this). Meal plans are far too expensive for the meals that they are able to provide. The new policy to temporarily deactivate meal plans when a student has an outstanding fee to the university is an atrocity."
College Junior,2,"Professor/student romantic relationships have not been treated with necessary attention. The university seems to only care about its ""cool factor"" and seems to neglect issues such as the quality of life and education of the students."
College Sophomore,2,There is no place on campus open past 11 even on weekends and almost all places are closed on holidays
College Senior,2,If you're not Greek around here say goodbye to having a good time.
College Senior,2,Im not sure if its just this campus or what but I do see a lot of drug and alcohol usage around campus.
College Senior,2,"The workload that we are given isn't very challenging to me. Most of my projects are easily done or they just seem to be busy work. The teachers aren't very helpful either. My building on campus is the only one that hasn't been remodeled, its very hot and stuffy."
College Sophomore,2,Lots of alcohol on campus. Anyone can get it whenever they want.
College Junior,2,"Parking at Western Kentucky University is atrocious. On-campus lots are at a premium, with spots filled even before the first 8 AM classes begin. Off-campus parking involves parallel parking on busy streets on an incline, and I have had instances where I had to walk 3 blocks to get a parking space."
College Senior,2,Campus never calls campus off in bad weather.
College Senior,2,"I always get y financial aid, but I have had to do some verification thing twice in a row which was a long process."
College Freshman,2,"Just this semester alone we have had school days cancelled due to extreme weather. Even if the campus itself doesn't close, the teachers are highly aware of the dangerous weather."
College Freshman,2,"This campus has few people that are accepting of LGBT rights. Mostly everyone has the same religious background and political beliefs. As for ethnic/racial diversity, I would say it's split about 40/60 between black and white."
College Sophomore,2,I was so happy to get out of the dorms.
College Sophomore,2,There are only a few requirements.
College Sophomore,2,They should be made more apart of campus.
College Freshman,2,the greek life seems pretty fun to be but havent be
College Sophomore,2,"I do not live on campus, but iv seen the rooms and heard the stories, living off campus is a must"
College Sophomore,2,Far to many options for fast or convenient food ends up destroying your body
College Sophomore,2,"All online means its hard to concentrate on doing your work or studying, it requires a lot more self discipline"
College Sophomore,2,"I do not have much of a Nightlife, my time is spent at home or work"
College Junior,2,Parking has always been an issue if one is to live on-campus. The campus has expanded and grown greatly in the past decade but the parking has not. The typical cost of an annual permit is $90. The typical parking fine is $25 
College Junior,2,"I have not had any help with applying with aid.  I have an excellent GPA (4.0), butbecause I am only part-time, I can not get financial aid.  "
College Freshman,2,A lot of students will hang out the outside of my dorm and they are very loud and most of the time have very loud music which makes trying to go to bed hard.
College Sophomore,2,There aren't a lot of spots and parking permits are extremely expensive.
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of people do drugs, but I am not one of them. "
College Junior,2,I am disabled with a handicap parking permit and there are numerous unused teacher/staff parking spaces that I believe some should be for the students.
College Freshman,2,To me Greek life isn't that interesting. I have friends that are in Greek but don't treat me differently it's just not my cup of tea.
College Sophomore,2,"Not enough parking spots close to campus and if you don't get to campus at 8am, you can forget about parking on campus. "
College Freshman,2,apply was easy but i didn't receive any aid i had to take out loans.
College Freshman,2,"I have had a good experience here at wku but tuition is high and so is living on campus. I would not choose wku if I could do it all over again. Its far away from home, not much to do in Bowling Green, and its very sorority  oriented around here."
College Sophomore,2,I got an amazing scholarship! But from my understanding you either get everything paid for or nothing. I see that as an issue.
College Sophomore,2,When getting into the SKyTeach program one teacher can black ball you. So you've got to be careful not to get even slightly on the bad side of the teachers in that area (even if they are actually terrible teachers). Sad really.
College Sophomore,2,Average. It's campus food; don't expect much.
College Freshman,2,The process itself wasn't difficult but very tidious and time consuming. Some of my papers were lost in the shuffle which made things kind of frustrating.
College Junior,2,The student body is predominantly two ethnicity's and not much outside of that. There is an ignorance towards most diverse subject matters. It is a southern school and has its fair share of the stereotypes of the south.
College Senior,2,To process has been a pain in the butt. It would be easier if they kept our information on file so apply to get aid you would just have to review it and have a choice to change if it is incorrect. Although this last was better but I have already accepted my loan but it hasn't said its accepted yet.
College Senior,2,They're about middle-of-the-road when it comes to strictness.  Don't even bother to attempt to bring alcohol into the dorms.
College Sophomore,2,I only say this because i work for a living and it is hard to get any help when you actually try to help yourself
College Junior,2,It rains constantly. our campus is located on top of a large hill which makes slipping and falling a constant struggle. I also ride my bike to class which makes it difficult for me to see where I am going because it is raining so hard I do not feel safe to ride my bike.
College Sophomore,2,Mainly Parties are the reasons for joining it seems like.
College Senior,2,there are many people of different backgrounds of many cultures which makes the campus pretty even in diversity. there are a huge amount of black people here
Alum,1,"Definitely one of the top worst school and especially for international students. Stay away with especially if you are international. Bad school, some irresponsible professors or academic advisors. Bad location in a very Racist community or extreme religious people who will never stop leaving you alone and keep asking internationals to believe in their religion without realizing the consequences for that for the international students. This school accepts any one cuzz it is not the best at all for anyone not from Kentucky. Classes not offered the time you need them and you will at least be late to graduation about one to two more years as a result of that.  Bad dorm. Bad food. Closed minded people, and more. Please go apply for the top biggest schools or top universities. Otherwise if you decide to come to this school. Prepare yourself for all what your are gonna face. I also wouldn’t recommend any American from open minded states and cities to come here."
Alum,1,All I could just stay away. I wish I didn’t not chose this school. If life goes back that would be the last thing I would do.
Senior,1,"The worst school with no doubt. Stay away especially if you are international student because you are gonna definitely reach a point where you are even gonna hate yourself. Racists, bad police, bad community, no opportunities for international students at all. So conservative to the extremist."
Senior,1,"All I could say is no the best at all or even close.


No A lot of studies available. 





No the best or even close."
Freshman,1,"The school itself is fun but if you go here DO NOT LIVE IN MINTON HALL! Every worker here has been nothing but rude and disrespectful. There is endless amounts of mold and when we bring up the issue, nothing happens. This is an unsafe and uncomfortable dorm and I HIGHLY recommend not living here."
College Freshman,1,It is awful. Very depressing. It's nasty and there are no space in the dorms.
College Freshman,1,I hate GREEK LIFE. Everyone In a fraternity or sorority are all stuck up and don't do anything to help better the community. People make fun of others as well as trash people and talk down to them.
College Junior,1,Terribly expensive compared to an apartment
College Freshman,1,"My experience at Western Kentucky University has been very disappointing. I have read wonderful reviews about this school, just to have found the opposite. Bowling Green is absolutely gorgeous, but that would be one of the only positives I've found at Western Kentucky University. I have a condition that requires special attention and, though they have a Student Accessibility Resource Center, it is extremely difficult to get any kind of help for my condition. They provide a variety of resources for their students, but many of the school officials are unaware of the resources the campus has, so you are left to struggle alone. If you have any kind of psychiatric condition, I highly recommend that you do not go to WKU. They won't show you any kind of sympathy and very little of the staff have actual knowledge of mental illness. Western Kentucky University has a clinic on campus, but every single student I've talked to, including my own personal experience, have had a significant amount of trouble being seen. The school work is not difficult, but everything expect for the schoolwork is. Most of the school officials simply do not care. Western Kentucky University is not the place to go, unless you don't mind being treated as a number."
College Junior,1,I honestly had the worst situation when coming here. I wasn't able to get enough financial aid to come here in the fall so I had to wait until the spring and still had to take out a personal loan to stay in and was almost kicked out because they wouldn't give extended time.
College Sophomore,1,I do not go to college parties.
College Sophomore,1,I have to be verified 24/7. I would love to just be able to use scholarships instead.
College Junior,1,I feel off-campus apartments are often in dangerous parts of time.
College Junior,1,THIS UNIVERSITY CARES TOO MUCH ABOUT ATHLETICS BUT I GUESS THAT IS THE MAJORITY OF SCHOOLS IN THIS NATION
College Freshman,1,I hate parties and I hate when my floor-mates come back from one drunk off their asses.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I dispise WKUs financial aid office. They are rude, they enjoy telling ""half-truths"" and flat out lying o students about requirements they need to receive financial aid. Some employees in the office are helpful and friendly, but most of them rude and disrespectful and impatient with students. I have been hung up on more than 10 times dealing with the finance aid office. I have also been standing in front of two employees and they tell me two different things I should do in order to complete the process. Usually, I stuck touring it out on my own. I did hear from a faculty member in another department that WKU's financial aid office does not generally like to help minority students, which results in their dismissal from the university."
College Senior,1,"Already having a degree automatically disqualified me for any immediate scholarships, even though I came in with excellent grades.  The scholarship opportunities are great as long as you are a first-time freshman."
College Senior,1,South campus only has one food option.  The food is very limited but edible when you don't have time to leave campus.
College Sophomore,1,Greeks and Non-Greeks are two different kind of species at WKU
College Freshman,1,They barely reply to email or help at all.
College Freshman,1,They don't inform very well with parking passes..
College Sophomore,1,Walking up the hill in the snow and ice is one of the worst experiences in life.
College Sophomore,1,"WKU is a party school, if you party. Lots drink and smoke. It's enforced to not do it, but people do anyways."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking on campus can be awful. Whenever the semester starts, it is so hard to get parking. A normal parking permit costs $90 and I find that to be expensive when it is hard to find decent parking. WKU had built a new parking structure, but it is $200 for guaranteed parking. Still expensive and quite a distance from some buildings/classes."
College Senior,1,Parking is a joke. I'm a commuter and there is only two parking lots for commuter and it's a good walk to anywhere.
College Junior,1,"the Parking and Transportation services have recently added a parking garage near most of the classes but the parking permit for a garunteed spot in this garage is $200. all other parking options are metered parking near classes that will not accept more than 45 minute parking (classes are at least 1 hour long), in permit areas which seem to have more permits than spaces, and in parking lots of local shops where your vehicle could be towed. 
also, the parking and transportation services enjoy ticketing vehicles for minor infractions rather than the vehicle in the housing parking structure that is there 24/7 with no permit at all."
College Freshman,1,"It is windy far too often. And when it's windy, it's usually a cold wind, so it's even worse. 

Not only that, but the campus sometimes smells like dogfood."
College Junior,1,The only thing we have unique is Big Red... no one reallty knows what that thing is.
College Sophomore,1,The hill! Is very unique and idk why anyone thought it would be good idea to build school on a hill!!! When weather is okay it's not bad but in the cold and blistering heat the walk up the hill is just treacherous
College Sophomore,1,It is god awful. Don't bother with it. They call it the hill for a reason...you get to walk up it all the time.
College Sophomore,1,"There is absolutely nothing to do in Bowling Green unless in the summer maybe going to Beach Bend, but as for the night life there is absolutely nothing to do!"
College Freshman,1,"There really aren't that many choices for what to eat on campus, especially if you are diabetic or a vegetarian, or have any other special diet needs. Much of the food is fast food, and at the ""Fresh Food Company"" or ""Topper Cafe,"" their food might be better for you, but the vegetables tend to always taste mushy or frozen."
College Freshman,1,The parking here is horrible. There are no spots close to dorms or classes. Those spots are always taken so most likely you have to park very far away from anything.
College Freshman,1,"I have to say, I don't have a car but many of my friends do and when I am with them, it sucks. I don't know how much permits cost but I know that you get a one time deal to have your ticket revoked. Without having a car it's actually a blessing to me because WKU has a lot of events that it hosts and parking can be really hectic. I would say you don't need a car unless you have a job off campus. The buses pretty much take you where you need to go."
College Senior,1,"Although they continue to expand parking, it is difficult to find a spot."
College Junior,1,The permits are outrageous and the parking isn't great to begin with. Even with a pass you're never guaranteed a spot and it is always hard to find one.
College Sophomore,1,"We actually have bumper stickers that say ""if you see my professor, tell them I'm still looking for a parking place"""
College Sophomore,1,"The parking system at WKU is horrible! Most of the on-campus living is all in one spot. Therefore, it is a miracle to be able to find a parking spot close to your dorm. The commuters have to walk a mile to class every day, because their parking lot is practically off campus. Overall, WKU needs to find more available parking!"
College Senior,1,The parking isn't very good.  WKU continues to let more student in when they do not have the room really.  You may edn up having to park far away from the dorm or campus as a commuter.  You must make time to find a parking spot especially in midday to get to class ontime.  I have had a few tickets for parking in the wrong place.  The parking authorities are very unforgiving.  The first ticket is usually excused but none after that.  Once I parked in the wrong spot because other ppl were parked there and it was not at all clear if it was a spot or not and got a ticket.  I appealed it because I had a good reason and they did not budge.  They just want money from broke college students.  It disgusts me!  You don't really need a car on campus.
College Junior,1,"Biology Department – Most of the professor in the biology department seriously have some sort of power complex. In majority of the upper level classes I have been in they wait to assign majority of the work for the class in the last three weeks, so not only are you trying to study for the final but you are having to write papers and give presentations on top of anything else they feel like sticking you with. The head of the department either doesn't like students or just doesn't want the department to have any bad reputations because when prompted by a student that a faculty member is treating a student unfairly, he does pretty much close to nothing but saying he will speak with the professor. Gossip travels fast there too. If you had an issue with one professor, all other faculty will know about it. It's almost like a high school."

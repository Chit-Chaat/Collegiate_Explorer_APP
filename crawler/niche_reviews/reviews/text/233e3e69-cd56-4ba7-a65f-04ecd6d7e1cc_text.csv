Niche User,5,Im going go there as a freshman and play basketball i viewed the campus and academics and it all seems great and worth the money.
Freshman,5,This school is outstanding. The teachers are very helpful . The professors look out for your best interest. Its a Christian school so you will get a look at the world through that way. You aren't just a number at the school. The teachers gibe you the effort that you are willing to put in.
Freshman,5,"I love the small, Christian, family-like community of Trinity Baptist College. Everyone loves and knows each other. Because we all live on a small campus, we see each other all the time, yet we are able to hang out in our friend groups off campus and go to the beach that is 45 minutes away."
College Junior,5,"My experience with the professors are unforgettable, they go above and beyond to help the students out. On average there is twenty to sixty students in a class which helps the professor grow a one to one relationship with the students."
College Junior,5,Our shoot offers a plethora of on campus jobs such as extended education. Extended education is where students go and help teach a class.
College Junior,5,"There is not a lot of crime that goes on at Trinity Baptist College, but just in case have cameras and security guys."
College Junior,5,"Trinity provides me with the best professors around; my professors will go out of their way just to make sure I understand everything, or just to see if I have a good day. I have a personal relationship with each professor; with the school being so small it allows a connection with all the teachers and students."
College Freshman,5,Everything is a short walk from parking lots and dorms
College Freshman,5,I don't notice any because I don't partake or expect to see that on a Christian campus
College Sophomore,5,We are in Jacksonville so there is food everywhere!
College Freshman,5,"The food is good, the dining area is clean, and a lot of variety in food choices."
College Freshman,5,"Always available parking spaces, and convenient at that. Permit cost is very low."
College Freshman,5,The Professors are extremely helpful and have a very open schedule for the students. The workload is not to heavy. There are many work opportunities given out.
Recent Alumnus,5,"There are only great influences to stay away from drugs, alcohol, and anything regressive in this environment.  An A plus plus!!!"
Recent Alumnus,5,"Trinity Baptist College is known for a college for professional Bible Scholars.  Not only is it a place for Scholars, there are really caring professors as well.  This is a college who wants to see students graduate and do something with their life!  I for one, would recommend this college to anyone who is serious about becoming someone and doing something that is worth while!  

     There is a variety of restaurants, shops, stores, and attractions that surround or are near the campus.  Historic Downtown is only about a 15 minute drive away, to a riverwalk, or the Zoo is about 20 minutes away.  The beach is also about 20 minutes away.  The college is distanced quite conveniently to anything you need if you needed to go to the grocery stores, or a SuperTarget, etc...

     This college is family friendly, as well as college dorm student friendly, the area also provides many housing facilities and jobs for college students.
 
     I love the focus this college has as far as it being a Jesus Christ centered faith.  The attitude that the people there try to strive for is an amazing influence to Jacksonville and around the World! This is a place for anyone who would want this influence in their lives.  An A plus plus for me!!"
College Student,5,"Campus Activities – Trinity has a lot to offer activity wise. It is a very small personal school and does a lot to keep everyone involved. They have job opportunities as well as sports and extra activities such as societies, where people get together and just hang out."
Junior,4,Overall TBC is a pretty good school with faculty and staff that really care. It does a great job at giving a small community feel.
Sophomore,4,"At Trinity Baptist College, it is easy to get closer to God and to become prepared for the secular world through a Bible-based mindset . Trinity's athletic could be a lot better , but due to the fact it is not an athletic scholarship school, one has to take what he can. The cafeteria food is always the same, but thee are always clean tables and chairs ."
Senior,4,"Having gone through the Academy, there is a completely different dynamic the college is trying to undertake. Since both institutions are in such close proximity, there is a lacking college claimed areas and constant shared space. But, the college is taking steps forward to develop more programs of study and raise revenue in order to invest in more college buildings. The student to teacher ratio is small enough to where the professors know you and create relationships that larger Universities cannot. There are also multiple on campus job opportunities to help the Resident student. I was highly encouraged and am a proud soon-to-be graduate."
College Junior,4,This past year our boy soccer team won nationals with a lot of support from the fan base.
College Senior,4,Haven't started yet. Will start in the end of August.
College Freshman,4,Everything is clean fairly new dorms.  Classrooms are very close
College Freshman,4,There is a wide variety and cost but you will need a car
College Freshman,4,Modest dress but you can still be stylish.  You have to keep a neat well groomed appearance.
College Freshman,4,It is a Christian college so the drug and alcohol is expected to be strict.  Do not come to a Christian school if partying is important to your college life
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is required to be in a society to promote friendships. 
College Sophomore,4,There are two computer labs in the library which is almost always open except on Wednesday nights and Sundays. 
College Junior,4,"Trinity has a myriad of majors that one can choose from. Majors include Music, Pastoral Theology, Teaching, and so forth. I am a Music major and I love it!!!!!"
College Junior,4,"Trinity is very good with the drug safety. No one really does drugs on campus, which is a blessing. There have been some students in the past who have been caught doing drugs, but that is very  rare. If Trinity catches someone with drugs, then they will punish them accordingly"
College Junior,4,"The academics at Trinity are pretty well. The teachers there are fantastic: they know the subject that they are teaching, and are enthusiastic about teaching it. They are also available after class to help you with whatever you need."
College Senior,4,The curriculum is not easy but it is worth the work. The discussion boards keep students involved with each other and make you think deeply about the subject matter. The professors are available and are invested in student success.
College Senior,4,It gets very hot and humid in Florida but there is a nice student area that is indoors and air conditioned.
College Senior,4,As an off campus student I do not utilize the dining hall but I have used Hebrews café and there are many choices available at a reasonable price.
College Senior,4,"The professors are supportive and knowledgeable, they have all been involved in missions and ministry and bring a wealth of experience to their students. The school brings in chapel speakers who are motivational and have experience in the missions area."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are well-taken care of. The upkeep of the grounds is consistent and tedious, and work orders for problems in the dorms are usually responded to within a week. The relationships built in the dorms are definitely worth living with numerous other people."
College Freshman,4,Even though it is a christian school you still get varying degrees of spirituaity and levels with their walk with God. But it is a very nice and peaceful environment. It is the first place in my life where I have been able to be around genuine people. I love the people and school.
Sophomore,2,"It was ok I did go there online, so my personal experience might be a little bit different than someone who was on campus. Professors are subpar, and they are horrible at emailing you back or even giving clear instructions on what they want from you. However, none of that matters because the classwork is a joke if you have a basic knowledge of whatever the class is you will pass with an ""A"" the courses are not challenging in any way. If you are a person, who likes to take the easy way out and go to Trinity Baptist College."
College Sophomore,2,what makes my school unique is that once you're there you're trapped. the school is not creditit. They kick people out for stupid reasons
College Sophomore,2,"There is only one or two meal options served at a time so if you don't like what they are serving, you don't eat. "
College Junior,2,"There are days where the weather is great, and there are days where the weather is poor. The reason for this is because it is North Florida, and Florida is notorious for random changes in the weather. But overall, it is well"
College Sophomore,2,"not much things to do around the area, but good for shopping mostly."
College Sophomore,2,"Food Experience – the food needs more consistency, needs to be more real tasting, it taste like its artificial."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Many Things to Do on Campus – During the night, there are not many things to do on campus. Sometimes there are student body activities or society activities, but that is every once in a while. The student center is open for students to watch tv, or play pool, or hang out. This is fun, but can get tiring."
Alum,1,"This college is truly a waste of your time. They aren't accredited by any state recognized accreditation. Some of the classes are worthwhile, but the majority of classes are a joke. Most of the professors are an even bigger joke. The administration also puts a curfew on all the students, tells them when to go to bed, and that they aren't allowed to have any kind of relationship with the opposite gender. Food is nothing but fried cafeteria food and is completely unhealthy. They expel students for being gay and lesbian. They expel students for  all kinds of ridiculous things. They also use you as free labor so be prepared to be woken up on a Saturday and forced into cleaning the dorms, or helping with the landscaping. If you want to be treated with even less freedoms than a high 
school student should have go here. If you want a serious education, don't choose TBC."
College Sophomore,1,its not like normal schools
College Freshman,1,Hardest thing to do and it never gave me any money and left me paying out of pocket for college

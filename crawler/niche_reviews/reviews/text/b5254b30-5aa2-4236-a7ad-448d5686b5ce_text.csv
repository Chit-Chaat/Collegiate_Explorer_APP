Senior,5,this school has been amazing. i can commute from where I live and make it to class with no problem. i always find parking in the evening close to the building class is help(when i was going to campus)
Senior,5,"Excellent faculty!! Excellent history, and excellent job prospects after graduating. CSUN is continuously improving and rising. Very inclusive and community aware."
Senior,5,Professor have been bery adaptive and attainable to students who are still adapting to the new online learning situation.
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman at CSUN, and all my classes this year will be online as a precaution to slow the spread of Covid-19. Online classes are definitely a challenge, but like I said before, our professors are working hard to help us through this and help our first year run smoothly."
Freshman,5,Honestly I feel like the professors are really trying their best to accommodate students given the situation with Covid 19.
Sophomore,5,The process was very simple and easy. Very great connection and service.    The application process was also very quick and asked the most important questions in my opinion.
Junior,5,Northridge is a place that I call home since living all my life in the city. CSUN has given me the resources that I have so desperately needed in my educational route with the professors I have had the pleasure of meeting. I wouldn't want CSUN to change in the levels of diversity but would like to see the development of crime happening on campus and how the CSUN PD can create programs for students in the Criminal Justice Department to have jobs such as the Matador Patrol and possible internships.
Sophomore,5,"My overall personal experience with CSUN has been beyond amazing. Without an doubt, my decision in attending CSUN has been superb."
Alum,5,"Very good school with reasonable prices. Speaking to business school only, I liked it. I cannot say it really helped me career-wise, but I'm happy with the quality of education. Professors care, students are friendly, staff is helpful"
Sophomore,5,"Everyone's ideal way of a classroom is students and professor trapped in four walls giving and receiving great knowledge, but due to our situation, online class is the alternative. Is it the best not really, but education is important as we are all adopting, professors are putting in as much more effort to grab student's attention and make is virtually entertaining. We are all going through this together and thank you for all the professors and teachers our there working hard on the shaping great students for the future/"
Sophomore,5,"Although it is not as big as other universities and cal state, CSUN offers so much more, a place where everyone is welcome, everyone able to meet and greet new people with thousands of students of all ethnic. A very well diverse campus and have great professors and staff that are truly caring and put students first."
Alum,5,"I was a transfer student from SMC and completed my higher level bachelor’s coursework at CSUN. I think it’s a fantastic school for commuters/transfer students. I took advantage of all the resources they had on campus for students: SRC, massages, computer lab & free printing, free snacks at the USU."
Alum,5,"Online learning was a breeze and very flexible at CSUN. They were asynchronous, so no need to show up at a specific time. Just make sure to submit work by the stated deadline."
Niche User,5,I was forced to take online classes because of the Coronavirus pandemic going on right now. I enjoyed being on campus more though.
Niche User,5,I’m in an Acapella group & I couldn’t be happier! I love the campus. Everyone that I’ve met is very friendly. School is essentially a second home for me!
Sophomore,5,"The online performance is something to get used to, however, all of the faculties are trying their hardest to make online classes be smooth and easy to take"
Sophomore,5,CSUN has an amazing campus and its library is an amazing place to study at. The professors are passionate about their majors.
Senior,5,Most of my professors have been extremely helpful once we transitioned into online learning. They have an extremely understanding  curriculum.
Senior,5,"Overall my time at California State University, Northridge has been astounding. In fact, I have met some of the best professors as well as friendships. Since the campus is not that huge, this has allowed me to have a stronger connection with professors and talk one on one without feeling unheard. Although, this school is amazing, I feel that the school should provide additional resources for students who are first generation students, such as myself."
Freshman,5,"They have amazing services online, especially right now due to the pandemic. They are very helpful and have many services for you on campus as well."
Freshman,5,The staff is ready to help anyone with burning questions. They try to make you feel as welcome as possible and as comfortable as possible even if you can't see them in person.
Sophomore,5,"The Camus is overall very beautiful and one can truly feel at home. There is a lot of diversity which allows you to learn more about others cultures. Everyone is very friendly which is easier to make new friends. Academics are really good helps you understand the content faster. Although, some professors can make some improvement in there curriculum."
Junior,5,I liked the fact that CSUN is very inclusive. There are so many resources all over campus! The atmosphere is very welcoming and the associated students always have events on campus. There are so many clubs to join! It’s really nice.
Junior,5,"Turning classes from in person to online was a little bit overwhelming, but my professors were easy to communicate with and tried to accommodate as much as they could. Taking ASL via zoom is kind of difficult especially if you have poor connection but the professors were patient and really tried to make it a smooth experience for everyone."
Alum,5,"Absolute best time of my life so far. This campus has given me the tools to pursue my field of study, interact with professionals, and made me acknowledge that I have the ability to control my environment with the space I create."
Junior,5,"Due to COVID-19 my classes were switched to an online format. My experience with online courses was good overall primarily because I have a good internet connection at home and I have the right software to use the required apps from my computer. However, in my anatomy lab class I struggled in doing my lab practicals. The exams were held through canvas, but the images would take a long time to load, which was frustrating because the exam was timed. Luckily, my professor was willing to add a few more minutes to the practical because I told him my problem. Therefore, I was able to take my practical more calm without having to worry about time running against me."
Junior,5,"My experience has been pleasant. My professors are excellent and passionate about what they teach. All of my professors were willing to help me during office hours and they made sure that I understood the material. There are a lot of clubs and organizations that students can choose from. For instance, I am in a fitness club where I get to instruct and motivate participants to do physical activity. There are plenty of dinning and lounging areas for students to study in a quiet or busy environment. The most modern building I would say is the Student Recreation Center, which is a fitness complex that includes a gym, indoor track, indoor basketball and volleyball courts, and A indoor rock climbing wall. Going to the SRC is like a getaway for me to release stress and engage in physical activity. Cal State Northridge is a great school overall that has a lot of student and educational resources."
Freshman,5,I thought that the professors did a great job with adapting and learning how to use zoom to help students learn
Freshman,5,"When i first entered CSUN i did not know what to expect, i was not too sure if the classes were going to be hard, or if i would get along with anybody. Thankfully CSUN was a great choice the environment, people, and campus is amazing. The academics and sports teams are great and more importantly CSUN offers help for any problem you are facing. CSUN is great school and i love my first year there."
Freshman,5,My online experience with CSUN was a bit wild this year due to the COVID-19 situation but thankfully CSUN had a great plan for this emergency and most people loved including myself online school.
Senior,5,"Although many do not consider CSU system a prestigious public university, I beg to differ. Professors are great, willing to help students. Private institutions cannot provide the same benefits as arranging this school. Printing is free, they give away produce, can get different certifications (machining and solidworks) during undergrad at no extra costs to the student."
Junior,5,This school is great because they care about the students that attend as well as the well being of the students. As a student who cares a lot about schooling I would definitely recommend this school to further your education.
Junior,5,Online is a lot easier for me I learn at my own pace so I love the online experience at CSUN professors get back to you immediately.
Junior,5,"My experience has been great academically, socially, and financially. Academically, my professors were always willing to help those who did not understnd the material. For instance, my writing professor guided me on writing a college level essay during my freshman year. I learned how to use transition words between paragraphs, write a good thesis statement, and cite in APA and MLA formats. Furthermore, there are a wide variety of clubs we can join. I joined 3 Wins Fitness where I provide group exercises for older adults for free. Some amazing stories I’ve come across is someone who was paralyzed was able to regain his mobility through 3 Wins Fitness. Moreover, I live 15 minutes away from campus with my parents, which has helped me a lot to try to save money for graduate school. Going to Cal State Northridge was the best decision I have made because tuition is fairly good, I have had excellent professors, and I am part of a program where I can impact a persons life through fitness."
Graduate Student,5,I love CSUN because it has all the modern amenities that UC schools have at a CSU price!  I love how so many local residents attend CSUN and how warm and welcoming everyone is in school!
Senior,5,"After Covid-19 made the school turn to online learning, I was worried I wouldn't do so well, but my professors were mostly understanding and helpful, which helped me pass all my classes."
Senior,5,"Love, love, love my University. Have had so many great experiences, classes, professors. Truly glad I decided to attend this University."
Senior,5,"I love that on Thursday they have a farmers market, I love that at the beginning of the semesters they hold events and give out free food to everyone who goes to the school. I love when they have djs in front of the library one certain times of the week. The gym is AMAZING and the two different pools?! It's great!"
Graduate Student,5,Northridge is a great school with lots of opportunities and great people. The faculty and staff are kind and respectful and always there to help students. The teachers are knowledgeable and there to help. The student life  is full and exciting. The are is nice and calm.
Senior,5,"What I love about my campus is that it has a lot to offer it, students, such as a nice gym, clean water, good food court, it always gives back to its students."
Senior,5,The professors adjust accordingly for online classes. They understand that the course is usually at your own pace and they give you a reasonable amount of work. They are almost always very responsive to emails and are generally very nice. I am not good with online classes but have succeeded (A's in all online courses) thanks to the professors.
Sophomore,5,It took some time to get used to it but professors and students handled it quite well. However it did have a bit of an impact on what kind of resources are available to students and how much information we could retain.
Junior,5,The school is really great I think. The professor i have had a really good at their jobs. I also like that the school is very divers and very connected.
Junior,5,"Fantastic, the it is easy to navigate and easy to communicate with teachers. Keeping track of your grades and work is really easy as well."
Senior,5,Took most of my classes online and all the online classes were very well organized and easy to understand.
Junior,5,"One of my favorite things about cal state Northridge is the diversity. We are in such a dark time currently and cal state Northridge has done a great job making everyone feel welcomed and treating everyone as equally. We are taught to be leaders and make change in the world. Aside from it’s beautiful campus and great academics, diversity is definitely one of the big reasons why cal state Northridge stands out."
Sophomore,5,I have taken on class fully online before the COVID-19 It was good. The professor would respond with good speed sometimes within two minutes. Which was shocking but also very helpful since you didn't have to wait for a long time to hear back.
Sophomore,5,"CSUN has a very welcoming environment and has great professors who do alot more than just teach. We have amazing events set up for the students, and along with those events we have great safety patrol. each student gets an email if anything dangerous occurs on campus so they are all aware to proceed with caution. And on top of that, CSUN is a very open campus so it is a great place to hangout or study at. I am very proud to call it my school."
Alum,5,"Took a few classes online, and I liked how flexible they were, but I prefer in class. You have to stay on top of your class, just like you would in class, but overall good experience."
Alum,5,"I learned a lot at this school, and the environment was always super welcoming. There was always something to do."
Graduate Student,5,I really enjoy the campus and all my interactions with the staff and professors have been amazing. I feel like the university is here to support me and support my goals. If anyone is thinking of applying to this school you honestly should.
Graduate Student,5,I do not prefer taking online classes but it actually worked better for my schedule to take online classes and they were good.
Sophomore,5,"I feel like my college experience was the worst at CSUN. I feel like the resource was taken away from me while the school was still charging me for those. Because the pandemic had effected on everything it also took a toll on my learning. because my professors didn't really have in-person meetings. At times emailing them was a hassle by trying to get a response. Also I living in a Mexican household with at least 8 plus 6 kids living in my home. So it would be hard to read and do my assignments in a quiet learning space. Also, I don't believe that all the resources were helpful since I couldn't attend tutoring or the writing center or use the library or the internet. I'm also very thankful that I had 1 out of 5 professors that helped me understand other courses. since all the courses involve criminal justice and its system."
Freshman,5,Online was difficult at first but within the first week professors were able to hold up the class and help every student. They made their hours more flexible so they can have a zoom meeting with students when the students needed help.
Freshman,5,CSUN has been a very fun and terrifying experience. School was hard but I was able to stay afloat due to having friends which was easy to make here. I’m glad I chose CSUN because I still feel close to home. People were friendly and professors were always there to help.
Junior,5,"Transitioning into online has been difficult on both teachers and students, but in comparison to most, CSUN has done its job in making sure it assists its students as much as possible. The IT department at CSUN is still fully available for teachers to contact fr any canvas app mishaps and have been understanding with the times we live in in connection to getting our assignments done. It makes me comfortable to take online courses in the fall since that will be the only option so that we don't risk spreading covid-19."
Junior,5,"During my time at Cal State Northridge University, I have found a school for the perfect combination of intellectual, artistic, and diverse set of individuals that merge in many ways. The classes have opened me up to so much new knowledge I can currently apply and the class options are endless. Then with the way campus is designed, we all have our departments in their own designated area, however, the library as well as food courts, shops, the gym and theaters are where we all merge into experiencing college life together. CSUN has personally also been an amazing place to find people who are looking to do business in the future that'll benefit the both of us. Something even more personal, I had the freshman experience linking me with my roommate whom I grew to love as a sister and after three years, will be one of her bridesmaids after covid. Therefore, not only do I make life long friends but life long partners to further better my life and career. I couldn't ask for a better school."
Alum,5,"There are various great opportunities for students. The support and care from the school counselors/advisors is so impactful. This university also takes threats very seriously and measures accordingly to keep students safe. The clubs are amazing and make you feel integrated, the volunteer opportunities for matador market days, environmental clean up or beach clean up day can make you feel like you belong.  The study areas are amazing and reasonable."
Alum,5,Taking a few classes online was fairly easy when you have understanding and supportive professors. Like with any online class it can be frustrating to get immediate help and responses from your professors. Just choose wisely and be prepared.
Junior,5,Online classes do not match with the real deal but the classes were structured in a way to give you the full possibility to grow as a student.
Freshman,4,The online transition was mostly smooth. Many online resources have been made available to students that are helpful during these times.
Alum,4,I took some online classes while others were hybrid classes that had part online and part in-person sections of the class. It was an overall positive experience but I personally prefer an in-person method of learning.
Alum,4,"My experience was a positive one at CSUN. There are plenty of resources available to help students reach their goals and many facilities dedicated to a healthy mental-space as well such as the oasis and SRC (huge indoor gym). CSUN is getting 4 stars from me instead of five because parking is horribly overpriced and largely unavailable even after purchasing a permit for hundreds of dollars each semester. Many classes tend to be overpacked and highly impacted. It doesn't mean its a bad school, there are just TOO many people there."
Junior,4,"Online education has been difficult not only for the students but for the professors as well. However, the professors in my 4 online classes are great and are very supportive. They still expect high-quality work but provide the resources to make it more attainable."
Junior,4,This is my first semester at CSUN and even though the experience has been online that has not decreased the level of education. My professors are great and still expect work from each one of us while having fun in an online environment. I am a Junior right now and am majoring in Sport Studies. I highly encourage anyone wanting to pursue a degree in Kinesiology to attend this university.
Sophomore,4,"I only took one class on online which was the intro to biology lab. I received a High B in the class but sometimes it was a struggle to operate the software on certain browsers. The professor didn't tell us it was recommended to use Google Chrome, because that was literally the only functioning browser. 
The professor interacted online with their students quite often so it was easy to get guidance.
Overall, my online experience would been considered excellent if the professor knew about the technical difficulties of the online tools we were using. If you are going to take an online class at Csun, I say go for it."
Graduate Student,4,"Attended CSUN for 6 year BS, and MS. Professors at CSUN would do anything to help their students succeed. CSUN has a diverse student population and the campus is growing extremely fast. The Chicano studies department, Kinesiology department and the psychology departments are the highlights of this school."
Sophomore,4,CSUN is an amazing school There are some bothersome professors here and there. But you can always read reviews online and find great professors that way. The community at CSUN is very inviting and all the events are so much fun. The campus is beautiful and the food is affordable and delicious.
Senior,4,"So far it has been pretty good. Last semester was pretty hard to adjust, but it is fine now. It is a bit easier to show work because you can share your screen over Zoom. I do still miss in person classes. I miss the community of campus and my friends. But for now online isn't as bad as I thought it would be."
Senior,4,"I really love this school. The campus is big and beautiful and the professors I've had are all very passionate about what they do. There are a lot of campus events such as concerts and parties thrown by the school. If you live in housing there are even more events thrown by the RHA. The RAs are great and the dorms are pretty nice. There are nice on campus dining options, but it is kind of expensive if you don't have the meal plan cards. There have been safety issues, but they try to stay on top of anything that happens. The campus is in walking distance to a Target, dollar store, and other eating options. It is also across the street from a tattoo shop."
Junior,4,Online learning really can be stressful without the scheduling and the professors one receives to take an online class with. Being eager to learn and having an open mind is very helpful when it comes to CSUN online classes. Please check to rate my professor for the professors you are planning to wanna take in the future so you see the experiences of other students and their strategies of passing the class.
Alum,4,"I loved the campus, it was very clean and peacefull. The professors were very helpfull and there were alot of resources. The dorm rooms were also nice and clean."
Sophomore,4,"I liked that there were many clubs and student organizations that one can choose from. Involvement definitely helps with student life due to meeting new people and making friends along the way. An aspect that can be improved on would be parking, since it can be at certain times a challenge to find a spot."
Junior,4,"CSUN is such a great school, and I am so glad I chose to attend. The community is so diverse, the people are so nice, the campus is so beautiful, and you don't have to break the bank to attend."
Sophomore,4,My online learning experience with CSUN has been pretty well so far. Many of the professors try their best in understanding that most students desire a need of flexibility and motivation.
Alum,4,Didn't really take online classes so cannot say more unfortunately. It was good to actually attend in person
Sophomore,4,"through online experience I have learned not to take campus life for grant, because even though I would drive an hour to school and back home everyday, I was starting to enjoy the experience. professors online did give some leeway which was good because they understood how hard the adjustment was going to be. For now I am okay with online because it saves me gas, but hopefully we can get back to in person soon."
Sophomore,4,California state university of North-ridge has been a really good experience so far.  The  thing I enjoy so much about this college is how they have camp matador for freshman. My camp experience was so unforgettable i wish i could relive it over and over again.  I have met some long time friends and made so many meaningful connections. this campus has great professors and connections as well. sadly the campus life was cut short but hopefully with a vaccine we can resume back to school.
Junior,4,The online learning experience is really great the professor took great initiative of the COVID pandemic and were able to switch to online teaching very well
Junior,4,"I love my college, honestly, I was so scared at the beginning of college but all the mentors, professors, tutors, and even friends I made there have been so helpful. I couldn't have asked for a better college."
Alum,4,"All online courses taken at California State University, Northridge were very well structured. Professors were attentive and responded to any issues/concerns students had in a timely manner. We would also have automated e-mails sent to  our school e-mail, stating any postings, assignment changes, etc. Professors also allowed office hours, which was beneficial seeing as though it was solely an online course."
Alum,4,"Campus provided many student services that benefited a student's academic/professional career, also provided services to promote an overall better well-being. The student environment was excellent, and there were many opportunities available to be involved with the university academically, professionally, and socially. All services were accessible to students, and the campus felt safe. Especially during the night time because there were security that would offer to walk you home if requested. A majority of professors were a joy to learn from, and helped me develop my skills in my major."
Senior,4,"Overall CSUN has provided nothing but a positive experience. The campus, and staff are extremely encouraging and helpful to their students."
Senior,4,"I have taken one summer class online and the remaining of the last semester of spring and overall it was hard to have a conversation with the teachers. It almost felt as if multiple students were talking at once. Also, I felt that completing my homework and attending class meanwhile at home felt like a distraction."
Sophomore,4,For the most part the professors that I encountered were very nice and easy to approach.  There are however some professors that take longer than others to grade assignments.
Sophomore,4,In my first year at this University I feel as though I learned a lot. For the most part everyone that I came across was very friendly and welcoming. The school does a good job of getting student familiar with the campus.
Alum,4,This was a new initiative as I was graduating. I took two hybrid courses and both were easy to adjust. The student must take full responsibility as the coursework can sometimes be easy to fall behind on.
Alum,4,"The best aspect about CSUN was the vast diversity among students and professors. Having worked with students of different ethnicities, age groups, and backgrounds is what prepared me to successfully enter the workforce."
Sophomore,4,Overall my experience with the CSUN has been good. I am done with my freshman year and most of my professors have been very good. They go above and beyond to make sure you have all the resources you need to pass the class. The campus is very big which means that there are a lot of things to do. The only reason why I took off a star is because I am a commuter and so are many others. The problem with this is that the bus gets extremely full and people can hardly find parking. I think the school should have it's own form of transportation for only students.
Freshman,4,"Overall CSUN is overall is pretty good csu, however I did happen to have a professor who is over protected on student  on cheating. He does happen to have wired techniques to make sure you do not cheat ,but he is a pretty good professor  overall. In my first year I encountered pretty good professor that are willing to push you academically so you can reach the next level. CSUN also has an amazing campus which is one of the biggest I ever went to. The campus food is pretty good but during time you get board of it. Overall CSUN diverse campus with every community have their own clubs."
Freshman,4,I liked how the campus faculty was very supportive and offered many different kinds of services for transferring students to make the transition helpful
Senior,4,Professors try to remain available during the pandemic and online learning. I must admit that online learning is not the same as in-person lectures.
Junior,4,"My online experience was pleasant primarily because I had the adequate software needed in order to use certain applications. However, online tests through canvas was hard for me because a question that had a picture would load slow as the time was running. Perhaps my Internet was too slow or the size of the image was taking up most of the loading time. I messaged my professor to notify him on my problem and he was willing to give us more minutes on the exam. Therefore I was able to take the exam peacefully without having to  worry about a question load fast or time running."
Graduate Student,4,"I feel that online learning was as good as it is going to get for an online experience.  There isn't much more a professor can do aside from doing zoom meetings and/or recorded lectures, so online experiences can really only get as good as a recorded lecture."
Freshman,4,"When I first started to attend CSUN, I was extremely happy and I am not saying I’m not happy now but it was a sense of warmth being their. I didn’t feel awkward or like and outsider, I had the sense of belonging. Overall, you may have great Professors and you may have a couple that or just okay but, if I can do it so can anybody else."
Graduate Student,4,There are lots of online classes at CSUN taught for many subjects. The teachers are always helpful and there for the students when things get confusing but the online classes are very well managed and organized.
Senior,4,"The professors care and are very helpful, you can tell they are passionate about teaching. The campus is clean and they offer a lot of services and activities for students. My only complaint is that the top people at the school constantly try to cut funding, especially for minority programs such as Chicanx Studies and Asian American Studies. It' pretty sad, considering how diverse the campus is!"
Sophomore,4,"It is a very good experience and there are many services available to students to help make the experience easier and better. There are academic services as well as food and wellness services. There are a lot of things to do on your free time, whether it's going to the gym or going to the library. The staff is always willing to help you succeed as much as they can."
Sophomore,4,It an amazing campus very friendly. The people are just amazing and the professors will go to any length for you jus to succeed. Some of the resources need some fixing but other than that it is good. The food on campus is good and there are tons of other options to eat off of campus that are not far away. The majority is in walking distance so there will be something for everybody liking.
Sophomore,4,"When the coronavirus hit, all my classes had been moved online and surprisingly the teacher made is much easier on us. It was a big change for both the students and the teacher, however they proceeded to teach us even through crashing websites and zoom sessions. It wasn’t the easiest to cope with, but we got through it. Some professors even changed the grading scale and syllabus, but through technology made everything work."
Junior,4,"At first I was unsure about my decision in attending the college I've chosen, but as time progressed I've grown to truly enjoy my time spent in California State University Northridge. I have yet to have a professor that I can truly call a ""poor instructor"". Learning environments are typically pretty well made with multiple areas to study and many facilities new can use to get help. The campus also provides quite a a fair amount of extra benefits such as a gym, some medical assistance, etc. My major complaint is the need to open up more classes and hire more instructors to teach the classes that students can not get due to over enrollment. Other than that the education I'm getting is worth what I'm paying."
Junior,4,"The only thing I would change is the price for housing, but I love this school and believe it has done so much for me as well. It’s cheaper than most big LA county schools also."
Senior,4,"Overall, I think CSUN is a good campus. I do think they can improve with teachers and finding new learning styles online."
Senior,4,"I'm a music education major (instrumental) currently attending Cal State Northridge. These music courses, like symphony orchestra and music tech, are some of the best I've been able to take, with excellent instructors and resources. The tech labs are especially good resources for all music majors. The only issues I have with the program are the availability of classes, the condition of some facilities, and workload. Some education classes have not been offered in years, and I have to take equivalent courses. Some practice room pianos are out of tune or haven't been repaired and many lecture classrooms have older desks (this mostly has to do with limited financial resources for the music department in general). This program demands hard work of the student but is well-repaid with the brilliance of staff and excellent resources."
Niche User,4,"Good school with a great campus, friendly students, great teachers and academic program. Pretty decent location and near decent restaurants/eateries too. Semi-decent athletics program.
Things have changed with COVID, but overall it's good."
Sophomore,4,"I love the number of resources this University provides. Feeling lost? The Career Center is there to help and provide outstanding responses. Feeling stressed? The beautiful, most relaxing Oasis is there to free your mind and relieve your stress. Many more resources for different occasions. The staff here are outstanding. There is nothing I will want this University I will want to change.  Super Satisfied!!"
Freshman,4,A very diverse school with a beautiful campus. Not very far from home either as the drive is less than an hour when there is no traffic. I must get there early though because the parking is a headache a lot of the time.
Alum,4,"My favorite aspect of California State University, Northridge was how diverse the student body was. Regardless of your major, there are a great many classes to take, such as: Art History, Queer Theory, and Music In Film. I found all of these to be incredible, and taught by very intelligent professors. The campus is also beautiful. The school itself is very much commuter-based. However, you can have an awesome college experience if you choose to be involved in the school life. Overall, it was a great experience."
Alum,4,What I liked the most about the college was that it was close to home. What I think can improve is the parking.
Freshman,4,"I think there needs to be more diversity within both the students and teachers. Also, I have encountered some teachers who do not use proper vocabulary regarding gender and race, and some who are completely behind on technology. Even utilizing the 'Canvas' website where all grades and files are located. Yet I do like the constant emails on events and opportunities available on campus. The safety overall has been good, yet I did wish there were more announcements for clubs and to push for student involvement and the jobs offered on campus. Thus far I’ve really enjoyed my experience at CSUN, but there are some improvements to be made."
Freshman,4,"The school is a commuter college and the party life there is very limited. The campus is small, I can walk from one side of the campus to the other in 7 minutes. If only focusing on education and plan on nat spending this college is very fitting."
Junior,4,"Csun is one of the few most diverse colleges in Southern California. I have attended the school for the past few years and have made special bonds with my peers who share the same interests as me. There are some big events that happen such as Big Bash which brings music artists to our school to perform and entertain. Overall, I have really enjoyed my time at Csun and I look forward to graduating with a Bachelors in Biology."
Junior,4,"School is nice, professors can be a hit or miss just make sure you look up your professors. The courses are semi impacted and you might have a hard time getting into classes sometimes especially the lower division GE so take advantage that first years have priority registration."
Niche User,4,I have went to check this university out. It’s pretty big. Looks safe. Interested in going to California State University at Northridge
Senior,4,"As a transfer student, I appreciated the opportunity of obtaining a free professional wardrobe, from Matty's closet.  The school provides free tutoring and free printing at the library and computer lab.  During a dark time, my grades and motivation dropped.  Seeking help and wanting to transfer to another major, a counselor met me with hostility and rejection.  I was a student in need of help, I never experienced this in community college.  I would like to the school to implement surveys and anonymous reports to be implemented.  I proved this aggressive counselor wrong, by completing searches on my own and obtaining guidance from another counselor.  Thanks to this special person, I am on track to graduating and obtaining the few remaining classes needed."
Alum,4,"The staff in the Business school and faculty in Business Law were all incredibly helpful. I was returning to school after a 10 year gap and they made the process as easy as it could have been. My law professors were universally exceptional and made themselves available at any time, for both class help and life advice. They wrote letters of recommendation for me that helped me get in to law school and I continue to keep in touch with them even after graduating."
Niche User,4,"when i visited CSUN was an amazing experience,I was impressed by the library because the higher the level the quieter it gets which is amazing for the students that need silent spaces to concentrate and study. Also, the food inside the campus has a lot variety and the student population is fairly diverse. the only thing that is concerning about the college is the graduation rate but i still truly recommend checking out this college because it offers great financial aid for its students and has a great campus.for instance, the culture of the college is impressive, the college helps the students to release their stress by preparing events that make the students feel included."
Freshman,4,The campus is very nice. The Africana Studies department is great and the professors in the department are really supportive.
Sophomore,4,"I love the diversity and feel at CSUN. Everyone is super welcoming and makes you feel at home. However, the hiring staff is not the best. There are quite a few terrible professors that I have heard of. But with the bad of course comes the good. Most of my professors are/were very kind and very passionate about what they do. Also, CSUN is very affordable compared to most schools and they do offer a great deal of financial aid."
Alum,4,I appreciated the small classroom sizes and some of my teachers/professors were extremely passionate and helpful.
Sophomore,2,Due to Covid - Campus is closed and education is online. While most teachers have little to no experience teaching online.
Junior,2,"As a stem student at CSUN, the online experience has been and will be absolutely grueling. This is not a matter of how well teachers manage their online courses, it is simply because of Stem classes,  labs especially,  being unteachable in an online environment. It's very difficult to be engage and learn the material when an experiment for your lab can not be done and your professor simply gives you the data to do a write up on. It nullifies the purpose of the lab and ruins motivation for the subject. Other classes that are not in stem are overall okay but lacking the ability to ask questions is quite a hindrance. Thought with our current circumstances, the online experience is unfortunately needed but continuing further semesters in this manner will surely result in a decease in attendance."
Senior,2,"Most students here are commute students, don't expect to create a strong or moderate team relationship here.

And some teachers are ok some don't teach you things at all.

Overall, this school does not worth your time."
Senior,2,"This review is specifically for Electrical Engineering students. It is the most unorganized most miserable department on campus. No one is assigned an advisor, no one helps students with what classes they need to take. You're on your own and need to guess what you need to take. I once sent 19 emails to get a response and get a form signed from the chair. They cancel classes every semester and some classes are only offered in one section even though there are 50+ people that try to crash. There are FAR better colleges out there. This place is only good for last resort."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Based on the crime alerts on sexual assault and experiences at frat/sorority parties, I believe that women, mostly, are not safe on campus, near campus, in their dorms/apartments or at parties. People don't have any clue what rape means and women have not been properly taught on who to trust and we need self-defense classes as well as ""rape prevention education"" seminars for men, especially."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Despite the school being the last resort if the other colleges didn't accept me when I applied, I would still say that my experience at CSUN was terrible: the location, weather, housing situation, lack of resources when I was a freshman, tuition costs and so on. However, I can rarely describe a favorite experience other than joining clubs but that's it. Unfortunately, I can't say anything positive about this school. I should've just applied to a community college if I knew how much debt I was going to be in for a college experience that wasn't worth it."
College Sophomore,2,Make sure I have enough money to pay for school
College Junior,2,I wish it was a little safer
College Senior,2,"It's pretty average, but it could definitely use some updating."
College Senior,2,Athletics aren't really a main focus on campus.
College Freshman,2,There have been a lot of robberies on campus because the students of the university get emails of the police reports.
College Freshman,2,"Personally, receiving emails of ongoing sexual assaults on campus make me vigilant but also worried that it may happen to anyone including me."
College Freshman,2,"Do not feel safe, especially at night"
College Freshman,2,"The social atmosphere is pretty much nonexistent.cost is too high for what we get, forceING people to live off campus"
College Freshman,2,"Some of the frat guys are very chill while others only hang out with sorority girls. Parties are very exclusive because CSUN has very strict Greek rules. The sororities are very cliquey and selective. If you are not a pretty white girl or don't know any of the high ranking members of the sorority you want then you will not get in. Some of the sorority girls are actually nice but they are rare and hard to find. Sororities at CSUN are very expensive and for some if you do not attend the weekly meetings you will be fined. Some sororities actually care about their philanthropy and put lots of effort into making a difference, while others use their philanthropy as a cover for their parties. 

What you put into Greek life is what you get out of it."
College Freshman,2,"I really wish they would find a football team! A football team, I believe would bring so much more school spirit and make CSUN students feel more as one."
College Junior,2,There are a lot of reports of unsafe activity and stealing.
College Junior,2,I heard that the area is not very safe and poorly lit with records of robbery.
College Senior,2,"If I had to pick one thing I like the least about CSUN, it would be the housing. It could be that I moved into these things as a transfer junior, but quite a few of the people that i meet here are either freshmen or incredibly immature which makes it hard to get along with anyone. I had a roommate that had parties for the last few weeks last year to the point that police would come and my RA didn't do s*** about it even when I complained about it. Granted, your experience can vary depending on the kind of roommates you have and from what I heard you can try to move into a different building of suite if you want but it's easier said than done since depending on the RA, they would want a good reason or want you to talk it out with your roommates first. There are a few plus sides though such as the cafeteria which is a bit pricey but all you can eat which is fine if you go once a month and a small computer lab which is open 24/7."
College Junior,2,"Through out this past school year alone, CSUN students have gotten the most theft/crime notifications; which I think should have something to due with lack of security around campus. The dorms can be easily infiltrated through balcony windows and during the day. As for sexual assault or crimes on campus, I think we need more that just the blue poles around campus to call for help if something were to happen. By the time someone does use the blue poles,it might be too late. Maybe CSUN can offer pepper spray or some form of defense training to people who wish to feel safer on campus."
College Sophomore,2,I have friends who have joined and I have heard bad experiences from them. They do not seem to be very lenient when it comes to people who have other school and job commitments.
College Junior,2,feels no different than the community college experience. was hoping for a more university feel when i transferred.
College Junior,2,not very exclusive. just like any other club on campus
College Sophomore,2,My experience with some of my professors have been horrible. Many do not know how to teach and have bad English  accents. They are also very unhelpful when you ask them for help when you don't understand the material. They are also very sloppy with their grading and are always posting grade up late.
College Sophomore,2,They should really work on the customer service
College Senior,2,The Greek life at this school is like high-school all over again. As a participating  member of a local fraternity I must say I was a little disappointed with the overall  atmosphere of this sort of organization. Most people form clicks and groups  (even  within  the same fraternity). The levels of drama are truly  dramatic. I've  never  witnessed more drama in my life than I have in the Greek system (not even high school).
College Senior,2,Unlike most large University's this school does not have a football team. Everyone agrees that the lack  of a football team impacts school spirit. For the amount of students  that attend the school  I'd  say about 5% go to the athletics  games. It's  sad considering the large volume of students  that  attend.
College Freshman,2,I hate the area and can't wait to leave. Will never return.
College Freshman,2,People are not very social. It's show up to class then leave attitudes.
College Freshman,2,I didn't get a scholarship but that could be my fault.
Recent Alumnus,2,The options are limited on campus.
College Junior,2,I don't feel like the administration thinks about the students and what they want when it comes to policy changes. They seem to only think about what is best for them and make decisions without hearing out the students opinions.
College Freshman,2,"Super boring area, only come for school and frat parties."
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot of cute guys, all of them have girlfriends and all the Frat guys are annoying"
College Junior,2,Parking is totally insane on campus at CSUN. There are almost no spots in any auxiliary spots lots around the campus past 9 A.M. The only spots that do are the parking structures and it can take up to 10-15 minutes sometimes to exit the structures from the sheer volume of people all trying to leave at once.
College Freshman,2,Maybe I don't know the people who throw parties but there's not many.
College Freshman,2,"I don't party myself, but all the parties people seem to go to are at nightclubs downtown."
College Freshman,2,"I personally am not into greek life, but the frat parties are pretty awesome"
College Sophomore,2,"I was not given any financial aid this semester, and I am still dealing with finding out why that is. Because of this, I had to pay the full amount."
College Senior,2,"I applied for financial aid in june and didn't receive my financial aid money until October.  I called every week asking about my financial aid and they keep telling me that it was something they needed to fix and that i would get my financial aid that following week.  This happened 6 or 7 times.  I was frustrated that i filled out everything i needed to, got my loan approved, but didn't receive my loan until half way through the semester.  By then i payed all my tuition and housing fees already."
Recent Alumnus,2,I'm not a fan of sorority/apartment parties some students throw so I usually go out in hollywood instead.
Recent Alumnus,2,We are a commuter school.  That is all...
Recent Alumnus,2,scholarship is impossible to get on campus because of competition
College Sophomore,2,I had to get loans and those worry me when I graduate I don't think my parents make enough but they believe so
College Senior,2,It would be nice if a student knew if he or she would be receiving financial aid in March or April instead of late June. Thus you only have a couple of days to come up with the money.
College Sophomore,2,"On-campus housing is actually a bit far from campus and requires a shuttle or walking. The housing is average, with no special perks. Many students who live on campus complain about the noise/music from other students living on campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,I was kind of pushed to attend CSUN by mother. I wished I would have gone to a CC and then transferred out to a school I actually liked.
College Senior,2,"CSUN housing lacks space. I understand it is a student housing, but it is not a slum, neither it should be. I was astonished to see how congested every rooms are. Also, it is student housing, not a damn prison. administrators need to let their guard off for a change."
College Senior,2,Almost everything is fast food & it's regular cost. There should be more restaurants.
Recent Alumnus,2,It is either very very hot or very cold
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you ask about it or pay good enough attention to what is going on around you, you will notice it"
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't many options for nightlife in the city, you have to drive either to Los Angeles or another city."
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't many places too eat besides fast food and big chain restaurants. There aren't many vegetarian or health food places either. The night life is non existent, you have to drive to Los Angeles or another city."
College Freshman,2,The time I notice police is when they are giving tickets or when a student was sexuality assaulted.
College Student,2,"Never got a scholarship I don't even know if they're real, my friends feel the same way."
College Student,2,I will have to wait till i get there.
College Student,2,"I have been applying for scholarships in order to go to college because I know for a fact that my mom cannot pay it entirely. My financial aid has been a problem because they have not send me anything yet, including the scholarship websites. I want to have money and scholarships so that way my mom would not have worry about working two or three jobs just to pay not only mine, but also my brothers. It will be best if I lived on campus because I have no one to take me to my school."
College Sophomore,2,"When it's hot, it's too hot. When it's cold, it's super windy."
College Freshman,2,"It's bad because of the safety, noises and traffic."
College Freshman,2,There are always theft/robbery cases.
Graduate Student,1,I do not take online courses. I have heard that online courses are many times easier to pass and easier to cheat on. if you want to get the maximum out of your educational experience don't take online courses.
Niche User,1,"Look up all the lawsuits this school has had filed against them. Also, if you request PRA documents, you will see all the internal complaints- and since the school does internal investigations- they are never held accountable. DON'T GO TO THIS SCHOOL!! RUN!!!"
Graduate Student,1,"CSUN is a total left wing liberal school with a solid agenda to indoctrinate students with their views. There's no tolerance for critical thinking. They say there is, but there's not. When you even mention a debate that doesn't go along with their agenda you are ostracized and humiliated by the professors. They instigate division and hate that is so rampant in our country today and if you want to be angry and never learn how to try and understand the other side of debates, then this is the school for you.  And don't plan on taking children, family of friends to the graduation ceremonies because after all the education you will pay for, foul mouth and hate speech against other races and people groups is what you will hear in the speakers at these ceremonies. White? Don't even think you'll win any awards regardless of how great you do in school. Reverse discrimination at it's finest.  Do yourself a favor and research other schools."
Recent Alumnus,1,I'm personally against it because it promotes rape culture and cult-like activities and attitudes.
College Junior,1,Stuck up people who think they are better than others.
College Freshman,1,The professors are horrible and don't care about the students
College Freshman,1,"The am performance, fan support, school spirt, are all very poor."
College Freshman,1,"White is the minority. If you are white, people will not accept you. I have been verbally attacked in class because I am white. I have had someone straight up tell me they do not want to be friends because I am white."
College Freshman,1,Weed addicts everywhere. Pretty sure I just saw a guy sharing crack with a squirrel. If you don't smoke you will be an outcast.
College Freshman,1,No sense of safety at all. People here are very sketchy. There have been several sexual assaults and robberies on campus and in the surrounding areas. Stealing is very common. Even sitting in a classroom I do not feel safe.
College Freshman,1,"I am honestly not happy at CSUN. Even with priority registration, getting the classes you want is basically impossible. Most people graduate in 6 years because it is so hard to get classes. And the people who do graduate in 4 years had to take summer and winter classes and lots of online classes. Since CSUN is mostly a commuter school, it is really hard to make friends because most people just want to go to school and then go home. It often feels a lot like high school because most people stick with their high school cliques and won't even attempt to be friends with you. If you like diversity then CSUN is the place for you, however in a political aspect, the university is very liberal. Most students and instructors are liberal. Most discussions in class turn political. White is the minority. If you are a outdoorsy type of person or like country music, then CSUN is not the place for you. Parking on campus is a nightmare! You pay so much money for a parking pass and are not even guaranteed parking. If you show up on campus anytime after 10am you will not find parking at all. Finding a parking spot is like a sport here. It's very competitive and there have been actual fights over parking spaces. On the positive side, CSUN is very affordable and offers lots of financial aid. The location is very convenient and there are plenty of places to eat off campus that are in close walking distance. I am hoping to transfer and get as far away from CSUN as possible.

 Be sure to do your research before going here. CSUN is not for everyone."
College Junior,1,no football team. not part of a major conference. mediocre athletic experience
College Freshman,1,"The school had to stop all fraternity and sorority pledging after one hazing incident ended up killing a student over the summer and another hazing incident was reported at the beginning of this semester.  As it is, either the Greek life on campus is very secretive, or they don't do a whole lot."
College Senior,1,"Everything is fine with the housing and the apartments but as for me I hated living on campus it was the worst ever, They were strict about certain rules and others not so strict its the same thing as living at home except you have to sneak your friends in even for a simple sleepover."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I think that CSUN might have the most ""confused"" group of students all over campus, there is a lot of aimless wandering going around the campus without much of anything getting done."
College Sophomore,1,It's terrible to find parking after 9am.
College Sophomore,1,There aren't many options for transportation unless you either live on campus or close by.
College Sophomore,1,"Most people that go to the games are teachers, and parents of the athletes, there is little to no school moral among the students."
College Sophomore,1,Awful junky greasy fast food only options barely any vegan or plant-based food options for those who care about what they put in their bodies to maintain health
College Sophomore,1,There have been reports of sexual assault and robbery multiple times.
College Sophomore,1,Expensive and usually hard to find parking. 
College Freshman,1,"I would not tell anyone to live here, i hate it"
College Junior,1,There is not a lot of parties I know of.
College Junior,1,"Their is simply no nightlife for students around California State University, Northridge. I am pretty happy that CSUN is not a party school because I can focus on my work."
College Sophomore,1,"Its Los Angeles, so you need your own car. Without a car I don't know how you get anywhere unless you live on campus, which still sucks because its about a mile walk just to get to campus."
College Junior,1,Too small and too strict
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is so much trouble and stress, unless you come about 30 minutes to an hour before your class starts. Unless you have classes starting at 8 a.m. then parking is really easy to find."
College Sophomore,1,The only way you can have a good night life is if you have a car because the nightlife is no where close to campus. You have to go to Hollywood to have an exciting night life.
College Sophomore,1,I have not been able to find any scholarships to apply for.
College Junior,1,Not really much to do on or around the campus. If you have a car then there are plenty of things to do within 30-40 minutes from the campus. Some events and activities on the campus. Nothing special.
Recent Alumnus,1,"If there is a transportation system, I have yet to find it."
College Junior,1,"The policies on financial aid eligibility are strict. If you lose your financial aid anytime throughout your college career and do not meet Satisfactory Academic Progress despite your GPA being a 3.0, 3.4 or even a 4.0. You are only granted one appeal, if you do not meet the SAP after an appeal. YOU LOSE FINANCIAL AID FUNDING FOR THE REST OF YOUR COLLEGE CAREER. meaning no matter how great your GPA is, you have to pay for all tuition cost out of pocket at that university for as long as you are enrolled. You only get one chance. That needs to be change because students aren't perfect and life happens."
College Sophomore,1,I only know a couple of people at my school who do drugs and drink alcohol. It's a very small percentage.
College Senior,1,State budget is low and the competition is fierce.
College Junior,1,"Sports at CSUN are not up to par. Unrealistic as it may sound, I strongly believe that a CSUN football team would boost this grade up to at least a B. A CSUN football team would give me a sense of CSUN pride and would definitely engage me in more school activities."
College Junior,1,It still needs much improvement since parking is limited to the amount of students attending this school.
College Sophomore,1,CSUN has never had a good Physical education program
College Sophomore,1,"The campus parking is terrible, everyone is a commuter and it could take longer finding a spot, then parking off campus and walking. Also a parking pass is over priced and rarely enforced."
College Student,1,"You really need to learn about the parking lots around campus if you plan on parking there. First of all, permits are expensive ($180 per semester, $360 annual pass). CSUN sells more permits than available parking lots. Parking is very difficult because it's usually full in every lot and you need to loop around a few times to catch a spot when someone finally leaves. CSUN is known for it's poor parking space, so more parking lots would definitely satisfy the CSUN community."
College Freshman,1,Its so ridiculous how they charge 300$ for parking and excpect everyone to find parking on top of that there is machines that allow te purchase of a day pass making it worse. But they build a huge field no one needs instead of the parking people do need.
College Sophomore,1,"It seems the campus strictness is very weak at this school. Under aged students get involved with drugs and alcohol but do not seem to get into any trouble. However, it does affect their academics in school."
College Junior,1,"Per semester, $180 is too much. Parking is very inconvenient. Non-structure parking can take 30-45 minutes, but once parked getting to class is fast. If parking in a full structure and trying to find parking, expect to get to campus 1-1.5 hours before your class."
College Junior,1,"A parking pass is about $360 for a year. That's just to be able to park on campus. That doesn't guarantee a parking spot. If you decide to park off campus, watch for street cleaning and 1 to 2-hour only parking signs. I got a ticket before because I overstayed my two hours."
College Junior,1,They don't provide any aid to international stuents. Thats bad
College Sophomore,1,It takes a long time. And it gets very full every time! It is not convenient if it takes a very long time and we get to class late for that.
College Freshman,1,"There is not that much school spirit. The only way to find out anything about a sports team is by the sundial (our schools newspaper), friends, or even going to the games. I see more fraternity and sorority students at the games then I see your average joe students."
College Junior,1,"Nightlife on or near Cal State Northridge is pretty nonexistent if at all. There is a small pub and grill on campus and social life on campus is scarce. The student body and associated student union have made efforts to entice student life on campus, however, it is still largely a commuter campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not sure.  When I was there, the library was the nightlife.  It was mainly to study of course.  I never stayed in a dorm but commuted to and from college.  I can't say this was a party type school.  It was mainly a business, history, geography, and latin american studies school as I remember it to be.  Check out the free online internet at the library, if it is not during or a few weeks before mid terms or finals.  If it is busy, I would avoid it, since students are using the internet for research and studies."
College Junior,1,"I don't even drive and I'm still able to report this grade. The one thing you will always hear students complaining about: PARKING. Everyone complains about $360 annual parking pass and how you have to get to in the parking structure hours before your class starts just to find a spot. I live in the dorms and ride my bike everywhere as to not deal with this. But what can you expect from a campus of 35,000 students?"
College Sophomore,1,"They try to sucker students in to loans before the student realizes it. They call it an award making it look like they are giving you free money.

The scholarship program is great.The manager works one on one with me.

CSUN does not put permanent medical expenses in to consideration for people applying for financial aid."
College Sophomore,1,Too much physical abuse in the Burger King on campus
College Senior,1,Nothing to Do – Northridge doesn't have that many things to do at night. Everything on reseda is mainly food. You can go on ventura and find things to do but you have to drive a while
College Freshman,1,"Monday through Thursday, between 8am-5pm, camping is just awful. There are cars backed up waiting for spots, and it can take up to an hour to find a spot."
College Sophomore,1,"While there are PLENTY of spaces available with the parking permit, there are also MORE THAN PLENTY of students that go to CSUN. What does this mean? When the most classes are going on (at around 11 AM), it gets extremely crowded. I recommend biking or walking if you live close by."
College Sophomore,1,"When I applied to universities, I thought that when I got accepted I would be plopped into an environment filled with enthusiasm and spirit for my school and its traditions. When I began living in the dorm at CSU Northridge I realized I was sadly mistaken. No one goes to football games. (In fact, I don't even know if we have a football team...) No one goes to big end-of-semester parties. There's hardly anything to tie you to your school other than the money you are paying them in hopes of an education."
College Junior,1,"Party School for the Alcoholics – CSUN is a huge party school. While people do smoke, it's mostly about alcohol. Almost everybody you see on campus you can guarantee will be at a party sometime during that week drinking. Drinking is very popular among the campus and dorm life."
College Sophomore,1,The parking in northridge is horrible. There is never anywhere to park.if you dont show up to school at least 1 hr early expect be late
College Sophomore,1,"A Nightmare – It's so bad. It's overcrowded. Students who don't show up at 7:00 am have so much difficulty finding a parking spot. The cost is ridiculous, especially for all the trouble and inconvenience it brings."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Enough – I dont know what the cost would be, but the new parking lots are not productive enough to better the constant waves of traffic"
College Senior,1,"There are many challenges that CSUN students are facing. Fees are increasing every semester. Many friends decided to not  go college this year and save money. CSUN students come from different races, but the Latino and Black CSUN students are not enrolling in classes they need due to cost of attendance and living expenses. Im a Latino, and I need three more units to graduate from CSUN, but I dont have money nor help to achieve my goal."

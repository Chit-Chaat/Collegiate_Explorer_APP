Alum,5,I loved going to school here. The classes were small and challenging. The campus atmosphere was friendly and academic.
Alum,5,Perhaps the best decision I have ever made was to attend this wonderful college. It is truly a little Ivy and it is just the size that distinguishes it from big Ivies.
Alum,5,"During my time, before the pandemic, I never had to take an online class. Now looking back, I feel like I was very lucky. I am so glad that I was able to attend classes physically."
Alum,5,Professors are very helpful and adaptive in providing online materials as well as virtual help when necessary.
Alum,5,"It was a great 4 years at Conn. However, there is very little diversity and there is now little to no party scene. But great and challenging academic environment. My professors in the Human Development department are highly qualified and very knowledgable. They are also very helpful and accessible outside of the classroom. They also were sure to keep flexible schedules to make time for their students."
Freshman,5,"Great community school filled with kind and motivated students. By the water, the campus is very pretty and boasts many amenities. The athletic center on the water has great views. There's a place for everyone at Conn."
Sophomore,5,"The Connecticut College atmosphere is one that fosters student growth, both academic and personal, and there are an incredible amount of resources at the college to support students in many different ways. For example, the Academic Resource Center is such an amazing resource that helps students in any way that they need. Also, there are so many clubs and organizations that make it quite easy to get involved and meet new people on campus. Probably the most amazing thing about Conn is that most classes are so small, and because of this, you can get to know your professors quite well. This, to me, is the most important aspect of my education, because I know that forming relationships—even with professors—is a form of networking, and that is critical. In many ways, college is an investment and is about cultivating valuable, life-long relationships with peers and faculty that will ultimately serve you in the future. I would not change a thing about Conn."
Freshman,5,"Academically I love the school. After one class in psychology I was sure that it was the major for me. The campus is incredibly beautiful. The school is in a location where you can easily get to New York or Boston. Due to its size, the party scene at the school is rather weak. You can always make it a good time, but it does lack the college party feeling."
Freshman,5,"It's easy to feel at home, no matter who you are, you'll find a good spot as long as you are genuine."
Freshman,5,"I haven't yet started my time there, but I can say confidently that the college fosters an atmosphere that I've never seen before. It's just the safest, most lively, most entertaining, and coolest place ever! I really wouldn't change much! Maybe some of the clubs could be altered or played with, but I'm not so sure. Love this place! Hope it changes my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Freshman,5,"Conn has a great community. The use of the Honor Code only shows the trusting environment on campus. Although there are things that could be better, it's still really good! "
College Freshman,5,It's college so there is drinking. But I have really never seen anyone who has had too much to drink without a support system to help them through the night/next day.
College Freshman,5,"There is a superb presence against sexual assault. All women groups, all men groups, and co-ed groups are all very active in preventing assault. Many of my friends take initiative in situations and I really haven't seen anything go wrong."
College Freshman,5,"Housing is good here. Basically all sophomores and older will have a single or live in an apartment, and freshman usually are in doubles or triples."
College Freshman,5,"Conn is amazing. I am so happy I chose this school over some of the other NESCAC's. The honor code is really something to brag about, it is really peer enforced and I can feel the shared governance the students have on campus."
Senior,5,"Conn has been four of the best years of my life. The people are amazing, I've made awesome friends that I'll have for the rest of my life, the social scene is fun and the professors, classes and individual attention is outstanding. I would however like to see them change their attitude and policies towards parties. Social life should be encouraged and campus safety should be a group that you can count on for help, not work to avoid. "
College Sophomore,5,"There are so many different types of courses to take. And they cover all different fields, if you're bored with one thing it is easy to move onto something else. The professors are very accommodating to everything that students need. Even if someone needs help outside of the professors office hours they will make time to help that student out. Classes are pretty difficult but if you manage your time well and do all the extra help sessions then it makes the workload much more doable."
College Sophomore,5,"We follow the Honor Code, so that is putting our trust in those around us. So with our belongings there isn't much stealing going on because everyone expects that they aren't going to take your stuff so you shouldn't take theirs. Also I feel very safe on our campus, it is pretty small and well light so it is easy to get around and easy to get someplace fast if needed. We have a great sexual assault prevention program in place called Green Dot, and many kids on campus are certified in it, and lots of our sports team sponsor it by having an annual game each year to raise awareness."
College Sophomore,5,"I love Connecticut College. There are so many great students, professors, clubs, and activities."
College Freshman,5,Classes are very hard and professors have very high expectations. There will be a lot of work for all classes.
College Sophomore,5,"CELS IS GREAT. The workshops are a little silly, but the CELS advisors are wonderful. One of the perks of going to a small school is that they can work really closely with you over a long period of time and really learn all about your career interests and prospects."
College Sophomore,5,"I love my academic experience. Nearly every professor I've had (DON'T TAKE CHOIR, PROFESSOR MOY ACTUALLY SUCKS) has been supportive, stimulating, and approachable. I have found the things that I'm interested in and I feel like I will be able to make something out of them because of the education I'm receiving and the connections I'm making."
College Junior,5,"campus is very safe, i leave out my laptop, headphones etc. and have never had a problem."
College Junior,5,Conn offers health/safety in all forms. It ranges from the on-campus health center for physical illness to free counseling services. Green Dot is taken incredibly seriously and is upheld by a majority of the campus.
College Junior,5,"The CELS office has national recognition. Many employers are amazed about how well Conn kids transition to office/working life. Coming from a liberal arts school, we are learning how to learn and this transcends the classroom and allows for students to apply their academic and personal experiences to best work within the parameters of a new situation."
College Junior,5,Conn is a feeling and a trait. I cannot explain what it is like to be a Conn students aside from saying a joke about camels. The campus community allows for everyone to be him/her best self without judgement.
College Junior,5,"Many alumni that played sports deeply respect their coaches and time playing at Conn and show this by giving back. This ranges from fiscal gifts to offering networking opportunities to athletes. The gym is open to the entire campus community rather that dividing the athletes and non-athletes. The school does not have a football team (as there is no female counterpart) but this allows other sports to receive attention. Soccer is the most commonly watched sport in the fall, with ice hockey replacing it the winter, and lacrosse in the spring. Being a Division 3 school, the athletes still highly value academics and are held to the same standard as non-athletes."
College Junior,5,"Conn cares about the growth and development of the whole person. The professors are beyond helpful in both academics and as role models to pursue a field of interest. The small classes allow of participation and for students to have a larger say in what is taught or discussed. Many advisors provide networking help when students are seeking jobs in their related fields The CELS office is crucial to having the best experience as it not only provides a grant to rising seniors, but helps more than 90% of students get a job within 6 months of graduation. Your individual advisor works with you for an other year following graduation to ensure a positive transition to the working world. Conn fosters the passions of all students; the many extracurriculars allow for interest to be shared throughout the whole community."
College Freshman,5,The campus is very safe. I have never felt nervous walking on campus at night.
College Freshman,5,"From what I hear, the college is pretty great with internships. I didn't take advantage of our CELS (Career Enhancing Life Skills) office, but if you take a few seminars throughout your time here (seminar topics include how to write a grant, how to build a resume, mock interviews, etc.) you are eligible for a 3,000 dollar internship of your choosing that the college funds for you."
College Freshman,5,"Connecticut College has a whole office called the Career Enhancing Life Skills program which is devoted to helping students prepare for the workforce. It funds a 3,000$ internship the summer after your junior year, and helps you get any other job too. They offer a variety of seminars with topics ranging from grant writing, resume building, interview techniques, they do mock interviews, teach you how to tie a tie, anything you need. They send out a list of potential internships and jobs each week to the entire student body."
College Freshman,5,"People who don't like the food are usually whiny rich-kids who are used to Mommy and Daddy providing fine cuisine. It's cafeteria food, but by cafeteria food standards, it's damn good. The numerous dining halls offer a variety, and Harris is open almost all the time. If you don't like the main course you can make yourself a salad, or a waffle, or have a slice of pizza. You have options."
College Junior,5,"I've had a blast these last few years. I've made very good friends through the clubs, groups, and organizations I'm in and we always have a blast together. We just hosted a party last weekend for 50-70 people. Conn night life is definitely better as an upperclassmen, when all your friends live in the off campus houses and you don't have to play the ""Who do you know"" game."
College Junior,5,"Despite the fact that many of the dorms are old, my rooms over the years have been fantastic. I currently have a queen sized bed in my room and have had fully liberty to deck it out with tapestries and rugs. I applied for group housing last year and was able to live with 7 of my friends on the same floor. Needless to say this year has been a blast."
College Freshman,5,"I always feel safe on campus, mostly because of the very strict Honor Code!"
College Junior,5,"The professors care about you. The older you get, the more work you will have but it is all progressive. The CELS program provides an amazing opportunity for internships, offering $3,000 dollars for the summer after junior year for students to intern at a company of their choice. It is also easy to acquire campus jobs and internships in New London, it just requires putting in the effort."
College Junior,5,"Connecticut college is amazing. The faculty and staff make time and truly care about you. There is a lot of a leeway in the curriculum to allow students to do what interest them. Registration can be extremely frustrating, particularly if one is registering for introductory courses or general education requirements but it definitely gets easier as one moves up academically. The workload is pretty demanding depending on the course but as long as one knows how to time manage they will be fine. There are several academic centers which allow students to further concentrate their studies whether it be CISLA which internationalizes their majors or PICA which focuses on public policy (to name but two). Studying abroad is very popular amongst juniors and the school really helps with the process."
College Junior,5,"Connecticut College is one of the most beautiful school's in the country, and this is not solely referring to the campus. The student body is overwhelming attractive. Everyone is generally well dressed and groomed."
College Freshman,5,A plethora of interesting classes and fantastic teachers.
College Freshman,5,"A small community with friendly, open minded individuals, that encourages students to find their passion and pursue it."
Alum,4,Professors did use technology to help students understand the material. I did not take any full classes online.
Alum,4,Overall I had a great experience at Connecticut College. I was able to participate in sports and still uphold my classroom standing. Conn Coll really pushes you to work hard and collaborate with your classmates and professors to fully understand concepts.
Sophomore,4,Nurturing and supporting environment-- small classes and supporting professors. Friendly student body.
Sophomore,4,"Connecticut college cares about its students by giving them support in their academics and social life. Supportive faculty and students are friendly, driven but not over-competitive. Cleaning in dorms needs improvement."
Freshman,4,Very supportive of students from all backgrounds. You can accomplish anything if you work hard and are constantly pushing to get support from the faculty and administration.
Sophomore,4,"I like that the school gives people the opportunity  and even encourages to pursue many interests, no matter how different they are."
Sophomore,4,"Connecticut college has a great social scene and awesome academics. You'll get so much out of the school's many clubs, work studies, surrounding community and sports teams, but you have to seek these experiences out rather than waiting for them to come to you. The facilities are getting better every year. There is a large arboretum and greenhouse that makes outdoor access very easy, not to mention running trails and river access on the west side of campus. The major downside to the school is the steep tuition that seems to drastically increase year by year."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the ability to freely pick my classes. I meet with an adviser and we discuss what is right for me. There are also a lot of resources on campus that help me preform to the best of my abilities.
Freshman,4,"I'm very happy at conn. I wish there was more of a social scene- no real bar life and parties are small, cramped, and mediocre. New London is trying to figure itself out so far unsuccessfully. Mystic is nice but a little farther away. Campus is beautiful, green, and small. The architecture is lovely and the dorms are nice and mixed grade. Freshman housing is great- AC, huge rooms etc. Other housing is pretty decent and there are a lot of options - apartments, houses, dorms. The food is pretty good with many options for a smaller school. Professors engage and are passionate and the classes are really interesting. Every professor knows your name and is willing to help you out. Gym is nice and new. Conn has a pretty great internship program too ($7,000 for juniors who take unpaid positions)."
Senior,4,"Connecticut College was a very enriching place to continue my education. I was a Classics major, and I sincerely enjoyed my time as part of the department. ConnColl is a place to form long-lasting and unique bonds with both professors and students alike. However, I would like to see Conn become more diverse and more accepting of students from other races. As a student of color, I did feel rather ostracized from the student body. Furthermore, I was the only student of color in many of my classes. Maybe my major is a discipline that does not attract students of other ethnicities, but I would still like to see Conn become a more diverse, wholly-welcoming and socially-motivated environment."
Sophomore,4,"The academics are very strong, however the social scene leaves a little to be desired. Most of these kids come from prep/boarding schools so it seems a little bit like an extension of high school. However if you can find your place, the community here is amazing. The campus is beautiful!"
Sophomore,4,"Just finished my first year at Conn and I enjoyed most of it. It is a small school, so you will always see someone you know when you are in Harris or walking across campus. Also not a lot of things to do some weekends but the school tries their best to provide fun activities. Diversity is a big issue, as well as issues of race and gender when it comes to disciplinary issues."
Junior,4,"Great school overall! Although Connecticut College is small, it has an inviting environment and has helped me feel at home."
Senior,4,Conn gave me the opportunity to explore different avenues of study I might be interested in pursuing. The close knit community and small size of the college made me feel right at home. The professors are extremely willing to help you succeed.
Sophomore,4,Great school with a beautiful campus. Student are able to get to know professors well and ask for help whenever needed.
Senior,4,"Conn is a really tight knit community and a great place to go to school. Going out can get repetitive, and the immediate local area of New London blows."
Sophomore,4,Great community feeling because of the small size. So many ways to create and pursue your passions! Love the professor to student relationship and the caring and friendly feeling on campus.
Freshman,4,"Only a month into my freshman year at Conn, I have already begun to call this place my home. While it is by no means perfect, it is pretty sweet. Every Thursday and Saturday night is full of partying and great times. The people are all really cool. The only thing that sucks is that the school is dominated by athletes so that can sometimes be intimidating. But, there are more than enough non-athletes to surround yourself with if you are not into sports."
College Freshman,4,"Lots of white people, but still diverse. There are a lot of people from different parts of the country, so its not just preppy WASP's that so many other schools have. But its pretty vanilla here. There is absolutely no discrimination against anyone though, thats taken very seriously here."
College Freshman,4,"Athletics are chill here. I love watching soccer games on the green, but what I really love is how well integrated the athletes are with non-athletes. I am not a varsity athlete but still have many friends who are."
College Sophomore,4,We have a great career services center that really sets students up to find internships and jobs for the summer or during school. The people that work  there are always very welcoming and want to help find you the best possible fit they can. They also work on finding the best programs that fit their students.
College Sophomore,4,"Getting the place you want to live can be a hassle. But once you settled on a place or even get the one you want you are able to turn it into a home. No matter where you are the rooms are a fairly nice place to live in. Most dorms in south are more for partying, while north dorms are usually for athletes or freshmen, but if you're surrounded by your friends you can have fun no matter where you are. Central dorms are the ones closest to classes."
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics are great at Conn. The teams are all pretty good, I mean it's in the NESCAC so pretty tough competition, but we seem to fair pretty well. The facilities are great for most sports. I am a part of the swim team and our locker room is not the greatest, especially not compared to the locker rooms that other teams have. But the gym and the equipment that we have available to us is just what we need."
College Sophomore,4,"Conn is so great. One thing that I personally love is how friendly everyone is. The students, the staff and faculty. Everyone is always there to help if you need it. Or if you just need someone to eat with. And many of the professors will go out of their way to help you with whatever problems you may be having. It seems to be a common aspect of the people that attend Connecticut College, where they are all extremely friendly and helpful."
College Sophomore,4,Most people get jobs after graduating
College Sophomore,4,The plex is definitely the best place to live
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the academics here. There are tons of interesting courses, you can get as specific as you want. I suggest taking classes over a wide variety of areas, you might find something you didn't know you liked. Test out classes in different time slots to see what options work best. The professors are for the most part very approachable if you ask for help. Don't overwork yourself, and don't overpoint unless you know what you're getting into."
College Sophomore,4,"One thing that's unique about Conn is our internship program. If you do all the workshops and little things Carear Enhancing Life Skills (CELS) office asks you to do from freshman through junior year, then you get money for an internship the summer between Junior and Senior year. Most of the requirements are easy. They will also help you find an internship that's right for you. Basically anyone who wants an internship can get one.

CELS is also good for helping you figure out your life post college. They bring a lot of events and employers on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Class size is pretty good. The only large lecture are intro sciences, most are small discussion based classes. There's lots of classes offered, I suggest exploring and seeing what your interested in. The professors, for the most part are very approachable."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not an athlete. I went to a high school that didn't have sports teams, and ended up rooming with an athlete which made me nervous at first. But it turned out great. What I love about student athletes on this campus is they are real people. They are the people you go to class with, eat in the dining hall with, live in your halls. If you go out to support them, you're not just supporting you school, you're supporting your peers. That being said, sports games aren't well attended. Some games and sports are bigger than others, especially Green Dot games, games dedicated to raising awareness about sexual violence prevention.

Being a student athlete at Conn is hard. I know this from watching my roommate. It is a full time commitment, even in the off-season. You don't get any breaks on classwork, you are a student every bit you are an athlete. 

Club and intermural sports are pretty popular. It's pretty easy to get involved and they can get pretty intense.

The facilities are good and open to all students, but it's a bit of a hike to get there. All athletic facilities are across the street and you have to cross a bridge with a lot of stairs. I mostly use the pool, which is a really nice facility"
College Sophomore,4,"I wanted to find a school I loved. The truth is, I don't love Conn. I love parts of it. At the end of the day you have to weigh the good and the bad, and see if your happy in the end. This review will not tell you what college is like, because every experience is different, but I will try to let you know my experience. 

Connecticut College is a largely residential campus, which was one of the things that attracted me to the school. The dorms are nice, most of the rooms are decently sized, and the campus is small enough that you are never that far from anything. Only freshman have to have roommates, rooming of course always comes with mixed reviews. I was lucky and ended up loving my roommate, but it is random so its the luck of the draw. I had some problems with my hall being to loud on class nights, which my house staff tried to address but never really changed. 

The campus is beautiful. There is always something going on. It is a little hard to get off campus without a car. There are plenty of clubs and stuff to join, it can be overwhelming, but remember to go at your own pace.

The classes I took were the best part for me. Okay, I'm a little bit of a nerd, but I discovered interests I never knew I had, and took classes from a class on refugees in Europe, to a class of Hispanic Identity (taught in Spanish!) that made me feel like I wanted to do something to connect with the world as a whole. Make sure to take classes that interest you.

Sometimes, I do feel out of place both being from a low income, and not really caring for the ""prestige"" of the school. But this hasn't stopped me from making friends, or finding things that I'm interested in."
College Sophomore,4,Great school. Plus the faculty is very nice and helpful
College Sophomore,4,There are many programs put in placed to education students about sexual assaults etc. Though it seems that many take part in these programs just to be part of them. I feel that there are mostly likely some people who have engaged in hurtful activities who have taken part in the education programs.
College Freshman,4,"The diversity on campus is pretty noticeable. They have many programs for minority students including an extra orientation. Politically, most people are very liberal."
College Sophomore,4,"Darcie Folsom, director of sexual violence prevention and advocacy, is lovely. Conn is one of the leading institutions in terms of sexual violence prevention; we talk about it, we work to stop it. My counselor is great, but the rest of student counseling services needs work, same with the health center."
College Sophomore,4,"I think the athletics at Conn are great because they aren't emphasized in any major way. I hate athletic idolization, so it makes me happy that varsity sports aren't really popular here. I love club sports though - they're everything sports should be, an engaging activity that develops both mental and physical skills, but there is also not really any pressure and the players don't suffer from delusions of grandeur."
College Sophomore,4,"Conn is a great place. The best things about it are the academic programs and the professors. A lot of work needs to be done in terms of the student experience outside of academics, but there are a million ways for students to get involved in improving the school, and the college is currently working on a gigantic new plan for the next decade or so. People at Conn are genuinely caring and genuinely inquisitive. It is easy to distinguish yourself here as long as you work hard and are willing to be open to many different experiences."
College Freshman,4,New Gym just opened with lots of new workout equipment
College Freshman,4,It is a good school
College Junior,4,"There is a huge movement to get more diversity on campus. This is not a top-down approach of the administration forcing it, but a strong want from the students as well."
College Junior,4,"Drugs and alcohol are there if you look/want them, but there are drug/alcohol free dorms and events offered. It is not a popularity matter if one does/does not drink. Everyone understands that each student is an individual and acts as one."
College Junior,4,"Everyone has to live on campus. This is good because there everyone is close to one another and it does add a more communal feel. However, it makes parties more difficult as there are few large private spaces. However, the newer dorms are modern while the older dorms have a very homey atmosphere."
College Senior,4,The professor are awesome. The people you'll meet are great. And the Conn experience is awesome if you take advantage of everything they have to offer.
College Freshman,4,People who know of the school are very impressed when I tell them that I go here. The career services are very helpful and students are all eligible to receive a school paid internship.
College Freshman,4,The school and the community is great. There is a huge stress on academics and everyone seems to be in the same boat with work load. Professors are very helpful and coursework is manageable with good time management skills. Some of the freshman activities are very repetitive.
College Freshman,4,All of the residence halls are a close distance to academic buildings. The dorms is south and central campus are beautifully built. The plex is newer and has more of a traditional dorm feel.
College Freshman,4,The Connecticut College community is very welcome and supportive.
College Senior,4,"The careers office is phenomenal they make sure you are up today on your resume, they make sure you have a summer internship, they make sure you are prepared for interviews, they prepped for you for the real world!"
College Senior,4,"With the exception of a few, i've loved all of my professors."
College Senior,4,"I've mostly live in the plex (newest building), but it's my last year so I decided to move. I like my choice, I just wish the dining hall was right downstairs like I was used to, but it's great. The social atmosphere is much better in older buildings than in the Plex. Staff is always great."
College Senior,4,I believe that the different sports teams should be more racially inclusive.
College Senior,4,"I think for me, the best part of attending Connecticut College are the professors that I have had and the encounters I have had with student organizations. The professors that have come my way , I have been nothing but amazing. They make sure that you are doing well academically, mentally and emotionally, that is just amazing and something that I am not used to seeing. There are hundreds of student organizations on my campus and I can say that many of them are very welcoming. Are the personal relationships I've created with people on campus I can also say that my campus is gorgeous and that is something that I love about going there. However, like in many schools there's this fight for equity and inclusion on my campus and once the battle is won (it will take a while) I can say that Connecticut College Will probably be close to perfect."
College Freshman,4,"Campus is beautiful. Most buildings are old gray stone, and very majestic. The outdoors spaces are to die for. The new library is pretty cool. The student center is pretty meh, as is a lot of the interiors of the dorms. We have a lot of new computer labs and some really great classrooms, but we also have some old crappy classrooms, and our art studios are generally poorly furnished. The greenhouse is great, and Olin and New London Hall are beautifully built and have solid technology."
College Freshman,4,"Never before have I seen so many attractive people with such poor fashion sense. I didn't know that ""prep"" was still considered an acceptable style until I came here. Lots of Sperry's, Vineyard Vines, pastel-colored shorts, and pretty much everyone has the same haircut. Maybe it's because so many of us came from high schools with uniforms. If you can get past that, most kids here are pretty damn good looking. We spend a lot of time at the gym, and are very image conscious. There is a small underswell of hipster-artsy kids who are also attractive, in a less clean-cut, boring way."
College Sophomore,4,Ive never seen a problem with it.  Always options to choose from.
College Sophomore,4,I get alright financial aid and the process to get it is not too difficult.  The real problem is just the price of tuition.
College Sophomore,4,Lots of options at dining halls.  Unlimited meal plan.  Pretty good food.  I dont comlain.
College Senior,4,"Pretty big rooms, social scene is fun if you seek opportunities... The college offers a wide variety of evening programs as well as academic and non-academic lectures and meetings."
College Sophomore,4,"The Dance Department is amazing. The professors are great mentors, the classes are engaging and interesting, and the performances I've done have ranged from intriguing and thoughtful to exciting and silly. Every moment has been wonderful. You can't get this kind of training except from a conservatory. If you're at all serious about dance, Conn should be one of the top schools on your list."
College Sophomore,4,The staff are very open to working with students to make sure they are healthy and happy. The Green Dot program has been effective at keeping sexual assault down at Connecticut College. Everybody makes a conscious effort to help anyone who seems vulnerable. I've never had a problem with sexual assault myself. Any form of sexual assault in public is quickly shut down by fellow students.
Freshman,2,"I'm a freshman who is transferring out. I'm writing this because I wish someone had told me the truth about Conn before I attended. If you want to major in anything in the arts, do NOT come to Conn. The arts programs are understaffed and under-funded, and do not prepare you for the real world at all. The school is small, and feels small. You see the same 100 people everyday, and diversity is insanely lacking with something like 70% of students being white and 50% of students being solely from CT and MA. The social scene is also very small. A cappella is huge on campus and they have their own parties, while many sports teams section off to party on their own. There isn't much to do on campus besides that and the occasional event. There is almost nothing to do in New London besides see a movie or go to Target, and even that is hard as nothing is accessible from campus without a car. Academics are good outside of the arts though, and many people do love Conn, I'm just not one of them."
College Sophomore,2,"Nightlife isn't the best - whether you want to party or not. There are a few bars in New London, which are much easier to get to if you have a car. The bars are pretty easy to get into if your underage. Most people stay on campus to party. Thursday and Saturday nights are the biggest nights. If you choose not to drink or party, it can be annoying, because everyone is on campus so it is impossible to avoid."
College Sophomore,2,"Most people party on campus. The Ridge is known for the best parties, but that's mostly for athletes. Many dorms are known as party dorms, and on the weekends drinking and partying is just about everywhere. If you don't want to drink or party it can be hard to avoid because almost everyone is on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"As some one who doesn't drink, the emphasis on drinking makes me a little uncomfortable. I respect other people's right to make different choices than my own, but sometimes the noise level and presence of drunk people makes it hard to sleep or study. I don't feel like there is a lot of peer pressure to drink, but sometimes it feels like there isn't much else to do. Drugs are less visible than alcohol, though certainly used. Floralia (Spring Weekend) is particularly bad if you don't want to drink or use drugs, because campus can get crazy and there's no alternative activities. There are pretty good sub free dorm options."
College Freshman,2,Parties are usually at the on-campus apartments across mohegan ave. It is a pretty far walk from some dorms and the parties can be hard to get in to.
College Freshman,2,The party scene on campus revolves around the upperclassmen who live in on-campus apartments. As underclassmen it can be hard to get in to the parties if you don't know someone who lives in one of these apartments. Non-athletes will have the hardest time getting in. A lot of people will go to the bars in new london when the on-campus apartments are not having parties.
College Freshman,2,No one really cares except for the athletes themselves
College Freshman,2,"Not much political, religious, racial, socioeconomic, or ethnic diversity. Lots of boring WASPs from a suburb of an East Coast city who are apolitical."
College Freshman,2,"Students rarely venture into New London because it's a bit rough around the edges. There are tons of great opportunities to be outside in the surrounding area though, the beach is not far away, and there are many parks and hiking trails to take advantage of."
College Sophomore,2,"Not good administration.  Never talk to the students, dont understand the students.  Only care about themselves and their own success"
College Sophomore,2,Not many options for housing.  Not enough apartments or independent living spaces for upperclassman. Have to apply for the few apartments we doe have. Not allowed to live off campus
College Freshman,2,The school pretty much does not allow off-campus housing. The few students who live off-campus live with their families. There are very few places near campus that are available for rent anyway.
College Freshman,2,"Most places are too far from campus to get to without a car. There are limited options after 11pm. Some very good restaurants in Mystic, Groton, and even New London, but not easily accessible and very few deliver."
College Freshman,2,"Though I qualified for federal financial aid, Connecticut College had different standards and I didn't even get work study. It is absurdly high tuition and if you come from a middle class family, there are no guarantees that the college will help you afford it, or so has been my experience anyway."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus Housing is really the luck of the draw. It also depends on what you want, and what kind of person you are. If you prefer that your housing is quiet, try North Campus (specifically Morrison and Wright), Blackstone, Smith, and Burdick. Smith and Burdick are quiet housing, and Blackstone is substance-free. If you want a balance between partying and quiet, Central is probably best. Try Plant, Branford, or Windham. Larrabee, KB, and Lazrus are more like South in terms of loudness, so those are comparable to South Dorms, which I will mention now. All of the South campus dorms are infamous for being ruckus almost every night of the week. If you're interested in living in a place where there's always a party, South is definitely for you. 

The better housing options come your junior and senior year, when you can opt to live in ""Off-Campus Housing"" (Ridge and Winchester, 191, Earth House, etc). It's more comfortable, but pretty far from the main campus. It's a good walk to get from there to your classes. 

It's really dependent on what you want. Also, quick side note: if you have bad allergies, Don't live in North (the Plex). I had horrendous allergies my whole freshman year that got much better when I switched to Central this year."
College Sophomore,2,"The party scene at this school revolves around partying in cramped singles, heading off to ""Ridge"" or ""Winchester"" housing (which either gets broken up or shut down by people blacking out and going to the hospital), or going to ""Cro Dances"", which feel like a quintessential middle school class on drugs. There are some off-campus options, but they are restricted until you're 21. 

The one place off campus that didn't card was recently busted, so you have to rely on older friends for alcohol. Otherwise, alcohol isn't really accessible to you if you're underage. 

Your typical weekend will probably look like this: Pregame in yours or a friend's room, go to a couple of friends' parties in various other rooms, hit up a Cro Dance/ go to a Ridge party, go to Cro for late night food, be back in your room asleep by 2 AM. If you want an exciting party scene, Conn Coll is NOT the school for you."
College Junior,2,Not many places besides mcdonalds
College Freshman,2,I hardly see the presence of athletics activities on campus.
College Sophomore,2,The curriculum forces students to fulfill a broad array of core requirements which hinders students from focusing in on their major; It makes the prospect of double majoring more difficult.
College Junior,2,"I have not had the best experience with financial. With dramatic changes in my financial situation with my father passing away, they failed to accommodate those changes and help me through a very difficult time. Getting through school is proving to be very stressful"
College Sophomore,2,"New London is not walking distance, and it isn't too fun.  Mystic is nice, but you also have to drive, and it's farther away.  New York and Boston are each about 1 in a half hours away, but it's hard to get off campus to go there."
College Sophomore,2,"There are a few college-owned apartments that are kind of off-campus, but they're not considered off=campus living.  Other than that, students are now not allowed to live off campus starting this coming year."
College Sophomore,2,"Drug scene is fairly minimal other than weed and some cocaine. Weed is very accessible and accepted on campus,\"
College Sophomore,2,"Very little selection for majors outside the basic liberal arts. No connection with local internships, job placement resources are highly overrated."
College Sophomore,2,"Lots of rain, very windy campus because of the Long Island sound. If you really like wet, cold, and windy environments, this is the place for you!"
College Sophomore,2,"I can't speak for need-based financial aid, but the schools offers no merit-based aid or scholarships or anything of the like. To be honest, paying 60,000 a year for this place is a rip off."
College Sophomore,2,"There is very little diversity on this campus, and this is an issue they have been struggling with for a while. I have spoken with international students, and many of them worry that they were only brought here to provide diversity for the white students. The dining hall looks almost segregated, with all the athletes towards one and and all the international/ethnic students at the other end."
College Sophomore,2,"There are very few schools in the area, other than a few community colleges and the Coast Guard Academy. The city of New London is pretty boring, and there aren't many options in terms of having fun in the town. Almost all activity occurs on campus, and the schools generally promotes students staying on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus housing is extremely limited, unless you are a fan of living in a single for four years. You have to apply for any hosing that is not in the dormitories, and it is very competitive. Also, beginning next year, student will not be able to live off campus at all. The school has had a problem with way too many people trying to transfer/ go abroad, and is struggling to keep enough students on campus for the year. The dormitories are very outdated, but they have a good location on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"There are a decent amount of computers in the library, but at any time during or near finals, every single computer will be taken guaranteed. As a Computer Science major, I would also say that the program is rather underfunded in terms of utilities, despite having some great teachers."
College Freshman,2,"Not much accessibility to downtown unless you have a car. It seems very convenient to be so close to NYC and Boston, but in reality it isn't nearly as accessible as you think it would be."
College Freshman,2,"Not enough to do, no nightlife outside campus except the bars in New Lo"
College Freshman,2,It is windy all of the time and pretty cold on most days.
College Sophomore,2,spots are not near your dorm and it is very expensive
College Sophomore,2,"I didn't receive any and it put a huge dent in my parents wallets. 60 grand a year? if anyone is reading this, think about that for a second. are you going to be able to go to grad school if you pay that much?! you better take your classes seriously......."
College Freshman,2,"There is not much to do outside of campus, especially if you are underage. The New London bars are supposedly very sketchy."
College Junior,2,"Pass the Tylenol – They need every form possible from tax return copies to FASFA and CSS. It's a big headache, but it can pay off. Generally, a frustrating process and department in comparison to others."
College Senior,2,Students Often Get Sick – There are several times I have eaten in both the cafeteria and snack shop and have gotten extremely ill.  Last year I lived off campus just so I could cook my own food but who has time to cook when you are busy with your academics
College Junior,2,Mother Nature's Experimental Lab – Being in New England means that Conn students are subject to the whims of Mother Nature's experimental lab. One day is beautiful and sunny the next it is raining and there seems to be monsoon like downpour's and the next it you can't feel portions of your body because it's so cold outside. That being said most people knowing the incredibly varying tendencies of the weather are either always prepared for whatever or just don't care and deal with the weather's craziness as it comes. In the beginning of the year in late summer/early fall and once spring hits people take advantage of the beautiful weather and its combination with our beautiful campus and hit the greens in full force.
College Freshman,2,"A Sea of White – Statistically speaking, Conn is made up of 90% white students (so I've been told). This means that the Hipanics, African Americans, Asians, and international students only make up 10% of the student body. Coming from NYC, this is a big difference, though not one that is difficult to get used to. I've heard of incidents where people have been discriminated due to race among students, but I've never experienced it myself."
Alum,1,"My four years at Connecticut College was a pretty good oppurtunity to figure out exactly what is wrong with the academic system in America. You can read about Professor Pessin's ill treatment for criticizing Hamas, elsewhere, and my personal ""enlightenment"" has not left me loving the college from a personal level as well. After expressing opposition to abortion in a class which I was unceremoniously heckled out, I got the distinct pleasure of having a series of rumors spread by students and our irresponsible professors about me somehow finding out which students had gotten abortions(I honestly have no clue how one would even go about this)and going around personally harassing them. No, harassment at this campus is a tactic reserved for the privileged group that more and more dictates what can and can't be said in this stifling, anti-intellectual, echo chamber."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have greek life
College Senior,1,We don't have Greek life
College Sophomore,1,They dont let us live off-campus anymore.  Administration got rid of some of the best nights from Conn.
College Sophomore,1,"New London is a very shady area. I don't go out often, especially at night, because I personally wouldn't feel safe. Mystic is probably the only place to go, and the area is more family-friendly than college-friendly. There are a few good coffee places, and the view of the Sound is nice, but I don't think any Conn Coll students spend an exorbitant amount of time in NewLo."
College Junior,1,"They have really crippled the social life over the last couple of years. They are very strict about drinking and may suspend you from the school for multiple drinking violations. They will also force you out of your housing for 2 drinking violations if you are living in an apartment with friends and move you into a single. They have implemented a rule recently where you must pay a 200 dollar fine for having more then 10 people in any room at any time in any private room on campus, preventing parties from happening. There is also a ban on kegs."
College Junior,1,Terrible social scene. This is a school if you want to most of your time studying and not partying. Parties sometimes happen but when they do the school will go out of their way to break them up and get everyone in trouble involved.
College Junior,1,"The school does not allow off campus housing. This provides a restricted social scene where RA's baby you all four years in dorms and treat you like a child. The RA's will go out of their way to make sure you are not drinking or being too loud and if you are will make sure to report you to a dean. This is the case with the independent living houses as well. These are apartments across the street from the college that the school touts as ""independent living"" however RA's still frequently check up on you."
College Sophomore,1,The social scene is absolutely atrocious. Some good professors and some bad. Non science and math courses are a joke.
College Sophomore,1,"People go out and want to live the typical college experience that they hear about, but it gets old really fast.  The school lacks activities for students and doesn't provide much entertainment.  In regards to concerts throughout the year, the schools brings in mediocre DJs and proceeds to charge students the price it would be to see top of the line performances.  Going out gets old really fast and the social scene is predictable.  Expect to see the same faces every time you go out."
College Sophomore,1,"The school has division III athletics and a large proportion of students participate in varsity sports.  Since there are so many people playing sports, no one attends other peoples sports other than one hockey game.  There isn't much school spirit and support for the athletes.  Go Camels?"
College Sophomore,1,"The facilities at this place are terrible. Dorms are old, athletic center is tiny, and student buildings are basically old school classrooms"
College Sophomore,1,"Girls here aren't anything to write home about. Very homogenous, white prep school girls. Most of them think they are much hotter than they are."
College Sophomore,1,"The buffet food gets old pretty quick, and there is only one dining hall open on the weekends. You also cannot elect not to be on the schools dining plan."
College Sophomore,1,Parking is expensive are the space is very limited. Officers love to ticket and harass students
College Sophomore,1,"The off campus dinging here consists mostly of Mcdonalds, subway, and a few other random restaurants in New London that are ok. After midnight, there is nowhere to get food, and none of the restaurants provide any student discount or anything like that."
College Sophomore,1,"The health center at this place is miserable. They treat you as if it is a chore for them to do their job. I had one incident where the health center misdiagnosed me and prescribed me a medicine that ended up giving me a red splotchy rash on my entire body for weeks! When I consulted the health center about it, no one would take any responsibility for anything. One of the worst parts about Conn College."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus provided transportation consists of one van that goes to Wal-mart and a few other places. Taxis are available, but they are really expensive. To be honest, you don't really need transportation here because there is no where to go. I like having a car just to get off of campus when I start feeling claustrophobic, but there really aren't many places to go other than a few decent restaurants."
College Sophomore,1,"I have been generally unhappy with most aspects of this school. Because the school is in such financial disarray, there are many instances of the administration taking directly away from student life and facilities. I have also had numerous problems dealing with the Deans here, who are extremely difficult to deal with and usually bounce you around until you get tired of speaking to people about whatever problem you have. My horrible experience here has lead me to transfer for next fall. DO NOT COME HERE."
College Sophomore,1,"The party scene at Connecticut is frankly miserable. The parties consist of going to the same 2 locations almost every weekend with the same exact people, and it gets extremely tiring. Because very few people live off campus, there is very little variety for partying, and even the parties on campus are generally boring and get broken up before midnight most of the time."

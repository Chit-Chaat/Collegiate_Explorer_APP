Niche User,5,I have not taken  an online course at seattle University and I plan to one day when I attend there one day.
Niche User,5,what I liked about seattle University is that the place where it is located is so nice and One day I'd like to go there.
Junior,5,Online learning is tough but my professors are doing their best to make the most out of it. They are willing to put in extra hours outside of class because they want us to do well. They provide us with lots of resources to aid our learning as well.
Junior,5,"I had spring quarter of my Sophomore year all online and I honestly loved it. All my professors were cognizant and understanding of the new learning environment and facilitated multiple resources and support systems to help us smoothly adjust to our new setting just as they were. I also utilize office hours a lot and having office hours over the computer was easier than I thought because I didn't have to walk across campus for a 30 minute meeting. It was more convenient and accessible! Overall, I almost prefer online learning over in person because I think it forces me to manage my time and take responsibility over my own learning!"
Freshman,5,I'm a new freshman at SU. So far there has been so much to try and get freshman involved in the SU community which I really appreciate. They have been doing so much for orientation and want class of 2024 to feel welcome.
Freshman,5,So far it has been good. All the teachers care about us and are constantly communicating about class. I think they are nervous but they are doing their best.
Senior,5,"Seattle University offers a great support for all its students.
It is diverse and they have different ways in which you can get involved.
Very nice library with lots of technology available and their tech specialists can help you improve the usage of your own devices."
Senior,5,"They use zoom and it works well. 
The teachers are helpful and they can help you navigate through your learning if needed."
Senior,5,"The professors have adapted fairly well, making online lectures still engaging. Although the workload may increase in some cases."
Sophomore,5,I liked the size of the university as it was able to allow us to connect to the professors more closely and have better connections to the staff. Being in the green weather is also very relaxing.
Freshman,5,An amazing school with amazing opportunities.  I love the academic potential here but the school really is what you make of it.  At the heart of Seattle it's great for city goers but also has very small class sizes which makes learning more personal.
Freshman,5,I love Seattle University for everything that is offered! I hope that anyone looking to enter next year will seriously consider this school.
Freshman,5,I loved the campus when I went for a tour and other events. My tour guide was one of the kindest people I have ever met and the campus is super beautiful. I would not change much about it.
Freshman,5,"So far my experience at Seattle University has been very positive. The students and professors are diverse, as well as extremely kind. It has been great meeting new people from across the country and out of the country. The academics have not been too challenging but that varies from person to person and depending on which courses one chooses. Despite not having a party scene, there are still a wide variety of social activities on and off campus, especially being located in between the international district and capitol hill. Even though the baseline cost is expensive, after merit aid the price gets a lot closer to in state public university tuitions and there are plenty of work study opportunities for those who need it. I highly recommend SU if you are looking for a small school with small class sizes and a liberal student population. There is also a lot of work being put into the school and new buildings for STEM and new dining options. Love being a redhawk!"
Freshman,5,"Awesome school! Although I don't attend this school just yet I know how truly amazing it is. From the small tour I went on the school made everybody feel included and excited! The dorms were well sized, the professors seemed very knowledgeable, and the location made me feel safe."
Niche User,5,"I haven't actually attended Seattle University yet. However, I have heard a lot of good things about Seattle University. Based on what my counselor had told me, she likes the overall area as well as the location of the school. She had recommended this school as one that I should look at since I was looking for a school that would be convenient for me."
Niche User,5,"is a nice school, because it provides many educational program that helped with my career; the campus is big and the school is diverse; i met lot of new friends; i become more outgoing while getting along with my friends, and felt more involved in school."
Junior,5,"The location of Seattle University is near Broadway, on Capital Hill. It's a great neighborhood (also home to Seattle Central College), and the campus is a nice place that is very welcoming in appearance and atmosphere. I would recommend this university to anyone interested in attending."
Graduate Student,5,Admission process was easy and self explanatory. Staffs at admission office were helpful giving guidance.
Niche User,5,"great campus, great location. People around that area are very friendly and social. Being in that area also feels very welcoming."
Niche User,5,"Seattle University truly provides an excellent Jesuit education dedicated to educating the whole person, to professional formation, and to empowering leaders for a just and humane world. That alone tells you a lot about the university. It is a very  diverse & inclusive campus. The classes are small in size and you almost always get the classes you need. Faculty & Staff alike are highly educated and each one cares for each & every individual. The students are driven  and when they graduate, they truly go forth & set the world on fire contributing to a better society."
Sophomore,5,I have had an excellent experience at Seattle University. The professors are very helpful and the small class size ensures that you have the ability to get the help you need. Also there are many opportunities for furthering your knowledge and experience in your potential future career. Campus is beautiful especially in the spring and Capitol Hill area is a wonderful place to explore.
Niche User,5,"Great staff and friendly students! Walking on campus is relaxing and easy to navigate. Along with the campus, the students are all very friendly and helpful."
Graduate Student,5,"Seattle University has a beautiful campus, right in the middle of downtown Seattle. Sullivan Hall has a fantastic environment for collaborative study, and inclusive practice."
Graduate Student,5,"Great location, lots of internship and job fairs opportunities, smaller classrooms, friendly and always there professors"
Junior,5,I love the location of Seattle U. It is very expensive though. I hope they can start offering more scholarships.
Freshman,5,"Coming from Hawaii and moving to Seattle to go to SU was a very big change but it has all gone well. Seattle University has an absolutely beautiful campus, especially in the fall when all of the trees change colors. The food in the cafeteria in Seattle University is very good and changes every single meal of every single day. I love it here. The people are very nice and really want to help you. The professors here at the school truly care about the students. They show up to athletic events, they go out of their way to help students in their subject, they are always there for students to just have a conversation with. It is amazing. I recommend Seattle University 100%"
Alum,5,Great school in downtown Seattle with small class sizes yields a great education with hands-on learning in all majors.
Sophomore,5,"Like all institutions there are flaws, but the overall experience far outweighs the flaws.The experience is what the student makes it. There are plenty of activities and clubs to get involved with and the food and housing are good. There are fun annual events to really get students connected to the school. Diversity isn't as strong as it could be but the school is actively working to change that. Academically, the course work is as challenging as you let it be. If you engage with it and go beyond the classroom, many more doors will be opened."
Senior,5,"I transferred to the Business school here my Sophomore year after attending the University of Oregon. I LOVE my experience here thus far (senior in the fall). SU has provided me with so many opportunities; a social media job within the business school, networking and mock interview opportunities, job fairs (how I landed my first internship). SU is in an awesome location in Seattle. I love the connections I make with professors and as a transfer I had no problem with making friends here. I highly recommend SU to everyone."
Junior,5,"I love Seattle University, I was scared when I first went but everyone was welcoming and now that I've been there for 2 years, I'm glad I chose it."
Freshman,5,I  like that Seattle University strives to educate the whole person and puts an emphasis on inclusion and the acceptance of all.
Niche User,5,When going to Seattle University I liked the way the community was small. It was not too big. Knowing for me and my short legs it is very needed for a small campus. When I visited for the tour and it got started I could see myself going to that college. What may could may change is maybe everything is all in the same side of the street. That could make me feel just a little safer. The food was just excellent. I have not tasted something so amazing in my entire life. Knowing about the community and learning new things around your community was even greater. Just a small tour really helped me make a big decision in my life.
Junior,5,"Attending Seattle University has given me so many opportunities to grow and learn in an active city. As an artist, SeattleU's location is perfect for getting involved in the local art scene, including attending figure drawing classes across the street at Studio Paradiso, going to the monthly Capital Hill Art Walk, and much more. I would recommend this university for students looking for: more than just a college town experience, a more intimate classroom setting with small class sizes, connections to pursue a career in Seattle, or a jumping off point to explore new subjects with the diverse UCOR general education credit courses."
Freshman,5,"Seattle University is an outstanding college, holding a high reputation in Washington.  Featuring passionate professors, knowledgeable staff, and connected student body, everyone acknowledges college struggles and support each other to reach success.  Given the near majority of students are majoring in business or some form of communication, I find them to be quite more open than cut throat colleges specializing in STEM majors.  This college is great for getting a solid foundation for college success.  If you need a reputable school that will support you to ensure you are on track toward graduating in four years, Seattle University is the college for you.

My only gripe with the school is the cost ($61,000 total), though it is justified given it is a private school."
Junior,5,"The atmosphere is busy but nice, the class sizes are just right to provide the students a closer learning experience with the proffesor. The school is also very connected to multitudes of businesses allowing you to have a surefire way at an internship or job after graduation."
Freshman,5,i like the people who attend the university and i also like the location (Capitol Hill) and it's near downtown seattle. There is a lot to do around the area which is great.
Junior,5,"Overall, my experience at Seattle University has been amazing so far. The atmosphere and people in the environment make it a welcoming, fun place to learn. The class sizes are small and make it easy to get to know your professors. This makes it easy to ask questions."
Freshman,5,"I am the first of my family to attend a 4-year institution and Seattle University has exceeded my expectations. There is such a variety of classes, clubs and programs to join, and the professors are extremely knowledgeable on their respective subjects. We also have an on campus chapel, which is great because I am a practicing Catholic and I am easily able to pursue my faith along with my education."
Junior,5,"I love it. My college is the College of Science and Engineering. Just like everyone that transfers from a community college, I wanted to get into UW. But I am glad that I did not since Seattle University has been great thus far. Just started my second quarter and I already feel at home. Have met a lot of people, and everyone has been so cool. Small classes and one-to-one with your professors. Seattle U is definitely great!"
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Seattle University. It is an amazing college with great professors, classes, people, and opportunities. I will always be proud to say I went to this college and I will always be grateful for the friends and connections with teachers I have made here."
Senior,5,"The professors in the business school are absolutely amazing. The school has small class sizes, rigorous programs, and a great reputation in the Seattle area. Their strong alumni base makes the transition from school to a full-time job almost seamless."
Junior,5,Being  a transfer student I came into Seattle hoping that I would have no difficulties. Seattle University was one of the most open and understanding colleges I have ever visited and helped my transition be that much easier than expected. Having so many clubs as well as resource groups only made my transition easier because the university personally provides the students with resources they might need to come into contact with while attending the university. The diversity of the campus is greatly appreciated since there are many colleges who focus on one set of nationality while this campus focuses on growth and learning in which they set aside cultural differences. It is an amazing college to attend as well as an eye opener to the real world.
Alum,5,"Seattle University is what you make of it. There are a ton of student activities to get involved with and a strong sense of community within the groups of students involved in those activities. However, many students choose not to partake in these activities, which can make it feel as though there are two different populations of students at the school. For those who take advantage of the wealth of opportunities at SU, it can be a wonderful experience. I loved my four years at Seattle University and the urban environment surrounding the school. It is a vibrant community filled with passionate students. "
Junior,5,I love this Seattle University. The professors in the business school are excellent as they're all very willing to help their students. The location of campus is nice because it's right in the heart of Seattle so there's always something to do (walking to downtown Seattle is one of my favorite things to do). Public Safety is always visible around campus which is nice because it makes me feel safer. 
Freshman,5,"Seattle University provides an outstanding community and support system for each and every student. The faculty place all students as a high priority, in order to provide students with the best experience possible. Seattle University focuses on the mind, body, and soul of the student not just the academics, in order for each student to achieve any goal they wish to. Seattle University allows each student to create a path unique to them on and out of campus in the local community. "
College Sophomore,5,I love the small class sizes and the fact that professor areally super accommodating and helpful
College Sophomore,5,I love the connections and networking opportunities my school provides. I also love how helpfull they are when looking for jobs.
College Sophomore,5,I'm never scared or uncomfortable on campus
College Sophomore,5,"The people at the school are kind and helpful, it is better than the experience I had hoped for"
College Junior,5,"Professors in the College of Science and Engineering are generally fantastic. They are approachable and willing to help with just about anything. The standard curriculum is usually very well-taught, and there are good departmental elective offerings, depending on your major. The registration process is fine; if a class you really need is full by your registration time, there are usually some reserved spots that you can go for if you get to the registration office in a timely manner. You will be assigned a registration time based on your class standing and number of credits completed. 

Some majors have very easy workloads; my workload for physics and math classes has been very challenging, but necessarily so. If you have reasonably good time management skills you will get through it, even if it feels like a sprint to the finish line towards the end of the quarter.

Popular study areas are psychology, biology, business, and nursing. I have heard that the workload in these majors is reasonably challenging but not extreme."
College Junior,5,The physics and math departments are amazing at this school. The largest classes I have ever had have been math classes with just under 40 students. My major classes in the physics department have 6-7 people in them. The professors are almost all top-notch. They almost all offer undergraduate research opportunities and really want everyone to succeed. Classes are graded fairly but very challenging in these departments.
College Junior,5,"As far as I know, everyone in the physics department who applies to grad school has gotten into a program of some sort, and people get amazing internships if they apply for them. I know nothing about the career center/services on campus, but the advisors in the science/engineering departments seem to be extremely helpful in getting students into internships, grad school, and jobs."
College Student,5,Its fun and exciting to live on campus because you are always surrounded by peers. I feel its better to live on campus because it gives you more of a college experience and the late night shenanigans are always super fun!
College Student,5,"Because I plan to attend and play on the volleyball team, the athletics are great. hopefully I get to be on the team and become a great part of a great season. The athletic department is very kind and eye opening and totally different from high school performance. With a greater fan support and school spirit, it's ten times more exciting then anything I've ever seen or experienced."
College Junior,5,SU is friendly school. The thing I like most here is that the professor and the advisors are always ready to help you.
College Freshman,5,We constantly have security roaming around the campus. It is very easy to find security on campus and they are very nice people that take their job seriously. When there is a problem or even a potential problem security is there to see the situation. I feel extremely safe on campus.
College Freshman,5,"We have several teams geared strictly for sexual assault prevention along with the availability of several resources in case you are sexually assaulted and need help. Campus security is also great with any issues and always around in case of an emergency. Despite living in the middle of the city, I have never felt unsafe on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"Seattle University is the perfect size, and my department in particular is an amazing academic community. I've learned a ton and have already had many amazing opportunities to do great things in my major. The school has great resources if you actually use them, and I'd definitely choose SU if I could do it all over again."
College Sophomore,5,Seattle University offers a diverse campus. The SU women's crew team had given me a new family and made me feel welcomed. Being in an urban setting gives me multiple opportunities. I am able to experience much more than just classes. I have built so many great connections and friendships. I definitely made the right choice by coming to Seattle University.
Junior,4,The transition from community college to 4 year university was smooth. Advisors and professors are always there to help and give insight.
Junior,4,"I'm entering my third year as a Computer Science major and as far as academics go, I really love SU because all my professors have been extremely accomodating and patient; their small class sizes really help focus my learning too. The campus is refreshing and easy to navigate and for the most part, it's easy to reach out to people because everyone is fairly understanding. There is plenty of diversity, club and social activities, and resources that additionally contribute to your own success. I really like it here because of all the academic support and resources, not so much for the social scene. I think it's a great place to take control of your own learning!"
Senior,4,The small class sizes allow me to connect with all my faculty. Faculty really cares about the future of their students and will do anything in their power to help. The education and network you get from attending SU is also great for getting your foot in the door in regards to your career.
Senior,4,The professors make online experience as similar to on campus classes. They do their best and all materials are taught well.
Junior,4,"So far my experience has been great. We live in strange times and as a transfer student from a community, college to a 4-year is nerve-wracking. There's so much information online about orientation, curriculum, and on-campus activities but it's hard to get an idea of the school online. For now, we are all in this learning together and getting through this pandemic as the best way we can. I look forward to physically being on campus."
Junior,4,Classes online can be hard especially in the summer because they are more compact in a very short amount of time than a regular quarter. There is a lot of classwork to do on your own. Have to be very commited.
Sophomore,4,"They were great as teachers let you take the classes asynchronously so I could work part-time as well. However, I never met any of my teachers in person which might end up hurting my chances for a letter of recommendation for the future."
Senior,4,"Great academics but very little school pride. Situated on Capitol Hill in Seattle, there's plenty of stuff to do outside of class."
Junior,4,"Overall, I have enjoyed the small school feel of Seattle University as well as the many wonderful professors. The only thing I would really like to have change is the return to a no-leash policy for the dog park on campus."
Junior,4,"Seattle University is a great school for people who want a smaller community. One of the reasons why I chose SU was the class sizes; the largest class size is around 40 students so, you get to know each other well and connect with your professors as well. The campus may not have Greek life but that doesn’t take away from the fact that you’re in the middle of the city. You’re also in Seattle which is filled with opportunities and SU will provide you with different networking events to form connections to better your future."
Freshman,4,"Overall, the school is pretty good. There are some things I would like to see improvements on though."
Freshman,4,I love how it is in the heart of Seattle. Being in the heart of a city makes me feel connected to a community beyond just the university. I also. really appreciate how much the professors care about their students.
Sophomore,4,"I love how small the school is, it gives you opportunities such as having close relationships to professors and TA's and close relationships to other students in your major (especially if its very niche). However, I would really recommend looking into if the quarter system is right for you. Upside is that your classes will only be a 3 month commitment, but the content is extremely fast and you will have much more finals and midterms than most college students."
Alum,4,"It can be a bit intense, and it's certainly not a research uni, but the teachers are generally dedicated and thorough, the class sizes are small, there is a clear and pervasive, morally driven mission (and has been for decades), and it is situated in a very beautiful urban campus. They also have excellent scholarship opportunities."
Sophomore,4,Very good academics good classes and people but some classes are useless like the UCORS. Parties are bad and boring with not a lot of people. Campus is small easy to walk and with beautiful views. Athletics are really good and athletes are very friendly and humble. The area is downtown Seattle so you can walk around and watch a lot of cool things just five minutes away from campus. Students can be very friendly and sometimes very quite. In general it’s a really nice place and a good school to go but yes they are missing some of the college experience everyone talk about.
Junior,4,"I've had a great experience so far, plenty of clubs and activities to participate in and every faculty member has been humbly kind and helpful to me"
Freshman,4,"The teachers are great! small class size (the most is 30 people), classes have flexible times, and some of the teachers have convenient office hours. The one downside is that this school is a private school, and so has a noticeably higher tuition rate than others in the state. Overall, it is a great school!"
Sophomore,4,Good School. Good Location. Nice People. They don't push religion onto you like other private schools. Very expensive tuition.
Sophomore,4,I like the small class sizes and the people. I just wish campus was a little bigger and the dorms were more modern as well.
Junior,4,"I've always been very into Computer Science and Engineering and Seattle is a world hot spot for that sector. It offers a fantastic academic environment and a beautiful, localized campus in the perfect location within the city.  However student life is not as active and close knit as I would have hoped for. The professors are knowledgable and well connected. The workload is a fair degree of difficulty. Campus is pretty safe and accessible, and the neighborhood that surrounds us is great save the high cost of living when moving off campus.  I can't imagine going anywhere else!"
Sophomore,4,What i like about Seattle University is that it is a small campus and you have the ability to get to know your classmates as well as your professors.
Sophomore,4,"Very small class size, professors know you by name. Dorm life is good and neat, the food is mediocre at best. A clean campus in the middle of Seattle, close to everything."
Sophomore,4,"Seattle U is great for STEM majors, with the addition of a new Science building, there will be newer labs available for student use. Science professors expect that you work hard but will always be there to help you out!"
Sophomore,4,"Coming to Seattle was a big change for me. Everything was so different, from the scenery to the weather to the city itself. This makes sense seeing that I am two states away from home. However Seattle University helped making the transition from high school to college very smooth. There are only smaller things that it only a 4/5 stars. Overall, my experience at Seattle University has been more so positive."
Junior,4,It has been a good experience and there are many resources available to students however there are many lacking as well
Freshman,4,The location is great and the weather is nice if you like the rain. The people are nice and it is easy to be yourself. Being close to the city is also nice to go out during the weekend.
Freshman,4,I love the open and relevant feeling of living in a city as special as Seattle. There are places and people everywhere who all have a different story. The school is open to all and knows they are a very accepting place for all students to feel comfortable.
Niche User,4,"Seattle University was an excellent school to grow and learn in, a great community, and in a fun part of town. I did feel as though I didn’t end up with very actionable career skills though, so that’s an improvement that could be made."
Junior,4,"I love my program (nursing). There are small class sizes which allows you to know your professors and classmates. The school is over all small, but nestled within the beautiful city of seattle"
Senior,4,"Small campus conveniently located near restaurants and coffee shops.  Within easy reach of public transportation options.  My experience studying in Seattle University has been very positive.  There is a lot of cultural diversity here among the student body.   The professors have, in general, been very approachable and willing to help."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently enrolled in Seattle University and I enjoy the classes. The professors are usually engaged int the material they teach, which makes class more engaging. There is academic support which is great. Free tutoring, facilitated group study, learning specialists and supportive teachers. My favorite part of Seattle U is that were are in the middle of Capitol Hill so many people will walk their dogs through campus, allowing me to get some doggie snuggles."
Sophomore,4,"Seattle University is a great small private school hidden in the center of Seattle. SU has a diverse student population, great food, and an amazing surrounding neighborhood. There is a wide arrange of classes to try out and many great professors. Seattle itself has four very distinct seasons so you get a little taste of every season when you're there."
Junior,4,"Seattle University has a fantastic academic environment and a beautiful, localized campus in the perfect location within the city. However, it falls short when it comes to our expectations of support of student life and overall well-being. There are many programs in place intended to foster a community between students, but they are not very active and often don't do enough to really do what they are intended. Honestly, you get out what you put in with the social aspects of going here, but that's true for many universities. The professors are knowledgable (a bit pretentious at times) and the workload is a fair degree of difficulty. Campus is pretty safe and accessible, and the neighborhood that surrounds us is great save the high cost of living when moving off campus. While there are many things I'm not the biggest fan of about SU, I can't imagine going anywhere else!"
Freshman,4,"I've only had a year at Seattle U, but overall it's been great! Classes are generally good, and it's clear that most of the professors here genuinely care about their students, and all of them are passionate about what they teach. My classes have been challenging and definitely require time and effort, but not so much that they overwhelm me. 
There are lots of things to do in the area, but a lot of them are pretty expensive. Off-campus housing is hard to find, and rent can be over $1000 a month for a tiny studio (which is true all over Seattle, not just around SU). On-campus housing is good, but your amount of floor and storage space really varies depending on which building you live in."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman at Seattle University, I have had a great experience. The academics and professors are excellent and the university does a great job involving students."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the experiences I've had and lessons I've learned here but I wish there was more focus on the arts. It is such an art heavy city and our department and performance center are barely highlighted.
Senior,4,Seattle university has been a great nursing program. The staff are helpful and accessible. Something I would change is when you are transferring in you still have to take the universities “UCORs” in order to graduate from SU. It would be helpful if they were online because the classes usually interfere with your nursing schedule.
Freshman,4,"Seattle University is in the heart of downtown, you would think it gets crowded and too busy however its the complete opposite. When you walk around campus you can feel how warm and accepting the atmosphere is. Seattle University is one of the most diverse colleges I've ever toured and to top it all off everyone is extremely open-minded. How would you feel about being in a class where your professor knows your name and cares about your academic success? At Seattle U, you aren't just a number, YOU matter."
Sophomore,4,"It's a very small school and you receive a lot of attention. There is always some to help you and focus on what you need. It can be scary starting college, but the school makes a huge effort to make sure there is something to help every succeed. It is a very difficult school, you need to be prepared to do your work. It's a beautiful campus and there is so much to do on and off campus, it will be easy to connect with like-mined students."
Graduate Student,4,"As a masters student in the Arts Leadership program, I have greatly enjoyed studying at Seattle University. It is a new, growing, innovative program that has some growing pains but it seems like they work through a few more every year. Their mission and values are in line with my own."
Niche User,4,"I have been accepted to this school, and after touring it 2 times, I am slightly conflicted on it. While many people say that the school is full of hipsters and stuck up snobs, I have only gotten the vibe that it is slightly sleepy."
Graduate Student,4,"It's great! Small classes, great curriculum. Some things can be improved! Been going here nearly 8 years."
Senior,4,"I have grown and come into my own in ways I never would have expected by coming to Seattle University. In my time here, I've encountered professors who have been essential to my growth as a person and who have expanded my view of the world around me immensely. The school administration itself has some issues with not being diverse and not truly fulfilling its mission of ""inclusive excellence,"" but there are so many staff and students who are working with one another to build a better environment on campus, to create an environment where anyone can learn and thrive. The expense that comes with this school is steep, but I've found that with the help of loans and scholarships, I am better able to appreciate what I am getting for that price."
Sophomore,4,I am about to start my sophomore year at SU and I could not be more excited. Seattle U is a diverse and exciting school to be at. Class sizes are small so you get more interaction with your professors and gain relationships/friendships too.
Niche User,4,"Loved the school, hated the whether. The nature scene outside the city is great if you have transportation."
Freshman,4,"Could provide better resources for class registration housing, and meal plan options. Otherwise, has dedicated professors and class sizes benefit leanring expreince"
Junior,4,"My experience is unique.  I am a student athlete, so I have missed out on things other students get to do.  I have really enjoyed the small class sizes and feel like I have gotten a ton out of my classes and professors. I definitely have personal relationships with some of them and it has definitely benefited my education. Also, the city makes the school; I love being in Seattle and it is a great place to be.  I do feel like though because it is small school it lacks in two things: school spirit like at sports games, and resources to provide clubs and community for students."
Sophomore,4,"Academically, not extremely rigorous; however, very experiential and personalized learning. I have been able to meet with many top business executives, and drastically increase my network. Party scene is pretty meek. Athletics are ok. Lots of clubs to choose from. Quite a diverse group."
Senior,4,Great school academically. The quality of the school/teaching is not worth the money. If it wasn't for how rare my program is (ultrasound) I would not have chosen this school. And if I could do it over I would choose a different school. The price of tuition is outrageous and they don't give very much financial aid out.
Junior,4,"I absolutely love Seattle University! It has become the stage for so much growth in my life. It is a beautiful campus, loving community, and excellent education. After starting my education at SU, I have become a much more socially and politically aware person and student. It is a smaller school though, so be prepared to know most people on campus if you are a social person. Lastly, I love that there is no Greek life on campus."
Senior,4,"Seattle University is a good school. It's a good size in a good location and it's easy to make friends if you put in the effort. As you get into your major you get closer with your fellow major classmates and it's really nice to have that kind of support towards the end of your time here. There's also a lot of opportunity to volunteer and build your resume, and lots of events that help enrich you and expand your world view. The only major downsides I can see are, of course, the tuition. But there is financial aid and scholarships and loans if you need them. If you're a commuter student, parking is expensive. The food is great but also expensive. But debt is something you can find at any university, so.  "
Freshman,4,"I would like a one time sign up for every survey that way I don't have to sign up for 40 websites to do 10 surveys, and also I'd rather it be giving me free money instead of sweepstakes."
College Sophomore,4,All the building are clean and fun to live in
College Sophomore,4,They have a great faculty and good programs but it's not my thing
College Sophomore,4,"At least for my major, they send out job and internship opportunities whenever they get them so it is easy to find them. Career Services and the redhawk network are also super helpful and pretty easy to navigate once you get the hang of it."
College Sophomore,4,"We are a smaller school so variety is a bit limited, but we do the best for what we have which is pretty good. I have been fairly impressed with quality of classes and professors, I think I have only disliked one or two professors and loved way more than that. I like how small classes are which allows for students to be more involved and heard."
College Sophomore,4,I've never felt particularly threatened and often walk alone on campus. Public Safety is pretty is easy to find and we have call boxes all around campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I personally loved it and made friends with almost everyone on my floor. Most of my my closest friends came from the dorms. We have nice amenities in each room (fridge, microwave, sink, cork board) and there is a pretty decent kitchen in each lounge. Campus is small so all the dorms are convenient."
College Sophomore,4,"I have really enjoyed my school. Even though I am still in basic classes, they keep you engaged. Everyone is super friendly and for the most part, anyone will talk to you. There are also lots of options to get involved."
Recent Alumnus,4,Their gym is well maintained and it seems pretty up to date.
Sophomore,2,I am a current student at Seattle University and I personally haven't enjoyed my experience here. I don't feel like I belong at this school as I don't identify as LGBTQ+ and I am not Caucasian. There is a lack of diversity as the school is predominately Caucasian and LGBTQ+ with not a lot of room for any other identities and there isn't support for the people who don't fit into these groups. The academics are too easy as grades are inflated and I have gotten an A in a class when I deserved a C or I received a C when I actually learned a lot in the class. The dorm food isn't good as there are limited options and the prices for the dorm food are highly inflated. Students have to purchase a $1600 a quarter meal plan as freshmen and sophomores as well. YOU ALSO CAN'T TRANSFER AS THE COMMON CORE CLASSES AREN'T TRANSFERABLE TO OTHER COLLEGES. I didn't have a great experience here and ended up not going back after my sophomore year.
Sophomore,2,The online experience has led me to slack off as i do not think i am getting the return on investment that i would be as if i were on campus. There is no connection to the professors and my learning has been impeded. I feel like a number on a screen when in class.
Sophomore,2,"It definitely has room for improvement. The professors that I have had have been super great, but I've heard differently from a lot of other students. There is also a very weak sense of community and school spirit. If you will be breaking the bank to go here, I would definitely think about your other options because it is not worth the hassle."
Freshman,2,"Cons: 
-Bad reputation
-There seems to be a severe lack of intelligent students.
-The food is unpleasing as of the 2018-19 academic year because we downgraded to a substantially worse food provider. 
-The party scene isn't great. There are no frats. The parties are either just amongst your friends or the whole school knows about it and it is at one of three places.
-The housing is particularly bad, because of the school's inflated acceptance rate, the school seems over-enrolled. Many people ended up in triples when they requested doubles. This wouldn't be a problem if the rooms for triples were bigger, but they're the same size as doubles. The housing coordinator is apathetic to this situation.
-It’s an echo chamber.

Pros:
-There are some good professors and classes are easy. Class size is also great.
-You're in a really cool part of Seattle. Capitol Hill is awesome, there is lots of stuff to do. The music scene is particularly good.
-Sort of racially diverse."
Freshman,2,"I've only been at Seattle U for two quarters but am just not liking it. Kids get cliquey right after welcome week, and the clubs don't cover a wide range of interests. All anybody seems to care about is social justice and tying progressivism into every aspect of education, which I just don't care too much for. Academics are good, professors are available, students just aren't very intuitive. It's just not the greatest school for its cost."
College Sophomore,2,I dont like Greek life
College Junior,2,"No one cares about sports at all, which is a shame; I went to one basketball game and it was very high-budget and I had a lot of fun, but there were only a handful of students in attendance and it would have been a lot more fun if more people had shown up. There is zero school spirit. The gym is really state-of-the-art, but the general dynamic of the students who usually go there makes it so that I hate going there (macho lifting guys and girls in little lululemon suits who always need to run faster and look cuter than the people next to them)"
College Student,2,"This school claims to be a liberal arts school but I have yet to see that reflected in the curriculum. I am undeclared and do not feel my advisor has supported me in taking the classes I want. The General Ed classes (UCORE) are a waste of my money because no one, not even the professors seem interested in the subject. I have had probably two classes I actually enjoy. The students are exclusive. If you do not make friends during welcome week dont expect to make any later on in the year. Theres not very many majors offered. Most kids I have talked to are unhappy and considering transferring. If you're looking for a small liberal arts school thats rigorous do not come here. Easy to get a good grade in a class and not even try."
College Senior,2,"School housing is extremely limited and tiny. The buildings are old, the floors are creaky, the walls are paper-thin, and the rooms are pathetically small. Also, the resident assistants are very ineffective at controlling noise within the dorms and other residences so that it is constantly loud and music is always booming beyond reasonable volumes. Pets are very restricted; one can only have a fish, not even a reptile or other quiet, safe, caged animal. The social atmosphere is not particularly inviting and is overall cliquey. Overall, I've been extremely disappointed with the housing."
College Freshman,2,The prices don't quite compare and I didn't find any striking deals.
College Freshman,2,"If you don't know the right people, you may never hear of these parties."
College Sophomore,2,"It all depends on your RA and which RA is on duty, some will let you off with warnings some will write you up immediately."
College Junior,2,"Off campus housing is pretty unaffordable, rent is skyrocketing and parking is hard to find."
College Sophomore,2,UW has better parties tbh
College Junior,2,"Seattle is a very expensive city, and rent is rising quickly. Apartments near the school are very small and expensive. If you go further away for a more affordable choice, the traffic can make getting to school take a long time."
College Senior,2,"The workload is intense but with any program you are expected to work incredibly hard in. The downside of my program is that there are a scant amount of internships, work study, or job opportunities available with the school. The students are expected to create their own opportunities which they train each of us to some degree in with several entrepreneurship classes and projects. I have acquired some knowledge of several different routes to take coming out of undergrad with this program. Additionally, the program is incredibly small in terms of student interaction within the major. Our graduation class for my senior year is expected to be 2 or 3 student in the B.A. I am pursuing. The facilities available are great for non-music majors planning to spend time in other areas of campus, but our music building and performance spaces are not great acoustically. We have a lecture hall, chapel, and library to perform in. There is also low incentive for students to be motived and for continually growth since everyone is on the same level with not much variety or experience in general."
College Junior,2,"There's a saying about the ratio from girls to guys; there is 60% girls, 40% guys and 50% of those guys are gay."
College Freshman,2,Good luck finding a spot.
College Freshman,2,"It rains all the time, and it's rather depressing."
College Freshman,2,"Other than in sexual orientation, there is no diversity."
College Freshman,2,"No big parties and small parties are crowded, cramped and a lot of binge drinking goes on."
College Sophomore,2,There are not many parking options. There are a few lots near campus but they are expensive and fill up.
College Freshman,2,"Public safety officers are more interested in enforcing drug and alcohol policies than keeping the student body safe. There have been multiple crimes committed near campus (a couple were even on campus), which the public safety was not able to stop due to their lack of visibility on campus. Instead, they spend all their time sniffing dorm rooms."
College Freshman,2,"Seattle=rain.  Winter Quarter is a struggle to get through without getting a little bit of SAD (aka winter depression).  Come prepared with a ""happy lamp"" and you're vitamin D pills. Get ready for rain too, rain gear, rain gear, rain gear! When the sun comes out, the campus is flooded with students.  You won't ever take a sunny day for granted."
College Freshman,2,"The winters are dreary and cold. It gets lonely without a visible sun in the sky. Other than that, Seattle can have beautiful weather."
College Sophomore,2,"It is Seattle so it does rain often but you only get big rains every once and a while its more just overcast a lot from november to march. Those crisp fall, winter, and spring days are totally worth it though they are beautiful and we have so many amazing ways to get in touch with nature that it doesn't matter that its cloudy a lot. Summers here are also amazing I wouldn't live anywhere else during the summer time."
College Senior,2,"Its Washington, so there's a lot of rain, so if you like rain then this is the place for you."
College Senior,2,We are in the wrong division for the size of our school and so we don't win very often even though we have a good team. A lot of the school funding goes to the sports teams so they have very nice equipment.
College Junior,2,"There isn't much diversity. The majority of people are into sports, and it seems like a lot of the clubs aren't very large or active and their events aren't really worth going to."
College Senior,2,"Guys are hard to come by. A solid 50% are gay, 25% are taken, and the last 25% are either not interested in a relationship or are un-datable. This is not a great campus for dating. There are way too many good girls so you end up with really awesome girls dating guys that aren't up to par."
College Junior,2,"Parking permits are very expensive per quarter but this is Downtown Seattle so what do you expect. I'd advise coming early, before 7 am to find parking spaces. Overall I would recommend just parking at a transit center and then riding the bus here."
College Junior,2,"If having an awesome freshman year dorm experience key to your WHOLE college experience do not come to SU. the housing is overpriced, over protective and not even nice!! the RHA at Seattle University take managing the dorms very seriosuly making campion and bellermine feel like prison. if you are loud, you are questioned. if your room smells faintly like weed you will be searched and apy over a hundred dollars in fees ."
College Senior,2,"Recently, the administration has given all of their time and resources to promoting our division one sports that the students could not care less about."
College Freshman,2,The parking fee is expensive and it is hard to find a spot.
College Freshman,2,The night life isn't much to talk about. Most kids just go over to UW.
College Sophomore,2,"Very strict policies, with serious consequences. Just learn to be discreet and don't get caught."
College Junior,2,"if you like rain, you wont anymore after living here."
College Junior,2,"Sports at Seattle University are not very impressive, but the support is huge. there is no football team, and sport performance is mediocre."
College Junior,2,"Honestly, just don't do stupid things and you won't have to worry abut getting caught or dealing with public safety which can be a pain. Don't smoke pot in your room because you'll probably be caught. If you're underage and you're going to drink, don't be stupid about it because, again, you'll probably get caught. If you do get caught you'll get written up by an RA and have to attend a hearing via the Integrity Board. Get caught over and over again, say goodbye to the university. Also, there is a policy where, even if everyone in  the room is 21, but there's ONE person in it who isn't, even if they're not drinking, it's still technically an ""under 21"" room, and you'll get in trouble for it."
College Sophomore,2,"facilities (like the gym and the new turf field) are really up to date and nice as well as clean and all very accessible. also, there is no obvious social scene on campus"
College Junior,2,"Not Very Impressive. Professors are often rude, classes are useless and easy."
College Freshman,2,"High School Part Two – Being at Seattle University is sort of like being in high school, but much more difficult academically. Administration acts like your parents (or stricter than your parents in my case), and everything is just sort of mediocre. The school is also not very active. For how outdoorsy the city is, kids at SU are comically sheltered."
College Freshman,2,"Typical Inner City – The campus is in a not so good part of Seattle. Campus security is okay, but there's only so much you can do. Don't walk alone at night, and never have your phone out in the open. We get regular emails about crimes happening near campus. There's a crack house across from the main residence hall, and a near shootout once this year."
College Sophomore,2,"Hipsters and Homosexuals – At Seattle University, the guys there are mostly hipsters or homosexuals. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that besides the fact that there are less boys to choose from. Most of the boys left are either athletes or go to the law or business schools. The majority of the student population are girls and most of them are pretty friendly."
College Freshman,2,Sports Are Underrated – The basketball team is decent and the games are fun but hardly anybody goes. We are not a sporty school so the spirit is lacking.
College Freshman,2,"Partying at SU is not very common. It is more typical for a student not to drink than to drink here on weekends, which is different than most college campus'. But once you find the party niche you will start to figue out where most parties are. The off campus parties are very small house parties and get broken up early. You are likely to get written up by P-Safe for drinking in your room."
College Junior,2,"Who Cares? School attempting to gain NCAA status, but no one cares..although some club sports are well-liked.  Athletics are not a big part of campus activities. Soccer and basketball"
College Junior,2,"A lot of apts and houses for rent in neighborhood, but expensive. Close the public transport and campus. Limited availability, limited paid parking.  Safety issues esp at night"
College Freshman,2,No Space – There is basically no room in downtown Seattle for a car.  There is some street parking but it is hard to get a spot.  Most students don't have a car.
College Senior,2,Campus Police Do Their Best – They can come down a little hard on dorm parties but do a pretty good job at keeping the campus safe after dark even though some of the surrounding neighborhoods aren't the best.
College Freshman,2,"There but Not – there are the people that drink and smoke but its not a huge deal and there are A LOT of strict policies against it, which are enforced."
College Junior,2,"Process Is Needlessly Difficult – Dealing with the financial aid official is really annoying. Each student is assigned to a dedication financial aid officer, but getting an appointment with that person is nearly impossible. You have to go meet with a walk in counselor first, which could involve waiting a long time, and if they don't think they can help you they send an email to your officer. My officer would only communicate with me by email and it was hard to understand her emails when it came to complicated loan stuff. She never agreed to an in-person meeting, and a lot of mistakes were made with my loans. There aren't that many school-based scholarship options for grad students, and the handling of the applications and decisions was poor. There have been some staffing changes so at least the administrative side of things may improve in the future,"
College Junior,2,Happy Hunting – There is parking available but it can be a coin toss for getting it. Metered parking is expensive.
College Freshman,2,Good Luck! Most of the people here are female. Most of the men here are gay. Most of the parties are at U Dub. Go figures.
College Freshman,2,"Impossible secure an on campus job, not enough housing for students (efficiency triples, anyone?) leading to a complete lack of floor lounges, inadequate advising center, and a general lack of campus activities or even school pride. For the amount of money I pay to attend this school, the Facilities are simply not up to par."
College Sophomore,2,There Is Some – There is limited off campus housing and it is expensive
College Sophomore,2,"Not a whole lot of options for parking, its fairly expensive and not always guaranteed. If you can't find a spot, you have to parallel park (2 hr max) on the street. I ride the bus now."
College Senior,2,Finding a guy on campus is quite the tall order. You have a better chance branching out into the city or the University of Washington than finding one on campus. And if you do...he's probably gay.
College Sophomore,2,"There are buses, but they run irregularly and the fare is expensive.  There is a school van for late-night transport within a few blocks of campus.  Other than that...people just walk.  It should be noted that a limited trolley line will be installed on Broadway soon and ready for operation in 2013 or 2014"
College Sophomore,2,"Expensive Apartments – Since this is Seattle, housing is expensive! The apartments right next to campus are extremely expensive and would require living with four other people, for a total of five, to make it financially feasible. As you go further from campus, it doesn't get much better until you're out of Seattle."
College Senior,1,This school doesn't care about their faculty or students.
College Sophomore,1,Seattle University doesn't have fraternities or sororities.
College Freshman,1,We just don't have it. I don't actually mind though
College Freshman,1,we do not have a greek system
College Senior,1,The cost of parking is expensive but were in Seattle and there's never any parking.
College Freshman,1,"Ladies, do NOT come here expecting to find a guy! There is close to no dating scene on campus.  There's about 30% guys, with the rest being girls.  Most of the guys are gay or already taken.  Have not found anything even remotely close to dating on campus."
College Freshman,1,"***warning: if you enjoy the rain and gray, ignore this post.

Coming from Phoenix, Arizona, where it is almost always sunny, I thought that the Seattle weather would be a great change of pace. I was wrong. I was so wrong. It is always gray and raining here, and if you're lucky the city will get a few partly cloudy and sunny days. Other than that, the weather is always bad. However, it rarely gets extremely cold in Seattle, with average winter temperatures around 40 degrees. The summers here are actually quite enjoyable--too bad we're not here for summer."
College Freshman,1,"Every weekend there is around 1-2 house parties that are nearby. Unfortunately, to any party-goers dismay, they are not raging, often crowded, and get busted by the police early on in the night. In other words, if you have partying anywhere in your definition of college life, this is not your university."
College Junior,1,Way Too Expensive. Parking permits are outrageouslly expensive and over priced. Tickets (if you don't buy a permit) are way too expensive too. They are very strict and unreasonable on prices.
College Freshman,1,"Okay I don't know if its because my high school was a partying school or what, but this place sucks. I mean you really got to put yourself out there to get into one of these parties. You either need to be 1. From an Island (Guam.) 2. A ""jock"" aka baseball player who thinks they are good but actually arent even part of the league anymore. 3. A white girl with a short skirt. AND, lets just say you do get into one of these beloved parties, it will without a doubt end by midnight. Pretty sure other college parties start around that time. So do NOT go to this school if you want the typical college social life. "
College Freshman,1,"Okay lets get something straight: if you go here to be an ""athelete"" and pursue your goals in the athletic world, it isn't going to happen. Yet all the ""athletes"" walk around here as though they are the greatest thing to walk the Earth. And they're not."
College Freshman,1,"This year, Seattle U let in more students they had room for, leading to an absolute fiasco. Students were crammed into ""efficiency triples,"" which just means squeezing three students into a double room and transforming all the student lounges into quads. Housing is incredibly expensive for 9  x 11 foot rooms and little to no amenities. The windows need to be replaced, do not open all the way, and ooze water when it rains. The heater is sporadic and there is never any internet connection. The desk chairs are actually rocking chairs and the rooms are so tiny, don't bother bringing any other furniture with you, it actually will not fit. "
College Freshman,1,"If you enjoy limited to no internet access, being squished 3 to a room for 2, luke-warm cafeteria food, a lack of school spirit and campus, and no sun, Seattle U is the place for you! Also, if you are not from Washington and are hoping to get that federal aid transferred to state aid, you can kiss that goodbye! Want to study abroad in Europe but still need that scholarship to transfer in order to afford it? Good luck with that! Expecting a competent advising staff that wont put you in a class you've already got the AP credit for? Go to another college. I am serious. Unless, of course, you were imagining your college experience to be one of freezing cold frustration, as you work your butt off to fix the universities mistakes. Not to mention the dangerous location the school sits on."
College Freshman,1,"Its Going to Get Wet. Whoever said ""It really doesn't rain that much in Seattle, people just say it does!"" was WRONG! And for those few days when it's not raining? Don't expect the sun to come out. In fact, don't expect to see the sun from October until June. It snowed three inches in Seattle a week before finals, and the entire school/city of Seattle completely shut down. Also, due to the rainy weather, don't expect to see people hanging around outside. The school does not have that college-campus feel partly because of the weather."
College Sophomore,1,"Rain Rain Rain Rain and Clouds – the sky is nearly always completely overcast, and it often rains. sometimes we actually see the sun, though"

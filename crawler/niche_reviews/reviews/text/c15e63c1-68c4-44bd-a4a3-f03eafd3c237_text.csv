Niche User,5,Well I just like they football team and it’s a really good place I would want to go to it isn’t far from home maybe a few minutes half a hour and that’s good for me because I don’t want to be far away so my mom and family and friends can come see me play ball
Freshman,5,I really enjoyed my first year of college. I learned a lot and everyone on campus from the other students to the janitors and cafeteria staff to the professors were so friendly and approachable. You are not just another student. This community really cares about your success and wellbeing.
Senior,5,"My experience at Faulkner University has been wonderful! Great instructors and students, clean campus, and most importantly, a safe environment. This school is so amazing my mom also received her Bachelor's Degree here."
Freshman,5,It’s a great school and offers so many different opportunities that other colleges don’t offer. They have an extremely high exchange student rate which is a great opportunity to meet new people and cultures.
Graduate Student,5,"So far, my experience with Faulkner University is excellent.  The admissions people are lovely, the campus is very nice, it isn't too badly priced, and the professors seem to be well qualified."
Niche User,5,It has a great and easy learning environment and the athletics are great but also encourage a school first principal.
Sophomore,5,I love the vibrant campus life and the spiritual environment it offers for its students. I feel safe and welcome here. Proud to call Faulkner my home away from home!
Sophomore,5,Faulkner it is a wonderful university where you can build strong knowledge about your academic aspirations and god.
Sophomore,5,Faulkner University is a great school. They put an effort into the student body and helps in any way they can. I chose Faulkner for a reason.
Junior,5,"Faulkner University is a small, family-like feel campus. It's a Christian school. No matter what the class is, the bible will somehow be incorporated into the material. Class sizes are small; and teachers are more willing to help you if you fall behind or need extra help. The classes I have taken to obtain my business management degree, including finance, accounting, & business law, have given me the opportunity to utilize my negotiating skills."
Freshman,5,"Faulkner university has been a great gone to me.
When I first got to this country, this was the first place I was at and the really helped me get through a lot of things. The culture shock wasn't really a great deal for me because of the amazing Faulkner team .
Amazing ways to get along with different  people here at Faulkner. 
I can't forget the great food served here too.."
Freshman,5,I love the Christian atmosphere that Faulkner provides. All the staff is friendly and provides Christian advice that we can use in our future fields. I hope to see the school grow and continue sharing their love for Davis Elementary School.
Junior,5,"It has been excellent so far. The coursework is solidly Christian, the faculty are learned, and the technology is very easy to use."
Freshman,5,It’s a really comfortable college to be part. The faculty and staff are very friendly and helpful with any questions or concerns that I have.
Niche User,5,I loved faulkner university because they have such good teachers and their administation staff has helped a lot with getting prepared for the upcoming freshmen.
Freshman,5,The main thing I like about Faulkner is the staff. They welcome you with warm welcome and their actually there to help their students succeed.
Sophomore,5,"Faulkner University has helped me grow into the person I am today because of the personal relationships formed between students and faculty. Without the care shown by the vast majority of the teachers I have been assigned, I would not have had the great experiences I have had, even though I have only attended Faulkner for a short amount of time."
Freshman,5,"Faulkner University is an amazing place. I am enjoying everyday student life here. I am in a social club, I get to play intramural sports and participate in Jamboree. The teachers here can be your friends; I truly enjoy going to class because I am learning and having a good time as well. Chapel everyday is a blessing; a whole school coming together to praise God. The change I want is for more students to come and to be apart of this experience."
College Sophomore,5,They are helpful posting jobs daily.
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone you encounter in the hallway, in the library or computer labs, and in each coarse are all so helpful and positive. The teachers are so passionate about what they are teaching and care greatly that your are understanding and learning. I have loved my experience here so far and I would make the same choice again for sure!"
College Sophomore,5,If there is one thing about campus it is the utmost safety it provides. We have a very good security team that regularly patrols campus checking for signs of people who shouldn't be on campus and just generally checking up on everyone regularly. We have key cards that let us get into certain parts on campus and no one but the people who have key cards have access to them. We have plenty of cameras surrounding campus watching everything and monitoring campus life.
College Freshman,5,I feel more than safe on campus! Everyone is always very friendly! No creeps or weirdos. The campus police do a great job monitoring the area as well.
College Freshman,5,I enjoy all the professors I have. They are all very willing to help you succeed. I love being in a place where everyone cares and takes the time to understand me as an individual.
College Senior,5,Professors have been great. They try to help the students and actually seem to care.
College Senior,5,The people try to help the students find jobs and internships when needed.
College Freshman,5,I love my college ! It is very focused on each student and strives to assist with financial assistants and gives simple admission instructions and availability of admission assistance is endless !!! I felt as if I was the most important student that applied ! They truly CARE about the students and also are instrumental in each students spiritual aspect .
College Freshman,5,Faulkner is the perfect school for me. I get to be myself and the people there are so accepting and encouraging.
College Sophomore,5,It's a great school and I love being there
College Sophomore,5,Faulkner has built and changed  a lot of sports facilities
College Sophomore,5,Montgomery offers a lot of dining places
College Sophomore,5,This administration is needed at all schools
College Sophomore,5,"There are plenty of places to eat, from Sushi to burgers or Chinese restaurants. On Atlanta Hwy, you never run out of options and Eastern Boulevard nearby has even more places to eat at a low price."
College Junior,5,I'm in Delta Xi Omega and I love it! Delta makes my college experience and I wouldn't change it for the world!
College Freshman,5,faulkner is a very safe place
College Freshman,5,i play soccer and its the best experience ever.
College Freshman,5,Any one and every one will be found at my school.
College Freshman,5,I love Faulkner. Every one is so nice and the learning environment is great.
College Freshman,5,I can always go to my teacher if I don't understand and i work for my degree.
College Senior,5,Jones works hard to help it's students network and work with firms or judges during the school year and summer.
College Senior,5,I am happy with the job I have. I am in the legal field and my career goal is to become an attorney.
College Junior,5,I am enjoying my field of study. As I enter the courses that are more related to my chosen field I am finding myself more interested in the courses making it easier to study. My coach is a great encourager and support for me. I believe there are good opportunities for interning/assisting here on campus.
College Sophomore,5,Not many requirements to join. Just make sure you have a good advisor to be sure you have a plan so you can graduate on time.
College Sophomore,5,"Faulkner has an excellent business program. The professors are awesome and truly enjoy their jobs. Work load is manageable, but some classes do require more work than others."
College Sophomore,5,It's free to have a car on campus as long as you have a pass and you can only part where your pass is allowed.
College Sophomore,5,Business program is awesome and so are the professors.
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is very diverse coming from different areas for different reasons. Unless you are gay then you are accepted here.
College Sophomore,5,"There is no pressure to drink, and if you do it's on the weekends or on your own time. It is a dry campus with a strict policy on drugs and alcohol. "
College Junior,5,"I feel like most people that I attend class with are older adults and they for the most part have their own families, therefor they do not focus on the issues of ethnic/racial diversity, economic background, or political beliefs. Most of us are here to earn our degree while working, being spouses, and parents. It is a Christian University and you are required to take 12 hours of Biblical classes, so if that goes against your beliefs, you probably shouldn't attend."
College Sophomore,5,The athletics at Faulkner succeed really well while maintaining good grades and that is uncommon at most Universities that have this high success with the athletic teams
College Freshman,5,"All buildings on campus have a computer lab complete with a printer and copier. Also, faulkner offers all incoming freshman students iPads. This is really helpful with book costs."
College Freshman,5,Night classes and easy scheduling. There is no wait to get administrative assistance which I love!!!
Recent Alumnus,5,"There are all kinds of guys and girls at this university. The one thing that most of them have in common is their moral integrity. The university is a Christian school, so a majority of the students are focused on living a good moral life. There are students from rural areas and urban areas. The guys are really nice even thought they are different. The girls are very pretty on the inside and the outside."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I have only taken one class that I am currently enrolled in. I am taking the class online, but the class streams live through interactive software. I have been able to meet the students in the class and I have already seen students of different nationalities, genders, and race. There are different political and social opinions present in the class based on the comments I have heard. Faulkner is a very diverse environment."
College Freshman,5,We have a really good varsity women's basketball team and fan support is high. The men's basketball team is good as well and is well supported by the fans.
College Senior,5,I love the program I am in (criminal justice). I enjoy all of my classes and would definitely recommend this program to anyone interested in this field.
College Senior,5,They have an ample amount of courses offered and everyone here is humble and willing to teach.
College Senior,5,We have regular police officers to serve as security on the campus.
College Freshman,5,The dorms are excellent. When you first walk into the girls' freshman dorm it looks like a ski lodge.
College Freshman,5,I am very satisfied with the programs that Faulkner has to offer.
College Freshman,5,This is my freshman year at Faulkner and I would have to say that the academic programs are excellent. They have many different degree programs and I really want to take advantage of their study abroad program.
Freshman,4,"went back to school, after many years, while working full time to complete my Masters from Liberty online. They required my BA as well as specific pre-requisites from my undergraduate college before accepting me into their program. It was challenging as I was working, but I made sure my weekends and evenings were available for studying. Their professors were always available via phone or email. I strongly recommend their online program for working professionals, or anyone who is unable to attend on campus, or who cannot afford room and board. The campus is breathtaking and their facilities are top notch!"

Freshman,4,It’s a great place !! You get along very well with everyone especially since it’s a small campus and you can make your way around campus really easy. The professors are very understandable.
Junior,4,"I really enjoy Faulkner and all it has to offer for students, but it is very expensive.  It is a great and safe place with many opportunities."
Freshman,4,"The school is very nice. We have a lovely campus full of activities and the opportunity to be involved, it is just so expensive."
Freshman,4,"Faulkner is a great Christian environment. It's very diverse, and prepares students for occupational opportunities. However, for the cost of the school, the curriculum being taught could be more in depth and informational. One class I took was not very beneficial to me. We would zoom through a lot of information, and I only could retain it long enough to past the upcoming test."
Freshman,4,"The tour was very informative and staff was willing to answer any questions.   Was a clean campus, also spoke with the fishing Coach and was told about all aspects of how the team worked.  Have spoken to others on the phone and through email and everyone is informative and helpful and want to help you every way they can."
Freshman,4,Faulkner University is a friendly school.  They have a clean campus and a safe campus.  I enjoy the new classrooms and the teachers seem very knowledgeable.  I enjoy watching there volleyball team and also there basketball teams.  It is a small campus and that helps with getting around and getting to know the other students.  The teachers seem to care how well there students do and are willing to help in any way.
Graduate Student,4,"What I love about Faulkner University are the staff, student advisors and the great timing and organization"
Senior,4,Faulkner University is an good school. It's a diversity of people from ALL around the world. There are great people here to connect with and get good vibes with. One thing I would change about Faulkner is the tuition price!
Sophomore,4,"Faulkner University is a Christian based school where Christianity is exemplified in the character of their professors and staff. I like that Faulkner is a Christian based school because it gives me the freedom to express myself spiritually without any restraints. Faulkner has a great support team who is willing to help the students resolve issues that may occur during their studies while at Faulkner. I believe that Faulkner looks out for the best interest of its students, helping them to succeed and meet their potential goals in life. Faulkner keep their students informed on all activities that are happening on campus and want all students to be included becoming a well community, while studying at Faulkner. The one thing that I don’t like about Faulkner would be that my commute to campus is an hour and a half drive from where I live other than that I think Faulkner is a great place to study."
Senior,4,Faulkner University is a very diverse and prosperous campus as well as very religious. The perfect place to grow spiritually and socially
Alum,4,"I liked that it was a small school. Did not like Montgomery, AL itself. School has no party life because it is a COC school with alot of rules."
Freshman,4,The overall experience was nice and fun. I really enjoyed myself. The people around campus was very well spoken and respectful. The admissions was very helpful. They make sure you have evrything you need and all the proper classes you need.
Sophomore,4,I like the small campus and the size of my classes. I feel like I get better attention from my professors because of the small classes. I also have had a better chance to get to know people.
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life is a major role on campus, most friend groups are created on this role. While walking around campus, it is very common to see people from the club walk up to each other and do their special ""handshake"" or see them walking to class together. Other clubs are sometimes friends with the other clubs but many stick to incorporating with their own. It affects the social atmosphere very heavily, but it doesn't necessarily effect the non-Greeks. The non-Greeks view Greeks in many ways, some in awe, and some flabbergasted that people would put up with the tasks they have to just to get in a club."
College Sophomore,4,"Every Thursday at chapel, a different sports team leads our school in the singing of our school's anthem. On the actual game days, it's easy to find the players in their jerseys and seeing people encourage them on upcoming game. Another common occurrence is doing our school hand gesture(sticking out the pinky and thumb) and yelling go eagles."
College Sophomore,4,"I would choose this school again and again because of the wonderful atmosphere it gives, inside the busy capital of Alabama this campus offers peace and serenity. It is easy to navigate and you will always find yourself seeing familiar faces."
College Junior,4,I've never had any problems or witness any problems on our campus. We have a security daily.
College Junior,4,I am still in my course classes.
College Junior,4,I really enjoy our athletics department.
College Freshman,4,"It's great to have diversity and learn about others culture and beliefs. Faulkner is primarily a Christian school, but we do have some people who aren't Christian. I think it's great they chose to come here because it's such a good influence to everyone."
College Freshman,4,"I am not into Greek life; however, they are always helping out and doing crazy things to be in the club. I think it's a great thing and have no bad feelings towards Greek life."
College Freshman,4,Faulkner has great school spirit. We are a small school and enjoy knowing everyone just about. It's great to watch baseball and basketball. Everyone enjoys the sports here.
College Freshman,4,"Faulkner does its very best to help students get a job immendialty after graduating. The employers at Faulkner really care about you and your education. They do their best to make it easier on your part. They go out of their way to help you, and that's very respectable."
College Senior,4,"Professors are great. They are a great help with registration and encourage you to get ahead. There are lots of study places on campus, outside, library, coffee shop, etc."
College Senior,4,Our sport teams do really well. Several of the students are big fans of sports. The faculty are also good supporters and encouragers.
College Freshman,4,The dorms are alright for now. The freshman dorms are not bad but the dorms will get better . Next year I will be in better dorms.
College Freshman,4,"The social club that I joined was Kappa Phi- Lamda. I love this club so much and spend a lot of time with my Kappa brothers. Yet, I still spend about the same amount of time with my friends who aren't in clubs."
College Freshman,4,Faulkner University is a great place for me to be. I could not picture myself at a different school. The overall friendliness is unbelievable and I would definitely choose this school again if I had to do it all over.
College Junior,4,"Faulkner Birmingham is a smaller school with flexible schedules, this helps me out a lot since im a night shift security guard."
College Sophomore,4,I love my school because its a small campus and I feel its easier to make more friends that way. I also love the good Christian environment which is so encouraging to me and allows me to express myself freely without judgement from others. Over all its been a great experience and I love going back to school after my summer break is over to see all of my friends again.
College Senior,4,"My school is unique because the teachers develop a one on one relationship with the students. They care about us and want to see us succeed, I'm not just another name on a rooster to them."
College Sophomore,4,They have nice apartment and remodeled dorms
College Sophomore,4,Great because if the different choices
College Freshman,4,"I've had no problems with the financial aid portions of Faulkner. Having a great admissions councilor, he set me up to receive all the scholarships and financial aid that I needed to be able to come to Faulkner."
College Freshman,4,"As a freshman girl, we receive the privilege of living in the best dorms on campus. The Harris dorms are sometimes called ""the ski lodge."" Next semester I will be living in a dorm with a significantly less number of amenities. Although the Burton dorms are closer to campus life, they are far below the standards of Harris."
College Sophomore,4,"The safety is good, because for the first time in history last year a gun was fired on campus. That has never happened before, and they are doing everything to make sure it doesn't happen. However, the nursing homes and apartments on campus lower the feeling of safety. Also, we don't have a security guard at the front of the school unless there are special events going on."
College Freshman,4,Campus food is good in the Grille and the Cafeteria. Faulkner also has a Dinner Theater across to street where Faulkner students and staff perform while have a formal dining experience.
College Freshman,4,I do not live on campus but I do enjoy the campus atmosphere in my free time. The school has a multiplex full of activities that range from playing pool to basketball. Even though its not your traditionally oversized campus they neatly provide alot of activities in an organized manner.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are wonderful, with two girls per room unless you want to pay an extra $500 per semestere for your own room. The apartments are spacious and have four girls or guys per apartment, with two bathrooms. The atmosphere is so friendly and inviting, and I really appreciate how my teachers take the time to help (considering the classes have approx. 20 people on average. I love it here!"
College Junior,4,"There were some professors that took the time to give the one on one help, when needed. I was on the basketball team and the professors really took that into consideration and worked with my schedule."
College Junior,4,The professors are will in to help you in the areas that you are weak. There is tutoring available to those who are struggling.
College Junior,4,We have a great Athletics program. And intramurals are really fun!
College Junior,4,The Administration is great here at Faulkner. They love to get to know you and help on a one on one basis.
College Junior,4,Housing at Faulkner is great and very safe. I love living on campus!
College Junior,4,The school maintains a level of strictness that is beneficial in the end
College Freshman,4,i study only what i need so i don't waste my time
College Freshman,4,Its Montgomery Alabama so there's tons of things to do near the school
College Junior,4,"I have had an incredible experience at school so far. I have been able to take part in many different opportunities on campus. I have been able to further my education and also grow as a person. I have made so many great friendships as well that will hopefully last a lifetime. My most memorable experiences so far have been traveling all over with the chorus, and being in incredible plays at our dinner theatre. I feel as if i chose the best place for me to grow and enjoy college."
College Junior,4,"The campus has a good policy and the right amount of strictness. Also, students are given many chances if they make mistakes, but there are things that will ultimately not be tollerated."
College Junior,4,"The school offers any graduate and undergraduate degrees. Also, the faculty is best at being helpful and making sure their students stay on the right track. Registration typically goes very smoothly,and allows students to get things in order ahead of time. Also, the curriculum is good and isn't too overwhelming."
College Junior,4,"I recently switched majors, however the program and opportunites so far have been well."
College Junior,4,The campus makes many feel like at home. It is a safe environment and take security seriously.
College Junior,4,"The unique things on campus is the unity and support on campus. Many students and facilty try their best to help you have a good experience in college. Other unviersities don't always have this trait. There also great devotions that people can participate in on campus. Sprituality is a huge factor on campus as well. Also, the arts program has some the most talented people involved including myself."
College Junior,4,"The school has many international students from all over. Many of those students play for different sports such as soccer, baseball, and basketball. The campus is more enjoyable with differnt types of studnets to interact with. Diverse campuses make you learn so much about life, and how to deal with individuals who are very different from yourself."
College Senior,4,There is 24/7 security that patrols the campus in a vehicle. I believe the security does a great job. I have not had any problems regarding my safety on campus.
College Junior,4,They are probably stricter than most related to who can visit in dorm rooms. I don't find this unreasonable as it corresponds with the morals taught by the church.
College Junior,4,"I have the opportunity to interact with students from England, Brazil, Africa as well as students from several states of the USA."
College Junior,4,The campus is small enough that a car isn't required but if you have a car there really isn't difficulty finding appropriate parking.
Alum,2,"Faulkner “University” is nothing of the sort. It has the feel of a medium-sized high school. The academics are weak, with many core classes taught by adjunct faculty. There is very little research being done on campus, robbing students of participating in meaningful, current scholarship. An authoritarian student life code treats young adults like children. Unless you are from a Christian fundamentalist evangelical background, RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE AS FAST AS YOU CAN. If you are from this tradition, you can do FAR better at a school like Sanford, Birmingham-Southern, Lipscomb, Belmont or evening Harding. Remember: you can do better!"
College Senior,2,"Faulkner does not have a lot of diversity. I'm not sure if it's so much their fault as it is the location. You don't see a lot of diversity in Montgomery, Alabama"
College Senior,2,There is not a career center at Faulkner. They do have career fairs twice a semester. A surprising number of Faulkner employees have graduated from Faulkner. I am not sure if they discuss how to get a job in your field after you graduate. Internships are required for graduation
College Freshman,2,Most of the people that go to Faulkner live on campus. The commuters often have very little to do with on-campus events.
College Freshman,2,The party scene at Faulkner is non-existent.
College Sophomore,2,We don't have clubs. We have social clubs that only hang out and do community work.
College Sophomore,2,"For being the capital of Alabama, I am very unimpressed. There is nothing to do ever."
College Sophomore,2,"Computer labs aren't open 24/7, not is the library and our wifi is horrible all over campus."
College Sophomore,2,"It is humid and sticky 99% of the time, and it is hot. When it rains, snows, or drops below 75 degrees the people of Montgomery freak out and put on heavy coats. They are not used to severe weather of any kind. "
College Freshman,2,"There is no nightlife at Faulkner and when you go off campus to find it you have to make sure the dean doesn't find out. Outside campus there are so many opportunities, though."
College Freshman,2,"Faulkner is extremely strict. There are so many rules, but you can sum them up easily enough like so: opposite genders are not allowed to be alone. You must attend chapel. No drugs what-so-ever. No sex or your kicked out. Very limited PDA. No attending bars or clubs of any fashion. For students under 20 12:00p curfew. No leaving campus after curfew. For all students: you must be out of the opposite genders apartment by 11:45p. No one of opposite gender is allowed in any dorm room ever. Dress code is present at Faulkner, but not strictly enforced."
College Freshman,2,"Local atmosphere here at Faulkner is not really how people see it. Behind closed doors the true college atmosphere comes out. Roommates cuss, talk trash, and brag about the girls they've been with constantly. Most of my friends are bible majors and they are just as bad. The people here at Faulkner, the ones who believe its so Christian, they haven't seen what I have. The worse part about it is you would never even know right away because most of the students are well rehearsed in being ""good"" while their in public and around teachers and such. It's really something to see the dark side of this ""Christian"" collage. Here at Faulkner ive hung out with many many students. Trust me, the dark side is far worse than you could guess. 
Faulkner is very strict. If your looking for a party on the weekend you have to go to AUM next door to get any action. Drugs here at Faulkner are almost all done off campus because of the cameras around every corner and because of the security guards who live to bust students doing any drug. It's good not to have any drugs, but its a hustle for the students who smoke cigarets or chew tobacco, although, chewing tobacco is done on campus mostly at night when they know they won't be bothered."

College Junior,2,Football is the main sport the school focuses on and they suck.
College Junior,2,"Limited and Not Away Available for Help – Most professors, registration process you on your on. There is know special study option or popular study areas on my campus.I'm doing well and work very hard to stay on all assignment but over all if the student is will to work hard they will completed theirs course."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's average, we have a dress code so we have to follow those rules. Social life is not that great, there's not much to do."
Alum,1,"Faulkner University is not a ""Christian University"". That is just a title they slap on their sign so they can justify charging upwards of 30k a year for enrollment (the net price recorded on this site needs to be updated. When only 20% of students at Faulkner are members of the Church of Christ whom the school claims affiliation, then the school is not Christian. That was the most frustrating part of Faulkner for me.

The academics are poor. Faulkner attracts low performing students because they have low acceptance standards. They have been told by enrollment analysis companies that they are essentially an ""open-enrollment"" school, which is why they have such a low retention rate.

The main point is that this school is not worth the price of admission. If it were 12k a year, that would be more reasonable, even though the value it provides is around 6-8k a year. 

I would strongly encourage you to save your money and look elsewhere for continuing education."
Alum,1,"The University has long ago sold it’s soul for money. They preach morality, yet invite Donald Trump, Jr. to speak at their fundraiser! And lest you think this is an anomaly, just google the past speakers- it’s a “who’s who” of White supremacy and misogyny. They perfectly embody the characters describing Matthew 23:27-28, “ ...You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean. 28 In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.”"
College Sophomore,1,There is not any nightlife.
College Sophomore,1,"Very dry, conservative Christian campus."
College Sophomore,1,You have no life and no freedom.
College Sophomore,1,You can only live off campus if you are an Alabama resident and live with your parents.
College Freshman,1,In the area immediately surrounding the school and close by there is nothing to really do at night because everything closes at ten. Which sucks. Areas outside of Montgomery city limits is where people to go to party!
College Freshman,1,There is no off campus housing at Faulkner university. This has turned MANY potential students away.
College Freshman,1,"On campus living arrangements and rules are the number one thing that turns prospective students away. If you live in the dorms, you cannot have a female in your room at any time. Females and males are only allowed in the dorm's lobby, but only from six in the morning to 11:45 at night. For any kind of intimacy, most students go off campus because you will get kicked out if caught. The dorms are nice though. Mostare shared by two students. The security is great. Faulkner has cameras EVERYWHERE. Almost every foot of the campus is covered at some angle. The apartments are not much better when it comes to male female contact. Your only allowed to be in the living room of the apartment of the opposite gender from eight in the morning to 11:45 at night. I understand that they don't want the Christian young adults having sex, but there comes a time when you just need to learn responsibility. Most of the rules are not followed in the apartments because students don't snitch on each other. There are only a few students that follow the rules to a ""T."" I could go on here, but if you decide to visit the college talk to some of the students in the lobbies or around the dorms and apartments. They can tell you how strict Faulkner is when it comes to male female contact when they are not on camera."
College Junior,1,"They don't have actual sorority's or fraternies they call theres ""social clubs""and its pretty lame"

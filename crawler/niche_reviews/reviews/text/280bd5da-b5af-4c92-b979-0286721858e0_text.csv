Sophomore,5,"It is a pretty good University! All my professors have been super nice and I like the environment. The campus is pretty big, but easy to navigate. The cafeteria is pretty good and lower case has subway, panda exprees, chicfila, and moes."
Sophomore,5,I like eastern Kentucky university because it is a fun and interesting school with great academics. There’s always something fun going on. They also really want to see their students succeed and have a lot of resources so that they do so.
Junior,5,All my classes have been online and the professors are easy to access and reply in a very timely manner.
Junior,5,Eastern Kentucky University has been so helpful and has worked well with my work schedule so that I can finish my bachelors.
Freshman,5,I have taken all of my classes online. Eastern Kentucky University has done a great job making their interface user accessible. The professors have all been great online too.
Junior,5,"Eastern Kentucky University has become my home away from home in the past year and a half. Even with everything going on in the world, EKU has kept a level head and made sure that their students come first with everything. Allowing us to stay at home and continue our schoolwork was just one great example of how they kept things smooth. They created a tactical team that only debated what their plan of action was and was quick to respond to any questions asked. Not only that, they have taken good care of their professors and allowed them the flexibility to work on their classes on their own time. This small community is probably the best one I have ever been apart of and hope to continue to be apart of for many years into the future as an alumni. Eastern Kentucky University has become my home and I couldn't imagine what my life would have been without it."
Freshman,5,EKU has a lot of good resources for all freshmen who need help with their school and job. Great experience in the events such as homecoming at EKU.
Senior,5,"EKU is a home away from home. Not only is it affordable,  the campus is beautiful! There are many campus organizations to join!"
Graduate Student,5,"Eastern Kentucky was my first home away from home. What truly made it a memorable experience was the professors of my department who are now my life long mentors and inspiration. I was more fortunate than other EKU students to develop close relationships and a sense of community with both other students and teachers. Unfortunately, what made EKU so special is now disintegrating since my graduating year of 2015, much of my department has changed to accommodate changes to the university (larger classroom sizes, raise in tuition, and moving away from service learning). Although the campus now looks very nice with new buildings and gardens, it feels that it has lost it's sense of close community and service learning."
Junior,5,"Advisors are very quick and adequately responsive. The courses are very informative and helpful. There are multiple options available and always help anytime. The campus is clean and safe, and there is always someone around the corner to help. I would recommend EKU to anyone!"
Freshman,5,"Eastern Kentucky University has welcomed me with open arms, I would highly recommend this university to any high school student or anyone looking to transfer. this college does not take failing as an option, they will help you at any cost to see you succeed. there is so many clubs and organizations that are availably to you at all times, this school is definitely a home away from home."
Alum,5,"I loved this school. Spent all 4 years here. It was very easy to get involved on campus. I even believe I had a total of 3 or 4 different jobs during my time here. The classes were great and the teachers were very helpful whenever you needed it. When it comes to the city as a whole, it's pretty based on the school but there are good restaurants and stores around. If none of that interests you, Lexington was right down the road."
Freshman,5,Eastern Kentucky University is a Great school! They have some of the best programs! Beautiful campus.
Senior,5,"Other than having the best criminal justice program in North America, EKU is just the right size for me. I have gotten very involved with the campus and with its organizations (which it offers a ton of). I have also gotten the opportunity to work here as a student worker which gave me a chance to work closely with professors and those within the community."
Junior,5,"From all the colleges I toured, EKU felt the most inclusive and most home-like. I do not regret my decision coming here. The friendly environment makes it feel like a safe and comfortable to spend my time away from home. The facilities are nice and constantly being updated, so can't complain about that. EKU has been a great environment for me to experience growth and become more independent."
Niche User,5,It was a beautiful place to see and a lot of great people there and to meet and their rooms are nice
Sophomore,5,So far my time at EKU has been nothing but wonderful. This campus is truly beautiful and so welcoming. With class sizes that are fairly small you feel like you can get to know your peers and professors better.
Senior,5,"I graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor’s in English and decided to go back this year for my BFA with a concentration in Painting.  I have only been drawing and painting for 2 years, and I wanted to improve my skills.  I love Eastern Kentucky University.  The campus is beautiful with vivid flowerbeds and trees.  EKU has an awesome food court with many chains represented like Chik-fil-A, Steak n’ Shake, Moe’s Southwest Grill, and many others.  Students are very active and health-conscious, so we’re getting a new recreational center with pools, gym, and many other amenities.  We love our football and basketball in Kentucky, so the stadium and coliseum are always full of students cheering on our athletes.  I have learned a lot, the professors are knowledgeable and really engage in instruction.  I am very glad that EKU is my choice to further my education."
Senior,5,"I am a full time online student and have had the best experience.  The support system is amazing. There are so many avenues available for help, of any kind, from study habits, writing papers, technical support, and even the much needed positive feedback."
Freshman,5,"Amazing overall. Wouldn't change it for a bit. Best choice for the American Sign Language Interpretation program, no doubt!!"
Freshman,5,I've really enjoyed EKU on and off campus. The overall diversity of the campus while also having very approachable professors really helped my transition to college life. I would highly recommend Eastern Kentucky University to anyone who is currently stuck on where they want to go for college.
Niche User,5,Eastern Kentucky University has lots of diversity and great things to do in the area. The campus is very safe and spacious.
Niche User,5,"I love this school, such a pretty campus! The new dorms are amazing and the science building is gorgeous. There is a police station, fire station, and hospital right down the street"
Freshman,5,"I just started my freshman year this past August, but I like the smaller classes and the everything is within walking distance on campus."
Freshman,5,"My fellow students are really kind and the staff and faculty is very helpful and kind as well! There are tons of clubs and organizations to join on campus, including Greek life! The residence halls are spacious and a lot cleaner than I expected them to be as an incoming freshman. Most of the buildings are fairly close to one another, so you don't really spend a lot of time walking, unless you live at Keene Hall. But even then its not a huge distance. There's lots of off-campus excursions to go on, too. You can go hiking and kayaking on Lake Reba, you can get dinner at a large variety of great restaurants around town, and you can venture around and take in the local history of Richmond."
Niche User,5,"Im a current senior high school, and i already know this is my home. I've been to multiple campus events/visits and met multiple professors and all i can say is wow. The campus is beautiful and safe and its overall just an amazing place!!!!"
Senior,5,"Smaller than most universities, yet large enough to offer everything you need with diversity.  Beautiful campus that is clustered mostly together with lots of activities.  The classes range from small to mid size so your professors have a lot of one on one interaction. The academics offer a wide range of choices for undergrad and graduate students. My overall experience  here is excellent."
Sophomore,5,"The campus is so beautiful and small, but not that small but its the perfect campus to walk around in and just enjoy."
Sophomore,5,"Overall it is a great school. Eastern has a variety of food choices including the cafe, chic-fil-a, panda express, Moe's and Subway. EKU also has a variety of campus-wide activities for students with different needs. The campus is beautiful and the landscaping is always maintained with various in-season plants. The students are mostly helpful and accepting of others with very few exceptions. Most of my teachers are wonderful and would go the extra mile for any students however, there are a few who refuse to offer any extra help. Like anything else there are going to be faults in the system but, at Eastern Kentucky University there are very few."
Freshman,5,"Everyone at EKU is extremely helpful, they make the overall college experience less stressful! When transferring in I was an absolute mess and riddled with anxiety, but the SOTO department made the transition painless and as easy as possible. I am forever thankful for my choice to transfer."
Niche User,5,"It is an amazing school. Wonderful campus, beautiful scenery, and very nice people. I plan to attend there fall of 2020 and I couldn't be happier with my decision."
Sophomore,5,From the first day I arrived at Eastern Kentucky University (EKU) I felt welcomed and apart of something I’ve never had before. There was a 3 day event where all freshman got to know one another and got the change to create friendships all of which I still have to this day.
Junior,5,"Eastern Kentucky University is phenomenal. You will learn how to critically think, how to progress with future careers and you will be provided the tools necessary to accomplish your dreams and goals."
Freshman,5,"Eastern Kentucky provides the perfect college experience. From academics, to sports, to social aspects, EKU is a place everyone can call home. The academics are challenging, but professors are always willing to help with students who struggle. Social aspects of Eastern are especially great. There are a ton of different sororities and fraternities on campus to join, as well as clubs and groups for those less interested in the greek life! Sports are extremely important to EKU. The football and basketball games create an environment that everyone wants to be a part of! Go Colonels!"
Sophomore,5,"While EKU a predominately caucasian populated university, we do not support or allow discrimination on campus. We are a welcoming community, with awesome educational opportunities and a beautiful campus."
Alum,5,"EKU has a rich history, beautiful campus, and plenty of activities for people from various backgrounds and interests. The professors are kind and willing to work with students to ensure success. Advising could be more streamlined and program requirements/course catalog listings could be more clearly stated. Overall, I love EKU!"
Alum,5,"Good student amenities, but needs to work on career guidance services. Some programs are also a bit rudimentary and would benefit from being expanded."
Sophomore,5,"Eastern Kentucky University is  a complete home away from home. The staff, students, and professors are always welcoming and will try to help you any chance they get. Campus safety was a huge factor when I was choosing a college and was one of the reasons I chose EKU."
Niche User,5,"Going to school there in the fall. So far every experience I have had with this university has been really good, I love it so much there I can’t stop visiting! I can’t wait to attend in the fall."
Freshman,5,"I love how it is big but it is also small enough to know many people such as professors and peers. I love campus life, there is always something going on to keep me busy in my free time. I also love how most of the professors try to make it as personal as possible."
Freshman,5,i like that at eastern kentucky university you are able to walk from one side of the campus to the other side.
Freshman,5,"Eastern is a great fit for me. I love the campus, its the perfect size and beautiful. Many majors are offered and the freshman orientation is phenominal. The professors are approachable and very helpful. My freshman year has been a learning experience for sure. I have grown as a student and as a person. EKU has a diverse population and that was really important for me. I am looking forward to all that EKU has to offer. I hope that I will represent my college in a positive light. The most important criteria for me is that I will have the skills I need to secure a job in my chosen profession. Go big E!"
Junior,5,I have had a good 3 years so far. I like the atmosphere that you get living on campus. The worst thing is the parking.
Freshman,5,"It is a fantastic university. I am beyond glad that I chose to go to EKU. My peers are great, the food is great, and my professors are overall fantastic. I love it!"
Freshman,5,I grew up in the town around Eastern Kentucky University. I have always loved the beautiful campus and the buildings housed on that campus. EKU is always actively involved with the high schools in surrounding areas. I remember many times I attended the STEM fair through EKU and part of that involvement helped waver my decision to attend Eastern. I always feel as if I belong at EKU.
Niche User,5,"Amazing Campus, Very clean , safe , dorms are insanely amazing, all around great college. Professors maintain great relationships with students. All inclusive campus. Many things to do and see around campus and some incredible state of the art technology."
Sophomore,5,Throughout my first year at Eastern I truly felt at home. I truly believe the best decision I made was choosing to go to EKU for college.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love EKU! My experiences there are great and I love all my professors there. I believe everyone should come to Richmond, where everyone is friendly and kind. They are open to different diversities and the professors do put you first."
Freshman,5,Eastern Kentucky University has the best program in my field in the whole state of Kentucky. It's School of Justice and Safety is a program of Distinction.
Graduate Student,5,Affordable and supportive. One of the better priced DNP programs with high quality education and appropriately accredited program
Freshman,5,EKU has given me a home away from home where I have found a field I wish to pursue and a job to help with the expenses of campus life.
Sophomore,5,"It's not too big, and not too small. It's affordable and still university title. There needs to be more parking."
Junior,5,EKU has a very welcoming environment.  The professors seem to really care about the students.  The newer dorms are very nice.  They have a support system for students with learning disabilities that is extremely helpful.
Niche User,5,When I visited Eastern it was absolutely incredible. They have amazing programs for health and criminal justice majors. They have a great atmosphere of students. Amazing class ratios. and its very affordable.
Freshman,5,"What i loved about Eastern Kentucky University was, of course that the had my major, Pre-Occupational Therapy, many other schools had the same major but this university had a much better program. Another reason Eastern stood out to me were the friendly faces and the appreciation that the incoming freshmen had from the school. it was very heart warming. It felt good to know that I chose the right decision to be apart of the Colonel family and the tuition was very convenient for me and my family. I am proud I've became a Colonel and i can't wait to see whom i will become when i walk across the stage receiving my diploma, accessing a new level to my life of happiness."
Sophomore,5,They are really nice and have a lot of materials to help you! It's a large campus with medium to small classes.
Sophomore,5,Professors are generally willing to work with you on things. Classrooms are clean and spacious. Classes are never too large. The area around the campus is amazing. Offers regional campus options.
Sophomore,5,I love Eastern Kentucky university. It's a wonderful diverse school. They offer a lot of opportunities and I love that. Although they just went through a budget cuts and they shut down the campus that is closer to me.
Sophomore,5,It is a great campus.  It is not a huge college--but the is Lots to do socially.  It is close to intersate--so communting is easy to navigate.  Close to malls.  Teachers are great small enough that you get indiviualize attention.
Graduate Student,5,I was an undergrad in the EKU Honors Program.  At that time it was one of the best in the country.  When I decided to go back to school and obtain my masters I originally went to another school but transferred back to EKU because they had evening/weekend availability to allow me to work full time and finish my degree.
Junior,4,"Overall, the learning experience online during COVID-19 has been very good. It has been an adjustment for everyone, not just the students."
Junior,4,I have been a student at EKU for 3 years now and most of my professors have seemed to genuinely care about how well we do in their class as well as other classes.
Sophomore,4,A beautiful school with a caring facility where it counts. I do wish they listened more to the students voice and what we had to say sometimes.
Sophomore,4,I took classes both online and in person due to Covid-19. Throughout this year and last year professors have always been eager to help the students no matter what.
Sophomore,4,"I like that there is always something going on and something for students to do on campus. Activities at the Rec, extra curricular activities, sports, etc."
Sophomore,4,"The instructors, teachers, and employees at eastern Kentucky university add very kind and positive people. As an African American male I have never felt unwanted on campus or uncomfortable. However, you cannot just expect people to help you you have to be willing to ask for it on your own."
Freshman,4,"Eastern Kentucky University has been great. The only downside, however, has been upon returning to school after a 2 year break. I have had to jump through hoop after hoop for the last 2 months, my financial aid is super late, I was only approved for readmission a week before classes began, etc. It has been a nightmare with that sense."
Senior,4,"I like the classes and professors. I'm very attached to the professors in my field. My issues are with the registration process, especially when first applying. They are also really bad about telling people important information, such as deadlines and resources."
Junior,4,"While these times are tough and communication is cut short on many occasions, I doubt that Eastern Kentucky University could have handled the switch to online any better. As things started to escalate, they had a team immediately banded together to discuss what will happen in the future. This quick response was able to keep us students and the professors safe on campus. The teachers were allowed a week to get things in order for us and many of them were able to make it feel like a real classroom in my own room. Sometimes the servers for Blackboard would go down, but that never stops a class from learning the material. While I miss classes on campus, I'm happy that EKU has allowed us to stay safe inside of our own homes and practice our social distancing."
Junior,4,"I had to take my classes online for the rest of the semester because of COVID-19. My professors were very understanding about attending lectures and turning in assignments because of technology issues. However, it was very stressful because they assigned more work than what was on the syllabus."
Junior,4,"I really love the campus! It is close knit and the professors are really helpful. They want you to succeed in their classes. The campus is kind of small, but it is very easy to meet people that share the same interests as you. Also, campus life is so much fun because you can meet so many different people from all around the world."
Sophomore,4,"Throughout my first year of college at EKU, each of my professors were very helpful and reasonable with assignments and grades. The campus is beautiful as well. After transitioning to online courses for the second semester, some courses were more difficult than others but I ended well and still kept a high GPA."
Freshman,4,"During the COVID-19, the online classes were good. They helped me to focus to finish the assignments on time.  The professors did a great job with communication with the students who needed help with their assignments. Also EKU offered the tutoring sessions online. They were helpful."
Junior,4,Online classes are typically very thought out and detailed. The professors are quick to respond and the content is easy to understand.
Freshman,4,I have enjoyed my time here at EKU. Its a big name school but with a somewhat small campus with great teachers and staff. Only rate 4 starts because I am a freshman and have not experienced everything yet.
Freshman,4,"I love how everyone feels like they have a place here. The staff are always helpful and welcoming, encouraging us to try new things and explore. There is always something to do, events, markets, parties. I have made many lifelong friends both student and staff alike."
Niche User,4,"I went to Eastern Kentucky University for a football camp in the summer and i really enjoyed it. I’m Trying to visit the school and see the campus, the rooms, and the area around the campus. I looked up the rooms and i really liked them."
Freshman,4,"EKU is a great school. The campus is amazing, it's very scenic, and campus life is active. Students are engaged and want to be there, the school offers many clubs and activities for students to participate in, and campus is very safe. The Professors are great, and every Professor and Advisor wants to see students succeed. The atmosphere is very nice."
Freshman,4,It is a really nice school and I recommend everyone to at least come for a visit. The campus has really nice vibes. If you ever have any questions you can ask any staff and they will be sure to help you or point you to who ever can.
Freshman,4,"EKU is an amazing school. I like the smaller campus, it gives the feel of being at home while away from home. I like that I'm exploring being away from home but I am close enough to drive home on the weekends or where ever I need too.
I enjoy and like the small class sizes and that the teachers/professors actually care about theit students and want them to succeed."
Niche User,4,"Currently, I am a high school senior boy d to attend Eastern Kentucky University. some family members of mine, as well as friends have gone through this path and have saturated me with information about this school, and its surroundings. I was drawn in to the school by their police academy, as they currently have one of the largest, most prestigious groups in all of America. when looking into this school, I discovered that it could be my second home. The thought of living on campus, and making a new family excites me, as well as scares me a bit. After visiting the campus and going through the grounds, I noticed that this is where I want to be, grow, and learn as a person. so far, my experience with this school has been nothing less of exciting."
Niche User,4,it's a good school to attend. Professors are connected to the students. They teach well. It is a more educated based school not many partys.
Freshman,4,I have been at eastern for only 2 semesters now but I already feel very comfortable here. My classes aren’t as far apart as I imagined they would be. Everyone here is very nice and it’s easy to find your way around.
Freshman,4,"I love the community feel of Eastern Kentucky University. I chose EKU because it was not as big as the University of Kentucky, and the class size was noticeably smaller."
Junior,4,"The course work is great and I love all my teachers, but the living faculties are not good to live in and expensive. I have bad and good experiences with other students, but overall they are friendly. The staff is super helpful and really encourage you to do your best!"
Junior,4,"My experience with attending Eastern Kentucky University has been an overall challenging and eye-opening. My student life is average in some regard, but I am making improvements to become more involved. Areas I think EKU can improve on is there student life, especially during the weekends. From what I've seen most students pack up and leave for the weekend, so enhancing student life especially during the weekend can maybe help students get involved and find fun weekend activities to do."
Junior,4,"Eastern Kentucky university (EKU) has a wide variety of majors, clubs, sports, and other ways to get involved on campus. Moody if the professor truly do care about the students efforts involvement in class, and stride too mane the classes interesting."
Freshman,4,"Its a really nice campus. Its really easy to make friends here with the different clubs, classmates, and fellow residence hall members."
Junior,4,"Switched here from a private university, love that I made that switch. Its not terribly big not super small. so theres enough new faces that you don't know everyone"
Sophomore,4,"The campus and people are amazing. Many of the professors are kind and helpful. Depending on how you learn best, however, a few professor can be hard to learn from. There is a great tutoring center that can help you if that seems to become an issue."
Sophomore,4,"I have had a great experience so far here at EKU. The classes and professors are great. There are many different food options available on campus. There are also many different people that are here on campus to support you and can help you, even if you just need to talk to someone. Not only are facilities great, but the campus is beautiful too."
Senior,4,I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at EKU. The professors are extremely hospitable and work with you to help you achieve your goals. It is a bigger campus with a small feel. You can't walk across campus without seeing someone you know!
Junior,4,My first two years at Eastern Kentucky university were great! They are doing a good job at giving students a better dining hall as well as new dorms.
Sophomore,4,EKU is very homey and accommodating. The tutoring centers and the colonels cupboard have been especially helpful.
Junior,4,"The college is a very nice place to relax and meet new friends. I feel safe, and the food is not too bad. The best thing is I have thoroughly enjoyed all of my professors so far."
Sophomore,4,I feel like the only main issue is that there isnt enough communication with students in financial need
Junior,4,"I love attending Eastern Kentucky University. EKU lives up to its nickname ""campus beautiful"" through the use of preserving nature as well as a no littering policy which the students uphold. The staff is mostly positive and campus live is thriving. It is also a good size as it is not too big to get across campus in time but also not overly crowded."
Sophomore,4,"I love being a student here at Eastern Kentucky University. It is very easy to find a home in whatever it is that you choose to do. From Greek Life to sports to being apart of a club, anyone can find an interest in something to do on campus. The food is not always the best but they have a lot of stores on-campus such as Chik-Fil-A, Subway, and Steak and Shake to fulfill your food needs. Overall it is a very nice, clean, friendly, and safe school to be at."
Sophomore,4,"Since Richmond, KY is my hometown I definitely have a biased view when it comes to this school and going in I thought I would hate it. However, I was proven wrong by the beautiful scenery and wonderful people."
Senior,4,I am transferring into this school in order to complete my degree and so far I have had a pretty good experience with most of the individuals whom I have come into contact with.  I am looking to interact with more individuals soon in order to hopefully be able to give a better score for their ratings.
Junior,4,"I like the atmosphere of the college. Its very welcoming and unlike other colleges, there is no a city in the middle of it. It is also very spread out compared to other colleges."
Freshman,4,I like the campus and the people. Some of the professors are rude and not understanding. The environment is nice and working on campus is enjoyable.
Freshman,4,One of the things I enjoy most about Eastern Kentucky University is the campus scene and how friendly the staff is.
Niche User,4,"My experience at EKU was amazing. Professors are wonderful and are so caring about the students, the resources the campus has to make sure students are able to strive and be better."
Freshman,4,"Eastern Kentucky University is an amazing university,  all of my professors have been down to earth people that understand that students have lives outside of school"
Freshman,4,"Eastern is a good sized school for most. It is very small when compared to UK, but this may also be a good thing. At Eastern, you are not treated like another number. Experience from both the Richmond and regional campus provided all that one might need. The campus give an inviting experience. Like all communities, nothing is simply handed to you. For the students who do not like it here, they fail to branch out and make friends. College is most definitely what you make it. There are activities all the time, a great gym, numerous intramural activities, various eating options on and off campus. The location of Richmond is good. If one wishes, a short trip to Lexington would be a connivence. You can make the most out of Richmond while also experiencing life in Lexington. This is a good school, good people. The professors truly care about you and your well being. Although they aren't perfect, they continue to improve with each year."
Senior,4,"I very much love going to school here! the college campus has so many resources for students and also have an amazing environment that is very welcoming. There are many clubs and activities available for students to get to know each other and make friends. The only issue with this college, like many, is the constant unnecessary construction and rising in fees."
Junior,4,Eastern Kentucky is a great community. Everyone is nice and eager to help you on your journey. The professors care about your learning and will do anything to help you.
Senior,4,"I really enjoyed my time here, it's a calm campus. They have great professors and I've had great memories here."
Junior,4,I attended EKU over 10 years ago and I am now enrolled in their online program.  I am a full time working mother of two and their online program is the only way I can finish my degree.  I am thankful this is an option for me at this point in my life and career.
Sophomore,4,"I love EKU.  life and opportunity.  I love the Music department, and the friendships I have made.  I do think the dorms need work.  My degree program is flexible.  I enjoy the classes that are small enough to have professor contact as well as the opportunity to have lessons."
Freshman,4,"Eastern Kentucky University has a variety of great programs, some of which are at the top of their rankings (such as in the state, region, or nation.) I have also made such good friends here and I am still in my first year of attending college."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the safety protocols on the campus, sometimes we have people who come through and like to make the campus feel unsafe but we have a pretty adequate safety system all around the campus."
Graduate Student,4,Overall it is a good college. If you know where to look it is easy to find good opportunities to invest in your future career as well as figure out what it is that you want to do with your life. I have had many chances to be involved and have made friends that will last a lifetime.
Freshman,4,"I'm very excited to return to EKU to finish up my freshman year of college. The experience of going here has been very fun and interesting, as there is always something happening on campus for students to participate in. The only complaint I have is the on-campus dining options, which are pretty limited."
Sophomore,4,This is probably one of the best school I have attended (I have been attended 3 different online schools). I can't recommend it enough. The only downfalls I have noticed are tuition seemed a little more than I expected (but still very affordable) and my advisor can be difficult to reach when needed. Those are the only reasons I did not give five stars.
Freshman,4,"This University is amazing, people are great, professors are good if you choose the right ones. The campus is absolutely beautiful and everything is good distance between each other. Some things i wish would change is the parking for anyone, and the job opportunities, its so hard to get a job on campus."
Sophomore,4,I like the size of EKU and its relatively  close to my home so it makes it a lot easier being away from home the majority of the year . They also have a good tutoring center that helps tremendously .
Junior,4,Many professors are willing to help students. The campus has a very family-like atmosphere. It is very easy to make friends and feel welcomed.
Sophomore,4,The people are friendly and they have a great education program. The campus is beautiful and it is easy to find your way around. There are a few professors that are not to my liking but most are. Downstairs case is a plus. I love the Chic-fil-a.
Senior,2,"I decided to attend this university because it was the cheapest option for me, but over the years they have increased tuition and cut several beloved programs in order to pay for unnecessary buildings and equipment that they don't need. For example, they tore down many historic buildings to build luxurious dorms, cafeterias, and REC centers while the Wallace Building, which houses the mathematics department, has mold and filthy, old bathrooms. The school has turned into one giant construction zone with so many obstacles and detours you must take to go to get across campus. Not to mention, the lab school has mold and old equipment despite the university announcing they would be building a new school.  Most professors have a negative attitude. This school charges so much money for unnecessary items. You have to purchase a meal plan and pay fees for campus recreation even if you live off campus as I do. Overall, I would only recommend attending this school if it is your only option."
Senior,2,"The advisers do not point on prospective certifications within the field of degree. For instance, Psychology has a criminal justice certificate, a child-rearing and counselor certificate; and  EES coursework in the criminal justice for mainframe leadership certification.

The teachers require constant supervision for grading, they all exaggerate their impeccable writing skills .

Several teachers sabbatoged the experience under stature by requiring all submitted assignments to be uploaded to another software, out of sorts. SafeAssign and the link not listed within Blackboard.
Financial aid office and TITLE IV  do not qualify for  sympathetic withdrawal into refunds--  be alert of fiscal inept.  Yield categorizing folders within school emails.  And more importantly, create an outline for success; volunteering and  blogs for vitae. Have the degree works impromptu.
Take the long way in the degree desiring, be your own profession."
Sophomore,2,"Eastern Kentucky University is not too bad of a place to attend for classes. All the classes are close together, the meal plans and flex makes sure you're fed, there are plenty of organizations to join, and there are plenty of places around the area for coffee. I would like to see the college focus more on academics and putting the money where it belongs as well as making the university more affordable and more successful for students."
College Freshman,2,EKU does not really have very much school spirit when it comes to athletics.
College Freshman,2,They think they're the best of the best
College Sophomore,2,Hosing it awful to deal with and keeps getting higher in price
College Freshman,2,"There are two nice dormitory/ apartment style living on campus avialable to upperclass men.  The older, dated dorms are old and cramped"
College Freshman,2,"There are not houses, only two dorm towers (one for fraternities and one for sororities). They pretty much go unnoticed, not even their parties are a big deal because everyone throws parties. Unless you're involved in Greek life, nobody really cares about them."
College Sophomore,2,"It's close enough to home that I can commute to save money, but if I had known that my room mate here would try to commit suicide then the second would be abusive, I would never have chosen EKU. Also the dorms are super gross. They had bed bugs, cockroaches, and everything was pretty much broken."
College Freshman,2,I would much rather be allowed to have someone over anytime during the week and they be able to stay. We're choosing our career dor the rest of our lives but we're not allowed to have someone stay with us during the week. Dorm rooms getting lonely sometimes. Other than that most people are rather easy going.
College Senior,2,Not alot of scholarships for minorities to choose from
College Sophomore,2,"We have one main dining building, with an upstairs and downstairs section. The upstairs is a cafeteria set-up. The food is cheaply made, low quality choices. The downstairs section has 5 fast food options, they are slow paced and extremely overpriced and under-stocked."
College Sophomore,2,"Demanding, extremely competative, hard to get into, top in the country"
College Sophomore,2,"Professors: lazy, not eager to help, no interest in collaboration

Curriculum: very contradictory, much too strict

Workload: difficult"
College Sophomore,2,"Living on campus is a struggle. There s only one dorm situated in the center of campus. The rooms in the dorms are not good sized, and social cleanliness is a ongoing issue."
College Sophomore,2,"Currently I am an OT major, however due to the extreme conditions to get accepted into the program, I will be changing my major. To even be considered into the OT program at EKU, you must have a minimum of a 3.5 cumulative GPA."
College Freshman,2,"The food that is offered is usually meat with few vegetarian options, If you want something healthy you have the option of a salad or fruit. Everything is usually frozen and for the poor quality the food should not cost so much."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life here is only about drinking and parties. I am not involved, nor do I want to be."
College Senior,2,"I'm honestly not sure about this because i own a car that i use to get to and from campus. There is a shuttle that runs daily on campus to take students where they need to go, but it is on campus only!"
College Sophomore,2,"Kentucky weather is like a woman in PMS, trust me, I know from experience. Random weather changes, random storms, an alert system that tells us there's a Thunderstorm Warning DURING a thunderstorm. It's an adventure, always."
College Sophomore,2,"While I personally have had no interaction with drugs, I know it's a problem when I overhear a girl in the bathroom talking a meth dealer on Powell Corner every Friday night."
College Junior,2,Have to be in a fraternity or sorority
College Sophomore,2,Often difficult to find parking so you must get there early. Permit price has doubled and availabilty decreased. 
College Freshman,2,The food choices in Richmond are not very beneficial.
College Junior,2,I am from Iowa so they don't know how to handle winter weather here.
College Freshman,2,I don't really pay attention to athletic stuff but many people participate in the activities.
College Freshman,2,"There are many parties on campus any night of the week, its just one of those things that you need to know about. The University throws really good parties too."
College Freshman,2,Eastern has one of the best nursing programs there is. The program has high standards set and goes by ranks. The only tip that I have for admission is to maintain high grades and do what you are expected.
College Senior,2,the only time i have felt unsafe is at night 
College Senior,2,MAinly it seems like the freshmen at our school are the ones th at get in trouble for alcohol the most.
College Senior,2,"The athletics are just ""okay"""
College Senior,2,"There are no good options besides the subway which was just built. The quality of the food is not that good, and also the service is not great as well. "
College Senior,2,"Eastern Kentucky is not very up-to-date as other campuses. It also not very convenient for a college student; Richmond, Kentucky could definitely use some expansion. "
College Senior,2,Rooms and showers are very very small. Fun to have friends close though.
College Junior,2,"I am a vegan. There are pretty much only 2 restaurants I go to-- Khin's sushi and Casa Fiesta.

On campus, the food is pretty bad although we do have several options including a cafeteria and food court, two coffe places."
College Junior,2,Their are lots of parking spots but its not always easy to find one. I live on campus and got really lucky that my dorm I right across form the building where most of my classes are. I always walk to classes I don't like driving even if it is a ten minute walk in the snow. Most of the time parking is always in front of your dorm building.
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is basically joining a club where you pay them to be your friends. You pay a lot of money throughout the year for friendships, invites, and activities. Often, they don't make a difference much."
College Senior,2,"The alcohol and drug scene at Eastern Kentucky is sever. Although, I am a 22 year old student I only see drugs and alcohol used more along my journey through high school and college. I dont use drugs or smoke, though I do drink on occasion. I see drugs being used regularly, but little to no peer pressure."
College Junior,2,"It is hard to get a parking spot at times, I arrive early to class however I don't want to leave and come back knowing it is hard to get a parking spot."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms are not big enough.  It is so crowded you can barely move.  The  housing process went smoothly and I got the dorm I wanted. I also got theroommate I wanted. The amenities were good.  I had what I needed that was provided. I don't like the cost, especially when it keeps going up"
College Senior,2,Mostly bars.  There really isn't a lot of hang-out spots that stay open late.
College Sophomore,2,"Richmond is known to be a big party town so, unless you are a ""partier"", I don't feel like there is too much to do around campus. There are plenty places to eat though. There is some shopping places but, there could be a lot more development in Richmond."
College Freshman,2,The dorm halls for freshman are very nasty and unclean.
College Freshman,2,Personally I have never felt in danger here at Eastern. Although the school is swarming with STD's and that disgusts me.
College Junior,2,financial is a somewhat non friendly experience look on the internet for schalorships there are tons out there
College Senior,2,Football is the most supported sport on campus. Fan support for other sports is not very high though Eastern does have some very good sports teams. IM basketball and Flag Football are pretty popular on campus. The Rec Center is top of the line.
College Freshman,2,Im going into Occupational Therapy and The classes just to get accepted to the Occupational science program are hard. After that you have to take 2 more years of classes and your not even sure youre going to get accepted into the OT program
College Sophomore,2,"Richmond had a variety of apartments to choose from but you would seriously need to have a car to live at them unless you get lucky to get one directly off campus. Also, many are expensive and you would need a roommate to may it cheaper. Fortunately, they are building apartments right on campus!"
College Sophomore,2,"Several options in the food court, but everything but Subway has really high prices. I eat a mostly vegan diet, so I pretty much never eat on campus anymore. The cafeteria is the fresh food company, so it's all you can eat and there are several options. Has a bit of a sketchy reputation for giving you ""Powell gut."" (Powell is the name of the building it's in). They put too many onions in everything. A lot of times they put food up early so if you don't get there in time, you only have a couple of options (and I'm a picky eater). The vegetarian station has slim pickings."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking lots are inconveniently located, its hard to get very close to your classes so there is a lot of walking involved. It is also sometimes hard to find a parking space, the parking lots are usually very full or packed. Parking passes are expensive considering that you have to fight everyday to find a parking slot. My advice is to get there 30 min early so you have time to find parking and walk to class."
College Senior,2,THE RARE TIMES I GO TO CAMPUS THE PARKING IS RIDICULOUS
College Junior,2,"From my experience at other schools i have found that like most colleges EKU doesn't offer nearly enough scholarships. The few they do offer is not available for middle class students. Most are only offered to low income students, but college is expensive and we could all use a little help!"
College Junior,2,"There are a lot of whites, but there's also a lot of blacks and Middle eastern people. That seems to make up most of the population, I think I've maybe know of or seen 10 at the most Hispanic and Asian people! There's a lot of ignorant people from every race as well, you can't escape that!"
College Sophomore,2,the truth is that the university is a suitcase college and being from miami florida im used to being around a lot of different people all the time and always having something to do. here at eastern the campus is always dead with very little to do because majority of the students live within 10 miles of campus so by the time thursday comes around about 70% of the campus is gone home until sunday night and the nightlife in richmond is also boring you will always have to make a 30 minute drive to lexington to actually have fun with the university of kentucky students.
College Junior,2,"Campus Shuttles and Around Town Shuttles – There are campus shuttles that will take you to different places around town, there are also very cheap shuttles that transport you around town. If not there are always cabs that are also cheap."
College Senior,2,"Very Small & Country – This is a very small country town located in Kentucky. There is some racism but you'll get used to it. You have to be there for a while to figure out the different activities available off campus. There are a lot of bars downtown and too many elementary schools close to campus. It is close to Lexington where University of Kentucky is, so alot of students travel back and forth there."
College Junior,2,"Dorms Need Lots of Upgrades – The housing is very convenient, close to everything on campus.  But they are old.  They are very small and extremely basic compared to other schools."
College Student,2,"Few Parking Spaces – The school doesnt offer enough parking spaces for students; therefore, students have to travel long distances to class.  This can be scary for women at night or early in the morning."
College Sophomore,2,"Some of the programs you apply for are very hard to get in to and you can only apply once a year, not once a semester."
College Junior,2,Not Existent – there aren't really parties that go on because we are a dry campus you have to go off to do those things.
Sophomore,1,"There are some good things about the school like the options for majors, that’s about it. All they care about is money and if you have an issue, everyone goes MIA with helping and you can’t get in touch with anyone. I highly recommend not going to this school."
Junior,1,"If you have other options, do not come here unless you just want to party. The coursework is laughable, and most of the students don't care. I don't know how this University is accredited. My community college was light years ahead of this school."
Niche User,1,"Eastern was a very large school with a large ratio of student to teacher. Coming from a small town and an even smaller high school, eastern was not for me. "
College Freshman,1,I come from a lot small school where I had the best of everything and then come here and pay a lot more and don't get no where near I get at my last school.
College Freshman,1,It's a joke. I've been to other bigger university's and they have a lot better values and actually trying to make a difference in there community. But here it's just a social scene where people get together to party but the parties are small. They to need to host parties or concerts. For people to pay and go towards a charity or something.
College Senior,1,"I am 32 and have a five year old son, i do not party"
College Freshman,1,Definitely not worth the cost of staying in dorms.
College Sophomore,1,I haven't recieved any financial aid. According to the federal government I made too much money last year so I should be able to pay for school myself.
College Sophomore,1,"Eastern Kentucky University's financial aid office is a pain to deal with. They offer meager amounts of financial aid. They are continuously transferring your calls, and don't attempt to offer help."
College Freshman,1,There are not very many options to choose from.
College Freshman,1,There are several things that they need to get a grip on.
College Senior,1,"the residential parking spots are very scarce, you would have to leave your car parked all week to keep a decent parking sopt. The commuter parking lot is kind of far depending on where you are located on campus, and the spots are always not that good. "
College Senior,1,"The city is boring, nothing to make you feel like its your hometown at all. "
College Senior,1,"I don't feel like some of the professors enjoy their job. Some are not really proactive with their students. The programs that mean the most to this campus are nursing criminal justice and business, all others get overlooked at times. "
College Senior,1,Not all greeks live in the greek towers; the NPHC greeks are not living in the dorms like the other organizations 
College Senior,1,There are no clubs in richmond anymore due to them going out of business. 
College Senior,1,"I feel as if my experience is not what i was expecting coming from high school. I have participated in some clubs in my 3.5 years that i have been here, and i still do not feel the experience that i hoped for as a senior in high school. Now it is really to the point where i'm just going to school and getting my education with no social life around campus at all. "
College Senior,1,"The weather is actually not that bad; it goes by the season change, either it is really hot, rainy, really cold, or steady."
College Sophomore,1,The wind and hills are tiresome and cold weather here can become unbearable. it seems like very little buildings have their heating and cooling under control.
College Sophomore,1,"Unless you like to eat different variations of grilled cheese everyday, then the main cafeteria sucks. The only time there is good food is when they do tours."
College Freshman,1,"I would say that Eastern has mostly white, southern baptist, heterosexual individuals. You can find others but its not as diverse as many other colleges."
College Freshman,1,I would say that if you're looking for a college with gay pride don't go to EKU
College Freshman,1,The parking is horrible here because there is not enough parking for on campus students. And yes a car is needed on campus because there isnt much to do in Richmond and there are alot of off campus job opportunities. Eastern Kentucky need to invest in more parking opportunities.
College Senior,1,Parking is horrible. Students get tons of parking tickets each year because of the lack of parking available.
College Sophomore,1,I am in a fraternity here at EKU. The college does nothing for us ever. We cant have houses and they are about to take away our greek dorms which didnt have heat or warm water till mid november.
College Sophomore,1,There is nothing to do in Richmond and the city hates college kids. School spirit is pathetic. I am a sophomore and I have never even seen the football field cuz no one goes to the FREE games. Construction has forced me to park a ridiculous distance away from my dorm that i dont even want to live in but have to because they make you till your junior year. That being said my dorm did not have worm water or heat till mid november. On weekends the campus is a COMPLETE ghost town because everybody goes home. I honestly am blown away that someone would give EKU a good grade on here. If you can survive food poising and are able to avoid getting shanked in the dim lighted parking lots by the hoodlums that pollute the school you might be able to find something positive about this place. I really wish I would have gone somewhere else and i wouldn't recommend this school to anyone.
College Sophomore,1,"The fact they are building newer dorms, they need to build more parking lots. Some students have to park very far away from their dorm. At night, is the worse when it comes to parking. You have to be cautious while walking and parking because of strangers."
College Sophomore,1,I am not a part of Greek life for two reasons: I don't have the money and it has a bad reputation at this school. Mostly known as partyers although there are some service fraternities and such on campus you can look into.
College Sophomore,1,"This year they changed things, and it's almost impossible to find a space close to some dorms like Case. I will want to live in an apartment because of this."
College Junior,1,EKU is a WELL known party school. Probably more than half go there for that reason alone.
College Junior,1,I didn't have a very good experience with this at all. I was told I was sent emails telling me I had to send in additional information re-guarding my FAFSA. It turns out I didn't receive any emails about it what so ever.
College Senior,1,"For Being a Dry Campus, It Is Very Much Wet. for Having the ""Best Criminal Justice Program"", There Is Too Much Leniency in Student Repercussions. Parties with alcohol are common, and drugs are everywhere. I know this from personallly witnessing it, without even being a part of it."
College Sophomore,1,"Could Be More Helpful – Both my parents work in a factor and I get no help because ""they make too much money."""
College Freshman,1,"Underage drinking and partying in general are rampant here--the worst part is that this overwhelming problem remains completely ignored by housing authorities. The drug scene doesn't seem to be a problem, though."
College Junior,1,"You can have tornado one day, snow the next day and sun for the last day."
College Junior,1,"I am a transfer student and I am honestly somewhat shocked by the lack of dining options at EKU. Not only is there a very limited option of places, but, more problematic, the hours are atrocious. On Saturdays at lunch time the ONLY place to get something to eat is the cafeteria. Which won't let you carry out food (they don't even have to-go containers). There aren't even any vending machines that are accessible from the library. Not a pro studying school, I guess."
College Freshman,1,I only received a 100 dollar grant from EKU. There are not many scholarships and the ones they have are very had to get. I applied for them but did not receive anything for the ones I was eligible.
College Sophomore,1,"We did really great at football this season and last year we were great at basketball, but students hardly ever go to the games even though they are free for students. EKU lacks school spirit."
College Freshman,1,I was jumped by four people. I no longer want to be on Eastern Kenucky's campus. I do not feel safe here and the staff and other adults here have not tried to help me feel safe in any way at all. I feel like I am not a student here at all the way I have been treated.
College Sophomore,1,Greeks: They're Everywhere. I'm not paying to get into a frat that party's all the time. Greek life takes over 75% of campus. People seem to forget that they don't need a Greek life to have fun at college.
College Sophomore,1,The faculty and non-residents have more parking spots than people who live on campus. We have to circle around for half an hour hoping for someone to leave their parking spot.
College Senior,1,"There is enough parking at EKU or else I would have given this an F.  The campus parking near buildings is very limited to students.  This is particularly difficult for non-traditional graduate students that spend little time on campus and often need to park close to a building at odd times to simply speak with a professor or attend a short meeting.  For example, using the library in person is rarely done by me because I have to park so far from the facility to use it."
College Senior,1,"There has been changes in the way of handicap parking. There are times when construction workers or other students will park in handicap zones. Thus leaving us with special needs having to find whatever we can to park. I cannot walk very far due to injuries from being in Operation Iraqi Freedom. I had to park as close as I could to my class building, when the HC spots were taken up by illegal parking. I got a ticket for parking where I did, even after I reported the illegal parking of those taking up the spaces I needed. I was informed by a police representative that EKU has more HC parking than required by ADA. Okay thats fine, however, what does that have to do with those who fail to obey the parking violations in HC parking? I say tow their vehicle and fine them maybe they will think twice next time."
College Senior,1,"I will be critical of this issue from what I have been witness to. Thank god I do live 40 miles away. I have my own house with my family. I  have been invited to a few off campus apartments for study groups or to talk with other sports related students. The way some of these kids live, I am ashamed and worried about the leadership of tomorrow. In most of them it is nothing more than a drink fest or which person wants to get drunk enough and do things they would never do sober. Landlords do not care as long as they get their rent on time. I decided almost two years ago, any study groups or just to get together will be done in a public forum. Let alone I will have my degree in three years, I cannot wait for May to graduate and get away from that atmosphere. If I were a parent of some of these kids, they would be digging my boot out of someones backside."
College Senior,1,Tailgaiting for football games and Rugby games are really fun to do. But the atheletics here just are not very good.
College Freshman,1,"Not Enough – There aren't hardly any places to park, and the only place with usually open spots is the Lancaster Lot which is really big and takes forever to walk to your car. It's very inconvenient. They always ticket a car that's not in the right place. There definitely needs to be better parking initiated."
College Junior,1,"The cost to share the very cheapest dorm with a roommate which is much smaller than a one bedroom apartment is the exact price of a one bedroom apartment off-campus. That is absolutely ridiculous. The dorms are generally highly neglected and the campus housing staff is very callous and uncaring. In our previous dorm, we had scalding hot showers that actually hurt people. Students took pictures of their first-degree burns and showed the housing staff that simply shrugged it off. The issue has been one for years. Apparently the dorm is very old and the pipes were run wrong. They just refuse to spend money to fix them. However, they can spend who-knows-how-much on the Noel Center which is completely and utterly useless. It's great for students to receive experience using the SmartBoards and whatnot, but there's no sense in a several thousand dollar ceiling fan or spiral staircase when tuition is at an all-time high and basic quality-of-living issues are at hand."
College Junior,1,The best computers are in strange computer labs that no one uses/that close very early.
College Freshman,1,"The parking situation is atrocious. There aren't enough spots to accommodate everyone. People are given tickets for parking in the wrong lot, even if they are there for five minutes while they run to their room to get ready for work."
College Junior,1,"The school is not commuter friendly, and some of the instructors are not as understanding as they should be when we have the weather like we have been having."
College Junior,1,Printing Allowance – Do not give enough allowance for copying during the semester.
College Sophomore,1,"It snows mostly in the spring semesters.  However, it is a huge issue because they often do 2 hour delays which is great if you live on campus and all you do is go to school.  However, if you have to go to work right after class the 2 hour delay will make you late for work"
College Sophomore,1,Snow and Ice – They need to cancel classes more often. The roads can be very dangerous and they may only do a 2 hour delay.
College Sophomore,1,"Punishment Is Moderate – An individual caught, for example, for underage drinking will be arrested and have their name put into the university's paper for everyone to see. There's more public humiliation rather than actual punishment."
College Junior,1,There is not enough available parking close to the dorm rooms.
College Student,1,Nothing to Say – I hate this school with a passion.  I absolutely hate it.  They only good thing about it is that I have made some good friends.  The academic programs are terrible.
College Student,1,"Used to Be Good – The best bar in town was torn down to make room for office buildings for the city.  The downtown life has dropped dramatically every year since the 1980s.  There are very few organized parties anymore because the police bust them up and give AIs and PUs.  The police are just doing their job I guess, but they bust up every party and people get in trouble so noone wants to have a party anymore.  Also, if you do go to a party, you can count on the cops showing up."
College Student,1,"I Hate This Place – There are major safety issues on campus that need to be addressed.  Also, there is major discrimination and foul play that most people are not aware of.  I have have worked on-campus and have had friends that have worked on campus that have told me so many horrible corrupt things that go on up there.  Also, I was blackballed from one of the fraternities I rushed because of my sexual orientation.  I joined another fraternity and apparently they didn't know I was gay until after initiation and all hell broke loose and so I was told to quit that one as well.  I also hate the organizations on campus.  They are designed to help students, but most are set up improperly and meet at times that many students are not available.  Also, having lived on campus before, it is impossible to study in the dorms because of the noise.  Also, many people are written up for noise complaints and other issues that were not their fault."
College Sophomore,1,"Drugs are a major problem at this school. No one seems to want to enforce it at least that's how it appears. Alcohol is usually seen at off campus parties, however marijuana is everywhere. It has a distinct smell and when you get on the elevators next to someone you can smell it on them. Students smoke cigarettes in their dorm rooms and when other students make complaints no one does anything about it."
College Sophomore,1,Greek students think they are cool and everyone wants to be like them. The real outlook is that they are dumb and barely make the grades to stay in school while at the same time throwing parties and getting drunk. EKU gives them benefits like being able to do things ahead of non-greek students which is unfair for them being so idiotic. They always allow other greek students to cut lines with them or crowd around busy intersections where people need to get by. Overall they should be dismantled and kicked out.

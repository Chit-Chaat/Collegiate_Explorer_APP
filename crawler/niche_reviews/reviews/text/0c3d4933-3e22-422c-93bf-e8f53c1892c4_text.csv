Alum,5,Houghton is a great Christian college. They uphold Christian values. The education is amazing. They are a tough school when it comes to academics which pushes students to strive to do their best. I loved it there.
Alum,5,"Professors will really want to know you and care about you. They care for you and you are not just a number to them, you are a individual."
Alum,5,Great Christian community that has a strong science department with great peers and friends to help you out spiritually or academically. The community is great and the support you will receive is lifelong. It has truly shaped me and will help me grow in the future.
Alum,5,"At Houghton, your voice matters. Professors were always concerned more that you learned and understood than with covering every inch of the material. It was more important to them that you developed critical thinking skills and evolved your understanding of a topic than to bombard you with a boatload of information. In nearly every situation, questions were highly encouraged and a professor wouldn't hesitate to throw away the plan to focus on a question the class didn't understand, helping guide us to a point of understanding. I can truly say that I left there as friends with many of the professors. The campus culture is no slack either. There's a lot of hype for the different clubs and organizations, and a lot of encouragement to get involved wherever you can. As a Christian school, we don't have the traditional idea of a ""party scene,"" so if that's important to you, this isn't the place for you."
Alum,5,"At the end of this semester, all the students had to move to online classes. While it wasn't the most fun transition, it was well-done, with may professors taking the time to suitably adjust their classes to fit the online format, and were very flexible with editing the class schedule if need be. Professors were very open to helping wherever they could to make sure we got the most out of our online experience."
Niche User,5,"Houghton College is like no other. Everyone is so friendly, the environment is lively, and overall its a great experience."
Alum,5,"Loved my time at Houghton. I transferred mid-junior year, and was delighted by the relevant skills that my professors focused on teaching me and the personal interest they showed me. Something I had missed at my prior institution. The location is something that you either love or hate, but I personally was a fan. You truly are only 30-40 minutes from more populated areas, which isn't much different of a commute that I regularly would experience due to traffic at home."
Niche User,5,"I liked that the students at the college would stop me in the hallway or lunch room and ask if I was new or visiting. By them taking the time out of their day made me feel welcome. I was also there for soccer and track and field meetings and the staff I interacted with was exceptional. I guess I was expecting that typical high school dirt-bag, who only cared about the teams recored. That was the exact opposite of what the coaches and staff were like. they were respectful as well as they held their team members to a very high standard on and of the field. The only thing that this college has going against it the coast of attendants. love the school as well as the people in charge of it. I really hope I will be able to cover the coast of attendants."
Freshman,5,"So far, I have loved my experience at Houghton, and I would encourage anyone who is thinking about coming here to pay the college a visit if you haven’t already, because you won’t regret it. The professors are excellent, and they show genuine concern for any student who is ill and can’t make it to class. The professors are also engaging, and they make you excited to attend class every day.
  The one subpar thing about this college is the dining hall food-several times it has been overcooked, but the good thing about that with a salad bar, make your own stir-fry and make your own omelette station, along with often a deli station, as well as a coffee shop (serves wraps and other snack-type items), a burger restaurant and a Mexican restaurant in the basement of the Campus Center, you won’t go hungry."
Niche User,5,"I have taken tours, auditioned, played with the band twice, attended Music weekend and Acceptance weekend. The food is excellent and the classes are taught by the professors. They are interested in what my goals are. Out of the other colleges that I attended they are prompt with getting back to me about how to buy the books and what people to talk to about lesson fees."
Freshman,5,"Houghton is an absolutely amazing college. The study abroad honors program in London is incredible. The people are kind and considerate. The professors truly care. If you want to party everyday or get easy classes, then this is not the school for you. It's an intellectually engaging school that I know God has led me to, and I'm glad."
Senior,5,"Attending Houghton College was the best decision of my life. I have had the chance to study exactly what I want and in the capacity that I want it. I have been able to discovery my personal passions through different educational opportunities and set challenging, yet achievable goals for myself. Houghton's faculty is so personable. Each professor truly cares about you as an individual and wants to see you succeed. Professors will go out of their way to help you understand any information you need clarified and take interest in your personal life outside of college as well. The academics are rigorous but its because Houghton wants to challenge its students to be the absolute bet that they can be inside and outside of Houghton."
Sophomore,5,I love the small class sizes and how you can actually get to know your professors well and your professors can know you.
Freshman,5,"My experience,has been great,each time I visited. Everyone is very nice,helpful,and they make u feel good about yourself and you it feels great to fit in somewhere. And I've visited 4 times or more already. I've also met the school presidents,not often do u do that. So,for me it has been a wonderful experience."
Sophomore,5,"Being at Houghton has really changed my life. I have developed a great deal of confidence thanks to the support of professors and peers. Everyone is very welcoming, and the spiritual life is enriching."
Senior,5,Houghton is great! I love the connections I've made here and the community that they build within their students.
Senior,5,"It is constantly evident how much the professors and administration genuinely care about the students and the education they receive.  They are continuing to move towards a more hands-on approach to learning.  It is a small school, but it makes real and effective efforts to develop valuable opportunities."
Freshman,5,"I love the close community.  The professors are very accessible. There are lots of great resources with Voca, the counseling center, and library staff. 

If you are looking for a party school in a big city, Houghton is not for you.  If you are looking for a small Christian school with a close community and strong academics, it is excellent."
Senior,5,Coming to Houghton was one of the best decisions I have ever made.  The emphasis on experiental learning has really prepared me for life after college.
Senior,5,"I have enjoyed the personal connections to professors and other students I have met at Houghton.  Due to small class size, one would expect professors to be more available to students.  Houghton professors go above and beyond in making connections to each of their students.  They regularly invite students into their homes, and they involve students in the work and research that they are doing.  One professor I know has been known to search for online deals on equipment that students need!  Houghton is a tremendous place to meet people with whom you will relate professionally and personally for years to come."
Freshman,5,"Houghton College is a great place to receive a Christian education surrounded my an extremely diverse group of students from all over the world. Houghton is a very small, but welcoming community of people, and has always been a college that is known for their love of God."
Alum,5,"Excellent, close knit Christian academic community. Fantastic DIII sports program, professors seek to be mentors and friends (no place to hide if you're lazy though!).    

Residence life is fantastic. Its a dry school, but anyone will tell you no booze is required here for a grand old time."
Senior,5,"Especially after taking two semesters abroad, I've realized how much I've learned at Houghton College and how much I miss it.  The classes are engaging and discussion-filled, the professors are deeply invested in the students and extremely caring (but also push you to do good work!), the surrounding nature is beautiful, the students are outgoing and supportive, and the local community and churches constantly reach out.  I would highly recommend!"
Senior,5,"In rural Western New York, surrounded by the beautiful Alleghany mountains and several State Parks, Houghton sits atop a hill. Houghton is a liberal arts school, which is everything the name implies. Students will be taught in a variety of pertinent subjects in a small classroom setting which encourages discussion. Philosophy, religion, art, music, science, and history are only a few of the subjects which a Houghton student can expect to engage in. Most classes range anywhere from 8 to 20 people and very often, professors and students will form friendships which last long after graduation as a result. Houghton has positively influenced who I am as a person and how I engage with the world around me."
College Freshman,5,We are rated the 7th safest school in the United States (If I remember correctly). That alone provides extreme comfort for us students and our families who send us hundreds of miles away to be educated. I walk alone in the dark often coming back from my parking spot and i've never felt unsafe before. It's a very tight and close community of students who are brought together by Christ.
College Freshman,5,"Since I was a sophomore in high school, Houghton College has been my dream school. I got here and it was more than I had ever dreamed of it to be. I've never been to a place before where I feel so welcomed with open arms and accepted for who I am, just the way that I am. Professors are constantly showing you that they care by checking in on you, praying with you, helping you inside and outside of class, and even some invite you to their houses with groups of students for dinners, movies, desserts, etc. I very much enjoy the wide variety of courses that are offered here. From Equestrian, to Biology, to the Fine Arts. We literally have it all. And I also like how my advisor is always looking out for my best interest and helping me every step of the way with course selection. I like the small classroom sizes because I feel that I get more of the one-on-one time that I need to be successful, and I like how the professors accommodate their teaching for what they believe their class needs."
College Freshman,5,"We often get alumni students who come back to our school for internships and job opportunities, but other than that, were kinda in the middle of no where. So i'm not all that aware of any internships, yet, but if we do have any i'd love to explore the opportunities."
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love my dorming experience here at Houghton. I feel like living on campus helps me get connected better and has given me opportunities that I wouldn't have been able to have if I didn't live here, such as work, and extra curricular activities that we have like ""hall brawl"", and the ""gatsby ball"". I love the community of girls we have here, we can all become so close in not only our personal relationships, but also as a community of God. I also love how to RA's here in Gillette make a point to reach out to each of us to have a personal and spiritual relationship with us all."
College Freshman,5,"My experience here at Houghton has been a very positive one thus far, everything about it continues to amaze me every day. The people are friendly, uplifting and encouraging. The professors and very interested in helping you succeed. The classes challenge you both academically and socially, but it's a good challenge. My roommate is awesome, we communicate well, and have fun while living together. The extracurricular on campus was very easy to find, and I am now involved in so much. It makes me feel like I have more than just academics as a purpose here."
College Freshman,5,We live in a very safe place
College Freshman,5,Our school is very reputible and I'm glad I'm able to attend it. It is an honour for the most part
College Freshman,5,"Our teachers and courses are pretty well done. Our new chemistry teacher is something difficult to interact and learn from as well, however he is trying and does care."
College Freshman,5,I love living on campus. There is so much love and community.
College Freshman,5,They are incredible. Our sports facilities are well kept and beautiful.
College Sophomore,5,There campus is very safe. I have never even heard of any violence happening.
College Sophomore,5,The professors are very knowledgeable and they care so much about their students succeeding.
College Freshman,5,I love my school because of the Christian atmosphere and the ease of access to professor when you need them.
College Junior,5,"My school has a community-minded view and you can really talk to the professors about any issues you're having, about the course or not.  It is very easy to make friends with the other students at the school and everyone is really nice.  The academics are tough and truly prepare us for the real world, making graduate school easy for most of the graduates."
College Freshman,5,This campus is super safe. I am a female freshman here and I feel completely safe walking around campus alone and at night.
College Freshman,5,"In the winter it's warm, in the summer it's cool. It's always kept clean!"
College Sophomore,5,Boom! Check it out. It is amazing.
College Sophomore,5,If you stay on top of everything then the academics are still challenging.
College Sophomore,5,One of the best BioChem programs I have found at a small Private Liberal Arts college.
College Sophomore,5,So many opportunities and help from career counselors.
College Sophomore,5,I wouldn't leave for another college after visiting Houghton.
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone for the most part is great looking. Although some are also known for their 'good personalities""."
College Sophomore,5,"If it's against the rules they are lenient, however if it is against the law they are very strict."
College Sophomore,5,"If you like the ability to visit large cities within an hour this is a great location, however if you also like small down diners and being in a quiet location where the student body is ample. Then Houghton is the place for you."
College Sophomore,5,"With the new Kerr-Pagula Fieldhouse and sport complex being completed the small college has the best athletic facilities in the region. About 20% of the student body is involved in varsity sports, however it being a small campus it is easy to get involved with intramural sports as well."
College Sophomore,5,As a science major the department really blew me away. As a Private College the school always takes funds to keep their facilities up to date and even some majors are considered state of the art. For being such a small college they really focus on leading their peers in specialty fields.
College Sophomore,5,"Many incoming freshmen come to college and expect 5 star living space. However, with free laundry in every dorm and a kitchen for every floor the dorms here are top notch. The bathrooms are cleaned daily and with such few students the wifi is always fast."
College Sophomore,5,I transferred from a BIG10 engineering program; the draw to Houghton was their medical research programs. As a BioChemical Major I can now be on track to get into grad school researching medical mysteries. A private Liberal Arts college seems to be able to give the students what they want and need since the school doesn't rely on public funds. The student body has more say in the classes we want offered and what classes are offered. *to an extent.
College Sophomore,5,"Houghton is a small campus in a rural area, I know that sounds boring. However, as a transfer student from a top 5 nationally ranked party school, I can tell you I prefer the nightlife on campus at Houghton. The activities and events the student body puts together are actually fun and not overly chaperoned by administration."
College Sophomore,5,"I told my admissions advisor that I filed my FASFA for the college. She responded the same day and told me that the financial aid office would contact me shortly. After, about 20 mins I received an email from my financial aid officer; we were able to discuss most questions through emails and phone calls. However, when I had my official visit my family and I sat down with her in her office. She then pulled paperwork showing values to the exact cent of how much aid I would receive and what my final bill would be. Nothing has changed since then, and getting those figures on paper before you decide to enroll really helps with your decision."
College Junior,5,"I have had so much help from the Financial Services Office. They are very knowledgable. Tips for financial aid would be to study hard in High School, to get academic scholarships!"
College Sophomore,5,"My major is new, and newly popular, so I feel right at home within my major. However, I can't speak much to its level of excellence, as I haven't yet taken many courses. But the professors are great!"
College Sophomore,5,"Our athletes compete well nationally, and though I'm not an athlete, I know our teams do well."
College Sophomore,5,"Something you'll hear from a lot of the admissions faculty or professors is an emphasis on ""community"". While we as students make light of it, it's true! The small size of the student body and ~11:1 student ratio make this community close, and I love it. The small size also means that every opportunity is open to nearly every student. It's unlikely the lead position in that club, or that job, or the last spot in that awesome class is especially competitive - not because people don't care, but because everyone can have a leadership position, with spots to spare. I have personally enjoyed participating in our renowned choir (we performed in Carnegie Hall this year), white water kayaking, our talented acapella group, both our fall and spring Saturday Night Live-esque variety shows, and so much more. I simultaneously feel academically challenged and stimulated by the social and communal opportunities."
College Freshman,5,I love the Equestrian program I am in! I learn a lot and our director is the best! I am very certain that i will be able to find a job in my chosen field after graduation.
Recent Alumnus,5,Houghton has high standards and isn't afraid to follow through on the consequences of breaking the rules.
Alum,4,The online classes I took while studying abroad in England were well organized and the Professor was good at communicating.
Works Here,4,Some teachers definitely had to get used to the online learning and the difficulties that it brought. But the professors still challenged us to get the most out of every call we had with them
Works Here,4,"A very open and welcoming college. The environment is amazing and people treat you like family. Everybody is tight with eachother and the professors truly want you to succeed. It is a small college and this does have its negative points, but overall a very warm and fun college to attend"
Junior,4,"I transferred into Houghton last year with high expectations for their writing program and I was not disappointed. I really like every professor I had (even in the classes I took outside of my major). The campus is really beautiful and scenic! However, it is also located in very remote area, if one does not have a car it is difficult to travel to even to the nearest shopping center (which is aprox 40mins away).  As a minority (African American/Native American) I would like to see more diversity on campus, there are other students of color there but they make up like 5% of the student body. The other thing I would tweak is some of the food being offered. Houghton offers good food! But not always the healthiest of options. I would like to see maybe more fish (not breaded or deep fried) and less red meat and also more healthier dessert options. The spiritual life on campus is very strong. If that is something of importance for you, as it was for me, then you should consider Houghton!"
Junior,4,"My online experience was unexpected. Due to COVID-19 all of my classes moved online, prior to that I did not have any online classes at Houghton. My experiences with my classes being moved to online was actually quiet good! My professors did an amazing job of carrying over our lesson plans and modifying our schedule accordingly. They were all still easy to reach, if necessary, and timely with turning in grades/feedback on my work."
Sophomore,4,The online experience is great. Professors are ready to respond if you email with a question or problem at anytime. The online classes require a good amount of interaction through forums.
Junior,4,I like the close-knit environment. The teachers are all very experienced and deliver a high quality of education for a reasonable price.
Sophomore,4,Houghton has a great community. There are many different majors to choose from . The class sizes are typically small so if you need some one on one time with the professors you can get it. One thing about Houghton I would like to see change would be the way that they send out the bills to the students instead of sending emails they should send emails and a letter with the whole year on it instead of a semester.
Senior,4,"Houghton has been a great place for me to get a degree. The professors here are fantastic and very personable. While there are small things that I have not liked during my time here, I would still recommend it and am glad that I chose to come here!"
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the general experience, the atmosphere (for the most part) and the facilities. Some things still need work, though. It's quite expensive, and that's really hurting it. It's also somewhat insulated and out of touch with the outside world."
Alum,4,"As a member of the Class of '67, I am stunned at how comments by members the present student body so accurately reflect my Houghton experience of 50 years ago !!!  Even the negative comments, by and large, are correct.  
     Houghton was really a superb experience for me, & prepared me very well for medical school.  If you survive the academic rigors of Houghton College, medical school will be a ""piece of cake"".
     Today I am an active supporter of the College financially, & am urging my grandchildren to attend.   My ratings below are from my 50 years ago there."
Sophomore,4,"Lovely local community. The values of the school are great and the people are kind. All my general education class were excellent. However, the science department is not the best. Their teaching techniques aren't great and it's not worth the amount of money students have to pay."
Alum,4,"It was a wonderful experience, very personal and academically challenging. The only change I would make would be more connection with local communities, more transportation/communication options with cities nearby (Buffalo, Rochester) in order to provide more students with opportunities."
Alum,4,"Houghton College is an amazing place. From the moment I stepped on the campus, I knew it was where I belonged. I made friends instantly and the professors really care about you. Houghton is a place that will encourage and challenge you in academics as well as in your spiritual life. "
College Sophomore,4,The value of the degree from this school is pretty good.  The career center/services is really helpful in helping you find an internship or possible job opportunities
College Sophomore,4,"I have had no complaints about my professors, they are all great and try to make sure that you succeed in their class if you really put the effort into it. The professors are very well knowledges in their field of studies.  The class sizes are relatively small.  The biggest classroom is in the science building."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is very safe and has a homey atmosphere.  There is a security guard at all times, during the day and evenings there is at least two.  There haven't been any crimes on campus since I have been enrolled."
College Sophomore,4,The best about campus housing is that it is close to the college.  The social atmosphere is calm and quiet but friendly.  People leave their doors open so someone could come in and visit.  The housing application went smoothly and the school really tries to pair you up with someone that you can room with.
College Sophomore,4,I love the Christian atmosphere to the school.  Everyone is friendly and you don't have the sense of cliques.  My favorite experience with my school would be the stress fair.  Everything was free and there were massages that people could sign up for and the school brought in Bernese Mountain puppies that you could hold.
College Freshman,4,I've never been one to be involved in a lot of sports but with the time I've been here at Houghton i've found that it has been very fun and stress relieving to join the intramural teams here on campus. Our field house is new within the past few years and is top-notch. A woman who was in the olympics travels an hour to get to our field house every week because she swears it's the best she's been to.
College Freshman,4,Our school is amazing. The financial department is a tough struggle. There is a shadow in there.
College Sophomore,4,"The Voca center is there to help students find jobs, internships, and so on."
College Sophomore,4,The cafeteria is not open long enough. It is only open until 7pm and it needs to be open later for the amount of money you pay for it.
College Sophomore,4,The athletics are very good. I am a varsity athlete and love being apart of a team that strives to honor God and succeed in the classroom and on the field.
College Sophomore,4,I really love the school and the professors and coaches are awesome! I just wish tuition was less because it is hard to attend there because of the high cost.
College Junior,4,"The career prospects at Houghton really depend on the degree program and the amount of networking you're able to do while here.  The more networking you can do the better, but the career center along with academic advisers are always willing to help."
College Junior,4,"Almost everyone on campus really cares about the physical, mental, and spiritual well-being of others, and that definitely shows in and out of the classrooms."
College Junior,4,"I enjoy the dorm I live in, but each dorm definitely has a stereotyped personality."
College Junior,4,"While I have not made much use of the athletic facilities or participated in athletics, I have heard very good things from friends and other students on campus."
College Junior,4,"I've found that Houghton College is a great fit for me.  My professors have always been very helpful with academics and also my personal life when I need advice.  One thing that prospective students should consider is the denomination and political stance of the college.  I have a fairly conservative leaning, while I would consider the Wesleyan Church, along with Houghton, a bit more liberal in certain areas.  Fortunately there are students on campus with a wide variety of political and religious leanings, making the campus very diverse in that area.

Overall I'm extremely happy that I chose Houghton College because the degree program is perfect for me, and the campus and surrounding area is truly a community."
College Sophomore,4,"It's great... Some minor issues, but that can be fixed with more students."
College Sophomore,4,Great for certain fields... Average for others.
College Sophomore,4,A little bit too good...
College Sophomore,4,"There are a few shortcomings, mostly due to low attendance, but overall it's wonderful. The student body and faculty are to die for and are committed to each other."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the community of this college. We are challenged in our academics, grow in our faith, and build relationships to do awesome things in life."
College Freshman,4,The professors are always there to help out if you need it. Don't be afraid to ask.
College Freshman,4,Houghton has a lot of events and traditions.
College Freshman,4,"The community is a big thing here. You can't go to a Houghton event without hearing ""Community."""
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of opportunities for students to work on campus.
College Freshman,4,"I love it here. The professors are great, the courses are great, everything is great."
College Freshman,4,"We have a lot of opportunities for sports and the athletic facilities prove it. We just got a new athletic complex, and it is huge!"
College Freshman,4,"I love the dorms, they are close to the main buildings, not a long walk."
College Freshman,4,"Most of the dorms are nice. There are two female dorms and two male dorms, but no co-ed dorm. The atmosphere is fantastic here. Most people are open to meeting new students. Houghton is about 30 minutes from any type of civilization, but it does have its own charm."
College Junior,4,"After visiting several colleges, I have found Houghton's food selection to be one of the best. They have a lot of variety, open dining space, and various meal plan options. The one thing I would improve upon is the cost of meals, as they are very expensive."
College Junior,4,"The campus has many different housing options and most are very affordable. They do a good job of matching roommates for the freshman class and are successful with the housing/lottery system for upperclassmen. There are kitchens on each floor of the women's residences, as well as lounge and study space."
College Senior,4,"Students shouldn't be into drugs and alcohol, so I'm glad that Houghton has a strict policy against these things."
College Sophomore,4,The college likes 'free minds'
College Sophomore,4,It is reasonably priced with plenty of room for activities.
College Junior,4,"It is a small school, so there aren't many options. However, the options available are very nice"
College Junior,4,The campus feels very safe.
College Sophomore,4,"Houghton really excels right now in music, business, the sciences, and communications, as well as others I'm not aware of, I'm sure. I appreciate Houghton's dedication to give a holistic (liberal arts, integrative studies) education to students of all majors."
College Sophomore,4,Strictness of administration never feels to me like it's getting in the way - I always feel safer or more comfortable because of it. I do know some people are frustrated with open hours (the times each evening when guys and girls are allowed to visit each other's residence halls) but they can always just hang out in more public spaces.
College Sophomore,4,"Off campus food within walking distance is definitely limited, but great food is just a short drive away in any of the nearby towns. Ace's is the best!"
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus, since its so small. And I haven't been to the health center much yet though."
College Freshman,4,"This campus is strict about underage drinking and other illegal activities, but I love it!"
College Freshman,4,For the Equestrian major it was very easy to get in to.
College Freshman,4,"The process was only slightly complicated because I transferred, but the bump was not Houghton's fault. And the amount of scholarships I received help out a lot!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"I love the weather in Houghton, because I grew up in NY and am used to cold, snowy winters. If you love this type of weather, you will love Houghton."
Recent Alumnus,4,"You have to qualify for a CLO (Community Living Option), and only a few seniors qualify every year. My senior year I lived in the Cole House, and it was a great experience. Great landlord, practically on campus."
College Junior,4,"Since it is a religious school, most everyone has the same religion, but for everything else people are really accepting of everyone and willing to embrace the differences of people and be friendly with one another.  When you just even take a walk on campus people will be walking by and say hi and just start in a small conversation.  People are always willing to just be friendly with one another no matter what."
Niche User,2,The campus is very small and the staff and most of the students when I visited were not very welcoming.
Alum,2,"My decision to go to Houghton seems to have cost me the fulfilling ""right of passage"" experience that typical American college can be. Houghton College is for students raised within Evangelical Christian Culture. If you are not in that demographic I strongly suggest you look elsewhere. If you plan to study in Western New York Ithaca, Binghamton, Geneseo, (and numerous schools in both Rochester and Buffalo) would offer the average student a much better experience."
College Freshman,2,"There's only a Chinese restaurant, a pizza place, and Subway. Also, for the first and last month of school there is an ice cream parlor."
College Senior,2,"I understand that Houghton is a ""Christian college,"" but they shouldn't be able to force students who are not Christian to participate in religious courses or activities."
College Senior,2,The college is in the middle of nowhere - there's little to nothing to do around here unless you want to drive out to another town/city.
College Junior,2,There are not many off campus housing options available.
College Junior,2,"Are Athletic teams are terrible, except for women's soccer."
College Freshman,2,the college is pretty strict our required to have i believe what is 57 chapels at the end of the semester so you have to go 3 times a week. if you fail they make you do summarizes and every one you missed out on. they are VERY strict about girls in the dorms that is not allowed only on certain days.
College Sophomore,2,"We only have one dining hall and the food is not bad.  There are around three main entrees per meal plus a sandwich, salad, and stir-fry bar.  We have great selection in ice cream though.  We have a coffee shop and a diner in the downstairs of our campus center but really that is it as far as dining options go.  The diner offers typical diner food (i.e. burgers, fries, wings) and there is a Sandella's attached that offers salads, flatbread sandwiches/pizzas, and wraps."
College Sophomore,2,"Houghton is literally in the middle of nowhere.  It is forty minutes from even a Walmart.  There are a few state parks nearby that are gorgeous, so if recreation and scenery are more important than nightlife and shopping then Houghton is definitely the place to be.  We make our own fun, and it is a very safe town to live in."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not much to do at night, but there are plenty of actvities and clubs offered on campus for daytime. There is a popular Sunday night prayer and worship gathering called Koinonia, as well as Mercy Seat which is Mon-Fri."
College Freshman,2,"Being a religious college, Houghton College is a little bit conservative. There are only a handful of of different races with i'd say about 95 percent being white. this however in my opinion is only portrayed by the number that apply and the cost of coming to the institution. However Houghton is very accepting and friendly to everyone here."
College Sophomore,2,"We really only have a few places to eat and don't get any discounts, we just have the all-access meal plan and then $100 for Big Al's, the only other place to eat at the campus."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not a whole lot of off-campus housing available lose to campus, but there are townhouses and flats which are really nice for upperclassmen."
College Junior,2,"They charge an arm and a leg to park near your dorm ($180) so most often students park in the ""fire hall"" parking lot which is a 5 minute walk (not far by some standards but far enough for the price!)"
College Sophomore,2,"The Precious Few – The majority of the students here are white, somewhere hovering around middle class, and go to church. However, those that do not fit into that description do have friends. It is a small school, and people group in unlikely circles. It is natural to hang out with people that appear to be like ourselves, yet it is not the overwhelming rule. We all mix together whether or not we agree with certain peoples' ideologies. That being said and being on a majorly Christian campus, there is a small circle of ""holier-than-thou""s. They tend to have few friends."
College Junior,2,"Conditions of Houghton College off-campus housing and lack there of such housing options leave the college housing program with a lot to be desired.

Having off campus housing at the college would be nice, given there are no married housing options even though there are many married and engaged couples on the campus.  The furthest option from main campus, ""The Flats"", just recently closed completely.

Community Living Opportunities outside of the residential halls, appartments/townhouses are still considered 'on-campus-housing-options'.

There is a hotel on campus, but then again this is not a feasible option for an alternative to the single gender housing at houghton campus such as the CLOs, residential halls & townhouses."
College Freshman,2,Long Winters – Western New York usually has long winters with not much sun and this can affect you if you are at school. You need to get out and do winter sports in order to get through the winter.
College Freshman,2,There is a decent diversity in ethnicity and there isnt much religious diversity though that cant be expected at a Wesleyan College
College Sophomore,2,"70/30, What's More to Say? The girl/guy ration is 70/30, great for guys, not so good for the girls. However, the quality of the people in general is excellent."
Niche User,1,"strict, unauthentic, hypocritical student body and town. beware and watch out for yourself. This is not a great school and if you want to transfer, your credits wont be recognized by other schools."
Junior,1,"website is lying, the school is way down in the competition to the point of being crippling. The vast majority of people are only able to find employment in Buffalo for about 30,000 a year or down near Philly. This is the lie that makes most people really hate the college. Really, most employers don't want Houghton at all. Most think lack of resources and outdated teaching is to blame. 
The college is in bad shape and will lie to get what they need. I am now transferring. The Food makes everyone REALLY sick. 
      Safe? Christian school? Slight drug use, nobody sees. The students abuse each other constantly with ganging up in packs on one poor kid. As long as its after 5pm, they never care. The Professors are highly staunch and don't like non book types. There is no relaxing or fun of any kind allowed here. The scholarship kids get treated badly. I advise reviews on other sites by past employees and students before attending. Staunch, unfriendly.  wish I could write more."
Sophomore,1,"College administration is very shady, while the faculty are amazing people I feel like you don't get your moneys worth out of going to Houghton and it is A LOT of money to go there. Not many parties unless you drive somewhere else, but that's okay if you're more focused on academics. However the atmosphere there is stifling. Some people love it, as did I for the first year but it got very oppressive later on. Lot's of sketchy things going on behind the scenes that worries me for people's safety."
College Senior,1,I hate the dining hall. They pretended to care about my concerns and didn't keep their promises. There are seriously not enough vegetarian/vegan options on campus.
College Senior,1,There's barely anything to choose from and there aren't any good vegetarian/vegan options!
Recent Alumnus,1,"If you're looking for ""nightlife,"" well, you probably shouldn't be going to college, because even though Houghton is remote enough to have no nightlife, if you're focusing on your studies, you won't have much time to waste in nightlife anyway."
College Junior,1,Very poor unless you love crappy chinese food
College Freshman,1,You are in the middle of the woods. 
College Sophomore,1,"there is supposedly public busses, but I don't think I've ever seen one. Unless you have a car on campus or a friend with a car - you're probably not going anywhere"
College Sophomore,1,"Houghton is an alcohol and drug free campus, or is supposed to be. If you want nightlife you probably have to travel a bit. There are occasional events on campus that are generally pretty decent and Big Al's is the largest hangout stop nightlife wise on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"There are a lot of restrictions on student's social lives.  We cannot drink on campus at all regardless of age.  If you are caught consuming alcohol or under the influence of any substance of that sort there will be negative consequences.  Academically, there are some restrictions.  Evolution is not viewed in a good light by the institution therefore it is not taught as truth by the science departments simply as a theory."
College Senior,1,There is nothing to do except get in trouble. Most of the students stay indoors and get obese.
College Junior,1,Houghton is 45 minutes from the nearest...anything. We have a Dollar General down the road but you have to drive to get anywhere.
College Sophomore,1,"Zero Tolerance – Houghton is anti-alcohol, anti-drugs, and against pre-marital sex. Even if you are 21, you are not supposed to have alcohol on campus. Anti-drugs I understand because of the illegal aspect to them. You cannot have a person of the opposite in your room outside of visiting hours; the door has to be open. Even if  you do these things off campus, if someone tells on you to the administration, they will take disciplinary action (such as taking away certain financial support with the most serious being expelling you). If you are late signing out of an opposite-gendered dorm, you have to explain why, apologize, and will not be allowed to visit in that dorm for about a week. Oh, and in the beginning of the school year, they have everyone sign a contract that they will not overstep those boundaries the school has set up. Basically, the administration is serious about their students behaving."
College Sophomore,1,"Two Pretty Okay Options – Houghton only has two off-campus dining options within walking distance; Subway and China Star. That said, both options are tasty."
College Junior,1,"If you like cold weather this is the place for you. Weather is unpredictable other than the fact that it is going to be cold. You may be fooled by how the nice the weather is when you visit Houghton, but it won't last."
College Junior,1,"Too Close – Houghton is a dry campus without leniency, also there are no drugs or smoking allowed. Limited visiting hours are the only time someone of the opposite gender can visit, and while they are in your room the door must be open and the light on. Also you must both be in sitting positions, no cuddling, and no sharing blankets. Often students will be lectured about ""sitting too close"" or hugging. Because those things could ""raise their temperatures and lead directly to sex."""
College Junior,1,Wireless access is unreliable at best. There is only one computer lab and the printers often do not work.
College Junior,1,"Bed Time – Nightlife is non existent unless Halo/Rockband parties, or movies with hot chocolate and puppy chow count. The place most students go to hangout is the truck stop, but I'm not sure if it's even still open."

Freshman,5,"As a freshman, I really enjoy the surplus of opportunities right when I enter including employment, extracurriculars, resources, student life, and dorming. There is never a dull moment."
Graduate Student,5,"The beauty of New York University is where it is located. Even though it does not have a traditional college campus, the uniqueness of the buildings makes up for it. They have also taken great actions on being safe during this pandemic."
Freshman,5,I've had a wonderful experience at NYU thus far. I have access to office hours and programs such as the writing center which helps students with their essays and any writing assignment.
Freshman,5,"I love taking classes online. It allows me to manage my time, and I get the one-on-one experience that I wouldn't get in a classroom of 100 plus students."
Alum,5,"I loved NYU. It was an incredible experience, as I made life-long friends, developed my communication skills, and got a chance to study abroad!"
Freshman,5,"My online experience has been great so far, the experience really depends on the individual and their work ethic. For me, online learning you need to be a lot more focused and in tune with the class and whats going on."
Freshman,5,I haven't started classes yet but everyone I have talked to about online classes say that professors try to make class as engaging as possible.
Freshman,5,"I haven't started at NYU just yet but all the resurces NYU is providing me are really helpful, however, they are not super upfront with information all the time."
Sophomore,5,My online experience has been great at NYU. I feel like I've received quality education and connected with other student fluently.
Freshman,5,"NYU is a university rich with fame. The special points of it are its wealth and generousity. When I once heard my best friends talked about it, she mentioned that NYU makes it free for students who are in the medical college. Humanitarianism is a very charming characteristic of this university, and this is what attracts me most."
Junior,5,"At NYU, you will interact with all types of students and professors. The global network is strong and impressive. There are so many journeys and avenues at NYU that you can take."
Graduate Student,5,Overall experience is great here. Faculty is helpful. Tons of networking and professional connection. And of course the academic is intense.
Sophomore,5,"I've really enjoyed my experience with NYU, it is a very great university. The academic courses are very rigorous and the students are very determined to excel. I view it as a top tier prestigious university that has great community for its students."
Sophomore,5,The online classes were just as interactive as the courses that I had taken in person last semester. I enjoyed it as it proved to be very convenient to access the course materials.
Junior,5,"I guess that one thing special about NYU is its open campus. There isn't any ""gate"" but the school is embraced by the city, and the people in New York respects NYU students."
Alum,5,"I took no classes online until the end of my senior year (class of 2020). All of the in-person classes were great, and all of the online classes were as good as they could have been given the circumstances. Professors were very understanding and flexible with deadlines."
Alum,5,"I loved the city, the people, and the student atmosphere. Professors were fairly good (some gen-eds were terrible, as expected). Overall good experience! I met some of my best friends there and continue to be in touch with the university."
Freshman,5,Great experience with great people who will help you and are there for you. Real community. Tandon environment can use some remodeling as classrooms  are not the best. More money needs to be invested to make the school look nicer.
Junior,5,"I'm currently a rising junior and I can't express how much I love this school! NYU is definitely not where you'll find the typical college experience. You are mostly on your own after freshman year, but I find that most of the students here prefer it that way; it gives us a sense of independence that other colleges don't offer. Classes are quite difficult but they are manageable if you apply yourself! I've unfortunately had to be sent home last semester because of COVID-19, but the professors were very understanding while we were taking online classes, which only supports the fact that the professors at NYU are excellent. The location of the school is amazing and the dorms are probably better than most other colleges in the country, and the dining halls are pretty good too!"
Sophomore,5,"I love how NYU is in the heart of Manhattan in the lively and historic neighborhood of Greenwich Village. Along with The New School and The Cooper Union, there is just a great academic and cultural atmosphere there.

NYU is excellent on the undergraduate level for philosophy and humanities in general, economics and social sciences in general, business, performing arts, journalism and media and communications in general, and health fields like nursing and dentistry.

People here put down NYU's athletics, but that's from a football-centric point of view. NYU has a phenomenal fencing program, and for all of the other sports excluding football there are pretty good facilities and programs. With 181 Mercer opening soon, they will only get better."

Alum,5,"Just graduated this year. Had an amazing experience I could not have had anywhere else. Not online got to travel through the world at NYU study abroad sites but got to live in the best parts of the greatest city in the world (NYC). For a big school, NYU really creates a supportive environment for everyone to thrive. You also don't feel you at a massive school thanks to the fact NYU structures itself with individual colleges (such as College of arts and science or Gallatin) which are much smaller and help divide things up."
Alum,5,"I really found that my teachers did their best to accommodate student needs. They were so understanding. I cannot speak for other departments, however, my experience with the history and politics departments remotely was great."
Sophomore,5,"I had to take some classes online last semester due to the pandemic. My professors were very forgiving and flexible. It was tough for me personally, however my professors made our situation much more manageable."
Graduate Student,5,Excellent online experience considering we are all online during the Pandemic. NYU is very accommodating.
Graduate Student,5,I love NYU. I feel as though I am getting a great education that will prepare me well to go out into the field when I graduate.
Sophomore,5,"Going to school in NYC is a very different experience than most colleges. The city becomes your campus, and there's so much more to do if you manage your time well. It's an expensive school, but you get a lot more bang for your buck with all the opportunities they offer. Highly recommend studying abroad for a semester too!"
Sophomore,5,"New York University is somewhat of an unconventional institution to attend, yet I would not want it any other way. Located in the heart of New York City, the available academic, social, political, and career oriented opportunities are overwhelming. If you are willing to put in a great deal of effort in classes, and work to get to know your professors through office hours, surprising networking opportunities can arise. Professors here care about their students succession, and will work along side you as long as you are willing to put in the time yourself and work above and beyond what is expected. It is a truly amazing university, and I am grateful to have the opportunity to attend an institution that works from day one to prepare students for the real world, and eventual work force."
Sophomore,5,"New York University has been all that I dreamed of and more. The academic rigor, diversity, and location has left me more than satisfied with my overall experience thus far."
Sophomore,5,"I took all of my spring semester classes online from March until May. The transition from in-person learning to remote learning was very smooth in my opinion. All of my professors were understanding of the boundaries to learning that emerged as the circumstances for many worsened. My professors were considerate in that they adjusted assignment deadlines and lectures to best accommodate students from different time zones. The university has been reaching out to students on a weekly basis, offering resources and updates. New York University has done a phenomenal job keeping their students informed and reassured that all needs will be met. I look forward to returning to campus, hopefully in the fall!"
Sophomore,5,"My professor did everything they could to make the transition to online easy and smooth. It was nice to do school on my own time, although it was harder to focus. Some classes were more challenging than others online."
Freshman,5,"NYU is unlike any other school. With its amazing location, the resources and opportunities are unparalleled. Even though the tuition is quite expensive, I really do feel like I'm getting a lot for my money, and I'd rather pay this tuition and come here than pay even more to go to an Ivy League institution. I feel that the University really cares about its students' thoughts and opinions and offers many resources to help students get adjusted to the city, make friends, and take advantage of career and educational opportunities. There are always events going on, influential people here to speak, and networking opportunities. Of course, this institution is not perfect, but I feel that its students are motivated to improve the school, and the administration is open to listening."
Graduate Student,5,I have had an exciting experiences so far in the school because they have strong academic and exciting sports and other resources time to make learning fun and exciting.
Graduate Student,5,"It had been  ecstatic moment so far.  Academic, sports, and learning including all social activities in the school are just fun and it makes learning go well."
Niche User,5,"Being in the heart of the city, the campus is so beautiful and is so diverse. The people are so nice and are just very good to be around."
Niche User,5,The professors are very kind and very professional. They are very knowledgable on their subjects and explains things very well.
Junior,5,"The classes I took online were taught through Zoom (live). The professors did a wonderful job of adapting to the technology to the best of their abilities and continued to be available for office hours, emails, etc."
Junior,5,"NYU is an amazing school if you love the city and are looking for a creative, collaborative environment."
Freshman,5,"NYU has one of the most amazing online learning classes yet. I have taken around 5 online classes till date, and I found it pretty awesome."
Freshman,5,NYU has some of the most amazing professors till date. It would be an amazing experience to be a part of NYU.
Sophomore,5,"Since the pandemic broke out, NYU has been conducting classes on zoom and it’s been an adjustment but it’s very good. I prefer learning in a classroom but the zoom classes are not bad at all"
Sophomore,5,"I love how living in NYC make you grow up os fast, and I feel like I'm not only preparing for a career but also for a life of success and hustle."

Freshman,5,"As a first year undergraduate student at their Tandon school of Engineering, I can say that they have a great engineering program with many labs and resources that NYU invests in."
Alum,5,I studied at the New York University Leonard N. Stern School of Business for four years to earn a Bachelor of Science in Business.
Freshman,5,"From the information I have collected about NYU and my personal experience, I find NYU to be an amazing center of artistic collaboration. I think living in a city that is already so driven by visual and performing arts really drives students to work towards a creative and collaborative goal in order to be included in New York City's community. I think sometimes the tuition seems quite extensive. In addition to that, I think having Chick-fil-A as a dominating fast food industry in collaboration with the university is hypocritical in the sense that NYU builds itself on its reputation of pro-LGBTQ+. All in all, though, the education, the community, and the energy of NYU outweigh any negatives and truly make it an amazing college experience."
Freshman,5,"I love NYU TISCH. I love the environment, the amazing feeling of going to one of the most accredited universities in the world. My friend plans to study in Shanghai, if corona allows it....one of the main negatives is its extreme price."
Freshman,5,My professors are very professional. Their office hours are usually flexible and they are always easy to contact when I need help or don't understand the material covered during lectures.
Freshman,5,"The experience has been awesome. I met some of my closest friends during my time at NYU Shanghai, and the resources at Stern are countless. The culture definitely prepares you for the corporate world."
Freshman,5,"I'm a drama major and I couldn't be happier. Everything you need is there, but you can't expect things to come to your door. You have to be proactive about your social life and the things you want to accomplish. You mature very quickly and I'm grateful for it."
Freshman,5,I love the location of the campus and how it was in the heart of Manhattan and I thought faculty there were all very nice and constructive.
Alum,5,"I went to Gallatin and had wonderful community and resources. The support I got was so helpful, and I actually felt like I got my money's worth. There was so much to do within the city and around school, and my classes were challenging but really made me think deeply. The professors are caring and understanding."
Niche User,5,I went there to visit my cousin who is currently a med student there and it was just beautiful. The campus was so clean and the dorms were extremely nice.
Niche User,5,"I applied to NYU at its campus in Abu Dhabi. It's been an incredible experience to get the quality of NYU's education at a place of concentrated diversity, as the student body is quite literally composed of people around the world."
Sophomore,5,"NYU has provided a wonderful college experience. I have been able to explore the city of New York as well as receive an incredible education. Currently studying abroad in Paris, NYU has given me resources and encouragement to explore the city and my passions."
Junior,5,"I love everything about life at New York University. The class size allows the professors to give very individual attention. On top of this New York City is a great place to live and study in. The classes are very challenging, but not in such a way that they are overly difficult. Student services are very expansive, easy to access and very helpful. The student health center is also extremely well staffed and truly invaluable. Online classes are also provided and they are truly easy to work through and the professors give classes that are easy to understand. The New York University website can at times be challenging to navigate, but this is mainly due to the high quality and quantity of information provided. All services I have had to deal with, those in charge were helpful and easy to work with to provide solutions to almost any problem."
Niche User,5,I was just accepted with an amazing scholarship! I was a bit nervous at first because it was a private school. Those are usually expensive and mostly rich people go there. I was shocked to receive the scholarship I did! Very happy as well!
Freshman,5,"The college is honestly amazing. The food options compared to many other universities are vast, the professors are knowledgeable. NYU is just all around a school in the city with many opportunities"
Junior,5,"New York University has so many resources for their students, it is all up to the student to take advantage of them. As someone who is really involved in campus life and culture, I really feel like NYU does the most in terms of providing a solid experience to students."
Niche User,5,"I was recently admitted to New York University this past December. Throughout the application I received a tremendous amount of support from the NYU Admissions Department. Everyone I spoke both on the phone and in person to were very welcoming and helpful, which made the entire application process very enjoyable."
Freshman,4,"My classes online are pretty engaging, I especially love my writing class where we discuss readings in a critical way -- despite being remote."
Graduate Student,4,It has been hard to learn online but the school has done a great job with trying to make it as easy as possible for the students and professors to work with one another.
Alum,4,"NYU is a really great school for those who are willing to dive into the professional world head-first and grow up very quickly. It does a great job of being an in-between by allowing you to have a college environment while getting the opportunity to live in the same city as some of the largest, most successful companies and people in the world. I don't think this school is for the faint of heart, but it was so worth it."
Freshman,4,This university allows students to explore and find they're true passions in life. It also gives their students so many travel opportunities which really opens horizons and their vision on the world.
Senior,4,Great undergraduate experience and student life. Advising can be lacking in some areas. The campus is in a great area.
Sophomore,4,"Everything at NYU is amazing, I am learning a massive amount and am inspired and motivated everyday. The only downside is the cost of tuition. Maybe it's because of COVID19, but I've literally had mental breakdowns with the thought of paying tuition to NYU."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, I attend some webiners these days. It is a pity that I have not experienced the lecture and some workshops, but the frequency of pre-college meeting reassures me that the quality of education and how responsable NYU is."
Junior,4,"Taking classes online were a challenge but NYU was at the forefront of making it effective. With NYU Shanghai being the first campus to move remotely, professors stepped up to the challenge and were understanding about student's needs."
Junior,4,The professors were pretty accomodating with online classes. They realized the adjustment and planned accordingly.
Junior,4,"I like the level of education I receive, however, I would reduce the cost of tuition. The overall experience does prepare you for the workforce after college."
Sophomore,4,"My online learning experience with NYU was certainly easier than in-person, but I'm not sure if I would say it was better. I commute to campus, so it was nice not having to spend an hour on the train every single day. There was also a lot less pressure during tests and quizzes, which reduced some of my testing anxiety. However, I worked part-time during the school year, which means that I left my house every single day of the week, and I subconsciously tied my outdoor experience with my NYU experience. Attending classes from home seemed foreign; an alienated time period whose end I greatly anticipated. As time went along, I found myself studying less, but still maintaining the same grades. I feel like online learning helps students memorize their class's curriculum, as opposed to learning and understanding it. However, I know that NYU did its best given the circumstances, and zoom lectures were much easier to understand once I replayed them and paused to take notes at my own pace."
Sophomore,4,"I love that NYU is located in the center of one of the country's most popular ""urban jungles."" When I first arrived on campus, I saw just as many students as I did strangers and tourists, but after a few months, I felt as though I was one with the city, and began to accept the hustle and bustle of Greenwich life. I love that there are restaurants everywhere you go, and that opportunities to meet people are endless. In terms of academics, NYU is very fast paced, and puts a lot of responsibility into its student body. Again, it took some adjustment time, but studying in the library and spreading homework time throughout the week really helped me move forward. NYU is a bit hard to navigate in terms of financial aid and general school policies, hence my 4 star review. Hopefully, I find it easier to maintain a regular financial aid package during the rest of my years here. Overall, I'm very happy with my decision to attend this astute university."
Freshman,4,"So far my experience with New York University has been very good. The classes are challenging, but the professors are usually very helpful and understanding. Administrators and advisors are very accessible and easy to get in contact with."
Freshman,4,The classes are very active and engaging even though it is online. The school holds many online activities or video sessions for students to participate in from home.
Graduate Student,4,"I take some online classes due to COVID-19. However, I study digital media design so most of the time we spend time learning digital designing or coding from computer. The experience after and before COVID-19 is not significant different. Professors and staffs are very helpful and always initiate informal online meetings where we can keep in touch with faculty ans friends. The only downside is that we still pay the full price without a chance to use the physical facilities at the campus"
Junior,4,"I think that online learning in general does not suit me personally, and it is probably not NYU's problem. The whole efficiency of learning online and submitting online decreases, and there are much more mistakes occurred than studying in person. However, the only choice for now remains studying online, and I think that NYU has done a great job accommodating its students."
Senior,4,"I think that NYU is a great school because you are immersed in such a diverse, bustling city. But it is also incredibly expensive and it can be hard for low-income students to feel like they belong."
Sophomore,4,The online course is taken via zoom. Professors are responsible and easy to reach out for help. New York University have many summer session in different country which is friendly to international students who are not able to go back to the main campus.
Sophomore,4,Good location with limited housing. Living in NY is a very inspiring experience. Everything is good.
Junior,4,"Taking online classes was actually a bit harder than I thought because it was difficult to focus on listening to the professor while laying in bed staring at a screen, but the professors were very understanding and lenient most of the time! Since classes were online attendance was enforced more than when classes were in-person, but that didn't seem to affect many students I knew."
Alum,4,"NYU is overall a pretty great school to attend. The cost would be the main issue seeing as somehow the school needs to charge its 51,000+ student body (give or take a thousand scholarship earners) around $80,000 a year just so that Andy Hamilton can earn $2 million every year. Despite this, you might only get the quality and experience of NYU at less than a handful of other institutions. Especially in the arts programs, you will learn from the most experienced and renowned professionals in the business. It's so hands-on that honestly after one class I felt like I knew 20x more than I did before."
Junior,4,"I have completed my sophomore year on ZOOM. I am thankful for the teachers accommodating to this new environment,  but I am not impressed with the institution as a whole for raising our tuition prices for the fall, disregarding the fact that Covid19 has left many students with limited funds. I am taking the semester off because I dont believe I am getting value for my money"
Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere of the city compared to an average university experience. I love my classes and I appreciate the closeness of each professor, especially given the size of my class and the entire school."
Junior,4,"I am so happy with my decision to go to NYU. I love the city, I love the ""no-campus"" campus, I love the people, the amazing classes, the openness and willingness to be open and support they build. However, the reason I left out a star is for the main obvious reason: the price. Deciding over the worth of price and my dream school was a tough decision, and it was not one I took lightly. I think tuition and affordability is something NYU needs to work on if they actually do care about support and their students. Yet, despite this, I am so proud and would not change a thing I did."
Sophomore,4,"Online hasn't been the worst thing in the world. Some of my classes actually translated online a lot better than in person due to how big the lecture was. I do miss having class with smaller groups, its harder to make friends online and make a solid group."
Sophomore,4,"very fun school and would recommend applying. It's very different than any school you're going to go to, it's not a closed campus, the greek life is dead and so are our sports team. But this isn't necessarily a bad thing, You're going to meet people from all over who have done great things."
Freshman,4,I spent my first semester at the Shanghai campus. The professors are great and the city is amazing! A lot of classes take you around the city for the actual classes.
Freshman,4,"My online classes were great, especially since attendance wasn't required. My professors uploaded lectures online and changed the syllabus to accommodate for students."
Sophomore,4,"The transition to studying online was very smooth for most of my classes. It was mostly up to the professors in terms of how they wanted to approach online learning, but it's up to the student if they want to actually learn the material. Given the circumstances, most professors wouldn't want to fail students for struggling, so some might take advantage of that. On the whole, you can still get a decent education with the material they provide, but it's obviously not going to be the same experience as if we were in person."
Sophomore,4,"Remote learning was difficult at first because it took some time to get used to, however I think that the classes were administered well and still allowed students to learn. One major drawback from remote learning in the last few months was having to factor personal circumstances and new environments into our rigorous learning regimes."
Sophomore,4,"New York University has amazing facilities to aid your studies and amazing faculty to learn from, however as an institution, NYU does not always prioritize its students and doing what is right over profits."
Niche User,4,"The school is great for what it's worth. But, it is incredibly expensive and you will end up in tons of debt."
Niche User,4,"My online experience was fine. Overall, it could have been better and I don't feel like I was getting my entire money's worth."
Freshman,4,"Wonderful professors, courses, and minds! Very easy to make connections and transition to work-life due to the city environment. Students are put on a track for success, however, costs for attendance can be difficult to naviagate depending on one’s personal circumstances."
Sophomore,4,"So far I have had a pretty good experience at NYU. There are always new opportunities that students have access to. All of my classes have been challenging in a way that has stimulated my brain and made me interested in the class. While there is a lack of a sports culture, there are still some D1 and D3 sports, including fencing , swim & dive and track & field. There is no better surrounding area than the East village/Greenwich village, where there is a wide variety of restaurants, bars, and fun activities to entertain yourself with. For the most part, dorms are a nice place to rest your head or study, but cramping three students into rooms meant for doubles can definitely cause some issues (gave me the flu)."
Alum,4,"NYU is for any student looking to make a mark on something. You could climb the ranks and become the top student leader on campus or stay local and join one of the many clubs on campus. If you’re not interested in joining, that’s okay because there are events catered for you as well. There is a place for everyone and it is up to you to define how intense you want your experience to be."
Sophomore,4,"Amazing education and helpful professors. I love walking through Washington Square but no ""campus"" makes it harder to meet people. The university offers a lot of resources that are beneficial for the students. Most amazing library and many food options. A lot of diversity."
Freshman,4,"It really depended on the professor of the class and how he/she decided to handle the switch to online teaching. For some classes, I actually found the online platform to actually improve my experience. For example, for my speaking-based French class, I found that doing an online class really improved communication between students. However, for other classes I found it really unhelpful to attend the class anymore, and I faced barriers reaching out to the professor or TA's for help. Overall, I was still able to succeed academically, especially with the change in grading policies for Stern, but some classes translated better to the online format than others."
Sophomore,4,"Extremely expensive if you don't qualify for financial aid.  The resources, however, are ample, though students need to actively seek them out to take full advantage of them. For a school like NYU, it is really how each individual student chooses to make out of it."
Sophomore,4,"If you're paying full tuition to attend NYU online, you're making a terrible financial decision. Online classes are just like any other schools'."
Sophomore,4,"There's diversity, great professors, and amazing classes with interesting subjects.  Also, the extracurriculars provided like the VIP programs or the makerspace all lead to a more amazing experience."
Sophomore,4,"Yes, because of COVID a lot of m classes were transformed online and the teachers tried including different tools like nearpod, mural, and zoom to help js in any way that they can."
Junior,4,"In general, professors have done a good job using Zoom lectures to continue the lectures as close as the in-person lectures. For things like lab experiments and presentations, they were quick to find alternatives to cover the same amount of material without needing to meet in person."
Sophomore,4,"So far, I've been having a fun time at NYU. It was a rough transition my first year for personal reasons, but I met a ton of amazing and interesting people. For those of you who are not that extroverted, it helps a lot to join student organizations (even if you feel like it'll be too ""nerdy"" to join). You never know who you'll meet--and it automatically makes a nice community! NYU is a single community, but it's way too big to FEEL like a community. Where NYU shines are the countless pockets of communities that you can find. You're also in NEW YORK CITY, where you can have the feeling of a campus in WSQ, but you have countless activities and sights in New York City. 

The academics can be manageable if you just go to class and do your homework. I am also in the humanities (Gallatin). It can be reasonably challenging though in terms of how you apply yourself to the coursework and learning. I really like the variety of classes (although it can also be a challenge to enroll)."
Sophomore,4,"I was in the unique position of studying abroad, so I had the MAJORITY of my semester in online classes. Overall, most of my professors made the transition well, but where a lot of mistakes happened were mostly in the changes to syllabi and how we had lectures (going from 3 hour lectures to 45 min lectures FOR THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL TO REVIEW was not helpful for learning). But overall, I think I still managed to learn in most of my classes."
Sophomore,4,"It’s a great school but the tuition is really high. They always have plenty of activities on and off campus, the food is good, and they provide help to employees that want to attend the school. The tuition is my biggest problem with the school. Usually students have to take multiple loans in order to pay the tuition and it’s really hard to get all the loans from one lender. They have great security also, security guards are always willing to help and are available if you need them to escort you to your car. They also have transportation to airports and other parts of the campus through out the city"
Freshman,4,"Being at the heart of New York City, NYU allows its students to have a home base to seize the greater classroom that is the city itself."
Junior,4,"Very quick with admissions decisions, always communicative. However, financial aid department was not very helpful"
Alum,4,"Going to school in a huge city isn't for the faint of heart. I personally enjoyed most parts of it, but as you'd expect, it's certainly different than your typical college campus. 

Anything you could ever need is within walking distance and there's an endless amount of great museums, stores, restaurants and basically anything else you could think of. I went there primarily for the fact that many of the companies I aspired to work for had an HQ there. 

The education itself was solid in my holistic opinion, but it was the professional opportunities that were top notch. You can leave a class and apply it to your career in the same afternoon. 

Commuting to class was always really easy, but living costs were high. If you don't mind loud noises, passionate people and opportunities to see just about anything on a city street, NYC is a great place to be. 

If you're going for a job at one of the thousands of companies calling NYC home, NYU is an incredible place to earn it."
Sophomore,4,"It’s truly what you make of it! I was lucky and found a pretty good friend group, so it was a lot of fun walking around the cuty with them! It’s definitely not as fun if you don’t have a solid group of people to hangout with, though."
Sophomore,4,I like how diverse NYU is compared to other schools. There's so many opportunities for people to find their niche within the larger college community.
Freshman,4,"Before the switch to online classes during the spring semester, my overall experience at NYU was quite positive. I'm in the Liberal Studies program, transferring over to the School of Professional Studies (or Stern Business, depending on admission) after my two years in the program. Liberal Studies doesn't exactly have the best reputation of being where the best students at the school are, however I've enjoyed all my classes and professors, as well as the smaller class sizes. I've taken to university life well, and enjoy being in the city. It's a bit challenging to find friends in such a large scale community, but if you use places like the classroom and your residence halls to your advantage, it becomes much easier, as you are likely to find common interests among these people. I will say that it is a bit of a culture shock the first time you arrive, if you come from a small community, it will certainly be a change, but it is much more like the real world that you will go into."
Junior,4,"I go to Rory Meyer's College of Nursing at NYU in their accelerated program. It is a tough program, however it prepares you for the NCLEX really well! Their passing rate is 95-99% throughout the years. They provide clinical experiences at many different hospitals as well as different clubs on campus to make connections."
Sophomore,4,"New York University has been an overall amazing experience. It may sound cheesy, but I love the fact that our campus is literally the city. My classes have all been awesome and in terms of the people, NYU is dedicated to making a safe zone for its students."
Sophomore,4,An absolutely unique experience! If you're looking to experience college in New York City NYU is in the best location and has so many amazing resources.
Freshman,4,"I love NYU! It is in the heart of lower Manhattan. It is not a traditional school, but you feel more connected than ever. Washington Square Park is your campus. The amount of opportunities and connections in New York City are endless! Everyone is super smart and support. Go Violets!"
Freshman,4,"There are a lottt of resources available through the school. The atmosphere was very confined, though, like a sort of ""left-wing bubble"". The school is really big and it can be hard to get a professor's attention if you're not extremely outgoing."
Alum,4,"Going to NYU was definitely a life-changing experience that launched me into adulthood at lightning speed. It was not just the academics and opportunities provided by the institution, but access to the entire city that distinguishes NYU from other schools. The urban freedom woven into the fabric of NYU's multicultural community is what catapults its college experience to the next level."
Sophomore,4,"Professors are thoughtful and considerate. Advisors are available to answer questions and help make decisions. Leadership is communicative, but during COVID-19 pandemic has been difficult to connect with and get answers from."
Freshman,4,NYU is a really big school and with a very diverse population. I really enjoyed the opportunities that NYU has brought to me because it is a school in the center of New York. There's a lot of academic and networking resources in school. It helps me a great deal academically and professionally.
Senior,2,"NYU has been trying, but it isn't really doing well with the online learning experience. The breakout rooms in zoom have not been impactful."
Graduate Student,2,It has been extremely difficult to learn from a computer only. Some professor have been unwilling to record classes for students in different area codes. This did not contribute to a productive learning environment at all.
Sophomore,2,"Online classes are difficult no matter where you go, but I think NYU didn’t take into account that they’re an extremely global school with students in pretty much every time zone. They didn’t offer different times to take classes for students on different continents."
Sophomore,2,"My academic experience was overall really good. I had some great professors, and I had a lot of academic opportunities that I don’t think I would’ve had elsewhere. That being said, I don’t think I can recommend going here in good conscience unless you have a lot of money to spend on an education. I was able to complete my first year at NYU because I had a lot of federal aid to help supplement the little aid that NYU gave me. I’m transferring now though because I’m not receiving the same amount of federal aid and my family isn’t able to pay the remaining cost. NYU is definitely not willing to work with students as far as aid goes, so if you do need any sort of financial aid to help with college, I would definitely suggest applying to other universities."
Freshman,2,"I was a freshman at NYU from 2019-2020 until I transferred to another school in May. I was originally from a suburban town in the Bay Area an aspired to become a city designer while being a student-athlete and playing varsity sports for the school. Unfortunately, within 2 months my experience at NYU was ruined to mental health constraints and adjusting to the 24/7 lifestyle of New York City.
   I had really bad anxiety living in the city, but what frustrated me most of all was the school's lack of mental health resources, which is entirely booked or working with inexperienced counselors. There is no central community at NYU and people can become very lonely despite living in a city with millions of people. Athletics are awful and are weened from any funding, and the commute times to the athletic center are 40 minutes of my day from WSP. New York can become very gritty in the winter and tuition is costly. I gave an extra star because I really enjoyed a few of my classes."
Sophomore,2,"In general, NYU is not a place for academia, and it can be very unfriendly about its students. not caring and not welcoming. courses offered are few (just compare its course offering to other colleges', you will see how few sessions/ topics NYU offers). very few classes have TAs. no review sessions before tests/ exams. Bureaucracy at NYU is insane - you can't get anything done without having to reach out to 5 diff offices/ people.  Most disappointingly, academic advisors aren't that supportive/ professional/ caring. Sometimes it feels like they don't want to help you, replying to your questions with automated texts. There are no personal connections made between my advisors and me."
Junior,2,Tuition is way too much for the actual experience it provides for its students.  The bureaucracy within the school is ridiculous and I have the hardest time getting through to the right people or office I need to talk to.  Some of the people working within the upper offices are rude and unhelpful.
Freshman,2,"Tandon’s problem is that it has NYU name, nothing else. There are many universities that cost less with better engineering programs.They flaunt ""the city is your campus,"" but no campus=no community, making friends=miserable. I've been here months,and no friends, no matter how many events arranged by NYU. With how much is being paid, you'd expect a competent way of seeing city, the NYU bus is horrible. I am in a low-cost in Clark and despite paying a normal price on most campuses, it’s far worse to the rooms others get for a quarter of cost.Bathroom is infested w/mold,the toilet seat:broke,the walls:chipped and dented,water damage, it’s dreadful. I had problems with my roommate where my health, academics, and well-being were jeopardized, and sleeping or comfort in the room:impossible. For weeks I rely on kindness of parents to find places to sleep,NYU never offered to refund this. There is nothing here which is better than normal university,worse. Don’t go."
Junior,2,"Untraditional so say the least! This school is not for most people.  There is absolutely no social life.  Yes, it's in the city, but the connection between students is non existent.  At NYU, you are on your own.  There are no social events worth going to.  There is no football team and the baseball team plays an hour away in an empty stadium. The basketball team is also a joke and no one goes to any of the games.  Don't spend your money here.  They charge you an Ivy League price, but it's nowhere near the quality of an Ivy.  Save your money and go to a traditional university.  I will be transferring soon."
Sophomore,2,"While NYU is a great school, it really has to be the literal exact perfect fit for you to succeed while also enjoying yourself. They really rely on you being almost completely independent in everything you do, which makes it extremely challenging to navigate difficult classes, registration, housing, and basically any resources you may need through your time at NYU (including wellness/mental help resources, which are notoriously terrible). On top of this, the city itself grows to be very stressful, something I did not previously believe was actually a thing. Make sure to do a lot of research and soul searching before attending, and connect with students you know and ask them about their experience because campus tours have little helpful info about both the campus and student life itself."
Junior,2,"The professors and staff are amazing, genuinely. I will miss the fantastic lectures and panels that can only happen at a prestigious University.

The students are always at this internship or that job that they're going between. It's a fast-paced energy that many would love. It can make it difficult to find friends. 

The problem is that everytime you leave your apartment you have to encounter New York City, and everything that goes along with that: catcalling, mystery liquids, cigarettes smoke, and of course people pushing and shoving. I've found it very difficult to relax. I can't just take a drive or go on a run. 

The people here are usually from the area, and very well off. Although of course they can be very nice people, sometimes I find it hard to relate to them even though I'm from a white middle class background. The students are the children of the 1%, there's no getting around it."
Alum,2,"I felt the faculty student interaction left a lot to be desired. I was in Gallatin, the smallest program at NYU and I still felt indifference bordering on disinterest from both my professors and advisor"
Niche User,2,"To be brief:
- classes are interesting and thought provoking
- the lack of a ""campus"" makes it extremely difficult to become involved
- most fellow students I've spoken to have said ""i hated it until my junior year and now i love it,"" which to me, seems like a pretty disappointing way to go through college
- hard to find/join clubs
- no real sense of community/school spirit
- professors are truly a hit or miss situation (I've had some great ones as well as some pretty awful ones)
- there are NO social gatherings or things other than the required few (which are generally not fun)
- very expensive"
College Freshman,2,New York University is not a school centered around sports; sports aren't really big deal on campus and I almost never hear about them.
College Freshman,2,What is Greek life? I believe that there are like six or seven frats and sororities.
College Junior,2,"There isn't much school spirit for varsity sports, and the athletics aren't on the same level as D1, but still pretty good."
College Sophomore,2,Seldom do you meet someone in Greek life
College Sophomore,2,Don't go to NYU if you're looking for sports pride
College Sophomore,2,"Its not really big here, and it depends on the frat/sorority if they are snobby. Also Greek life is super expensive."
College Sophomore,2,Very few people care about sports in the school.
College Junior,2,"There is not much of a Greek presence at NYU, only 13% of the school, so it is not a big deal"
College Sophomore,2,Aren't a big deal but nobody minds
College Junior,2,Nobody's intrested in greek life at the school.
Recent Alumnus,2,No one cares about sports at NYU.
College Sophomore,2,"People just don't care about sports, unfortunately. Few people show up to the basketball games and hockey games, and we don't even have a football team."
College Sophomore,2,Three of my roommates from freshman year are in Greek Life and they often times don't get much sleep because of their involvement.
College Freshman,2,This is an engineering schools. Brains over brawns. >:(
College Freshman,2,No School spirit. It sucks.
College Freshman,2,love being in the city but it's not college
College Freshman,2,Living in NYC offers students a lot of freedom. Many NYU students take advantage of it.
College Junior,2,"There are 3 gyms, I believe, but the only one near the physical therapy dept or Langone is Palladium--it's on E 14th st, and it's far too small for the number of students who need to use it. It's also poorly organized and has some odd policies. Most of my classmates (including myself) have joined other gyms, like NYSC or crunch."
College Freshman,2,"This is not a school for people who want to go to the campus football game every week- we don't even have a football team. There are definitely athletes here and they are recognized but hardly celebrated when compared to other big state schools. This is just not that kind of environment. Personally, I don't mind that at all. There is an extremely diverse population of students here studying a wide array of topics. The community here isn't as cliche as many of my friends' schools. You have to work a little harder to meet people but the people you do connect with, you really connect with. I don't think the lack of sports enthusiasm hurts the college experience at all but some students prefer a different environment."
College Freshman,2,Greek life simply is not a major part of life here. It's there if you want it.
College Freshman,2,Sports? Most students would say they come to NYU for other things. Don't go looking for the football field.
College Freshman,2,Greek life has little effect on social atmosphere of campus.
College Freshman,2,"Some students are involved, but it is not a large part of campus life."
College Freshman,2,"I rushed in the fall, and I got all the way to bid day before dropping out myself because I just wasn't really feeling strong with the group that offered be a bid. It's pretty easy to rush, it's definitely a different process than if you're from the South or California; there are no house visits, and interviews are much more lax. Basically no one actually knows about Greek life or what they do, however. There is no visibility and less than 8% of the student population is really part of Greek Life."
College Freshman,2,"There is no athletic scene. We don't have a football team or stadium, and other sports like basketball, swimming, and soccer are essentially ignored by almost everyone. All kinds of intramurals exist, they're just not super popular. If this doesn't say anything about sports at NYU then I don't know what will: our best sports team is the Quidditch team."
College Junior,2,"Personally, I have not visited the two gyms NYU too much. This is why I think I do not have the right to say things about the facilities. But on the other hand, I know that fan support/school spirit is almost nonexistent. I think because NYU is located in the city, there is not much of a campus to gather and rile up a crowd of supporters. Also, except for the athletes themselves, no one really seems to know what sport events are happening, let alone attending. However, I do not believe this is a bad thing, because everyone is proud of their academic achievements. Even if we do not know much about sport activities, we do know that we have bragging rights for our intelligence!"
College Freshman,2,"No one really cares about sport at this school, but there are athletic facilities available."
College Freshman,2,"Personally, I've been documented for drinking in the dorms. You need to be careful and mindful of the amount of noise because a simple noise complaint can turn into documentation and the dumping of $50 worth of vodka down the drain. I think they're a little too strict. I was once in a room and someone was talking about how they chased shots with Red Bull and the RAs on duty heard her through the wall and knocked on the door for ""suspicious language."""
College Freshman,2,I know someone who's been sexually assaulted this year and so far no consequence has been taken against the attacker.
College Freshman,2,"As a varsity athlete, I wish there was more support on campus. There are some students that don't even know we have sports."
College Sophomore,2,"To be completely honest, NYU sports are irrelevant to the rest of the University. I'm sure the sports teams are incredible, but it must suck for most teams to have to travel at least 45 minutes just to play a ""home"" game."
College Junior,2,"Housing is way too expensive especially for what it is.  It is cheaper to live off campus, and NYU needs to get with the program instead of ruining their students financially."
College Sophomore,2,I don't know anything about NYU sports.
College Freshman,2,"Many people say that Greek life at NYU is pretty much non-existent. While this is not entirely true, it's not to say that Greek life plays any huge role in the NYU community. Most students look down on those in Greek life as people who are incapable of making friends in a city as large and expansive as New York. There are, however, a few somewhat popular business-oriented fraternities at NYU. As for the rest, though, they are rather overlooked."
College Freshman,2,"NYU is NOT a sports school, and for many students, that's perfectly fine. Some even enjoy this anti-sportiness, wearing t-shirts emblazoned with an ""NYU Football"" logo (there's actually no football team). Don't apply if you expect to be attending weekly rowdy sports functions, with huge crowds and raging school spirit. Instead of games, you can find students at musical, theatrical, or other artistic activities and programs, and with such a great performing arts school, it makes sense. 

As for athletic facilities, there are many gyms throughout campus with adequate equipment, allowing for students to fit a good workout into their busy schedules."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I personally don't care about the Greek Life at NYU because I don't hear about it often. However, I do know some people who are in Greek Life."
College Sophomore,2,dorms are old and worn
College Freshman,2,You need to harass them to receive aid pretty much
College Freshman,2,Your gonna be broker than broke.
College Junior,2,There is not much of a party scene when it comes to engineering school because of the workload. Students who live the party scene lifestyle tend to go to NYU's main campus.
College Freshman,2,"I'm not sure if I'll be bale to make it in college 4 years. Even though academically and socially my life here has been going smoothly (close to 4.0 GPA, internships, etc.), it doesn't seem like I'll be getting much in scholarships."
College Freshman,2,"It's relatively expensive, and there aren't many options. It may have to do with the fact that I'm from Europe and the food there is infinitely better in general terms, but I didn't like the dining hall food that much. Getting a meal plan shouldn't be mandatory. Or at least freshmen should be allowed to get meal plans with less meals even if they don't live in apartment style housing—we always have lots of meals left over. If they're going to force us to buy too many meals, then at least make it cheaper."
College Senior,2,"Good for the location and great facilities in general, etc."
College Senior,2,"In my experience, so many courses that you don't learn almost anything in the whole semester and you feel so bad because you paid too much money for every course. In my case, just few of them were worthy. Of course I understand this is my particular case in my particular program. There are students of other schools at NYU that are much happier because it's not the same Steinhardt than Stern!!!"
College Senior,2,The quality of food is pretty bad
College Freshman,2,NYU is known to be stingy about its scholarships for a reason. Its one of the most expensive schools in the country.
Recent Alumnus,2,Manhattan is an expensive place to live.
Freshman,1,Simply not worth the money for zoom classes at NYU. Coming from the west coast it was especially hard with morning classes which would be moved to 6am.
Sophomore,1,"I studied at NYU for 2 long years. It was the worse experience of my life. The teachers were horrible and I had to study everything on my own. Fortunately, I was able to transfer to UCLA (the best university in USA). I got robbed twice in a year. 
See you in a future NYU."
Alum,1,"I was disissed from the Ph. D. program at the end of my 5th year despite all of the achievements and honors that I received throughout the program and especially on the 5th year itself. They screwed me over by changing my qualifiying exams, giving me tons of anxiety and stress and indirectly accusing me of plagiarism because my essay exceeded their expectation. They could not prove it at all because there was no such a thing."
Senior,1,"You have been warned about the social life. If you’re not the outgoing type who’s willing to reach out to many people, you’re not going to thrive socially. And the same is true for
your job. Be very careful about this and don’t get discouraged."
Alum,1,"Going to NYU was a waste of my time and money.  It's a bit elitist for no good reason, but if your daddy helped you get in, he can help you get a job."
Alum,1,"Worst college experience I have had.  My teachers were unsupportive, overly opinionated, and boring.  I would never take another class at NYU.  It is the epitome of an overrated university in a good location."
College Junior,1,"There is no athletic scene at NYU. Possibly because the campus is immersed in the hustle and rumble of New York City,  sports aren't a big part of student life and only a very small amount of people display school spirit."
College Sophomore,1,They're non-existing but nobody minds
College Senior,1,Engineering school is very demanding. Everyone is so focused on studying and doing well in their classes that it becomes difficult to get involved in sports.
College Senior,1,Most people look down on Greek Life. Not usual.
College Senior,1,NYU is not an athletic school. We knew this.
College Freshman,1,"This rating should not discourage people from coming to NYU, but the athletics are nearly nonexistent. While we do have several D3 teams and a D1 fencing team, the events have low attendance and the school is missing the athletic school spirit and bonding that a more traditional college offers."
College Freshman,1,"It's rare that someone is part of Greek life. It doesn't affect the campus whatsoever, and I never hear anything about any of the frats or sororities. I think the ""housing"" for them is just one of the floors of one of the dorms."
College Freshman,1,"There is absolutely no school spirit or student involvement when it comes to sports. I never hear anything about our sports teams, and that's an infamous part of NYU."
College Freshman,1,Almost nobody cares about school athletic teams.
College Freshman,1,"No one knows anything about sports or athletics. The gyms are pretty useful if you're willing to make the walk/live near one of them, but hardly any school spirit with sports."
College Freshman,1,Everyone probably knows by now that NYU is terrible with giving money
College Sophomore,1,NYU is terrible when it comes to giving any aid.
College Sophomore,1,I am an incoming Jr and will now have to stop my education because of financial ais. I was qualified for so many in house grants and scholarships yet when I asked why I did not receive any they told me they were not allowed to tell me why I was not shosen.
Recent Alumnus,1,NYU also really isn't big on Greek life. The only time you see/hear about them is the gay frat's on campus- events.
Recent Alumnus,1,"NYU isn't really big on athletics, and what is out there isn't advertised well or emphasized at all really. Very little participation, even fewer people actually go as spectators."
College Freshman,1,Welcome to NYU! That'll be 4 million dollars!
College Freshman,1,It's awful. I don't know who to go to for anything and everyone is very rude and unhelpful.
College Sophomore,1,The apartments offered are not very reliable and often seem like scams. I would not trust NYU's site with making the deciding factor for where you should live - or at least be very wary of the location.
College Freshman,1,"I didn't receive any financial aid from the school, and only got loans which doesn't help my family. The school is expensive and it is hard to get scholarships. I am trying to appeal for more aid."
College Freshman,1,Not sure if it really exists. Ambivalent toward it.
College Freshman,1,People are athletes here to get into Stern. Everyone quits after freshmen year.
College Freshman,1,They have pretty bad parties. Greek life basically doesn't exist.
College Sophomore,1,"NYU doesn't give out enough scholarship money. It's stingy and unreasonable, and horrifically expensive."
College Sophomore,1,Greek life is not really a part of NYU.  There are way too many amazing and awesome things going on.
College Freshman,1,"i don't like sports though, so it is fine"
College Senior,1,"NYU is often really bad about financial aid and in my four years here, I've had to beg and scream for additional assistance, even when my dad lost his job."
College Sophomore,1,Make sure you do extremely well in high school because that will determine how much you're getting from the school. And the amount stays the same for the rest of the school years.
College Junior,1,"NYU gives to those who REALLY need the money, however most middle class families are left to pay the entire bill :("
College Sophomore,1,"LOL NYU doesn't have sports....? I mean, our football team is undefeated but"
College Sophomore,1,"It's absolutely the worst. There are no explanations, no help, no guidance."
College Freshman,1,"This is for NYU Shanghai, so no off campus housing is allowed yet as its an international school."
College Freshman,1,"Considering I go to school at NYU Shanghai instead of the Stern Campus in New York, we don't have any greek life since its such a small campus so I have no idea."
College Freshman,1,"NYU isn't for everyone, but it's a fantastic school in an even better city"
College Senior,1,"Most NYU Students see fraternities and sororities as a joke. I do too, to be honest."
College Sophomore,1,"It is an over priced and financially corrupt institution. I have received about a fourth of my tuition in scholarship but if I do not receive more I will be in crippling debt. The tuition is approximately 65K a year with room and board, but its hard to give up when you have wanted this for so long. My tips would be to keep trying and keep working with the financial aid office to get as many options and as much money as possible."
College Junior,1,everything about it is bad
College Junior,1,They are cancelled for the next year
College Senior,1,"Haha there's no ""real"" Greek life at NYU (THANK GOD)"
College Sophomore,1,It makes no sense to drive to NYU because it's in Manhattan so parking is horrible.
College Sophomore,1,There is basically no Greek life at NYU and it is viewed as being pretty silly.
College Junior,1,"Ok the school is in the city. It is impossible to find parking and when you do, it usually costs you a lot. Even meters cost about 3-4 dollars an hour!!"
College Junior,1,"It's an engineering school. Parties do not exist. Period. To find a party, you'd probably have to look off campus"
College Freshman,1,"Don't bother bringing a car, you will have no space to park it"
College Junior,1,"This school hardly gives out any scholarships and if they do, they look for every excuse on why you don't qualify. They have scholarships that are based more on need than merit. If you plan to attend NYU, make sure your pockets are stuffed with money because it is one of the most expensive schools in the country."
College Freshman,1,I know only a few people who engage in sports. The athletic facilities are used mostly to meet personal fitness needs. There is no sports community of which I am aware.
College Freshman,1,"What is Financial Aid at this school? Most people barely get anything rewarded, including myself."
College Sophomore,1,Manhattan is the hardest place to find housing. The application requirements are very strict
College Freshman,1,The housing application is THE WORST.
College Sophomore,1,I wish I could get more financial aid than I actually do.
College Junior,1,"Unless you can check off every box on the form to indicate your in the worst life situation possible, the likelihood of getting scholarships is slim. You'll likely get a boat load of federal loans and be told to reapply next year."
College Sophomore,1,"Every time I try to pay for some part of the program, they send a refund check of the same amount back to me. Every part of the process is the biggest headache imaginable, and I recently learned that there is apparently no way I can see my bursar account online, because I'm a grad student at Stern."
College Freshman,1,"its stupid, its all about money"
College Sophomore,1,"Hard to get financial aid, some scholarships are helpful, but not much."
College Sophomore,1,"We Do not have any off-campus housing since we don't have the actual campus. However, we do have an area called ""campus"" where most of the classes are."

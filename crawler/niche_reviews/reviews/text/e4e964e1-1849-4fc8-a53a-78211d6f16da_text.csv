Junior,5,I personally love the college that I go to. You get one on one time with your teachers due to the smaller classes. You and your class mates get very close because you are with them throughout your time there. It is a great experience being at ptc. And I highly recommend this program to anyone.
Freshman,5,"I have scoliosis and the ability to have all my classes in one building has been a big help! There are also on-campus dorms which are a five-minute walk to and that is the only serious walking you will have to do. If you are someone with a disability causing you to be in a wheelchair there are elevators accessible to you and the whole school has no stairs in it so it's very convenient to those in wheelchairs if a fire happens in a building. Each dorm is equipped with good fire alarms and there are days it goes off at night, but at least I know I am safe even if it is a false alarm every time. So I defiantly recommend this school it is awesome with all the nice teachers as well."
Freshman,5,"Since the corona outbreak my teachers have done everything they could to help us learn. Some teachers tell us to ""move at our own pace because they say we want someone who knows the content not learns it and moves on."" Which I am proud to say has let me feel less stressed in this rather stressful time."
Sophomore,5,Educational wise is great! The off campus housing isn't the best. Takes forever to get things fixed or working.
Niche User,5,"the school is amazing, it always have been! the small classrooms along with the careing professors and low cost makes this the ideal college for most people."
Freshman,5,It's a very nice and well-put school. The campus and housing sites are very nice and much different than the high school experience. Its a very enjoyable environment and I loved every minute of being here.
Alum,5,"I graduated in 2015 from the A.S. EET program and will be returning (online) to earn a B.S. in applied Management this summer. My time earning my EET degree was excellent, with professors that truly cared, worked with you and your schedule (as a night student working full time), and it opened doors for me to move up with my company. I've received 3 promotions at this company since I've earned my A.S. degree, and could not be happier with the time I spent at PTI/ PTC."
Freshman,5,The admission process was easy and my coordinator was awesome. She explained everything very through and made sure I understood everything. She even provided me with her cell phone number to get ahold of her in case I had any questions. The overall experience was great!
Niche User,5,i learned that they are many things to do and you can keep your self busy. the staff are great and everyone is nice to each other and they help each other
Niche User,5,I went to an open house at Pittsburgh Technical College. I really liked the area and how the different classes were presented. I also liked how the on and off campus housing was set up.
Niche User,5,It is a very beautiful place located right outside Pittsburgh with so much land too it. When I visited it was a nice day and the building was clean with a bunch of active members involved in the school including Graphic design majors. That is what I am interested in and I was able to talk to a professional who graduated from the school.
Niche User,5,I have 2 children attending PTC.  Absolutely wonderful experience.  They have excellent faculty and the quality of education is exceptional.  They care!!!!! I would highly recommend.
Freshman,5,"This college is absolutely honestly amazing! They are very serious about being hands on, and they are very good at it. Their schools in IT, Criminal Justice, and Video Production are phenomenal. All of their programs are great. They also offer on campus housing even though they are a 2 year college. Their Humans versus Zombies game is so fun."
Niche User,5,i like the way the dorms look for starters. Also i like the way the college is made and the teachers are very kind their. the other thing i like is the dorms out of campus. For real i went just to the open house so Im not a former student yet but Im getting their.
Freshman,5,I have not started attending PTC yet but so far I already love it. Everyone I have talked to so far has been so pleasant and helpful. They make me really excited to start next fall!
Sophomore,5,"It is a great school, the teachers care about your success and likes to see you succeed! They are very helpful and professional about their jobs and helping other students learn to be able to have a career also!"
Niche User,5,I love the campus. Its beautiful and well organized and easy to walk through and find what you are looking for. The teachers there are so nice and willing to help and answer any questions you have.
Niche User,5,I want to go there sooooo bad. It seems like such a great school. I wouldn't want anything change about I mean maybe lower the cost. But you wouldn't believe how badly I want to go.
Niche User,5,I haven't attended the college yet. From what I've received from the college about their culinary arts program i really like it and the college has interests for anyone in the extra activities. I also like how friendly the staff is there.
Alum,5,I loved going to this school. It was a quick 2 years for me and really prepared me for my career.  There was no extra work to be done because I got all I needed from this college.
Freshman,5,I liked how the school was very opened minded about anything the students were up for trying if you were stuck with a hard problem they would help and solve it.
Alum,5,"Fantastic location, fantastic programs, fantastic career placement services, fantastic experience. You get out what you put in. I went to one of the state's top public schools and the academic classes were a breeze. This is a trade school though, so your classes mainly focus on your career with a hands-on approach. If you aren't serious about your career, this is not the school for you.

Off-campus/commuting students (I found) had an easier time focusing on their studies since they were not a part of the on-campus drama/scene, but that also means missing a ton of student life events. 

Here, you will find life-long friendships with your peers and life-long connection with your professors. Fantastic school. I would go back if I could."
Freshman,5,The Pittsburgh Technical Institute is a very well productive school. The Teachers are nice and will do anything in their power to help you make it!
Graduate Student,5,"I'm going to give PTC five stars because I've had a stellar experience here over the past several years.  With the addition of the bachelor's program, the school has enabled me to pursue opportunities I'd otherwise not have from within my current company.  I admit, they're student-body is made up of some questionable characters which is pretty evident by reading the majority of these other reviews (absolutely terrible grammar from kids that barely made it through high school.... it's the ""We accept EVERYONE"" situation), but otherwise, this place has come a long way and I can honestly say, with their regional accreditation, I'm proud to have earned both my associate's and bachelor's degrees from PTC!"
Niche User,5,"It's an awesome college.  Anyone who wants to have hands-on support, great campus, AND great job opportunity should go here!"
Senior,5,This is a great school. I have the best instructors and I'm really excelling with this school. I'm glad this is the school I picked. I feel like it's preparing me very well for my future career.
College Senior,5,"Our schedule are very set but when we having something coming up, the professor are very flexible on them. We can summit our work on line or if we have a reasonable excuses. They will our extend our deadline"
College Senior,5,"We just had a guest speaker today coming in. She is doing really good at her job now. She still contact the school and giving school updates on her. Just like her, many alumni will let the school know if their job is looking on hiring anyone new. This helps with the upcoming graduates a lot"
College Senior,5,"My experience with the courses and professor at this school is AWSOME!!! Professors will glady stay after school to help with any student in need. Classes are fun yet challenging. Our class varies within professors. Styles are different, Sizes are different. Classes can be outside, online, or in-class."
College Senior,5,"My major is Graphic Design. One our first quarter, our professors will teach us most of the basic that will get us started. Later on to the second, third, and fourth quarter. We will built of our knowledge and create our unique designs. Fifth and Sixth quarter is when we're ready to go into the adult world. We will start doing things on our own, professors will help us with our portfolio piece that will help us to get ready to be in our internship."
College Senior,5,"My overall Experience at this school is fabulous. I've never went to vo-tech, but now; I can easily create brochures to posters to make a website all by myself. PTI is also a unique school because it's very hands-on. You get to work while learning. I would definitely choose this school again if I had another chance. My family was a little unset because I didn't go to the ""named"" school. Those famous school such as the Harvard, MIT, Art Insitute. But I enjoy everyday here, it is very challenging. I also am confident to complete with the AI students."
College Senior,5,Going to school here is super convient. Classes are offered at various times and teachers are super helpful and understanding when it comes to things such as emergencies.
College Senior,5,Career services is fantastic and is very involved in helping connect past and current students with internships and full time job placement.
College Senior,5,Small class sizes makes it easy for the teachers to connect with students instead of seeing them as just another number. This makes it easier and more enjoyable to learn.
College Senior,5,"The degree is fantastic and well respected. Many employers know that Pittsburgh Technical produces quality, hardworking students and they are eager to higher them."
College Senior,5,The Graphic Design major is well focused. It gives a good variety of learning that will help in a real world job.
College Senior,5,This school is a fantastic enviroment with great teachers
College Senior,5,"My experiences with online classes are amazing. They help save time by not driving to the campus if you only have one class that day and making it online helps everyone save time and money. The workload is more dependent upon the student seeing as though they are not on campus, but the teachers are available via email or phone call."
College Senior,5,"What makes my school unique is that the smaller class sizes actually allow teachers to learn your name and to remember you so say you have a question regarding English form your first quarter but your writing a paper in your fifth quarter you can go back to that same teacher and ask for help and they are more than willing to help you, because they actually care about how you do in your classes, and knowing you graduate makes them that much happier."
College Junior,5,The instructors teach amazingly well.
College Junior,5,I enjoy the Graphic Design Program.
College Junior,5,Always having career fairs and offers internships.
College Junior,5,I haven't make it yet to the step of internship but I'm sure it will be a great experience
College Junior,5,All the great Activities we do .
College Freshman,5,It's good so far enjoying myself
College Junior,5,Either finding job for you right now or if you need job 25 years later down the road to help you with your career
College Junior,5,Great career service department finding you part time jobs on campus and off campus. Also finding internship to complete your mandatory internships.
College Junior,5,"Hospitality management, the workload can be smaller or larger depending on major this one you need to memorize many codes and formulas. Rely on test to evaluate if you retained the material. the facilities are outstanding with all programs they use in the real world. internship in your 7th quarter and can do it where you wan to and get accepted to some popular is at Disney and White House for hospitality industry as well as Pittsburgh visitors bureau."
College Junior,5,"I enjoy the career services, which is what allowed me to make my decision to come here. My significant other went to school here and was able to find a job three days after graduation."
College Junior,5,This semester I only have 3 classes that they have been able to keep altogether aside from one class on Friday. There are no hassles or frustrations aside from  not knowing my schedule significantly in advanced
College Junior,5,It is a very quite facility and gives me great opportunities for the future
College Junior,5,"Like I said, all of the instructors are amazing and they have a very good balance between helping you and pushing you to do your best."
College Junior,5,"I am going to do my clinicals in some of the best hospitals in Pittsburgh, which I am extremely excited for. I cannot wait to get that on-hand experience."
College Junior,5,"The student body is extremely diverse. Though with my program I see a lot of very unfriendly people, I am meeting great people everywhere else who are extremely personable and easy to get along with."
College Junior,5,They bring you the paper that has your finances for the entirety that you are in school and the over all cost and break it down into quarters. They have financial assistance and plans for people like me who make very little and want to be able to find a career and not be stuck in a job.
College Junior,5,"Though I have no graduated yet, my boyfriend found a job three days after graduation"
College Junior,5,"Anatomy and Physiology 1 and 2, goes over the function and structure of the human body. Microbiology, is the study of microorganism and finding them in a lab. Intro to nursing goes over the ethics behind being a outstanding advocate for the patient. Critical Thinking, opening our mind so that we have the ability to ask if our decisions are logical and if this is our correct choice or path for our personal morals. It allows us to question our own judgement so that we can be the best we can be."
College Junior,5,All of the instructors are great. They are very helpful and give you useful information along with real-life skills that can be applied in my career. I am only in my first quarter and I feel as though I have learned more here than when I spent a year and a half at a community college. I can't wait to start my practice clinical next quarter!
College Sophomore,5,The professors are nice and helpful.
College Junior,5,the teacher are so willing to stay and help you and its great to know someone wants to help you
Junior,4,Since the corona virus has happened we have moved to online classes and for the most part is it not to bad but for some classes I would prefer to be at the college for.
Freshman,4,I enjoy Pittsburgh Technical College because it has a large variety of majors and different after class activities. One thing I would like to see change is some of the teachers. Though most of them are great one or two could be better in terms of responding to students or how they teach their classes.
Freshman,4,"I graduated from this schools LPN program. I felt as if i was properly prepared for the work force.I am now back for their LPN-ASN track program. I will say the school is very expensive. I am paying about $42,000 for an associates degree that will only take me 1 year to complete."
Freshman,4,My experience with PTC is very positive. They are very supportive of their students and they offer lots of different programs without the price tag of a major university.
Graduate Student,4,"PTC is a good college. All their programs teach you skills well beyond what you need for the field, and that will help you move up in your job. Student life is great and there are always events going on. I recommend it to people, especially looking at the Medical and CAD field"
Niche User,4,I love how hands on it will be. the food is great or so i have been told. the teachers are really nice.
Niche User,4,It was great to see that they have small classes and the professors are truly in gaged.  I think the off campus housing is not great and needs to be better maintained and safer for the students.
Niche User,4,"The school is small right now which can stink sometimes meeting new people; however, the attention I get from every single staff member is amazing. They preach they are a friendly bunch and they truly are! I would love to see this school grow to a full size I would highly recommend at least checking it out."
Freshman,4,"Friendly environment. Decent on-campus housing. All the instructors I've had so far are willing to help you with any issues. There are a number of student activities provided by the school, such as intramural sports, bonfires, game night, clubs, etc. This is a dry campus, meaning no alcohol, so there isn't much of a party life here."
Freshman,4,"PTC is a very amazing college, they take your needs into consideration, they don't teach you anything you don't need to know in your study, they make it very easy to study information and it's very easy to ask for help if you need it"
Sophomore,4,"The teachers and staff are all easy going. Just ask!  My instructors listen, offer advice, push me to think. Courses are challenging, but help is always available. I moved here and the apartments are super nice. Campus is nice and quiet, until activities kick in. The malls, stores are all nearby. Tons of restaurants and shopping. Met really nice friends here too. It's private, feels safe and someone is always around to help."
Niche User,4,Wonderful Teachers who are more than willing to help you and make sure that you will make you understand the knowledge to be a graphic designer.
Junior,4,It is a good college overall and haves great activities. It is just so far away and port authority is bad with their transportation. It is better to live on campus.
College Junior,4,"I did not make it to this process yet, but from what I hear they try there best to help out."
College Junior,4,The teachers love what they doo and they will do a lot to help a student out if he is willing to learn.
College Junior,4,My program does a lot of hands on work and I like that. I wished we can see how the pros handle a situation out in the job field.
College Junior,4,It is good I wish we had more field experience when it comes to learning the multimedia equipment. I want to get a chance to go into the real world and be on job sets to see how they approach the situation.
College Senior,4,We had a couple on-line course. They are helpful because it works with our schedule. We can also upload our work online. We also have discussion board with lets us to interact with classmates.
College Senior,4,I am not close to be on my intern yet. But the career center/service are very helpful according to many alumni guest speakers.
College Senior,4,The classes are easy to use and manage online. Instructors do their best to keep it simple to submit and access files along with accessing lectures.
College Senior,4,They have a career department which will help alumni throughout their life to find new jobs. Plus they use alumni to look at new internships or new employers of future graduates.
College Senior,4,I have to say that so far my experiences with the staff is amazing they are more than happy to help any student and if they can't they find someone who can.
College Senior,4,The value of the degree is amazing because it is middle states accredited meaning that most if not all of your credits will transfer to other colleges or universities nationwide.
College Senior,4,"The program I am in requires that you have a background check, the workload is not to bad, around your fifth quarter you will have a heavy workload but it will settle back down. Curriculum is somewhat demanding as you will learn some law and you will need a thorough understanding of the crimes code. The facility is relatively new and its one big building. They school also offers an internship as part of your graduation requirements, and it will help you with future jobs, if you so choose to continue to need help looking for one."
College Junior,4,Has a career services department.
College Junior,4,There's great teachers there they are very helping in always there .
College Junior,4,There's always a lot to do there
College Junior,4,So far I have had great experiences on different type of hands on things
College Junior,4,Students there are very respectful in ready to learn I leave on campus in lots of students like me that leave there are very nice in helpful .
College Junior,4,Courses some can be easier than others some professors no how to lecture and others rely on books powerpoints.
College Junior,4,It's great school for people who have difficult schedules and want an hands on learning experience with an great career service department that you can use for your whole lifetime for help with jobs and your career.
College Junior,4,I like the teachers and classes.
College Sophomore,4,"All the teachers are there to help you, they make it easy for your to grip the concept better and explain it more.."
College Sophomore,4,The instructors are very attentive.
College Sophomore,4,"The program is fairly challenging, I have an easy workload, the curriculum is up to date, and there are multiple job opportunities."
College Sophomore,4,close to home. 2 yr program. career focused
College Sophomore,4,I believe that this program is set up just as it should be to help me obtain a career and further my education. Close to home and exactly what I need to have a career
College Sophomore,4,registration was easy and very helpfull
College Sophomore,4,very detailed and career specific
College Sophomore,4,I love the campus and how the school is set up
College Junior,4,cause so far so good
College Junior,4,cause by being certified in some areas I didn't have to take the few classes
College Junior,4,the whole culinary arts program is amazing the teaches will spend one on one time with you and stay after to help you succeed
College Junior,4,I expected to have homework
College Junior,4,you get to interact with a lot of new people daily
College Junior,4,the whole campus just goes great with the people and the resources. every one here wants you to succeed and its great to know that
Recent Alumnus,4,the finacial aid was helpful in being there but they did not always seem to be stright forward
Recent Alumnus,4,I love the academic hands on work environment and the focus really great job there.
Recent Alumnus,4,They were focused and the teachers were great
College Senior,4,The labs are very good.
College Senior,4,There is new apple computers and free printing.
College Junior,4,"The student body at this school is diverse. Being located near a large city, it has a lot of students of different ethnicities and cultures."
College Junior,4,one unique thing about this school is how all classes are in the same building. There are no worries of getting lost while trying to get from on end of campus to the other.
College Junior,4,The school is down to earth and very student friendly. The faculty care about each student and ensure that help is given if it is needed.
College Senior,4,Its not as expensive as a four year program and most of the FASFA is applied
College Senior,4,The social scene is great the campus is great and conveient
College Senior,4,Career services are great they do their job to help
College Senior,4,They are friendly and do their best to help you with school
College Senior,4,I have only have 2 online courses and they were considered hybrid Online/ Classroom they were straight to the point and easy to navagate
College Senior,4,There are a great deal of electives the school offers. There are different programs to find for every career. The career department works well with students. The curriculum is awesome with a quick pace. Work/study is available
Alum,2,The school in many ways was average but the teaching staff was in many ways horrible. Not all teachers fell into this category of below averageness but the ones that do take the cake. One of the biggest problems me and some of my other classmates have had are with teachers not taking the time to do their job. A lot of teachers there will rely on automatic grading to do the job for them and some teachers wont put in grades at all. I failed a class because I was not given my online access and once I had it and did the late assignments they auto graded to 0 without the teacher taking the time to correct this.
Niche User,2,"When they start a new program it is always a huge mess! Yes, the teachers come from the field they are teaching in. However it doesn't mean they are well spoken or educated in life.  I had teachers making fun of certain religions! Joke was on them 😂 because a student in our class was that religion.  He handled it nicely and explained his religion to them. Which the whole class already knew about because we weren't ignorant.  These teachers couldn't leave it at that! We spent the next 3 days not learning about what we paid for! No we learned about this particular religion.  What a joke."
Alum,2,"My professors were all pretty knowledgeable, and were almost always willing to help. The cafeteria was also pretty decent; it offered a variety of foods to choose from at different times of the day/week. The on-campus dorms, on the other hand, were deplorable. Rooms were dirty when we moved in at the beginning of the semester (supposed to be cleaned). No enforced curfew, there were students outside at all hours of the night playing guitar, skateboarding, etc. I had to call security once due to a group outside skateboarding on the sidewalk until 4 in the morning. Avoid the housing and get an apartment with a friend if possible, it's awful and very overpriced for what it is."
College Sophomore,2,I come from a poor family due to my dad getting sick. I thought I would have got more help from Financial aid and getting more grants. My mom had to take out extra private loans so I don't have to pay 500 + a month while in school. So I do hope that it is all worth it when I do graduate
Recent Alumnus,2,the people in the senter are great but overall ive had a bad experience with it i couldnt get a job while in school and now that im done i still dont have one
College Senior,2,It is so overwhelming! the program is not organized and what we review is not even on the test! the workload and overwhelming and the curriculum doesn't make any sense and the teachers makes up the rules as it goes and doesn't even follow the curriculum. But other then that there are many internships and job opportunities available. The medical field is a great field to get into you just have to have the time and patients for it.
College Junior,2,"Set in Stone – There are (in most cases) only two groups studying the class. So, the classes are only given two chances to fit in your schedule and often the classes are overlapping, just in other teachers. If you plan on going here, keep an open schedule."
Freshman,1,"This FOR-PROFIT ""college"" is a total scam! Beware! Used to be Pittsburgh Technical INSTITUTE - changed their name to ""college"" overnight. No idea how they now say they are a ""non-profit traditional college,"" they are full of LIES. ""A higher standard"" is a COMPLETE LIE. Not an exaggeration, a total and complete lie. There is ZERO requirement to get in, except a check. Some of my classmates could not read. I left for a REAL college after I realized they accept anyone and they PASS EVERYONE, regardless if they should or not, just to collect your tuition money. Started talking to alumni -- NONE of them work in their field and NONE of them are making enough money to live. Everything in their TV ads is opposite of the truth. PTC IS A SCAM!"
Graduate Student,1,"Honestly if I could go back in time I would never go to PCT wish I never did. They don't help you with job placements. And even if you trying to better yourself they won't work with you. They will say one thing and then another don't even bother wasteing your money or time when you can go to a better school that will take the time to work with you. I know if I could go back in time I wouldn't choose PTC.
  Go to a school or trade where you can actually get a job in your field epically the design field."
Niche User,1,"This school is a joke. My son chose this school. He has an IEP so there was a possibility that he would need extra help. In all of our pre admission visits we were promised he would get any help needed. During his first quarter there, he never missed a day, was never late and turned in all projects. He received a call while on break that they were kicking him out because his work was not up to their standards. WHAT A JOKE!!! Shortly after we receive a letter that we owe them approximately $3000.00 and have 30 days to pay it. We have tried numerous times to speak to financial office to make arrangements but they NEVER return a phone call. I think this is their plan all along,  They had no intention of helping a student succeed. Just get whatever money they can from the family. I will scream from the rooftops to anyone who is looking at this joke of a school to go anywhere else."
College Senior,1,"Similar to the staff and classes, the campus and it's resources leave something to be desired. Athletic centers don't exist, the library is useless and small, hence avoided by almost all of the students. I don't really know of a student center, and the campus activities are childish pointless exercises with little to no entertainment value, like ""cupcake decorating night"". People literally just show up to grab some free food and leave-there is no meeting new people or learning new things here, and little opportunity and motivation in your life and future career to be found."
College Junior,1,"If you're shy don't bother coming here. It's been 3 months, and I only have one friend."
College Junior,1,"One of the teachers talks to much about her personal life, and I haven't learned anything in another class. We listen to the teacher read from the book, and watch tv episodes and a few movies."
College Junior,1,"Too Easy – Recommended you find another school to go to.

I've been here for three quarters and I plan on dropping out to find another school. The criminal justice program here leaves so much out and honestly, even with my honors in my classes, I don't see myself getting the challenge or the training I will need for any security, criminal justice or safety career I will ever go in to. The teachers hold your hand through everything to the point that some of the more incompetent students here do almost as well as my with their scores.

(And I've heard whispers from students that all the other classes here are just as easy.)"

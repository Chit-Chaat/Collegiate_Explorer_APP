Alum,5,"I liked Rocky Mountain College because of its small tight-nit community and the small student-teacher ratio. It gave me the undivided attention I needed that I believe helped me succeed. Student, staff, and faculty were friendly and helpful. The campus was also beautiful and small."
Alum,5,"I did not take any online classes at Rocky, but I know online classes are offered in many different subjects."
Sophomore,5,"I thoroughly enjoy Rocky Mountain college, the educators, the students and the campus itself.  The small campus is very community orientated, offering many volunteering opportunities. A small campus also means smaller classes in which you really get to know other students and the teachers who are all highly qualified to teach what they are teaching.  Living off campus I don't see much of what the dorms are like but from what I have seen they are not much different from any others that I have seen and the students are all so inclusive of others.  Overall Rocky Mountain College is a wonderful school to obtain your degree or even further your education at."
Freshman,5,The environment on campus is fantastic! Everyone is super kind and helpful. Rocky has become my new home!
Freshman,5,"Very friendly staff and students. Beautiful campus situated in Billings with an overall small student body giving it a very home like feeling. Staff are always there to help you, and the college doesn't have a bunch of hidden fees like most universities these days. Overall I love RMC!"
Junior,5,It is a close knit community with great people. I love the atmosphere and environment it brings to its students. I love Rocky Mountain College.
Alum,5,"I had the best time when I went here for my undergrad. Met some amazing friends, learned a lot from supportive professors, and enjoyed seeing the sights in the region. I enjoyed the music program as well as the sciences. The campus is beautiful in the spring and there's lots of skiing nearby if you enjoy that. The campus is very walkable, not too huge. There are jobs nearby at the mall also."
Junior,5,"Rocky Mountain College has a small friendly and active community on a beautiful campus, with amazing faculty."
Junior,5,"Rocky Mountain College is a great college that offers students great opportunities.  It is located in Billings, which is the largest city in Montana.  The class sizes are small, so there is a Professor to Student relationship, and that is very valuable.  Rocky also offers a ton of scholarships for both scholars and student - athletes.  There are multiple sports teams, and the professors are very accommodating to them when traveling as well."
Sophomore,5,Rocky is a great small school with Professors that care about the success of their students. I love the tight knit community.
Freshman,5,"Rocky is a great small school. The professors are incredible. The atmosphere in campus is super inviting and there is always something to do on campus. Class sizes are small which allows for better understanding of the material. Everyone feels safe on campus and there's an overall air of happiness. However, being a small school in Montana, there's not a whole lot of diversity which is kind of a drawback. The food also isn't 5-star by any means, but there's always a ton of options. The residence halls are what you make of it; a lot of people complain about them but really the halls aren't terrible and the Resident Advisors are incredible people and make living on campus so much fun!"
Freshman,5,"Rocky is a very good school and I have been able to learn a ton there!  There are nice and intelligent professors, the staff is great, and the kids are interesting being from everywhere!  I am glad I go there it is a great school!"
Freshman,5,I like everything about Rocky Mountain College.  There are very knowledgeable staff and it is a very nice environment to be in.  I wish there would be a more experienced Chemistry teacher instead of one just starting this year.
Sophomore,5,"RMC is a smaller college, but has so much to offer. Professors and staff are so willing to help out the students. There are awesome events offered through the college. Campus is so beautiful. RMC is rich in it's history. There are so many opportunities on campus to grow in leadership skills."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love how all the faculty and staff members are willing and ready to help any student. Being a very anxious person makes it hard for me to ask for help and at Rocky I feel like none of my questions will be regarded as ""stupid"" and whoever I ask will gladly answer. Truthfully, I don't dislike almost anything about Rocky, yet there is one thing that does bother me: there is no track! Even though we have cross country and track/field teams, there is not a track on our campus. As a college student, I hate going to a (terrible) high school track to run. Other than that, I think Rocky Mountain College is doing a great job."
College Junior,5,"Rocky has something for everyone I feel and is the best fit for me because of the small, size the personal touch of the professors and staff, and the various opportunities."
College Junior,5,Rocky looks after its students from the minute that the student applies. It is difficult for the student to fall through the cracks. The students get to know numerous other people and the professors/staff very well. Overall an astounding experience.
College Junior,5,This school provides so many opportunities for students to get out and connect with each other and the professors. Numerous class trips and extracurricular field trips allow students to explore the city and the region.
College Sophomore,5,I have been extremely pleased with the personal attention paid to students by the faculty.  The enrollment is small enough to allow for this atmosphere.
College Sophomore,5,My career path is unique.  Rocky Mountain College provides that unique path as a major course of study.
College Sophomore,5,The campus population is very focused.  I was not aware of any assault issues.
College Sophomore,5,"My experience at Rocky Mountain College has excelled above and beyond my views of college prior to attending. Rocky Mountain College is small. Because of this the teachers are open to suggestion and are always available to you for assistance or guidance. I can say I personally know all of my professors in addition to the majority of the student body at Rocky Mountain College. Its a community, students and faculty notice when you're struggling and can't act fast enough to provide assistance."
College Freshman,5,Rocky really focuses on helping their students get into the real world and finding internships that they will learn from and enjoy.
College Junior,5,"I love Rocky. We believe in community and intentional relationships, and that's really the environment I've been given going to school here. I've had class sizes of five people before, making it entirely possible to actually get to know the professors beyond a superficial level."
Recent Alumnus,5,professors care and are available. first name basis
Recent Alumnus,5,students get good jobs and great graduate acceptance
Recent Alumnus,5,small and personable. teachers care
College Freshman,5,"Montana people have a lot of pride in their schools..more so with the Universities. RMC is a smaller private school and the local community has embraced it. We have local people who will take us after games to eat and they even helped us set up our dorm rooms. The coach even helped organize our dorm room! We are a highly competitive program that makes to NAIA Nationals every year. RMC knows that it can be hard to be a student athlete and they/teachers really work with you so that you do not get behind during the season.

Students support all the teams and are crucial to the energy level at game time. Our facilities are adequate and are even open to the public for a fee. Elderly folks work out then go have coffee in our dining hall which is neat."
College Freshman,5,"I chose RMC for 3 reasons-size,major and volleyball program. I was recruited to play volleyball but it was RMC'S Equine program that sealed the deal. RMC is about the size of the high school that I graduated from which gives it a small home town type atmosphere. I'm not getting lost in the crowd and I love that my teacher will yell my grade from a recent assignment to me from across the campus!

All the staff care about you and want you to succeed. We even have local people that feed us and take us grocery shopping.

My coach treats me like her own children and adopts me when i cannot travel home. 

I'm sick of eating pizza,but that seems to be the only food students can afford. I never get enough sleep and i'm never alone(dorm!)..but college life at RMC will make me ready for the big bad adult world that is coming upon graduation!"
College Sophomore,5,Most of the classes and work loads are very manageable. The library is great to be able to study and there are times the tutors are available to help. The writing center is also great to go get a lot of help on essay assignments.
College Sophomore,5,love the career day on campus just wish it lasted longer
College Sophomore,5,little pricey and food could be better
College Sophomore,5,I love my college choice and I'm very proud of the Aviation Program at Rocky Mountain College
College Student,5,I love the school and the faculty and students on campus. Everyone is like a large happy family that is always there when in need of help or anything in general. I feel welcomed and safe on campus. The classes are small making communication and comfortability more convenient with professors and other students.
College Senior,5,"I love the small size of the school. This creates a small atmosphere where I get to know the other students in my classes as well as the professors personally. Additionally, it offers a great deal of hands on learning rather than large lecture classes. Furthermore, it offers all sorts of fun free programs for students to meet friends and have fun. I love how students get to play such an active role in the running of the school with leadership programs and activities. I could not have picked a better school."
College Sophomore,5,The people are the friendliest.
College Freshman,5,"I had no problem receiving financial aid, I received the financial aid simply upon being accepted at the school adn by having good grades in high school."
College Sophomore,5,It is a great fit for me.  I like the way the professors and other staff are so oriented toward helping students succeed.  They all see it as their job to help me complete my formal education.
College Sophomore,5,"Rocky is a private college and is quite costly. However, Rocky offers great scholarships and financial aid so it can be affordable for any student. Most students receive an academic scholarship and an athletic scholarship. My academic scholarship alone covers half my tuition. I do qualify for financial aid and it picks up the rest of my tuition. Applying for financial aid was fast and easy."
College Sophomore,5,"Rocky employs the best professors. I am only a sophomore, however, I have enjoyed all my professors so far. All my professors know my name and care about my success. Nearly all the professors are readily avaiable outside of class to help someone if they need extra assistance. I like the school because professors take attendance, and if someone is repeatedly absent they try to track down that student and make sure everything is alright with the student. "
Freshman,4,"The food is absolutely terrible. It's a rip off for how much you have to pay, especially since you have to have a meal plan when living on campus. The options are limited. Pizza is almost always served at lunch. The meat is always sketchy.  Food is often cold. We get our moneys worth by taking juices and stocking our own fridge. I live in a triple in widenhouse and we got really lucky. Our room is one of the few that has hardwood flooring and a nice view. People here are fun and everyone knows each other since the school is so small. Most of the diversity  comes from the football team and international students. Bring a car. Dear lord bring your car. The Rims are super nice to sit at at night and look at the city lights. Teachers are nice and genuinely care. Campus is beautiful, it looks like Hogwarts. Bottom line: Food horrific, people good."
Freshman,4,Rocky is a fantastic campus with a lot of diversity. The professors are great and want to help you succeed. It is more difficult for nontraditional students to fit in since most incoming students are right out of high school.
Alum,4,"I loved how small Rocky was- -I made excellent connections with my teachers, which opened up a ton of opportunities for me! The surrounding city was small and old-fashioned, which isn't my style but might suit other people quite well.  Furthermore, for coming out with less debt than I would have had at my state school, I'd say it was a great deal! Anyone who's satisfied with a basic degree (art, bio, etc) would probably do well here."
Freshman,4,"Rocky is a wonderful small safe campus with some outstanding outdoor recreation activities open to all! Many shops eating places, gas & more close to campus."
Senior,4,"Hands on instructing.  Smaller college with great professors, this allows you to have the ability to get a lot of one on one time.  The staff is very helpful and truly care about your success."
Freshman,4,I am a freshman in the Equine program and I am loving it. The campus is small so it is very easy to get to know your professors and classmates. There are also tons of activities to be involved in as well as academic assistance.  
College Junior,4,It is unfortunate that many of the athletics feel that alcohol is the only way to have a good time and often attempt to drag in Freshmen into the drinking scene.
College Junior,4,There are numerous resources that provide Health and safety on campus. A campus safety office is staffed every night and completes rounds around the college to insure everyone is safe. The office will also walk students from buildings to cars or to other buildings it the student is feeling unsafe. A campus counselor and chaplain are on staff if a student has an issue or just needs a person to confide in. The college employs RAs in the residence halls to keep the students safe and out of trouble.
College Junior,4,Generally the housing is decent. RAs do a good job at promoting programs and enforcing policies. Lately it has been difficult to get residents to attend programs meaning the community building has been difficult. Overall the social atmosphere is relaxed but still playful.
College Sophomore,4,My room location and assigned roommates was great.  I'm looking forward to moving into the Sophomore dorm.
College Freshman,4,The curriculum is harder because it is a private liberal arts school the professors are great and with a smaller student body you get to know them better and have more of a chance to get their help if needed.
College Freshman,4,The diversity on campus is great there are a lot of foreign exchange students from around the world which adds a lot to life on campus.
College Freshman,4,We have lots of people patrolling around and a direct connection to the police.
College Freshman,4,"Overall it's great, some people just don't make sense. As in most of the population is form Montana and kind of shun others it feels like (to me at least)"
College Freshman,4,Im not an athlete so I haven't really seen where they go. But the gym looks really nice
College Freshman,4,"because Rocky is such a small school that you meet just about everyone on campus i feel incredibly safe on campus, as do most students."
College Freshman,4,i love that Rocky is liberal arts and focuses on all subjects. i also really enjoy the classes sizes and that you get to know your professors better.
College Freshman,4,the career center on campus is great with working with local employers for students who want part time jobs that relate to their fields.
College Freshman,4,"the athletic department is one of the biggest departments on campus and the majority of the student body are athletes, meaning we have a lot of teams to support."
College Freshman,4,i love that Rocky Mountain is smaller which is great for easier and more comfortable classes and yet we still have excellent resources for the students. being a small school also makes for a more comfortable and closer community on campus.
College Freshman,4,Rocky is a small school so everyone knows everyone so you feel very safe.
College Freshman,4,Rocky is very small so it is easy to get into classes that you want even if you are a freshman.
College Freshman,4,All of the dorms are very close to the classrooms but it's fairly expensive.
College Freshman,4,Rocky is a fairly small school with an average class size of 20. It sometimes feels like high school but at the same time it doesn't you can have a close relationship with professors and can feel comfortable asking them questions.
College Junior,4,The aviation professor are very interesting people and have interesting stories.
College Junior,4,Sports are important but a lot of emphasize is put into football.
Recent Alumnus,4,dark in areas but safe to walk alone across campus
College Sophomore,4,The campus is pretty diverse for the school being in Montana. There are several international students so that makes the campus much more diverse.
College Sophomore,4,"There is some drinking and drug use, but this school is trying to become a tobacco free campus so that's good."
College Sophomore,4,"The class sizes are great and the professors are knowledgeable about what they are teaching. Although some hats the liberal arts aspect of the college, I think it is great because I can take different classes that don't apply to my major."
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the students at the school are in a sport team, so sports are very important as t the xchool, although some of the games go unnoticed."
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoy the small population and the small class sizes. The professors all know me personally in my department and I can always go to them if I need help in a class or just need to unload all my problems on them. This is why I decided on this school and it was worth it.
College Sophomore,4,always could be better. would feel safer if loud parties did not happen at 2 am
College Sophomore,4,sometimes they are hard to find
College Sophomore,4,athletes tend to cause disturbances at night.
College Freshman,4,"The community is really close and supportive. The small student body really allows everybody the change to get to know each other. There are plenty of oppertunities to get envolved on campus through clubs, sports, and school sponsered activies. The biggest downside is that class offerings can be limited putting stress on athletes and some majors to be able to work out a class schedule."
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of places to go see movies, go shopping and go to concerts"
College Freshman,4,"It is not segregated, and the social life between the two is good."
College Freshman,4,"There are always 3-4 choices at lunch, plus a salad bar and the grill."
College Freshman,4,The only complaint are the cleanliness of the bathrooms and showers.
College Freshman,4,i actually quite like it.
College Freshman,4,They have regular security and i feel pretty safe.
College Sophomore,4,Its amazing and gives you a chance to step out of your comfort zone and meet new people. :)
College Sophomore,4,"Student Participation in Athletics is huge in my school, and the fan base is tremendous. The fans are the best part of participating, they make it worth it."
College Sophomore,4,The rocktivities program allows for so many friday night events as well as before and after sports party. The debate team is growing and allows for one on one coaching.
College Sophomore,4,The school has so much history within the buildings. Three of the buildings on campus were built by the first class at the school. Also by being a small private college there is plenty of time and availability of professor for one on one teaching and mentoring.
College Sophomore,4,Rocky offers a lot of majors that other schools do not have. They also call the students and ask questions about classes so that the school can improve each major. By knowing that your major is only offered at a few colleges helps the retention rates and the professors put in more effort to help each student.
College Sophomore,4,"I am a Social Studies Broadfield Education Major. I love this major, the school offers so many classes in specific areas that i feel as if I am extremely prepared for becoming a teacher."
College Sophomore,4,"My favorite off campus dining is Salad Creations. They do not have only salads, but they offer paninis , wraps, and soup bowls as well. The customer service is great and the student special is a salad, chips, and a medium fountain drink. They also offer punch cards which after 10 times you get a free salad. All the salads that they offer are amazing and I have never left unsatisfied."
College Junior,4,Our soccer team is the best cheering section. They go to every game and support every team enthusiastically. Our facility isn't very good for athletes or students. We share all the amenities but they aren't very good. My highschool had a better set up.
College Junior,4,"There are a lot of athletes and the biology program has pretty cute guys, most of which are smart. Most people don't really take the time to dress nice except for some of the girls, but guy wise they just wear sweats."
College Junior,4,There is a lot of room on campus for us to just hang out outside and play games.The school does a good job with all the different recreational activities which are really fun! We set up laser tag in our gym recently. Way cool.
College Junior,4,"There are many different ethnic groups from all the different foreign exchange students. The only racial diversity comes from the sports programs which bring in other races. Other than that, other races don't really just come to Rocky. We do have a BGLTS alliance club on campus and multiple christian clubs, but no other religion oriented clubs, though there are people with different religions on campus."
College Junior,4,"There are a lot of internship and job opportunities posted around campus. Different professors and majors have more or less coursework. For biology there is a lot of time with labs that are being invested and then on top of that there is a lot of homework. Then compare that to psychology majors (I am both) there is barely any homework and the stuff that is assigned is easy. We have a pretty good music program and facilities for them, or at least it seems that way, and the theatre department has opportunities for plays on and off campus and the plays that I have seen have been really good."
College Junior,4,"The school itself has pretty strict policies about drinking and drugs in the dorms but the RAs usually stay out of that business unless they directly see it or are given complaints about it. That being said, the drinking and drug use isn't really a problem. The thing that like about the athletic program is their policy towards drunk and alcohol use. Coaches can set up more strict rules but the school's policy allows the student to receive counseling if caught doing drugs that way they can be rehabbed."
College Senior,4,"Aside from a lack of organized events, the dorms are quite nice.  We have free laundry, computer labs (though I wish the ones in the dorms had printers, for convenience), and as long as things aren't broken (though it does happen often...), there's plenty of heat for the room and showers, which is nice.  Dorms here, like anywhere, are a little pricey, but considering the cost of apartments around here, they're pretty standard."
Recent Alumnus,4,I didn't live there but it was nice
Recent Alumnus,4,drugs are not very noticeable and alcohol is noticable
Recent Alumnus,4,The cost is ok and the variety is great
College Freshman,4,"I pretty much get all the classes i want. I like how before you can register, you have to meet with your academic advisor so he can lift the hold that prevents you from registering."
College Sophomore,2,"noisy neighbors, and things are already broken when one moves in. the space is pretty nice in Jorge though"
College Senior,2,"Saying there's an atmosphere at all is quite generous.  Only one type of person can have a good time in Montana: the hiking/outdoorsy type.  I think it's great to have so many outdoorsy options, but there's more to a city than that, and it makes it pretty impossible to meet new people.  Practically no-one has any idea what to do around town, not even the locals."
College Senior,2,"Since the school is tiny, the most one might need to get around campus is a bike.  However, if one has taste buds and would like to eat real food (instead of the cafeteria ""food""), a car is quite necessary to get around town since the taxis are unreliable, and the public transportation is practically nonexistent."
Recent Alumnus,2,no public or campus transportation in that area
College Freshman,2,This year we had terrible weather. It was in the negatives for awhile and the snow just kept coming nonstop.
College Sophomore,2,I don't party off campus but others say it is okay!
College Sophomore,2,Not too strict but not too lenient.
College Sophomore,2,I think the opportunities are there but I haven't researched them yet.
College Sophomore,2,It is okay I guess.
College Sophomore,2,I don't feel as secure as I would like to be!
College Sophomore,2,They try but not as hard as they should.
College Sophomore,2,The men on campus aren't very attractive. There are a few decent looking men but most are geeky looking or too into partying to be attractive. 
College Sophomore,2,Students are required to live in the on school housing until they are juniors which costs more than living off campus. Students that live off campus have limited parking and it's hard to get a good spot. 
College Sophomore,2,I have my own laptop but I use the school computers to print off paperwork. The computers are slow and the labs are usually pretty packed. 
College Sophomore,2,I was a varsity athlete last year and was treated a lot better than this year when I just played the intermural sports. The school spirit is very much lacking. 
College Sophomore,2,My school has very poor student activity. There are a lot of different activities but not very many people like to engage in the activities which makes it awkward to participate. 
College Sophomore,2,The amenities aren't very up to date and don't work
College Sophomore,2,The spaces are nice but there's a lack of people
College Junior,2,It's all just fast food and you have to walk a mile or more to get to an food service place. There's very limited healthy sinning places.
College Junior,2,I know there are options and ways but haven't really heard of any. Plus I have a car so don't really pay attention to that kind of stuff.
College Freshman,1,We don't have greek life
College Freshman,1,at Rocky we do not have Greek life because of our size.
College Sophomore,1,to loud at 2 am almost any night of the week.
College Sophomore,1,too many of them going on in the dorms
College Senior,1,"It's extremely cold.  It makes it hard to do many social activities or ""outdoorsy"" events for those who are sensitive to the cold.  It's something that has to be taken with a grain of salt, since the school is great, but the state is not."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't know anything about the Greek life on Campus here, I'm not even sure if we have any."
College Sophomore,1,I hate winter and I'm going to school in Montana so it's my own fault but the sidewalks and walkways are very icy when trying to get to class on time.
College Sophomore,1,The only way to get transportation is to use my own car or get a ride from a friend. 
College Sophomore,1,I pay 10$ per meal and I would rather go out to eat than eat the caf food. It doesn't taste very good and it is most def not worth 10$ a meal. 
College Sophomore,1,"I barely got any financial aid, it came from scholarships "
College Sophomore,1,The only form of transportation other than a students own vehicle is a private taxi service.
College Freshman,1,"There really isn't any sort of nightlife. There are some bars and casinos you can go to if you're of age. Otherwise there is a campfire every now and then, or you can go bowling, or roller skating but you would need a car to get there."
College Freshman,1,"Bring a car. They will tell you, you don't need one but you do."

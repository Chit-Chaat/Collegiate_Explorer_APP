Freshman,5,"Giving them the benefit of the doubt because I am accepted and trying to enroll for fall, but haven't taken classes yet."
Freshman,5,"So far, everyone I've encountered here has been helpful and friendly.  I hope classes resume normally in the fall!"
Freshman,5,"As like everyone else, I had my doubts about DuBois at first. All it took was a visit, and orientation to make me love the college and the area. You have your mcdonalds, red lobster, and walmart right down the road, a close knit community on a small 5 acre campus, student housing right around the corner, and a sense of belonging. Currently I am entering my first year tomorrow."
Freshman,5,"I love it. The teachers are amazing and the degree that I'm going for is just fun to learn! You get to go outside and enjoy all of the great outdoors for some labs and learn a lot of the animals, plants and agriculture practices to help the ecosystem"
Alum,5,Great college for any age.  I started college here when I was in my 30’s and they treated me just as good as a 20 something!  I’m not kidding this college is great for any age!
Freshman,5,"I love the school so far. It’s only my first year, but I feel very comfortable attending here. The teachers are very nice and helpful. The school environment is so inviting and there are many events. I really love how everyone is so kind to each other here. I would not change anything at this moment at Penn State DuBois"
Freshman,5,"It was not at all what I expected and that's a good thing! The atmosphere here is great, the profesora actually know who you are and get to know you and the people I have met are amazing, they are like a small family."
College Junior,5,"I am a first time student at a college with credits. I love Penn State DuBois and would recommend this college and have recommended this college to other potential students. I talked my niece into coming to Penn State, she will be attending in the fall."
College Junior,5,"I love the online classes and the services for online exams, study guides, emails. I have only had partial online involvement this year, but I will be taking an online course next semester so that I can work more hrs. at my job. I have heard the online course I am taking next semester is a good course."
College Junior,5,I have been told that they are very good.
College Junior,5,"I believe that my major is a highly rated career in my area and surrounding areas. I have not yet used the networking that the school has set up for students, as it is my first year, but will be checking into them this year."
College Junior,5,"Most courses are directed to your majors. The hardest course that I had to take was anatomy and physiology. This course is extremely hard, but the instructor and the university want you to succeed and attempt to help you in every way possible. They employ tutors to help you, and the instructors make themselves available for help. Class size has never been an issue; every instructor knew me by name and knew my personal strength and weaknesses."
College Junior,5,"My major is occupational therapist assistant. I have learned a lot. The workload is a lot but I know that what they are teaching me is what I need to succeed in my career choice. They help in any way they can to make u you successful. They tell you what other students have done to succeed, they employ student tutors to help you with homework and exams, and the instructors will help with difficulties in any curriculum."
College Junior,5,"Love my college choice. Penn State DuBois is a small campass with caring and knowledgeable instructors, that truly want you to succeed."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are very helpful and relatable, but also have high standards for their students.  Professors are understanding when students need extra help, and expect students to understand the lessons if they do not have questions."
College Freshman,5,"My major is Bioengineering which is not currently offered at a branch campus, however, I attend this campus, because it is close to home and credits are easily transferred for classes I need to pursue my major. This major is rapidly growing and is furthering the health care field. The development of new medicines, devices, instrumentation, and methods is what enables us to further our health in our society, while also maintaining its health. The major is heavily loaded with classes in the Bioengineering field once I transfer to the main university. My workload is quite intense now as well, with research I partake in on the side in a Chemistry lab along with, the main weights of my classes focused primarily in Physics, Math, and Engineering classes."
College Sophomore,5,"I love the online courses i have taken, minus one. But i just believe that it was the professor and not the course itself. Most professors, especially one, are extreamly helpful and they way he was his online class set, has given me the ability to know how to teach myself information easily."
College Senior,5,"Wildlife Technology – I love my major. We do so many hands-on activities that actually get us out in the field. We have 4 hour labs, normally outside. All of the things we learn are things we may need to know in the future, and information we can pass on to other people even outside of our major. The facaulty is astounding. They seem to be in their offices most of the time during a regular school day. They are very helpful and have available office hours. There are many job and internship opportunities with my major as well and our some of our facaulty make them known to us"
College Freshman,5,"I Love Penn State – I love the standard of education at Penn state university. I like that I get a personalized education at a small side campus. Class sizes are small, so a student is encouraged to participate in learning and to seek additional help. I work in the peer tutoring center, and we are busy every day with a flow of students seeking extra help. It truly is an amazing place."
Freshman,4,"Very friendly and welcoming staff and professors, faculty are eager to help and know what they are doing and must do to help students."
Sophomore,4,I like that it is a small campus. The professors are always willing to help out. There is no on campus housing. Over all it is a really good school.
Freshman,4,"The experience with Penn State DuBois has been great.  Its small enough so that classes are not packed, and you actually get the chance to talk with your professors.   There is always something going on with the Campus Activities Board so events and free stuff are always available."
College Junior,4,They are willing to help you with job/internship prospects. I believe a Penn State degree is well received and recognized.
College Junior,4,"Pros: I appreciate the small class size. It allows you to get to know your classmates and professors and you are able to receive one on one attention if need be.

Cons: The ""filler"" (e.g. humanitarian) class options aren't as great. We don't have the same variety that you would probably get from a larger school/campus."
College Junior,4,"I'm very new, but so far it's been a positive experience. My classmates and I are all very close, and I've made a lot of wonderful friendships. My professors are very knowledgeable and are also kind and helpful. The workload is pretty substantial, but there are study groups and tutors available if you need extra help."
College Junior,4,"I appreciate attending classes at a smaller campus because it gives you the opportunity to make close friends, become well known to your professors, maneuver around campus easily and overall just feel at home."
College Freshman,4,"At Penn State DuBois, everyone knows everyone.  The most important thing to remember is to put yourself out there, try new things, and take advantage of everything there is to offer.  For being mostly a commuter campus, there are so many FREE things to do on campus.  The clubs are always organizing new, fun things to do.  DON'T BE AFRAID TO GO!!  IT'S FREE!!!  Be nice to your teachers and at least pretend you care.  They will do ANYTHING to make you succeed if they know you're trying.  Being at a small campus and staying at home my first year is the best choice I could make.  My grades are awesome, my friends are awesome, and Penn State is awesome."
College Freshman,4,"If I had the option to choose my school again, I would. My experience has been very enlightening."
College Freshman,4,"The workload for Wildlife Technology students here is large, but purposeful. My campus has a high rating of graduates who are guaranteed work after college because of the high standards students have to live up to in order to pass."
College Freshman,4,"My campus has a small library, but that library is connected to every other campus of my university. If there is a book that a student needs from another campus, they can fill out a request to have it mailed here. It is a good way to make sure that students have access to what they need."
College Junior,4,"The alumni networking is great, they try to get many people involved with it."
College Junior,4,There are many different types of students and there is typically no drama or fighting and everyone is helpful to everyone else.
College Junior,4,"The campus activities are great, we as students are the ones who get to choose what types of things are done which makes it a lot of fun. The library is newly remodeled and has a lot of space in it to study."
College Junior,4,"I love online courses, everything can be done at your own pace and the professors are great and help as much as possible."
College Junior,4,The financial aid staff are very polite and very helpful when it comes to helping us with paying for school.
College Senior,4,"There is a wide variety of students at PSUD. There are many adult learners along with many high school seniors who come to get a head start on college and many in between. We have all races and ethnicity. Although there are vast differences, everyone is so helpful towards each other and so friendly."
College Sophomore,4,"Everything as well is easy accessible. Its a small campus, but there are many different opportunities."
College Sophomore,4,Everything is easily accessible! At Penn state Dubois we have proficient computer labs in every single building!
College Senior,4,"Sometimes the printers get weird and don't print but  majority of the time, everything works pretty well. There are a lot of computers available."
College Sophomore,2,"The population is not diverse, ethnically or religious or sexual."
College Sophomore,2,Computer Science – Computer Science online was good. It was very easy to submit work but terrible to send emails because you dont have that face to face relationship. Registration was difficult and there is no peer to peer interaction. Trying to reach each other is a hassle. I rate it a C
College Sophomore,1,"There is nothing too unique about my individual campus, its all just a part of the Penn states 2 plus 2 program giving students opportunities in towns closer to their homes."

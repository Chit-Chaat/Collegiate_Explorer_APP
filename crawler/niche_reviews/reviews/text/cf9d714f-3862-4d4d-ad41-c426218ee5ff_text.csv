Alum,5,I had a good experience at Anderson University. I think the school needed to inform students more on the requirements for teacher certification.
Freshman,5,I love it here it has a beautiful campus and there is always something to do and see here. the places surronding campus are very cute too
Freshman,5,i haven't started yet but so far its going good. i am excited to see how they go and im excited to be in my pjs
Alum,5,Online courses with AU are well organized. They use canvas as their learning platform which has always provided smooth navigation and ways to communicate with professors and peers.
Junior,5,"Anderson university is a wonderful school. The atmosphere is probably my favorite thing. Everyone is so kind and generous. It’s a place with only happy thoughts, and its almost impossible not to be surrounded by friends and people who love you.  Not only is it fun and nice but the classes are not too complex and because the classes are smaller its easier to focus and talk with professors. It has only brought me joy and happiness and I cant wait to continue the rest of my years here. Anderson has stolen my heart."
Junior,5,"Because of the recent pandemic we were forced to go online. Something that everyone dreaded became something easy and yes not the same as in person, but it still was a great experience. I was in choir and because of online we had to virtual choir. It was Anderson’s first. But they did everything to make it fun and unique. Everyone still participated and we were able to make history for the school. Not only that class but all classes online were easy to follow and all professors were understanding."
Sophomore,5,"The environment at AU is very warm and welcoming. Everyone that I have met there has been very nice, and everyone makes an effort to be friendly. The professors are great about working with you, and helping you get your assignments done. The professors are all very good teachers. All of the staff is great, and they are all very friendly."
Freshman,5,"Anderson is wonderful university where everyone is friendly and welcoming. No matter where you are on campus, there is always someone to give you a friendly smile or say ""hello."" The professors work hard to create solid relationships with the students to ensure that they learn the most they can throughout every class."
Freshman,5,The same care and investment that goes on within the classroom is also present online. Students are able to reach out to their professors and receive responses and aid quickly. The online portion of the classes are well organized and easy to navigate through.
Junior,5,The size of the campus is perfect for me. I’ve made some great friends. The nursing major has been a great opportunity for learning and the simulation lab is excellent!! I’ve had a lot of opportunities in my major.  The professors are always available and helpful!! I love being at AU and the opportunity I have!!
Sophomore,5,"I am a sophomore at Anderson University, and just in that short time I cannot imagine myself going to college anywhere else. The atmosphere is incredibly welcoming, with caring professors who truly want to see their students succeed. Small class sizes encourage student-professor relationships and small campus size encourages relationships with the many people you pass each day. Anderson University feels like a home away from home."
Freshman,5,The professors are great and the campus makes sure there are a lot of things to participate in other than academics.
Niche User,5,I loved the environment. There's this sense of hospitality and pure love. You feel very welcomed and everyone treats you like you belong.
Niche User,5,"Anderson University is a great Christian University. All the professors are very kind and helpful. The campus is very safe and people are always willing to help when you need it. Because of the smaller campus, the environment is more intimate and it is easier for students to get to know their professors and their classmates."
Freshman,5,"Many opportunities are given, professors are caring and personable. Beautiful campus. You can tell your money is well spent on not only academics but the look of the school."
Freshman,5,I am a freshman at Anderson and it is been a great experience so far! Everything that Anderson does is very intentional and beneficial. There is nothing bad that I have to say because everything and everyone is kind and helpful.
Niche User,5,"Anderson University was the most energetic and friendly campus I have visited. The students overall attitude was happy and intentional, it was very easy to see that the students love their college. The school is the perfect size, not being too small or too big. The class sizes sounded perfect, averaging about 28 per class. I would like to see even more people join this college!"
Niche User,5,"I do not currently attend Anderson University, but I would like to. My guidance counselor attended and suggested this school to me. She said it was a great school and a great opportunity for me. I am planning to do a tour of the campus soon."
Alum,5,"This school, specifically the psychology department, went above and beyond. The students were able to create a strong relationship with their professors in this department because of the class sizes. Along with strong relationships built, the professors taught in a style that made learning fun and easy. This department also made me feel very prepared for Graduate school because of the information they taught us and how hard they were on us."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Anderson! The campus is beautiful, and the professors are great at their job and they care about you as a person. The students are very friendly, and the food in the Cafeteria is pretty good too! We also have great events!"
Freshman,5,I love Anderson. The community and friendships that you find there are irreplaceable and like none other.
Junior,5,"Anderson is a great school that has a lot of opportunities! Professors are amazing, care about the students, and are very invested in the students."
Freshman,5,"Anderson University has such a beautiful campus and atmosphere. There are so many people that love the Lord. There are so many ways to be involved and feel like you are a part of a family here on campus. The ministries, faculty and staff are all very good and make you feel like you belong and are where you need to be."
Niche User,5,I love the Christian Environment! I feel like this university really strengthens your faith and makes you feel welcome. Small and close-knit.
Niche User,5,I am going to be a freshman at Anderson University in South Carolina in the fall of 2019. It is a very nice school and I highly recommended it.
Freshman,5,"I have loved every minute of being at Anderson University. Their small, but welcoming community, beautiful campus, encouraging staff and professors, and rigorous academics are what makes Anderson a great school to attend."
Sophomore,5,"I love the small, yet amazing atmosphere at Anderson University. I feel like I have a good relationship with my professors because they take the time to actually get to know me."
Junior,5,I love the Christian environment that doesn't compromise faith and academics; the university excels in both! Definitely needs more parking though.
Senior,5,The most amazing school. All staff and faculty are extremely passionate about students and their learning. As a university they do all they can to ensure the happiness and growth of their student body.
Freshman,5,Anderson University is a great academic college. I love going to school there because the professors are extremely knowledgeable and they challenge you with each assignment. The school itself is family orientated and is a wonderful college experience. I would recommend this university!
Sophomore,5,Anderson University is an amazing college that I have got to be apart of for two years now. The community is outstanding and is my home away from home. I would highly recommend Anderson University to anyone looking for a great school that cares beyond the classroom.
Freshman,5,"Anderson is a great school with incredible academics, however though, the school is best served for those who put their academics above everything else. The food and housing are decent but the party scene is nonexistent and frowned upon by the university."
Freshman,5,"I am a student at Anderson University and I love how friendly the faculty, staff and students are. The love for Jesus is evident, especially among the faculty. The only improvement I could suggest is better campus safety. It often takes awhile for them to come pick students up."
Freshman,5,I love the environment and campus is beautiful. Great academics and all together a good school. I love that it has its own church on campus and the professors are all friendly.
Junior,5,"On the nursing department, the professor care about the students. They guide you through the process and ensure you understand the concept."
Freshman,5,"Anderson is a wonderful place where people truly care about you on an individual level. Its small size provides a tight-knit community of believers who work together to grow personally, spiritually, and academically. I would not change my decision to come to Anderson University for anything. I really have no complaints."
Junior,5,"I love the quality of the education here and the fact that it is a Christian University without that Christianity being forced on those who don’t hold that religion. I would like to see more parking space and more space in the buildings in general. I would also like to see a place to get healthier snacks and food, even if it’s a health-focused vending machine. I really like the Anderson University community and how Student Life offers a variety of fun opportunities throughout the school year."
Junior,5,"Anderson university is wonderful college. I enjoy going here, because it is a quaint, low key college. I enjoy making new friends and being with old ones. Classes are readily available every semester."
Junior,5,Anderson University is by far the most amazing college I have seen! Anderson University has so many opportunities for the students to grow academically and spiritually. This is my second home and I have made so many friends that will last through my education.
Freshman,5,"Anderson University is a mature, excellent college for those wanting to pursue a career after school. The location, atmosphere, and professors are all top-notch."
Alum,5,Anderson University provided me a first-class education because the professors cared about your success.
Freshman,5,"Anderson University is a place where you can be you. Coming to AU I have made amazing friends who love the Lord just as much as I do! Here at Anderson University community is key! People are friendly, so don't worry about knowing anyone when you come because by the end of your first week here you'll know the whole campus."
Sophomore,5,I love the experience I have there! The staff is super friendly and I also feel really connected to them. I love the student activities they have on campus and the fact that they give us so many of them. Athletics on campus are also very fun to go to and cheer on our school.
Freshman,5,Anderson University is a great school. The faculty is all so friendly. Everyone is like a family here. I love it!
Freshman,5,"Anderson University is an amazing college with a beautiful campus and amazing staff. The professors are incredible and desire to help you learn and grow in your faith. They are great to be around. I actually look forward to having class, even at 8am every day. All of the professors have the highest degree in their field of study and  some still work in the field of their study so students continually have up to date information about their major."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently in my second year at AU and I still love it just as much as I did from the very first day. Being at AU has changed my life spiritually, mentally, and has shaped me as a person. Being in college is hard enough but fortunately here at AU, there is a christian environment that is loving toward all students. I believe I go to a college that is focused on the well-being of their students and wants to see them strive not just academically, but spiritually as well. I cannot wait to see what my future here at AU holds but I know that whatever may lie ahead will develop me in my major and into the adult I am meant to be. "
Recent Alumnus,5,I would not trade my college experience for the world. I am surrounded by the best teachers who care about my success and take the time to ensure that I an learning in class.
College Freshman,5,They make sure they give the most up to date information for the career you want to go into. The professors are experts in the fields they teach and some are still actively involved in the career they teach ensuring the most optimal information and teaching.
College Freshman,5,"I love my professors. They are engaging and work with us to help us reach our potential and our goals. They are willing to work with us when our schedule dose not work, they are helpful and understanding. They want to see us succeed."
College Freshman,5,The campus security gives us notifications if something is happening and they have provided their number on the back of our ID's so we can call them whenever we need them. This school cares about our safety; it's their top priority.
College Freshman,5,"All of the girls on the hall are friendly and the RA is great. We all get along very well. We are all think of things to do together, like decorating the hall for different holidays and getting together for late night snacks!"
College Freshman,5,My school is great because the people there make you feel special and you are all part of a big family. I feel they care about everyone and want everyone to succeed in the career he or she has chosen to pursue. I can't wait to start this journey and see where my future goes from here. For instance we had base camp which allowed you to spend one night and kind of get a feel of what campus life was all about. I had a blast it was so much fun getting to know the people who were going to be in the nursing field with me. Anderson University is one of a kind!
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love my school! I cannot wait to be back in the fall!
College Freshman,5,"I feel very safe on campus, and the campus safety officials take the safety of students seriously."
College Freshman,5,"From the moment I arrived on campus, I felt welcome and was in love with the beauty of the campus, the people and community, and the overall atmosphere!"
College Sophomore,5,"The courses that I took this past year were very challenging, but I was able to push through and make all A's. This would not have been possible if I did not have professors that were invested in me and my education."
College Sophomore,5,"My first year at Anderson University was the best, I believe, it could have been. The professors were very personal and interested in my education and the other students were very friendly and welcoming."
College Junior,5,It is the best academics I have seen by far!
College Junior,5,There is no drug scene here that I am aware of.
College Junior,5,I have heard of nursing students here gaining great careers simply because they were AU alumni which is great for the school and all nursing students to come!
Alum,4,Online was not anything that we needed to do when I went to school at Anderson College. It was also not a University when I went there.
Alum,4,"The campus of Anderson College, now Anderson University, was small and growing when I went there. I would get lost on campus if I went back to visit now."
Alum,4,Choosing Anderson University for my undergraduate studies was an incredible decision. Professors were AMAZING and my experience was family oriented. Sometimes the financial aid office was frustrating to deal with but other than that I LOVED my experience there! I have felt completely prepared to begin my career as a teacher thanks to AU's faculty.
Junior,4,"Anderson University is a highly accredited private, Christian college that encourages faith and education."
Sophomore,4,"I took one hybrid class second semester, so half of that class was online. Due to the Coronavirus, everything was online for everyone the second half of second semester. That was very interesting, but AU did a great job of adjusting and helping their students adjust to moving all learning online."
Senior,4,I have not loved my entire journey with Anderson University. I am an Adult Studies student and some of my courses were not the best for a single parent. However I have enjoyer my experience and many of my classes and professors. I highly recommend it.
Senior,4,Online classes are very demanding. Many require several hours of work in addition to the recommended amount of time the professors give. Typically they ar seven week classes. I personally enjoyed most of my online classes however it is easy to fall behind so communication is key to succeeding.
Sophomore,4,I personally loved how welcoming each student at Anderson University was.  It does not matter who you are or where you come from.  Everyone is treated like family.
Sophomore,4,The only time I took classes online was when the pandemic started to become a serious problem and we were sent home.  All of my classes for my spring semester were switched to online learning.  It was not too bad of an experience.  The only challenge was having art classes online.  It is way harder to improve in art without meeting in-person.
Freshman,4,The people I’ve met and become friends with here at Anderson have been amazing. The professors are also very intentional and care about their students. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because a lot people that come here live less than and hour and a half away so they will go home every weekend. This can make it hard for people who don’t live as close to have friends to do stuff with on the weekends.
Freshman,4,Anderson University is a private christian college that includes everyone. It is a small school where students can have close relationships with their professors. Everyone is kind and including. This school is amazing!!
Sophomore,4,"It is a small campus so it is easy to find your classes. the classes are small, no more than 35 students, and the teachers learn every students name. If you are out of state that is ok, there is usually something to do on campus or around campus. There are many opportunities for you to get involved in ministries, clubs/organizations, and activities."
Niche User,4,"I love the atmosphere they have on campus. Everyone is always so happy and is always ready to help you in any way if you need it. The teachers I've seen so far are really sweet and nice to the students. Everyone there wants you to succeed and do well during college, outside of college and in the future."
Niche User,4,There's always a lot of students working on campus and they accept pretty much anyone. However they are really expensive.
Sophomore,4,Anderson has been an amazing experience. It is so easy to get connected and there is always things to do. The classes are small and the faculty is absolutely amazing. I actually have fun here. This is a place I never want to leave. There is not much that I dislike. Infact there is practically nothing wrong with. My experience here.
Junior,4,"The professors in the education department want each and every student to succeed. Their office doors are always open and students are welcomed to come in and talk about school, life, or just hang out. Relationships at Anderson University matter. Something that Anderson can improve on is for the whole college to be as welcoming as the individual departments. This includes in Financial Aid to Anderson Central."
Freshman,4,"I choose Anderson because of the size, social, and christian community. I like that Anderson was on the smaller side because I did not want to feel like I was fighting for the professors attention and I could easily ask questions in a smaller environment. All of the people that I have met are very easy to approach and they are more than happy to answer any of the questions that you may have while in college. I love that I can talk to my advisors and professors about my spiritual life because the are all believers. When I go to them for advise the can give me some from a spiritual standpoint and thats what I need in a college."
Sophomore,4,"Anderson university is an amazing school. The faculty and staff often go out of their way to make sure you are able to achieve great things. Especially in the honours college, the professors are more than willing to work with you one on one, building relationships, and helping you understand the material. Anderson is such a great community that does its best to point students back to God at every turn. As their motto states they give us “knowledge for the journey”."
Sophomore,4,"Anderson University’s academics are excellent. All of the classes are challenging and engaging, and I have not had a professor I did not like thus far. However, it would be a great improvement if Anderson University would work harder on welcoming a more diverse student body, including people of many races and backgrounds. Another area in which Anderson could improve is making certain none of the science teachers are teaching their students evolution, as this is a Christian university."
Sophomore,4,"Anderson University is a great school, full is hardworking students. My sister graduated from Anderson 3 years ago and now she teaches full time at an elementary school. Teachers in the Education department are incredible and want to their students succeed. Academics are tough, but the teachers strive to help their students achieve their goals."
Freshman,4,"Anderson's campus is beautiful and the faculty cares about the student's wellbeing and safety. The worse part about Anderson is their food, meat is often undercooked and there are rarely healthy options. Anderson does not even include some of the healthier options at Chick-Fil-A, such as the cool wraps and fruit cups, in their meal plans. This does not make any sense and could be such an easy fix. The students deserve to have healthy and SAFE food options at all time for no extra cost with their meal plans."
Niche User,4,"I loved how peaceful the campus was. It is an easy place to make home for 4 years. The nursing school facility is very clean and pretty, and Anderson University's staff is very pleasant. My only concern is the condition of the dorm. They are older and not very up-to-date."
Junior,4,The campus is beautiful and a short drive to many different activities.  I think we could use more housing for students.
Freshman,4,The atmosphere at Anderson is incredible. It truly lives up to its name as a Christian University. God is the bases of everything.
Junior,4,"My time at Anderson University, so far, has been nothing short of a positive experience. The friendly Christian environment accepted me right away, inviting me to many clubs and events. Being a transfer student and having commuted as well as living on campus, Anderson has provided a comfortable envirment to learn and grow in my studies as well as in my relationship with Jesus Christ."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is wonderful, but it can definitely feel small at times, especially if you don’t have a car. However, the smallness has helped me make a lot of friends, and I’m able to see people I know several times a day."
Junior,4,"AU is a great school. They offer small class sizes and most of the professors are really awesome and try to help whenever possible. The university does however, have a lot of rules students must follow to graduate/not have a letter sent home to parents."
Junior,4,"Andeson University is an unapologetically Chrisitan university. While that is said, there is something for everyone. The campus is continuing to grow and change."
Sophomore,4,"I love my specific theatre department and the campus is beautiful! However I feel that there is not a lot of diversity on campus. The theatre department is amazing and I feel at home there. I love my college and the friends I've made. I feel that my major specific classes are very helpful, but the gen ed classes sometimes feel boring and unnecessary."
Sophomore,4,"I like the atmosphere of AU.  The Christian atmosphere is very welcoming.  The professors are always willing to help and provided students with the best advice they can offer.  As a commuter student who lives 30 minutes away, it is difficult to find a place on campus in a social aspect because many of the events are very much geared towards residential students."
Freshman,4,"I really like the Christ-centered atmosphere. Nice, genuine students and faculty. The school itself is very small, which can be a good and bad thing. I wish there were more community-based things to do on the weekends - a lot of students just go home."
Freshman,4,"I've attended Anderson University for a year now and have throughly enjoyed it. The academics are definitely challenging but the professors are always willing to take time out of their schedule to help with any difficulties. The majority of students are from the area so being an out-of-state student, the weekends can be uneventful because most people go home. Overall the campus is extremely nice and the food is satisfactory. I'm very happy I chose to attend this school."
Sophomore,4,"I have enjoyed my experience at AU. I have met great friends and had some great teachers who have helped me further my education. Because it is a small school, the teacher and student relationships are closer than other schools. This allows you to get the most out of your education. The environment has been great for my relationship with Christ and helping it grow. The location is perfect for me as well since it is close to my home."
Sophomore,4,I like the community and how students are able to learn their career as well as grow in their faith. I would love to see the diversity aspect of the campus change.
Freshman,4,This is my first year at AU. I really like the school ! There are plenty of activities to do and ways to get involved. Most of the professors are good . The campus is beautiful. It seems like they are always cleaning up and making it look nice. The dorms are nice too! The classroom sizes are pretty good too. The athletics are a fun part of the campus too. The size of the campus is just about right. The food is no too bad either. There is also a CFA and Eienstein’s on campus ! I really like that! Overall I think this is a really good school!
Alum,4,"Anderson University provides a quality education and excellent teacher and staff support. If you are interested in a small school where you become close with classmates and professors, AU could be a great fit."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Anderson University so far has been great. The faculty is extremely caring and considerate of all students. Each faculty member strives to make students feel connected with them and are eager to help them succeed. There are many different organization opportunities around the campus so there is always something to do or an invitation floating around. The dining hall and other food sources around campus are amazing! Anderson University feels like home for me and I couldn't have made a better college decision.
Freshman,4,I am totally in love with Anderson University. It's a great university who really cares for its students.
Alum,4,"Anderson University was my home away from home. I was a resident of Virginia when I decided to attend Anderson. I thought going to a school 8 hours away would be difficult, but I found that the faculty at Anderson University was extremely welcoming and truly wanted you to be comfortable. I spent all four years at AU, and I loved every minute of it."
Sophomore,4,"You get what you pay for, you are not just ""some student"" there are professors there to push you, who care about you in more ways then academically. I am blessed to be attending this university"
Freshman,4,"Anderson University is a beautiful school nestled in the small town of Anderson, South Carolina. The university is quaint and small, but just big enough. For its smaller size you feel as though you will know everyone by name, and you will see faces you know, but you will also see new faces everyday."
Sophomore,4,I am a sophomore here at AU and I love it here. But I will say that if you are not a Christian you will not like it here. I am but the people that came here that are nonbelievers transferred after the first semester. Most of the professors are very helpful and nice. The large majority of the students are all very nice and friendly.
Recent Alumnus,4,The security on campus is great. I never just see them standing around. They are always busy and working.
Recent Alumnus,4,The accounting and criminal justice program is very respectable.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The athletic at my school take the back seat to a lot of liberal arts and other things on campus. Our facilities are ok, but we would use some upgrades. Our students do not always get involved."
College Freshman,4,There are plenty of intramurals and varsity teams for all students to enjoy. The students even create their own teams and team names within the intramural sports. It is always fun and inclusive whether you are a player or a spectator.
College Junior,4,In the business department we are well networked and gave a high reputation in the community fair quality of workers especially in the accounting department
College Junior,4,"The proffesors and class style, especially in the honors program have been one of my favorite things about this school. They know each of us personally and care about our academic success. I've heard of some professors who don't match this description, but they're either gen Ed profs or they don't last more the two years at the school"
College Freshman,4,"Anderson University has a lot of sports to offer from basketball, soccer and even baseball. They love to get the students involved they have a Trojan club which lets you in the games at a cheaper rate. The sports facilities are some of the best around for a such a centralized school. I have attended many games before I knew this was were I would be attending."
College Senior,4,There are a variety of options and there are many different professors that are all very friendly and nice.
College Senior,4,Everyone is treated fairly and no one feels threaten.
College Senior,4,I think it is very well written and clear.
College Sophomore,4,I really don't know. I just kinda go here.
College Sophomore,4,"Like I said, if the professor is good, the professor is GREAT. If they aren't, they're horrible."
College Sophomore,4,"I've never felt unsafe on campus. Campus security can sense from their little building that someone doesn't have a parking decal, so I'm hoping they're good at catching bad people, too."
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy my school, and the teachers who are good are good. However, the teachers who aren't good, ARE HORRIBLE PEOPLE."
College Freshman,4,"Anderson university is world-renowned, and their students are put under contract to work as early as Junior year."
College Freshman,4,"I absolutely love the christian community, and all the people on my floor became like one big family!"
College Sophomore,4,The career center on campus is very good about placing students and graduates with jobs that will best suit that particular student.
College Sophomore,4,On campus I generally feel pretty safe. Our campus security does a great job of protecting the campus and students.
Freshman,2,"If you're going for the Christian environment, you should probably look somewhere else. My time outside of the classroom has been a living nightmare. And it's the same for my peers. There are many personal reasons why I'm transferring after the semester, but this school has grown more casual in it's convictions and how it handles issues. And I don't feel safe on campus."
College Junior,2,Athletics has never been a major part of this school and so student involvement is lacking to say the least. Most students don't even know when the games are and openly where shirts depicting other schools on campus. Currently there is a big push to change this attitude but it's a ways away from success
College Freshman,2,Housing is not worth what you pay for it.
College Freshman,2,For the track team there is no track to run on and the fields for soccer are subpar but for students it is fairly decent
College Sophomore,2,"Saw a drunk homeless guy roaming campus at 11 pm during basecamp (summer orientation) and he tried approaching a group of girls before they noticed and left. Campus isn't in the best part of town, so hearing gunshots in the middle of the night isn't surprising. A man was stabbed down the road last year, so that was frightening."
College Sophomore,2,"The gymnasium is extremely small. It's nearly impossible to get a spot in the bleachers for basketball games; but that doesn't quite matter, seeing as how the student section stands the entire time."
College Sophomore,2,"No Greek life because it will ""destroy Christian values"" at the university, only basketball games are hyped, only Christian clubs to join, half the professors are passionate about their work"
College Freshman,2,There is no advertising of jobs or career services.
College Freshman,2,"The buildings just haven't been renovated, and you can tell."
College Freshman,2,"I don't party, but it is very strict."
College Sophomore,2,"I am not really a partier myself, but most AU students don't party on campus because of the fact that AU is a dry campus. AU doesn't allow alcohol, they don't allow tobacco, and the opposite sex is not allowed to be in rooms except for MTRFS 7-11pm. People who like to party usually go to the club Maui on thursday nights because it is college night and there are special deals."
College Junior,2,The school is very homogenous
College Senior,2,Very little about Greek life is noticed.  I couldn't tell you that much about it.  Very little support from faculty again.
College Senior,2,"I'm an adult and expect to be treated like one.  I'm in the adult program (ACCEL) and I have had to remind some professors that I am as old as they, and I expect some mutual respect.  I would not do over.  AU is expensive and the rep is not all that great.  8 weeks is too short to learn what they try to teach.  Many faculty members are arrogant and rude. With their rep, someone from Clemson, USC, Furman, etc.  would probably be picked before you."
College Senior,2,"Classes are difficult to schedule because some are offered at night and some are not, or only in the winter classes for example. One may be offered online, and the other one is seated.  Not much help from advisors either."
College Freshman,2,"The school is not intended to be a great party school. If you like parties, go to Clemson."
College Sophomore,2,"Aramark dining services does a bad job at providing food for vegetarians (other than the salad bar).  Nothing on campus is organic, even the healthy foods are not healthy if you read the descriptions provided.  The quality is pretty bad.  The three dining halls quit serving food at 7 and two of them stay open for purchases until 8 pm."
College Sophomore,2,"Though there are a decent number of international students on campus, most of the students on campus are typical southern baptists whose parents make a good living and send them to school with lots of money. Except for the theater department, where there is a very diverse group of students.  Everyone else on campus is pretty cookie-cutter like."
College Freshman,2,It is not good at all. It's overpriced even with a meal plan and the quality is not good.
College Senior,2,Some of the equipment in the general population lab is old.  The key boards are worn and the monitors are blurry.
College Freshman,2,"The food is always some kind of pasta and meat every day. The only fruit choices are between an apple, orange, and banana. There is not any dairy free food choices for the people that cannot eat dairy. There are two other places on campus to eat known as the Grille and Food For Thought. At the grille they always have burgers and hot dogs and any food that is easy to make and serve. Food For Thought is where people go to eat greasy, overly cheesy pizza. The people serving the food are nice but other than that, you get really bored by the day to day food options."
College Junior,2,"I don't party or drink. I've seen a few bars and there's a club downtown, but I don't know if its any good. I've heard of parties at students off-campus houses. Anderson is a dry campus and there are severe consequences to being caught with alcohol. Mostly it's a place to chill with friends in smaller groups. The best place to go for fun is Greenville, forty minutes away."
College Freshman,2,"The eating is average here. The best one is the one in Merrit. It's all home cooked style food, though it isn't always phenomenal. There are two other eateries on this campus, the Grille which is just burgers and fries and the like which is merely okay, but not a suggested daily place to eat. My least favorite is Food For Thought because the pizza is often sitting there for a while and the other items are just subpar. I really wish the dining places would be open longer hours, because not every student has time to eat during the 2 hour slots that they are open and that's not fair to them."
College Freshman,2,the food is average. it is not the best bust also not the worst
College Sophomore,2,"It is a little hectic because Anderson has more students than parking, which creates a mess. Commuters have the worst of it, but if you live on campus, just remember that when you go out, you may have to walk back."
College Freshman,2,"If you can find a spot close to your dorm, you're fine, but if not, you'll have to walk.  Too many parking regulations and specialty spots."
College Sophomore,2,"There are far more international students than there used to be, but most of them are art majors or play sports. Just about everyone is Christian, or was raised Christian."
College Junior,2,I am an Accel student and commute at times.  Parking is awful I have circled the parking area for 10 minutes and was still unable to find park.  I left and went to our local city library
College Junior,2,"Computer Issues – computers are slow and unreliable, the labs are normally full or reserved and there are not enough of the them. the printers are poor quality, there are few of them, they are often broken, and there is little to no option of color printing."
College Junior,2,"The food isn't horrible, but most of the time the vegetables are not delicious.  Most of the time I get everything on my plate, but only end up eating a few bites of everything just to taste the food."
College Freshman,2,"The only transportation are cars and bikes or walking if some are into that. I understand buses can be costly, and that you may have to be able to afford bus drivers, and the buses. Many people walk or bike to and from the athletic campus because they have no other way for getting to class.  They could catch a ride with someone, but its notlikely that everyone on campus is always going to be willing to give someone a ride. Weather is an issue for the students who don't have a car. They have to somehow get to class in the pouring rain on somedays and walking into class, not only is not very acceptable, but it is not comfortable for the student. We need at least one or two buses or SOMETHING for these students."
College Freshman,2,"since this is a christian university there arent any house parties on campus. there are sometimes small events that happen at dorm lobbies but not too many students go there. there are a couple clubs, and theyre okay, but there should be more nightlife events on campus that are more interesting."
College Sophomore,2,Old and Broken Down – The computers are old and slow most places on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Here at Anderson, there's a rule about having the opposite gender in your dorm room. While I know it's for safety and religious reasons, I feel like giving us 4 hours (7 to 11) 5 days a week to hang with our other gender friends in our room is reasonable if not for the other rules of: lights stay on, door stays open, everyone has their feet on the floor (No sitting on beds or laying on the couch). It really is frustrating. The dorms are nice, but they're over-crowded and some kids were actually sent to a hotel because they ran out of rooms even with 3 people in the 2 person rooms on campus. On campus living is alright, but it's uptight."
College Junior,2,"I am a psychology major and I find it ridiculous that people who don't know what they want to major in choose psych because they think it will be a fun major. You have to be extremely dedicated to be a psych major. The classes are tough. The professors are very intelligent, but hard. They test and teach us like we are already in grad school, but make it known that most of us won't get in and to not get our hopes up. So, unless you plan on being fully dedicated and plan on going to grad school, I wouldn't choose psychology as a major."
College Junior,2,"We Could Do Better – The food is alright, but it isn't the best. We have three places to eat now, but not a lot of variety. Luckily, this year I lived off campus so I was able to eat the food I wanted."
College Junior,2,Anderson has a lot of unexpected events and allow the public to park where students need to park to make it to class on time. I've been late several times because of this. On an average day it's not bad but usually wherever there is expected parking there's a long walk to class that follows it.
College Sophomore,2,"Dorms Are Crappy – There are about 3 great dorms on cost and the price for all the dorms are ridiculous, but acceptable. Washers and dryer are great and expensive. But the people in the dorms are great"
College Sophomore,2,Housing Off Campus – I don't know much about housing off campus but from what I've heard it is hard to find an apartment near campus. They are all almost 30 minutes away and finding one is even worse. But I do live on campus and it's great although they do have limited space.
College Senior,2,"Repetitive Variety – Our school cafeteria boasts having an incredible variety for students each day. While this is true, you can expect basically the same meals from week to week, as well as the same varieties. Another problem with variety is that our chef tends to experiment with lots of interesting foods and food combination. While this is also okay to change things up, it seems like we never get just a good old fashioned American meal. I think it is a good thing to have variety, but its better to have a GOOD variety."
Senior,1,I only had about 2 great teachers. For a Christian school they are anything but Christian and more interested in getting money than their students. When the going gets rough for their students they 'turn' the other cheek.
College Freshman,1,We do not have greek life.
College Student,1,Everything here is the worst.
College Freshman,1,Incredibly strict for being in college
College Freshman,1,we do not have greek life here at Anderson.
College Freshman,1,I hate that we aren't allowed to have members of the opposite sex in our room except for certain times.
College Freshman,1,There is nothing social going on except for at school.
College Freshman,1,"The current parking situation on our college campus is horrible, and everyone seems to recognize this fact except for the administration. Because we are a smaller school, permit costs are relatively low ($60.00) and freshman are allowed to have cars on campus. However, there are not nearly enough spaces. After all the parking spots on campus fill up, students are forced to park down the street, at nearby churches, and even in local resident's driveways!"
College Freshman,1,"There is NEVER a parking spot near my dorm and I ALWAYS have to walk by myself in the cold all the way from the intramural field to my building and it is very frustrating. It's a good ten minute walk and if this school were to renovate anything, the parking needs to be the first thing."
College Freshman,1,"There really isn't anything to do at this school. Occasionally there will be a sports event or something of the like, but if we really want to do any thing fun around here we have to come up with the ideas and resources ourselves."
College Freshman,1,"There really isn't anything to do around this campus, unless you are an athlete or involved in some other ""society"". The theater program does well and puts on great performances, but it really seems that this school doesn't make that much effort to ensure we are actually enjoying ourselves at this school."
College Sophomore,1,"Dormitory visitation rules about the opposite sex are far too strict.  The fact that the entire campus is dry and tobacco free also seems to strict to many students.  There is extremely limited parking, and the campus safety department is very strict about violating parking rules, therefore it is nearly impossible to avoid a parking violation at some times."
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have buses here at Anderson unless it's a sport event. Other than that, students have to drive themselves to get anywhere."
College Sophomore,1,"Christian School – As a Christian school with Christian values there are not any parties on campus. There are a few gross, shabby clubs in Anderson but they really aren't worth your time."
College Junior,1,"Hello 1999 – Don't expect the computer labs to be equipped with state of the art equipment.  The computers being used were around when I was in early elementary, and I'm a senior in college.  Bring your own laptop and color printer.  Printing in color on campus costs a ton."
College Junior,1,"Glorified High School – The university is strict and dull.  Mandatory chapel every Wednesday.  No eating or drinking in class.  You are not allowed to wear clothes that show skin like ""spaghetti straps"" or ""mini-skirts"".  Men are not even allowed to wear sleeveless shirts.  If you want a university to be able to make true friends, this isn't the place.  You are not allowed to be unattended in your own room with someone of the opposite sex, even if just platonic. Attendance policy is rigid.  Campus dining is one step up from repulsive.  Faculty and staff are kind and helpful, generally, but the atmosphere of the campus is elitist and lacks diversity.  Do not attend this university if you are not a very devote Baptist, otherwise you will be ostracized."
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life here which is probably why there is not as much partying here at AU.
College Sophomore,1,"Get Me to Graduation Fast! I am a person of freewill and open opinions about life.  This school is not that.  It is a very typecast institution and if you are not to their exact mould, you will not fit in.  I went to another institution for two years and miss it terribly in comparison to this university.  I am only here for my major, which is very rare in this state.  I have two years left and am trying my hardest to make it through.  If I had to do it over again, I wouldn't choose to."
College Sophomore,1,"Stranded at AU – I used to go to a large university in South Carolina that had an amazing transit system.  Anderson University is not that school.  They do not offer any kind of transportation outside of the university--even in emergency.  There is a bus system running around the town, but they do not have routes posted.  Also, the bus system is very shady-- I would not trust it."
College Freshman,1,"The Bad – The athletic building is absolutely terrible. It is very outdated and only accommodates athletes. They have around five treadmills that are outdated and the rest is weights. The student center is also very poor and not inviting at all. They are going to renovate that building, however."

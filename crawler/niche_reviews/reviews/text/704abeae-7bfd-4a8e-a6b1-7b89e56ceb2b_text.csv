Junior,5,"The admin is corrupt, especially higher up admin, but students and faculty make this an amazing community of scholars, educators, and world-changers. I love my Vassar community. I love the campus."
Junior,5,My professors bent over backwards to help me with my timezone issues. Having professors that understand your needs is a great part of going to such a small college.
Alum,5,I loved my experience at Vassar. The professors are incredibly inspiring and accommodating. They were willing to spend lots of time in office hours reviewing any materials that I was struggling with. The school attracts a unique mix of students who create a great culture which is combined with great academics. I have made lifelong friends with people from all over the world and would not trade this for anything.
Alum,5,Professors adapted well to online learning. There were many different formats they adopted as we switched partway through the semester but all of them continued to deliver the content well. Some professors went as far as having one-on-one meetings with students once a week to discuss material and make sure everyone was on the same page. I really appreciate the dedication of the professors during these tough times.
Senior,5,"Vassar professors did everything they could to make the transition to online classes a smooth and easy process. Like most schools, lectures were done through zoom. Professors took into consideration that many students have different times zones and therefore made sure that students were not penalized for not attending the live lectures. All and all, it was a good experience.  I know if students were ever struggling with the adjustment, teachers were always willing to make exceptions."
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Vassar. I'm a first-gen college student in my immediate family and suffered some imposter syndrome feelings while there, but I found my network of friendly, warm, supportive individuals among the students, staff, and faculty there - with many of whom I still communicate."
Alum,5,"I didn't take any online classes with Vassar so have no online learning experience with them, but while I was there they did use the Blackboard CMS system and faculty were using that platform to deliver various elements of the class - grade book, assignment dropboxes, email system, and more."
Niche User,5,"Excellent school with a beautiful beautiful campus. Both my children went to Vassar and chose it over ivy leagues they were admitted to because of the generous financial aid. We couldn’t have been happier. After Vassar, one went to Columbia law,
 and the other did a double degree engineering program at Dartmouth. Thanks Vassar for the excellent undergraduate education."
Freshman,5,"Beautiful campus and a very friendly, quirky, student body. Grad school placements are top notch and students have a fun time. Great financial aid."
Freshman,5,"The food has been upgraded tremendously since we’ve shifted to a new caterer and we essentially have unlimited edible food. Academics are top notch. We have several famous academics teaching undergrads at Vassar like Uma Narayan and Andy Davison, and the student body has such a rich history of activism. Also, it doesn’t hurt that we’re the most socioeconomically diverse school in the nation.  We also don’t have any greek life, and our campus still has a very female culture. Frat culture stays far away from our environment, and we’re very grateful for that. Dorms are small but they have their charm. like sure the hallway will smell of weed but hey.. it’s alright given that Jacky Kennedy lived in my room."
Alum,5,I honestly do not know where to start. The campus is absolutely beautiful and well-maintained. The library is a dreamy place to study. I personally loved the dining experience. The students are all super smart and interesting; the professors even more so (not to mention kind and personable).
Freshman,5,"The professors at Vassar are typically very passionate and willing to work with you to help you pass their class/achieve your goals. The campus is beautiful and diverse. Financial aid is fairly generous, and you may be able to work with your financial aid counselor if you need to. However, it's really the luck of the draw because some counselors are more receptive than others. Safety is only a slight issue if you don't live in the dorms, but you should be fine as long as you lock your doors."
Sophomore,5,"Vassar is a very supportive community that encourages all of their students to pursue what they love. The professors are fantastic, there are plenty of resources to find job and internships, and your classmates are always there to help you out. Great place to learn what you love."
Senior,5,"Vassar has been the right choice for me. The small class and laboratory sizes make for a very intimate learning environment. Vassar is a very diverse environment in every sense except for politically. Vassar is a very open place, however, it is so liberally leaning politically that sometimes people have a hard time expressing their opinions if they aren't the same as the majority of Vassar. However, Vassar has a variety of different people there so everyone can find their niche there. Vassar is in no way a party school, as the night life is very much a ""what you make of it"" situation. Vassar has no Greek Life, which makes for a highly inclusive campus."
Sophomore,5,"A comfy environment for a rigorous academic experience. The professors are (mostly) caring and passionate about teaching and provide an high level of support which is backed up by a very helpful peer tutoring system. There are great job opportunities, though they can be difficult to get without work study in your aid package. The extracurricular activities are plentiful so you're guaranteed to find people with common interests if you look."
Sophomore,5,I really love Vassar. So far I've learned a lot and it's easier than my crazy high school. I have a great group of friends and we have so much fun.
Junior,5,"Amazing institution that positions itself as a school of multi-disciplinary education, boasts a thoughtful and inclusive student body and is driven by crucial conversations our society faces. However, more importantly, this school provides opportunities that open our minds to see the aspects on which we could improve as college students, and urges us to envision and be prepared for our respective careers after graduation."
Junior,5,The college offers diverse courses and flexible major/graduation requirements that allow for students to take whichever classes they're interested in!
Niche User,5,"I would like to see it become more diverse. The student body is small, so it would be nice if there were more opportunities to meet new people."
Freshman,5,"Vassar's campus felt like home right away. They have the best trees. The buildings are absolutely beautiful inside and out. But what is more beautiful is the people. I can strike up a conversation with anyone I meet. During finals, I was obviously struggling with a math problem, and a student came up to me and offered to help. As well, there are a million resources for you to use when you need help."
Freshman,5,"Coming to Vassar was the best decision I ever made. From the moment I stepped onto campus, I was welcomed and supported. The professors are AMAZING and are very approachable and easy to talk to, and will do everything they can to help you be successful. The students are very intelligent and hard-working, but never competitive. Students are serious about their academics, but at the same know when to take breaks and make room for having fun."
Senior,5,"Great place, had a lot of great experiences. Academically intense but does not foster a competitive environment. Great professors with a lot to offer."
Alum,5,"I had an amazing experience, and met people from all over the world. My professors were great and the campus is beautiful!"
Junior,5,"I've loved my time at Vassar College. Everyone who goes here is very motivated, interesting, and intellectual. The academics are top-notch and the faculty members are vibrant and fun. Although it's location can be isolating at times, there are always things to do on campus so you never get bored."
Sophomore,5,"This is an amazing school where many competitive students, advocating leaders, and the future of our generations exist as a cohesive community. Even though it is a very small campus, the dynamics of the school allows you to experience everyday differently. Throughout the years in school, you will be able to meet people who are slowly changing your view of the world and also pushing for change in the school, community, nation, and the world. This is one of the best decisions I have made to come to Vassar"
Senior,5,"An incredible liberal arts experience - though it's really what you make of it. Some classes are much easier than others. Vassar takes its need-blind policy very seriously and is the most generous with aid out of its peer institutions. The student body is made up of some of the most kind-hearted and accepting people you'll find anywhere. No one cares what you wear, where you come from, etc - you can truly find yourself & be yourself here."
Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful. Classes are interesting and challenging. Professors care and are very nice.
Sophomore,5,"A unique and transformative liberal arts experience. Your perspectives and ideas are always being challenged, and the free curriculum allows you to explore your interests. Clubs and organizations have a strong presence on campus. Facilities are fine, but nothing special. Financial aid is outstanding, the best I received from the 8 colleges I got into."
Freshman,5,"I went on the college tour for Vassar. I liked that the classes were small, so everyone got to know their professors and be heard. I loved how generous the school is with scholarship money, if you earn it. They have blue lights everywhere to keep you safe. There's even a mummy in the art exhibit."
Sophomore,5,Vassar provides the perfect balance between the arts and humanities and STEM fields. This is perfect for students like me (chem major and pre engineering) who want a real liberal arts education while also being able to focus on specific scientific fields that interest me. It is easy to get in contact professors and there are fantastic research opportunities for all classes.
Sophomore,5,The History Department is amazing! Real rockstar professors who are famous on campus for their ability to guide discussions just as much as for their bestselling publications.
Freshman,5,"Started  college here in the fall.  At first, I was apprehensive as  a POC at a private PWI, but the campus is gorgeous, and the student body is the most diverse, accepting group of people that I have ever met. Everyone here is so incredibly different and so incredibly passionate,  and  it makes for a unique group of students The professors are amazing,  easily accessible, and extremely accommodating. The dorms can be hit or miss on the sizing (some  rooms are monstrous and others are rather small), but each house has its own character and usually everyone comes to love their house. The benches beside Sunset Lake are  particularly peaceful for reading, studying, or painting. It's  a  large campus for our smaller student body,  so it's fairly easy to find your own space when you want  to."
College Sophomore,5,"I was able to earn an internship and other job offers as a result of the ""Vassar"" name."
College Sophomore,5,Fostering relationships with professors inside and outside the classroom has been the best part of my experience so far. Professors genuinely care about your lives and want to see you succeed.
College Sophomore,5,"Vassar is not without flaws (administration issues, subpar dining services, lack of diversity of thought, etc.), but has served as a second home for me. Academics and student life are phenomenal."
College Sophomore,5,"I've loved all my classes and all my professors! Class sizes are small, so I am always able to get to know my professors personally. They care about the success of their students, which reflects in their teaching!"
College Sophomore,5,"Vassar College is unique in that it is a fairly small close knit community of highly motivated and intelligent yet noncompetitive students, among whom I was quickly able to find my place and strive to be the best I can be while also having a lot of fun!"
College Freshman,5,"There is diversity in terms of race, sexuality, religion etc. Not much variation in political beliefs."
College Freshman,5,"The dorms are fun, social spaces, the bathrooms are clean and the facilities are acceptable to us."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are friendly and willing to help, they are very passionate about their subjects and the small class size means high level of student engagement."
College Freshman,5,"Great professors, you can almost always get into the classes you want"
College Freshman,5,"Our double room in Josselyn is HUGE with a high ceiling and floor to ceiling bay windows. All the dorms are close together, so it is easy to hang out with friends from other dorms."
College Freshman,5,"Sports are a big deal to the athletes and not a big deal to non-athletes. There is awesome school spirit, a great athletic facility, and fan support from the student community.  Friends attend each others events. In general, students are doing whatever they are passionate about."
College Freshman,5,Courses are great. Professors are great. There are a variety of classes. Professors are helpful and understanding. You will learn a lot.
College Freshman,5,Great social atmosphere. People are generally respectful  and friendly.
College Freshman,5,"Classes are very interesting and engaging. Professors are knowledgeable, good at their jobs, and understanding."
College Freshman,5,"Classes are really hard but that's expected, vassar isn't exactly a easy school to get into. However, even though they're hard, they're super interesting. Professors are super engaged and really want to teach the subjects they're teaching, which makes going to class something I want to do every day. I've had great experiences in student organizations, especially in student theater. One of the things that I have enjoyed the most, surprisingly, was my campus job. Everyone expects that going to work for your $9 per hour job is going to be a chore (or a place where you sit and do nothing) but there are a ton of really interesting jobs in departments where you're doing stuff that feels more like hobbie than work. I work at the drama department costume shop and we're always getting to work on really interesting projects. At the same time though, I'm learning so much about sewing technique and designing which I had never really thought I would get to do for paid work rather than a crafty hobby."
College Freshman,5,"Everyone is very accepting, liberal, friendly and there's always something to do."
College Freshman,5,Good financial aid for low-income students.
College Freshman,5,"Exemplary professors - warm, welcoming, accessible, sharp - I can't imagine a more perfect education!"
College Freshman,5,There is a never-ending number of things to do every day!
College Freshman,5,"Everyone is friendly, attractive, smart and interesting at Vassar!"
College Freshman,5,I love Vassar's chill students and professors!
College Freshman,5,Everyone I know has gotten substational assistance from the school.
College Freshman,5,"The housing system really creates a sense of community. This may be one of my favorite things about the school. Each dorm has its own type of vibe, it's really cool."
College Freshman,5,Academics at Vassar are phenomenal!! You will definitely receive an education you can't get anywhere else!
College Freshman,5,"The alumni network is great, there are many very successful Vassar alums. We also have an alumni network database that lets you reach of to alums. The Career Development Center (CDO) is very helpful in helping you find internships and preparing you to go out into the workforce. They hold many different events through the year."
College Freshman,5,"There are a wide variety of courses at very with a plethora of topics. Vassar offers many courses you will not find anywhere else. Professors are very intelligent and willing to help students. Professors will know you by name, and know what you are capable of since the class size is so small."
College Sophomore,5,"Vassar College was the first undergraduate institution in America to provide a cognitive science major/program; because of this, the college excels in the field and offers some cutting-edge information as well as top notch professors."
College Student,5,"People are damn hot. People dress very well, but they're great at staying personal. Huge diversity in style, but people still look great."
Alum,4,"Small, liberal arts college experience. Opportunity to develop intimate relations with both faculty, peers, and staff. All academic resources were very accessible and campus life was always stimulating. Plenty of opportunity to get involved in a wide variety of extracurriculars."
Freshman,4,"Vassar College has an abundance of amazing partner programs for students coming to build up their careers in their specific fields of study. Some range from STEM-related studies while also focusing on international studies and Education.  The courses are extremely challenging but there is so much support outside of class to help students with their assignments. A majority of the professors are very understanding of students situation and there is on-campus financial support for first-generation students. While Vassar is good for their partnerships programs and school- work tutoring and support, it seems that support for other necessities is lacking. It is extremely difficult to transfer credits over to Vassar and there is almost no help in the process.  The system for registering for courses also needs improvement as it puts a majority of upperclassmen at a disadvantage and finally, there is a lack of social programs for students interested in STEM fields."
Alum,4,"The academics at Vassar are top notch, even challenging. The professors are dedicated and available for help. The social life is good. It's definitely easier if you join a club or a walk on sport... It usually becomes your social group. There are lots of diverse students and affinity groups in regards to race, gender, and other minority coalitions. The admin definitely has a long way to go to support these students, but they definitely listen to student input."
Sophomore,4,I have had a great time with Vassar so far. I have taken great classes with wonderful professors and have made friends I will hopefully keep in touch with after graduating.
Freshman,4,"I love the atmosphere and the amazing campus.  The buildings are just spectacular.  The people are also amazing and welcoming.  I think Vassar does a great job at creating inclusion right from the start.  It can be hard starting at a new school, but Vassar tries to make it as easy a transition as possible and that really helped me.  The music department is great and I love all the opportunities there are to play/sing in ensembles at a high level.  The Poughkeepsie area is great and has opportunities to get off campus that I think many students do not take advantage of.  The Hudson Valley is a great place to explore art and the bustling cultural scene on Main street."
Senior,4,I’ve learned a lot about myself through my time here and I am so much smarter because of the academics and life at this school.  But also because of the skills I learned on how to handle a toxic liberal environment (which is loud but most people aren’t like that)
Junior,4,"Great college, especially the students, faculty, and staff, but there's not much going on in Poughkeepsie."
Freshman,4,"Vassar College has been a pretty good experience. Haven't complained much and that's a good sign. Great professors/academics, cool people, great support for low-income, first gen students if you participate in Foundations/Transitions."
Alum,4,"The professors, President Bradley, and administration,  campus , organizations, and intramural sports were terrific!"
Junior,4,Vassar College is a great space for individuals who dont know exactly what they want to study. There are so many options for classes and the professors are really interested in teaching what students want to learn. Amazing academic experience.
Sophomore,4,"The professors and classes are all very good. The school has many great professors and allows the students to explore different subjects. The athletics are not supported as much as many of the peer institutions.  The party scene is not great, but you can always find something."
Sophomore,4,Vassar is quite a unique place and if you are not ready to be accepting to everyone than this is not the place for you. Besides that this is a kind and loving place that makes you feel welcome no matter how you feel about yourself.
Sophomore,4,"Vassar is a wonderful school with amazing academic and social opportunities. The food and  local area aren't the best, however, the food service is changing next year and if you give Po-Town a try its better than you'd think at first glance (try Adam's whole foods, Big Gay Hudson, etc.) The professors are the best you will ever find. HANDS DOWN."
Freshman,4,"I have had an amazing experience during my first year at Vassar. The tuition is very high, but the school offers one of the best financial aid packages in the country. The classes are very interactive, and the professors are not only helpful, but also challenge students to think beyond their limits. The students are also very involved in on campus activities, and there are a wide variety of clubs that students can participate in. The only downside to the school would have to be the food, as the ""deece"", the all-student dining center, is infamous for having bad food."
Sophomore,4,"Great professors, good class sizes. Really nice people.  It definitely has a vibe, but if you're artsy and creative I would absolutely recommend it! "
College Freshman,4,All of my professors have been amazing and there are a great many classes to choose from.
College Freshman,4,We have many notable alumni including but not limited to Meryl Streep and Anna Hathaway. Other than that the Vassar post graduate community is always willing to lend you a helping hand. Acceptance rates into graduate school are very high as well.
College Freshman,4,There are blue lights everywhere. There is EMS and security always driving around. There is campus security run by students themselves at night. Most places are well lighted.
College Freshman,4,"The people I have met here have been AMAZING. I have found nothing but open arms here on campus and I know I have made friends for life. My favorite part of being here so far is doing crazy wild things with these new people in my life like walking a mile to a diner at 2 am and putting salt in each others water. Whenever I am feeling stressed about classes or financial aid, these are the people that are going to keep me from falling down the rabbit hole."
College Sophomore,4,"Some dorms are better than others, but my experience with housing has been very positive (excellent roommate, clean bathroom, wonderful House community). However, space was an issue in my double."
College Sophomore,4,"There are many job and internship prospects at Vassar, and the alumni network is vast. Career services are easily accessible and very helpful."
College Freshman,4,"So far, I found the career center very helpful because they provide many opportunities to learn more about career prospects such as workshops, drop-in hours, and other events. However, I am not at the point when I really need to figure out my career prospects yet in order to fully appreciate those kinds of services at my college."
College Freshman,4,"Class sizes are usually small so there are more opportunities to ask questions and participate in discussions during class. Professors are also more accessible to students through office hours and appointments, which are very helpful for students struggling in class, trying to figure out future opportunities, or just want to talk to them more about a certain topic of interest. Furthermore, there are a huge variety of interesting courses to take especially when Vassar only has three core requirements--a quantitative analysis (math and science-based) course, a freshman writing seminar, and familiarity with a foreign language (whether through a year-long course, AP/SAT Subject test, or testing out)."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, I have enjoyed my time at Vassar College so far. The people here are so friendly and eager to support me whenever I have concerns. Also, I appreciate the efforts that Vassar College tried to put into making a more open and diverse campus despite some complications along the way. If I did the application process all over again, I would still choose to go to Vassar (if I got accepted)."
College Freshman,4,It has a good impact as you can make a lot of friends at parties when they do happen.
College Freshman,4,"It's fun, there are the town houses, the terrace apartments and the mug but you often have to look for stuff going on"
College Freshman,4,"Classes are good, most people study in the library. Very difficult though so you have to work for your grades."
College Freshman,4,The sports teams are really involved with lots of bonding opportunities
College Freshman,4,There is a prominent drug scene at the school though you don't have to partake if you don't want to.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of alumni resources available online and the CDO always has events to keep us in the loop.
College Freshman,4,Out there but you have to look.
College Freshman,4,"Seems good, but don't know it that well"
College Freshman,4,"The professors are really engaged and the class sizes are almost always pretty small. The sorts of classes you get are really out there too, like in the way that challenges your world views and pushes you to think about topics you might not think you'd be interested in."
College Freshman,4,"Most of the dorms are in pretty good shape, and several have been renovated in the past few years. The atmosphere really depends on which dorm you're in, because each of them have very different vibes. The senior housing is also pretty nice."
College Sophomore,4,The community is amazing and just as engaging as the academics.
College Sophomore,4,"Still trying to find more orgs to join, but there are many options. Some great professors and challenging but not too work-heavy classes that are interesting."
College Sophomore,4,"Although the school has a history for being for the wealthy upper middle class, it has been changing. The financial aid for low income students is top notch and honestly, the best I've gotten. The financial office is great and unlike some other colleges, they keep their promise to keep education affordable for all 4 years for low income students. 

However, sometimes being a student of color from low income area can be difficult socially and can affect how you are seen and judged. 

But however, the professors are great and most are very eager to make sure you comprehend the topic at hand and makes you think deeply. Great education. The party and the social scene however cam be bit monotonous and tedious and there is that Vassar bubble."
College Junior,4,"Off-campus housing is pretty nice if you want to get away from having to deal with Vassar security, neighbors, and meal plans. It only means that you have to deal with real police, real adult neighbors, and cook for yourself. This can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it!"
College Junior,4,"Vassar has a lot of money. They gave me a lot in the beginning, but then for one reason or the other, charged me more for the next two years. The financial aid officers can be kind of patronizing but most are very understanding."
College Junior,4,"Everything is close by, and the campus is pretty beautiful. Coming from a low-income family, my room back home is super small. My room at Vassar is about 3 times as big. The floors in the hallways and the bathrooms could be cleaned more often, but beside that, its pretty great."
College Junior,4,"Off campus dining is where most people eat in the end, because on campus is terrible."
College Freshman,4,"A good amount of options to spice up the dull on-campus options, but not a ton. Decently priced for the average student."
College Freshman,4,"The lack of frats and sororities create a more friendly and accessible party scene for everyone. Also, because of Vassar seclusion from the city, more events occur on campus every weekend."
College Freshman,4,"The Health and Safety on campus is good. Things do happen, but overall Vassar is a very safe campus and our health center is very accessible."
College Freshman,4,"I get money from the army to go to college, but I have heard from several low-income students that they received the most financial aid from Vassar."
College Sophomore,4,"Hook up culture totally exists here, but the campus is attractive. If you're into sports, but not a varsity athlete, Vassar sucks because no one but the actually competitive athletes is interested in team sports or general athleticism. Many people here are still fabulously fashionable and beautiful, however. Eating disorders happen a fair amount."
College Freshman,4,"Alcohol, drugs, and domestic violence: Before orientation, both students and parents had to complete an online alcohol, drug, and domestic violence course.  There were two parts to it, and it took about 2 hours in total to complete.

Security:  It is almost impossible to drive across Vassar campus and not encounter a Vassar Security vehicle.  At the main gate, there is an officer to check in with, albeit, they rarely question why you're there.

Attendance:  The college expects you to go to class, although the professors can be more lenient.  The school is good about making legal leaves of absences in case of emergencies at home.  Probation can occur if your average in a class in below a C grade.

Academics:  A student is expected to maintain a C average.  It's a pretty lenient average since there are so many classes and so many other campus activities the college wants students to participate in."
College Freshman,4,"The best part about the athletics is that it reaches out to the local community.  For the Vassar After School Tutoring (VAST) program, the boys volleyball team and the girls lacrosse and squash teams conducted workshops with the Poughkeepsie Middle School students.  They not only taught them how to play, but they helped build cooperation, communication, and confidence within the students.  They showed the value sports have physically, mentally, emotionally, and socially."
College Student,4,"They're there. Athletes seem to like athletics. They're nice as social clubs for athletes. Otherwise, most people don't notice."
College Student,4,"Safety is pretty good. Security people are nice. Health services is fine, not the best, but they work pretty well."
College Student,4,"It's pretty nice. You can make it what you want. People like to go out, hook up, etc. Some people don't and that's cool too."
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of options, lots of price variations too,many very close to campus. There's a lot going on all hours of the day. Many come onto campus too. Food is great."
College Sophomore,4,"The classes I've taken so far at Vassar have been very interesting, and the professors very intelligent. Most are open to meeting with you whenever possible, and all have office hours specifically for students. Class sizes are a lot smaller than most other schools'. Overall it is very nice."
College Sophomore,4,"Vassar is pretty great about setting people up with connections and internships, and since it is a ""prestigious"" school, the name means a decent amount."
College Sophomore,4,"Vassar has a stunningly beautiful campus. Most of the buildings are pretty old, but they are well put together (with an exception made for some of the quad dorms)"
College Sophomore,4,"I am getting a decent amount of financial aid from my school - it takes a while to apply (as always) but Vassar is generally pretty good about giving people the money they need to attend, at least in my experience"
College Sophomore,4,I personally love my dorm - the bathrooms are nice and the people are very friendly. However I know this changes from dorm to dorm.
College Freshman,4,Very nice and green open space for the most part.
College Sophomore,4,"I love living on campus! Freshman have to live on campus. There are ""better"" dorms and ""worse"" dorms but almost everyone has dorm pride."
College Sophomore,4,The campus as a whole is pretty lenient. There are security measures in place but nothing over the top.
Freshman,2,"Taking courses online was a step back from the on-campus learning at Vassar college. In my experience, it seems as if the professors offered more homework during online courses without consideration of students suffering from the pandemic. In addition to more work, the support for online classes was not as helpful as it was in person. This is not the fault of the teacher but the situation that we were in as I couldn't connect with the material online."
Freshman,2,"If you plan on attending this school, I would say a visit is a neccessity. Please please please visit this school before you attend. For me, to be blunt, the campus is too small and this is exaggerated by the surrounding small town. The people tend to be homebodys who are slightly awkward. 

I will say, the professors put a lot of effort into what they do, the food is not bad it just gets old, and the campus is very serene and beautiful. 

This is just my opinion, I know many people who are very happy here. But I can't say the same."
Freshman,2,"While people find this college amazing, I don't. After a year here, I have found it to be not only the antithesis of what I was looking for, I felt I have grown a lot more conservative since I first arrived on campus given the hostile attitude toward free speech and open dialogue. Additionally, with the employment situation after graduation, I simply think paying $300k at sticker is a waste of my parents' money. 

However, I do believe the academics in this school is amazing and professors are among the most insightful people I have met. Some professors truly light up your world and that's the only thing I cling onto here."
College Sophomore,2,"People on campus tend not to care about athletics too much, though people on teams (from what I gather) seem to be happy and taken care of."
College Freshman,2,They're ready to help but these problems still happen.
College Sophomore,2,"Social atmosphere is rather exclusive. Dorms are old, and though many are refurbished, there are still bugs and rodents. Bathrooms are of very poor quality/cleanliness."
College Sophomore,2,"Social atmosphere is not as inclusive as it may seem; if you don't fit the profile of the typical Vassar student exactly, don't go to school here."
College Junior,2,"The THs are the only place you can attend a decent party,and even those are pretty weak. The music is basic, the dancing is kind of sad, and everyone is packed together like sardines in a can. Once in a blue moon, you will have a lot of fun in a TH party and that will be your excuse for going every weekend in the hopes for another fun night."
College Freshman,2,Poughkeepsie is definitely not a city worth seeing thats why many students hardly leave campus except to run errand or to eat.
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you break into the scene early as a freshman, it's extremely hard to get involved. Parties, even in senior housing, tend to be small, with lots of hard alcohol since kegs are banned on campus. You mostly party with the friends you live with, and it is impossible to get involved unless you have a connection."
College Sophomore,2,Its in the middle of a bad city with horrible atmosphere
College Sophomore,2,"The school is Division 3, so it's not like anyone coming here comes for athletics anyway. Some of the sports teams are really good, but they're not heroes on campus or anything."
College Sophomore,2,"""Bad"" is not a good term. This school just isn't much of a sports school. If you are in a sport, then it's all good, but there's not much attention to it."
College Freshman,2,"Drug use on campus is visible. It's very easy to obtain drugs and alcohol. But there are plenty of people who don't engage in it, and are perfectly happy."
College Freshman,2,"Poughkeepsie is a seedy, semi run-down town that most people dislike. That's why the majority of Vassar students don't frequently leave campus."
College Freshman,2,"The campus shuttle will take you to different parts of campus during the week and to the mall on weekends at select times. Other than that you're stuck using the expensive taxis that charge per-person, so splitting a taxi is pointless."
College Freshman,2,"The early fall and spring are nice, warm, and sometimes sunny, but the winter is long, cruel, and you spend 99% of it indoors hiding from the snow."
College Freshman,2,They have a bad course selection for biology. I can't get into classes because there aren't enough teachers.
College Freshman,2,I think sports deserve more credit here and I would definitely love some more school spirit.
College Freshman,2,Only public transport is a shuttle to the mall on weekends.
College Freshman,2,They are rather old and slow
College Sophomore,2,Everything on Vassar's campus is much nicer than anything in the rest of Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie is a pretty poor area. Vassar really is a bubble that people tend not to venture outside of.
College Sophomore,2,"Ugh. The people at the main dining hall try really hard but the food is mediocre. There's only one other place to eat open during the day and that's pretty good but they both have sort of inconvenient hours. If you ever want to eat after lunchtime but before dinnertime, you're out of luck. Also, none of this is cheap."
College Sophomore,2,"Almost everyone lives on campus. I have heard so many landlord horror stories. There's really hardly anything closer than a mile from campus, and what there is is very expensive. If you have a car or bike, there are a few decent options."
College Sophomore,2,Not too many students have cars and those who do are very popular because there's nowhere within walking distance to buy groceries. There are shuttles to Target but they're only on Saturdays and they fill up really fast. Having a car is not a necessity but it's preferable. 
College Sophomore,2,Student parking is extremely far from everything else and it's really easy to accidentally park in the wrong place and get a ticket.
College Sophomore,2,I guess they're good for those involved in them but varsity sports aren't big on campus.
College Student,2,"Most of the campus is very into marijuana (it is a liberal arts school, after all) and alcohol is of course easy to get access to/abundant on campus. Security tends to turn somewhat of a blind eye to underage drinking and drug use; that being said, if you choose not to partake, you won't be judged harshly."
College Sophomore,2,"You definitely need a car to get around Poughkeepsie. There's one street around Vassar that has restaurants and stuff, but sometimes you just need to go to the grocery store or mall or whatever. The Poughkeepsie taxis are awful--unreliable and expensive. And the only school shuttle runs on Saturdays from 3-9 on the hour (to the mall, stop and shop, and train station). I think only students doing internships in Poughkeepsie try to take the regular busses. Parking for underclassmen is a 15 minute walk away from most dorms."
College Freshman,2,"Campus dining at Vassar is bearable, but nothing extraordinary. There is one all campus dining hall that is buffet style, one swipe allows you unlimited food. There is also another dining facility where you pay for each item. This food is better than the dining hall but mildly expensive (..almost $7 for a sandwich). However, there aren't many options and the options they do have get old. There are some small restaurants a few minutes walk from campus that are delicious, but can be a bit pricey."
College Sophomore,2,"People here give Poughkeepsie a lot of s***, presumably because most people here are rich, sheltered kids from small towns who aren't used to being in pretty run down urban areas. But if you go out and explore Poughkeepsie (I'd say do so by taxi, car, or bus, not walking) it's not too bad. There's some great restaurants not too far. Walk down Main street and there's a plethora of authentic Mexican restaurants. There aren't any clubs or anything fun to do, though. And people really don't leave campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Very Very Liberal – it's a very liberal place and sometimes liberal to the point of not accepting ""non-liberal"" views, which is not quite liberal.. get that?"
College Junior,2,"You Will See and Smell Drugs – You will see and smell drugs. There is no way around it. Eventually you just get used to it or you move to a wellness floor. It's primarily marijuana, but depending on who you hang out with you'll definitely hear about ecstacy as well."
Recent Alumnus,2,Do NOT go into Poughkeepsie. Only reason the grade isn't lower than a C is that it's relatively easy to catch a train out to the City.
College Junior,2,"Not a Lot of Options – We are a small school, and this represents itself in the party scene. If you want big frat parties, this is not the school for you. Most parties are either in the suites or senior housing, and are either dance parties or beer pong parties. If you don't drink, you will get bored. You aren't judged for not drinking, the parties usually aren't as fun. The best parties are private parties with only your friends or sports teams, but I would probably think that wherever I attended. All parties are either on campus, or a couple blocks away, we don't really venture too far into Poughkeepsie."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not an Athletic School – We're very much an academic institution. While there are organized athletics and a ton of intermural opportunities, we don't even have a football team."
College Junior,2,"It's really nice to have a car on campus, as it is rather isolated. To get anywhere otherwise, you'd have to take a cab. Parking is pretty cheap - $60/semester. However, there is only one designated lot for students, which is a fifteen minute walk from the heart of campus. It's pretty bothersome, especially if you're walking back to your dorm from the parking lot at night. Not really safe."
College Junior,2,Barely Any – No one really wants to live off-campus. It's kind of a sketchy area.
College Junior,2,"Too Busy – You'll be surprised how quickly you'll forget that Vassar does not extend to the ends of the earth. You get caught up in activities, so it's rare that you'll be venturing out into Poughkeepsie. There are opportunities for teaching at Poughkeepsie Day School and working with the prison initiative. There is also a mall, a drive-in, and a 24-hour diner."
College Sophomore,2,"It's beautiful, don't get me wrong, but be prepared to not see the sun for most of the year. The campus is stunning, but the snow can be overwhelming."
Alum,1,I did not take any online courses at Vassar College nor were they offered to any students during my tenure.
Junior,1,"Definitely only go here if you are as left as the political spectrum goes. It is an obscure scene here. I thought that it would be an incredible environment of acceptance and diversity, but everyone splits off into groups based on a common similarity and often only mingle with each other at the ""parties"" held in the THs, though they usually end up to be around 100 people standing around with weird rap music blaring. This school wouldn't know how to throw a party if it was the only thing to keep the institution running. Most students are too awkward/nervous to say hi to others when walking to class. It's a bit ridiculous here."
College Senior,1,"i was looking for a school which invites discussion and is accepting of differing opinions. what i found was a place which caters to those who were picked on in high school because they are different...and now they do the same to others. i am a white, male, heterosexual who likes art,music and literature. if you are similar stay as far away from here as possible-you will be treated like charles manson. i had no idea my 'white privilege' (i am on scholarship and come from a lower-middle class broken home...but trust me i am fine) would grant others the opportunity to bash me at will. to make matters worse, the majority of the teachers and the classes regardless of subject ALL focus on race, gender, sex, discrimination, safe spaces, the end of the first amendment, and close minded liberals who are overly sensitive. stay away!"
College Junior,1,"The quality of food is poor, and its prepared poorly. Not much variety, same things over and over. No nice berries, just frozen berry mix. Can no longer swipe for other people, which is bogus. The online menu is wrong and nonexistent fall semester. The retreat is nice, but I can't spend meal swipes there. A meal swipe is worth too much for the little I get with it."
College Freshman,1,"Vassar claims to be very diverse and accepting and it is towards the LGBT community, but I cannot say the same for minorities on campus. Since it  is a private university White students make up over half of the school and it is very evident."
College Freshman,1,Vassar does not have Greek Life :(
College Freshman,1,"Hardly anyone lives off-campus, and those who do don't speak too highly of it. Poughkeepsie isn't a nice place."
College Freshman,1,Have to park really far away and parking enforcement is terrible.
College Sophomore,1,There are hardly any available and they are slow. But people hardly use them anyways.
College Sophomore,1,"There are no consequences for drug use. It's a very big part of the Vassar culture, and limiting for students who don't want to be involved. Sure, you can do other things,  but in a school so small, there's no way that the drug culture doesn't influence your experience, whether you're participating or not."
College Sophomore,1,"Unless you have a car or go down to the city often, there's nothing to do in Poughkeepsie. There are restaurants around Vassar, and the variety isn't bad, but Poughkeepsie is by no means a ""college town."" The closest movie theatre is 25 minutes and a $17 cab ride away."
College Junior,1,"Recently the campus has been buckling down, being much stricter with security and handing out outrageous to minor offenses. It's abhorrent."
College Senior,1,Almost Completely White – Attempt to diversify campus is accepting solely Chinese-nationals
College Freshman,1,"Sports Not a School-Spirit Booster – Varsity sports at Vassar are not a very big part of campus life. Those who go to various games usually go because they themselves have some sort of connection to someone on the team or to the sport itself. Sports events are not  campus-wide events and are rarely even talked about by other students. Those who do play sports, however, set themselves apart due to the rest of the student body's lack of interest, resulting in cliques."

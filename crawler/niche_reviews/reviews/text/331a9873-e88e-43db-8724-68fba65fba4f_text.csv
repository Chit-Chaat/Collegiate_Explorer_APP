Alum,5,"SLU is the perfect blend of academics and fun. The professors are typically very invested in their subjects and excited to meet and work with the students. Student life/ the party scene is unbeatable: on-campus live concerts at least once a week for those who like a good jam band, the dirtiest dance club in the county is a half-mile from campus who what to drop it low, the best bar in the world is located 2 blocks from the front entrance of the library, and all the house parties you could ever want at any of the theme houses that border the edge of campus. Not to mentions that Outing Club, those dirty ragamuffins are always good for a rowdy time. 56 Park is not for the faint of heart.  Honesty, the best thing you will take away from SLU is a group of life long friends that somehow always seem to pop up at the best times."
Alum,5,I never had to take online classes but I assume that SLU professors would be very accommodating and flexible.
Freshman,5,Very welcoming & helpful people. Campus is fun and classes are interesting. Always something to do through many official and unofficial activities. Dorm and food is decent.
Freshman,5,SLU has been the best college experience I could ever wish for. I am surrounded by not only fantastic people but people who more often or not are on the same if not more academically motivated. We like to have fun here whist getting things done. It is a great balance.
Alum,5,Amazing school. I went during a tough time in my life so I didn't get everything out of it that I should have but I would definitely recommend it. A more isolated campus close to the Adirondacks so not ideal if you're looking for a big city experience but great student involvement and academics.
Freshman,5,"St. Lawrence University offers a college experience that would perfectly suit anyone; from their 24-hour library which features numerous study settings, which accommodate any learning style, to their themed housing for upper-classmen, to their picturesque location, to their free laundry and environmentally-friendly campus, SLU truly captures what it means to be a modern school."
Freshman,5,"Good, small liberal arts school in Upstate, New York. This campus is always beautiful and students and staff are all very friendly. It could offer more food options for students, especially those with food allergies."
Freshman,5,I absolutely love St. Lawrence! The school is a very unique community with lots of opportunities in both academics and socially. The first year problem that St. Lawrence offers is a great way to get to know the people you will be living with. I'm excited to spend the next 4 years at such a great school!
Junior,5,"Saint Lawrence has so much to offer students. The administration is so happy to help every student establish and achieve their academic goals. The students make a small campus feel close-knit with friendly faces that greet you when you pass. Warm smiles from everyone on campus make the winters bearable. The networking opportunities at St. Lawrence are like no other, your future beyond college life is made such a priority at this school."
Alum,5,"St. Lawrence University afforded my the opportunity to study off-campus twice in two very different settings. The first time I lived off the grid in an intentional community, calling the Adirondacks home with eleven other individuals. The second time I traveled overseas to Kenya where I studied the intersections between environment, development and culture."
Alum,5,"Great academics, involved student body, great alumni network, and professors that are involved in students future"
Sophomore,5,"I see others comment that it’s horrible here because it’s in the middle of nowhere, and I wonder if they didn’t notice that when they visited? It’s definitely rural, and I don’t have any issues with that. Same with the off campus bars and restaurants. A small town is not going to have spectacular nightlife. 
The food is ok and definitely gets repetitive in Dana. I like the Pub and use the meal exchange a lot. 
There are a lot of affluent white kids, but you can’t magically increase diversity. We do have a pretty good size international student body and I think that helps. If you’re a minority, please apply, that’s how you increase diversity. I am quirky and a bit awkward and I have found a wonderful group of friends, so while you see a lot of preppy kids, I haven’t had any trouble fitting in. I really like my professors so far. I do know some kids who don’t love a professor here and there."
Sophomore,5,"Students smart, very preppy, come from a lot of money!   Weather not so good.
Athletics very good, very competitive.   Students are friendly.  Dorms Ok.. newer Dorm is best.  Area/community - not much going on.  Not many hotels. Winters are cold."
Freshman,5,"I love the liberal arts education, because it gives em the opportunity to experience material outside my major.   The professors are all very dedicated and want to work with students, which is what I wanted in a university."
Junior,5,"Although it may get too cold in the North Country, the extreme cold weather is what leads many of St. Lawrence University's students to be filled with passion, hard-work, and create a strong community with each other. On top of that students in this campus  truly care about making a positive mark on the world. This small campus allows for a friendly face in every classroom, club, and dorm life."
Alum,5,"I transferred to St. Lawrence from another university and am so glad I did. These four years were some of the best of my life. Fantastic people, great professors, strong sense of community."
Freshman,5,"St. Lawrence is truly a family tight unit. It small structure in size does not match up to its full potential. The employees here at SLU invest so much of their time into the students so that we can all get the degree and education we want. There is so many various clubs, athletics and activities to do. The alumni connection branches to all parts of the World which makes this small family into an even bigger one!"
Alum,5,"SLU was in a very small town, with little to do.  The tight nit campus allowed me to easily find lifelong friends, those of whom I still keep in touch with.  I was involved with athletics for my first two years, both of which were great experiences.  I was able to learn how to prioritize efficiently between the academics and athletics.  Additionally, the small class sizes allowed me to form close relationships with my teachers.  The academic atmosphere was constructed in such a way that made learning, asking questions and test taking, easy and manageable.  My four years at SLU were some of the best years of my life.  I was able to grow in my studies, which allowed me to find what I really wanted to do for my future career.  It gave me the determination and desire to go out into the world and create my own path."
Sophomore,5,"St. Lawrence has a beautiful and active campus. Students are passionate, academics are rigorous, and professors are wonderful. There are so many ways to get involved in clubs and student activities. Though the surrounding area is very rural and campus can feel isolated, SLU students are never bored as there is always so much happening right on campus. "
College Freshman,5,The alumni network is huge. That is one thing the school takes pride in. They have many resources to connect you to alumni that can help you get an internship or job or even give you advice for your field.
College Freshman,5,During orientation the school stressed to us all our resources when it comes to Safety. The school is very interested in our safety and do the best to make sure the students feel safe.
College Freshman,5,"The parties especially the big weekends like titus, halloween, springiest and fallfest make SLU AMAZING!"
College Freshman,5,Parties every weekend thursday-saturday and JAVA and TICKER are LIT
College Freshman,5,Study abroad programs are amazing! And professors are geniuses in their fields
College Freshman,5,Not as much racial/economic diversity but a lot of other kinds of diversity and its all very accepted
College Freshman,5,There's really no peer pressure/admin is very chill
College Freshman,5,Security is a lot of the time too good.
College Freshman,5,"Class sizes are small, profs are passionate/genius"
College Freshman,5,Almuni network is the BEST/career services are WOW
College Freshman,5,1stYear Average.2nd Great.3rd AWESOME.4th THE BEST
College Freshman,5,"The alumni network is the biggest reason I came to SLU -- there are so many programs and meet-and-greets that, if you take advantage of them, are great ways to network for internship opportunities. The career services office is pretty helpful, especially for first-years."
College Freshman,5,"I've had the advantage of only needing to take courses that interest me -- I had transfer credits for gen ed requirements. Even 100-level classes are pretty small (largest for me was around 30-40 in econ/gov) although, classes like bio101 and chem101 will obviously be larger. Professors are dedicated and understanding, almost always willing to meet with you any time. Classes have honestly been one of the best parts of SLU for me."
College Freshman,5,Best choice academically and socially.
College Freshman,5,"Personally, I have always felt safe on campus. I haven't had a problem with security."
College Freshman,5,I love St. Lawrence. I'm so glad I decided to apply here. I love the small size and the professors are wonderful.
College Freshman,5,The St. Lawrence Career center is so helpful and the alumni network is so willing to help SLU graduates as they enter the workforce.
College Freshman,5,The dorm atmosphere really feels like a huge community at SLU. It's easy to get along with those around you and problems are dealt with in a timely fashion when they do come up.
College Freshman,5,"To be honest, I'm not really a sports person. However, I've found myself attending more sporting events than I ever have before because I love the SLU spirit. Everyone cheers on our fellow classmates and roots for each other. I feel sports add to the community at SLU."
College Freshman,5,"Choosing to go to St. Lawrence University was one of the best choices I've ever made. The SLU community is truly unique and I love all of the relationships I'm forming. From friends to professors, everyone is willing to help you in some way."
College Freshman,5,I really love this school. I have great friends and great classes.
College Freshman,5,"I love this school, but almost everyone is the same. There is very little diversity on this campus, but there is a great sense of community."
College Freshman,5,The sense of community at St. Lawrence is incredible.
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love St. Lawrence University. It is by far one of my favorite places on Earth. The north country people are so very nice and the environment feels perfect for me. I've had so many wonderful experiences here that it is hard to choose one. However, if I had to talk about one, I would say every weekend when me and my friends get together to have burritos and watch movies. My school is unique because there is so much more to being here than just being a student. You are part of the community. If I could choose to come here again I would do it without a doubt."
College Freshman,5,"I love St. Lawrence. It isn't too small, but there is such a wonderful sense of community on campus. The professors are great, classes are interesting and campus is beautiful! There are great academic and career resources. Even the food is amazing, and most of the residences are decent. Being at a liberal arts school means that everyone has a wide variety of interests- very few people fit into any stereotype. The typical SLU student is passionate, social, and motivated. It's pretty easy to meet new people with similar interests. Since we are in such a rural area, there are always events to keep us busy on campus- the entertainment comes to us. The student body is very diverse, but almost everyone has one thing in common: we all love SLU!"
College Sophomore,5,"I love this campus with a passion, though the winters are frigid and snowy it is a gorgeous environment. Hockey games in the winter and football games in the fall, the campus never gets boring. You can go skiing every weekend and there are a number of plays and events year round to keep us active and informed. Though the classes are challenging, the professors make it their greatest interest to help students understand the work. there are many free resources to help also therefore failing is not an option. If you put in the effort, you will get a favorable reward. My school is unique because of our hockey games and pub cookies as well as the Monday dinner special called the saints bowl. If it could do it all over again, I would still chose St. Lawrence because of the atmosphere and the year round beautiful campus as well as my friends."
College Senior,5,"St. Lawrence is amazing! I was raised in Queens, NY (NYC), so coming to St. Lawrence was definitely a huge change from the big city to the North Country! However, if you are open minded, you can definitely make it! I have come to enjoy outdoor activities and even though there aren't as many stores around as the city, it is a typical college town. St. Lawrence does a fabulous job of making sure that everyone is comfortable in terms of adjusting and transitioning. The professors are always there for you to talk to, and being a small school, you are able to get one-on-one help easily as well as gain connections! The dining hall food is pretty good for dining hall food. There have been a lot of changes to the campus since I have been at St. Lawrence, but there are currently 5 places that you can eat on campus, and at difference times. Coming to St. Lawrence, a liberal arts college, my career path has changed A LOT, but there was never any judgement from my professors or peers, just encouragement! You also have a lot of flexibility with what you can study! I am currently an Economics major, with a double minor in Fine Arts and Anthropology! The abroad semesters are fantastic as well! I have many scholarships, but even so SLU ( St. Lawrence) wants people to be able to study abroad and have that experience! This past Spring I went to Trinidad and Tobago. For a person who is struggling financially, I was still able to go abroad and have that experience! Housing is an interesting part of SLU as well! The dorms are very good for dorms. They recently built a new dorm and have renovated one of the current dorms. St. Lawrence also has senior townhouses as well as theme houses. The theme houses are very unique to SLU. You literally live in a house, and this house consists of a group of students ranging from 8-20, that share similar interests! I have lived in a theme house for the past two years and I love it!"
College Junior,5,"The campus, academics, athletics, and people are amazing. It is truly a great school and has much to offer. It is rigorous, yet there is always help if needed."
College Sophomore,5,This school straight hands out money to the people who need or deserve it. Its really great and helps a ton
College Sophomore,5,"We have sick facilities here. The gym is gorgeous, and the soccer field look like a professional pitch. Shoutout to Bobby D!"
College Sophomore,5,"Pretty lenient campus police. People love to go out an have fun, and the campus police respect that. Unless your are loud and doing something way out of line, they leave you alone. It's pretty nice"
College Junior,5,"I think we pride ourselves on having amazing athletic facilities. You can find indoor and outdoor tennis courts, amazing squash courts, indoor and outdoor tracks, and a great gym to name a few."
College Junior,5,I always feel safe on campus. As a female walking alone has never been an issue. There are usually always people around and a lot of light posts around.
College Junior,5,"Faculty is very helpful and supportive. You'll often have classes with some of the same people who are your major. The science majors are the only ones who are really on their own and in their own group. Because of all the labs, classes and research, the science majors such as Biology or Chemistry, really only stay in their own building for everything, so other majors don't interact with them as much I find."
College Junior,5,"Academics are superior. St. Lawrence has great faculty and hard-working students. The work load can get pretty heavy sometimes, but everyone is in the same boat. It never gets to the point where your work in unmanageable, but we are pushed and challenged a lot. However, because of the SLU atmosphere and people here, people know how to balance life and academics. We all help each other out, and I have not sensed a severe completive attitude on campus at anytime."
College Sophomore,5,"Students do not have access to any buildings except their own residence building after 11pm, which can be constraining and can cause difficulties."
College Sophomore,5,"The classes are good, with the range of requirements meaning you will be well rounded. Professors may be hard, but they are mostly very nice and happy to help if you have any problems."
College Freshman,5,The campus here is great with working with students to make college a great experiece
College Sophomore,5,"CAs and RAs are really helpful resources if you have any issue or question about your dorm. The res halls are kept pretty clean and the room sizes vary dependin on dorm type and location. Pretty much every dorm has a kitchen and lounge area. Laundry is free and most are centrally located. SLU is the place to come for great dorm life, they really can become a home away from home, as long as you don't mind the non-stop parties."
Recent Alumnus,5,"For a small school, SLU is pretty much going to have everything you need as far as facilities go."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Students at SLU love to party and have fun, and they will find ways to do that even if it's -30 degrees."
Sophomore,4,"My favorite part about St Lawrence University is the community that forms once you arrive. I was worried at first about making friends since I am shy, but that was not a problem. Within the first day or two, I had made a group of friends that lasted throughout the school year and even now. In this time period, I also gained new friends throughout the year, one of which will be my roommate this coming year. One thing I would change about St Lawrence is the meal plan for freshman. We had unlimited swipes at the dining hall, but the pub had all types of food a majority of the day. I ended up having to add more money both semesters so that i could continue going to the pub to get smoothies and wraps."
Freshman,4,"St. Lawrence University is a very close-knit college with a diverse and peaceful campus. My favorite thing about SLU is the sense of community within the student body, and the positivity that everyone has towards their studies."
Freshman,4,"St. Lawrence is a beautiful, rural college. It is a small sized college with so many nice people. There is a large sense of community here. The teachers here are very willing to help, and want to get to know you personally. There are many clubs on campus, and you can always find an activity that you like even if it isn't a club. There are 3 other colleges around St. Lawrence so there is a large amount of college students that you can connect with. The only downside to SLU is that there is a little disconnect between the administration buildings."
Junior,4,St. Lawrence is a good school with a tight community of students. The teachers are all very smart in their fields and make you want to learn.
Freshman,4,St. Lawrence University is a great liberal arts school that has an outstanding alumni network. I have been able to get lots of one on one help from professors which has made it possible for me to succeed as a student. Working for college admissions has also been an amazing experience and has made me into a much stronger public speaker and has opened my eyes to new opportunities.
Freshman,4,"SLU is a school with phenomenal academics and alumni network. The school is very liberal and if you are conservative be prepared not to be heard. Many of the students here portray an entitled vibe because of their parents money, but you will find that at most schools. Athletic's are a big part of the community as well as the night life. There is always something to do Thursday's and Saturdays, but Fridays tend to be a slower night. If you choose to apply or attend SLU and you are a great student academically, you will come out making big bucks. The student to teacher ratio is low, and in my experience I would say 12-1. Furthermore, there so many majors one commit to. However, I wish there was more an emphasis on the Business in the Liberal Arts, but I am still young and have not completely been exposed so I do not know. Overall, if you come to SLU your going to have fun and get a great education."
Freshman,4,"I have found St. Lawrence University to be a very welcoming community, and have found an abundance of opportunities available to me. The professors are very welcome and knowledgeable in their subjects, and make learning more exciting. I will be studying abroad with a very highly recognized, SLU program next semester. Have very much enjoyed my time here so far."
Junior,4,"St. Lawrence University provides a warm, tight-knit community and friendly atmosphere. Academics are great and networking opportunities are endless. Great professors and a great community. Small class sizes with about 25 students in a typical course. Not much to do in Canton, NY but there are always things you can find. One down-side is that there is not much diversity, but I think it is starting to get better."
Alum,4,"St. Lawrence is incredibly focused on the learning and well-being of its students.  St. Lawrence compels students to be well-rounded and worldly in encouraging them to study abroad, join interesting clubs, take a variety of classes, and pursue research.  Professors are always there to support students."
Freshman,4,"SLU is an awesome place to go to school! I am only a freshman here, but I have enjoyed by first year so much! Everyone is extremely nice, and it is easy to find a friend group! The campus community is very close, I will say that must be partly due to the fact that off of the campus there isn't much to do! St. Lawrence has great relationships with their alumni, and offers amazing help in career services! Overall, I love it here!"
College Freshman,4,I love the class sizes here. One of the reasons I chose this school was because of the class sizes. They really enhance the quality of learning and ensure that students are getting the teaching and help they need.
College Freshman,4,"Being a D3 school, everyone is still very interested in seeing how the teams do. Hockey is huge here so the school will get the most involved for hockey season. What I like though is that there still is a chance for walk ons. My friend tried out for the lacrose team and made it and I'm trying to walk on to the ski team."
College Freshman,4,"My favorite experience was during orientation when the who first year class lit candles on the quad. It was one of those experiences that I won't forget and although there were difficulties in keeping candles lit, once they were all lit it was beautiful to see how they lit up the dark sky."
College Freshman,4,It's just as good as being on a varsity sport!Good
College Freshman,4,HOCKEY IS AMAZING!Everyone is fit/does intramurals
College Freshman,4,I feel extremely safe on campus. I have no problem with walking back from the library late at night.
College Freshman,4,"The class sizes are great for getting one on one time with the professors. You aren't just another student, they was to get to know you and work with you."
College Freshman,4,"The career service center will do whatever they can to help you. They offer mock interviews, resume workshops, and connections to alumni."
College Freshman,4,Freshmen are housed based on their First Year Program. This makes it easier to make friends right away.
College Freshman,4,Hockey is a big part of the community. Sitting in the student section is a must to get the full experience.
College Freshman,4,Great campus with a strong sense of community. Good academics with lots of options. Lots of opportunities to explore interests.
College Freshman,4,"Ice hockey is a really big deal here - really fun for most of the student body to come out and support together. Soccer and football games are pretty fun, too."
College Freshman,4,"I haven't been here for long, and at first I didn't like it. But once you get to know more people, you realize how diverse the campus is in terms of backgrounds and interests. There is something for pretty much everyone. I feel welcomed and included."
Recent Alumnus,4,"St. Lawrence is the epitome of the expression ""It's not what you know, but who you know."" The alumni network is strong, especially in business and on Wall Street."
College Freshman,4,So far I am really enjoying my experience. I have only been here for one semester but am very happy with my choice.
College Freshman,4,"I think that St. Lawrence University is really unique. We are a small school in North Country, and even if you see the same people in Student Center everyday, you can still be surprised by the number of things that happen here."
College Freshman,4,"I've had a great experience so far here. Being in the north country, you need to be curious and seek out your own fun, and there is plenty to do if you look for it. Classes have been good overall so far, and the social scene is good for the most part, albeit heavily alcohol oriented. No complaints here!"
College Freshman,4,"SLU takes its athletics seriously. Most people are physically involved one way or another.

Also, the department is amazing."
College Freshman,4,Classes are generally small. The professors are pretty good. The variety of courses falls short. There is usually one or two sections for all classes which is really frustrating when you need a certain class.
College Freshman,4,"We have a ""Use don't abuse policy here."" You may drink alcohol but don't be dumb. However if you are drinking in public and not in your room or a party the security will ask you to pour out your drink. Also the school does not allow the Canton Police on campus so that is good. Security does not break up parties unless it gets super, super crazy which is very rare."
College Junior,4,It's a very wet campus and the administration knows it. Not trying to get anyone in trouble just trying to keep everyone safe.
College Junior,4,All the equipment is new and up to date!
College Junior,4,The science department is very helpful when it comes to trying to apply for the next step in your life such as medical or graduate schools.
College Sophomore,4,"For a liberal arts school, there is a pretty wide array of majors and minors to select from. And if one doesn't sit you exactly, St. Lawrence offers it's students to create their own major."
College Junior,4,"Thursdays and Saturdays are generally the big nights to go out. Fridays you can find plenty of fun parties going on, but more people tend to relax on a Friday night and save up energy for Saturday. A lot of students have schedules which allow them to have no classes on Fridays which explains why Thursdays are such a popular night to go out. There are always parties going on at houses around or off campus, dorms, suites, and townhouses. No one ever has a problem finding something fun to do if you're in the mood to party."
College Freshman,4,"Security is always available by a phonecall, we have a safe walk program, and the advocates program to deal with sexual assault. Was really happy with how sexual assault was dealt with especially after hearing horrible stories about college cover ups."
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics at St. Lawrence University can be very prestigious, and athletes are well cared for and appreciated. However, there is significant discouragement from athletes' involvement in other co-curricular activities on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"This was my dream school going in, and while not everything is perfect, I'm glad in my decision to go and couldn't see myself anywhere else."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus security seems to do a good job. I personally haven't been to any parties that were busted, but I've heard about it. Sexual assault is an issue on campus, hence why we have a hotline for it."
College Sophomore,4,"With the initial financial aid package, there wasn't enough for me to be able to attend. However, once we emailed them they gave another grant that made it possible for me to go."
College Freshman,4,The facilities are very well kept
College Freshman,4,"I have been to the gym a few times and it very nice. Up to date equipment and plenty of it. There is an indoor climbing wall, which I have yet to use, and indoor tennis courts. Appleton Arena is nice and very fun to go to during hockey games. During the warmer seasons, the local river has a canoe shack that is run by the school and is free. It is right on the running trials which are also very nice."
College Freshman,4,St. Lawrence has a very large endowment and therefore gives out very good scholarships. I am paying the same or less than SUNY tuition. I did very well in high school and was rewarded for it. St. Lawrence makes it easy for someone who is prepared to go here to be able to afford it.
College Freshman,4,"I say it's great for those who like to party. If you enjoy partying then you will not struggle to find somewhere to party. Everything from the suites to Dean is fair game on the weekend. This campus lets loose every weekend. Friday is just prep for the night and the weekend. Sunday is hangover and panic to get homework done. Most people don't remember Saturday is. Honestly, I find it pathetic because for those who do not drink there is not much to do at night on the weekends."
College Sophomore,4,"SLU has an amazing alumni network. A degree from this school will definitely get you noticed, an most students leave with at least an internship or graduate school plans. Career services has more workshops than one person can attend, an they are all focused on specific topics which range from future plans to how to build the perfect resume. The people there are super helpful, and if you have a question they can't answer, they will refer you to someone who can."
College Sophomore,4,"Most professors really care and take pride in teaching great lessons. If you have a bad professor, or issue with something, you can make a report and try to have something done bout it. Students fill out reports on each class an professor at the end of the semester. The class sizes are fairly small. My smallest class was three students an my largest class so far had about 40. A good portion of the courses are lecture based, but interactive as well, and most teachers have flexible office hours."
College Sophomore,4,"Hockey is really big on campus an students really enjoy football games. Varsity sports are the go-to event for a competitive atmosphere. If you're just looking for a fun time with friends, intramurals are great even if you're just part of the crowd. SLU has a ton of school spirit, even when we lose, but the players definitely take it hard. The gym, track, workout room, and pool are all open to students with an ID card, very clean, and easily accessible."
College Sophomore,4,"Greeks are pretty normal, outgoing people here, and definitely throw great parties but they can be very exclusive. There are only a few options for Greek life, but it is available if you want to join."
College Sophomore,4,"There are two main dining options on campus: Dana, the buffet style dining hall, which is open three times a day and twice on weekends; the pub, which is open pretty much all day every day and also has a coffee shop and mini convenience store. There is also Pub 56, which doubles as a bar and hangout  space, usually only utilized on weekend nights. The Grab-and Go which is good for a bagged lunch you can carry to class, the Bookstore coffee shop which has the best muffins and cappacinos, and a few others small limited option places. You can pretty much get anything you're craving on campus, and the full flex meal plan covers most of it."
College Sophomore,4,"The food is fairly good quality and there are some really ethnic places. Plus a mcdonalds, and four or five different pizza places. The only problem is that they don't open until late afternoon, but they're great if you want a large pepperoni at 2AM"
College Sophomore,4,"When you're first accepted, admissions asks for a desired major. You can plan and take courses to fulfill your major's requirements, but can't actually declare until sophomore year. The new APR system does make it a bit harder than it has been in the past to get into classes you need seeing as how there are no more preferences for majors/class years. But other than that, picking a major and taking the proper classes is pretty easy and you can change or create your own major."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Honestly, you're going to hit bumps wherever you go. But I loved my experience at SLU overall."
Recent Alumnus,4,There are some gems that use lots of local farm fresh food. My suggestions are and always will be the Blackbird and 1844 House!
Recent Alumnus,4,"Professors were fantastic! Except for a few duds, of course."
Recent Alumnus,4,I loved being an English major at SLU. I wouldn't do it any differently if I had to do it again.
Recent Alumnus,4,"If you want, you can design your own major-- which I think it pretty awesome. 

I was an English major and wouldn't change a thing. There is some tension between the English Lit profs and the English Writing profs, but that's just a small stupid thing. It's mostly just the old guys that need to recognize that English Writing is a valuable part of the English world."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Diversity can mean a bunch of different things. To me, it means different type of people. I think SLU is really opening up to different type of people (meaning different interests, different political beliefs, etc.) You're going to find jocks at this school, and you're going to find hippies, and everything in between. 

As long as you're an outgoing person, you are going to fit in somewhere at St. Lawrence. If you're quieter, you might be in a little bit of trouble."
Recent Alumnus,4,The athletic facilities are pretty great for a school that's D3 in most sports.
Recent Alumnus,4,SO MANY people are on scholarships at SLU. Something like 90% of kids get financial help in some way shape or form. I personally had two types-- loans and another scholarship.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Housing was pretty awesome. I was able to avoid the ""dreaded"" room draw every year by living in a theme house (interview process) and then by living in a senior townhouse (application process). They're always re-doing certain dorms, so you're not really gonna be too screwed over no matter what you get."
Freshman,2,"I was a freshman at St. Lawrence this past year and I have to say i did not have a good experience. There were a few main reasons as to why I won’t be returning for next year. 1) The location is extremely isolated, remote, and overall very depressing in the winter. If you are looking for a college with a nice college town, this ain’t it. The lack of accessibility to transportation makes it very frustrating to leave campus at any point in time. You are allowed to have a car, but if you don’t own one it makes it almost impossible to get off campus in any way. 2) the weather makes winters dreary and never ending. Some nights can get down to -10 degrees. Not fun. 3) The student body can be very cliquey and closed off. Once students make friends in the first week, it is hard to branch out and makes new ones. 4) the dining hall has NO OPTIONS and the food is not good at all. Overall, I would say I am happy my experience at SLU is over"
Freshman,2,"I took classes during the online period, I can say that like many other schools, classes were not as engaging and I did not retain as much information as I would have liked. For the tuition of the school, the quality of learning online was very poor and not worth it at all."
Sophomore,2,"I soon realized that St. Lawrence University was a very cliquey school and the friendly people are always deemed weird. Kids stay up literally all night on Thursdays (which is fun if you're a partier) but it's mainly found as an annoyance when you're trying to sleep. Most students don't respect the dorm halls and destroy them when they get drunk. Every single FYP and FYS is ridiculously stupid/long/boring, and a waste of time if it doesn't help with your intended major. The professors are very friendly and love when you go to office hours. Overall, you better make friends really fast otherwise you'll be left in the dust for the rest of your time at SLU. Thought this was my dream school, clearly not."
Sophomore,2,"This is a love or hate school, there is very little middle ground. I enjoyed my time here but it was clearly not for me. The school works on an FYP system where people tend to make friends very quickly and ultimately becomes EXTREMELY cliquey. People only care about partying and by partying I mean drinking in a dorm with four other people. If you try to really try to meet new people, you're going to come off as weird. The school has a system of popularity almost like a high school. If you don't make friends very quickly you will become very socially isolated and grow to hate the school."
Freshman,2,"To say that this school is a total bust would be an understatement. I have been mocked, spit on (literally), and ostracised by my peers due to the simple fact that I do not drink alcohol or do drugs (I medically cannot). To have been lied to by the admissions department that there is ""sober options available"" for students is another bust. There ARE NO SOBER OPTIONS AVAILABLE! Student Government tries really hard but no one shows up to these fraud events. The local area is a joke, residence halls are trashed almost weekly, and everyone seems to have come from the same 5 prestigious boarding schools in New England where everyone is white, rich, egotistical, elitist and talks, dresses, and thinks the same. I am definitely transferring out this year. STAY AWAY! If you do not drink or do drugs  you will be left out, and develop signs of depression."
Sophomore,2,This school holds strong pride in its “diversity.” But my first day on campus I quickly realized that there really wasn’t much diversity. Not to mention the only thing to do for fun at school is get wasted on the weekends. Not great for someone who doesn’t drink or do drugs.
Niche User,2,"I grew up in the area, so I thought coming back would be an okay idea. Soon I found out I was wrong. The students are mainly rich, preppy, snooty students. The professors have a mind of their own and don’t notice if something is wrong. I had zero advising. All of this led me to feel extremely alone, anxious, and had no help with what to do next. The food is terrible and living in a further away dorm from everyone else doesn’t help. Not recommended at all. There are far better places to go for cheaper and for a better education."
Freshman,2,"Don't come here if you are not a preppy, ignorant and uncultured New Englander.  You will find 88% of the students here are like that. No diversity at all. Students here, in general, are completely not interested in the outside world ar all. They want to forever stuck in their own little world  and die in their preppy New England dream. Everyone here dresses the same, talk the same, and think the same. Mostly shallow, superficial and uncultured. Too much basicness. Also, if you are from a city, I strongly recommend you do not come here. Trust me, you don't want to deal with the countryside people.However, I do like the professor here. Especially Katherine Wolfe and Olivia Cedric.  Academics are descent."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It seems like the only things happening on campus on weekends are dorm room parties. Not all parties are out-of-control, and those that are mostly take place in the senior townhouses and the suites, which are somewhat secluded from the rest of campus. Parties closer to the center of campus are usually smaller, although there are a number of loud drunk and/or stoned students who like to bang on doors and generally cause mayhem. It seems like practically everyone on campus drinks to at least some degree, and it seems like many use drugs of some sort. Conversely, there are others who don't use substances, but there seems to be a prevalent attitude on campus that if one doesn't partake, they're considered ""lame"" and (whether intentionally or not) excluded from most aspects of campus life."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is a constant flow of alcohol and drugs onto the St. Lawrence campus, and Safety and Security seems to turn a blind eye to the problem. They also encourage people to report incidents to them rather than the Canton PD, which I suspect is to keep the number of documented police reports to a minimum (and therefore keep the U.S. News ratings inflated). With that said, even though enforcement and punishment by Safety and Security tend to be VERY lenient, Canton and SLU are generally safe places."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Due to the small size of the school, course offerings are pretty limited. Also, the quality of professors can vary greatly across and even within departments and programs. I've had some who are hard-working, understanding, helpful, and genuinely interested in their fields of expertise. I've also had a couple who were absolutely horrendous, unprofessional, and one who was possibly discriminatory. Also, it seems like each professor thinks their class is the only class students take each semester, so the workloads tend to get pretty heavy late in the semester. Overall, the quality of education is good. However, I have to give a low rating due to the quality variation and lack of consistency amongst professors."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Besides the new dorm that was built after I left, the dorms on campus can be charitably described as decrepit. The freshman dorms were built during the 1950s and '60s, and it seems as if the college hasn't done a thing to them since. The suites have a bit of a stench of pot and cheap booze, and have definitely seen better days, and the senior townhouses are trashed on a weekly basis due to partying. Sykes was nice once, but now is starting to almost literally fall apart. Dean-Eaton is a complete dump of an eyesore, absolutely REEKS of marijuana, has toilets that back up with an alarming degree of regularity, and should be demolished and replaced with something less trashy and sketchy. Theme houses are in various states of disrepair, and ""off-""campus apartments (which are actually on the periphery of campus) are a sadistic joke. Oh, and true off-campus housing is virtually non-existent. But I hear the new dorm that opened about a year and a half ago is nice. It actually has more than one or two bathrooms per floor!"
College Freshman,2,"Make friends with someone that owns a car ASAP. Canton restaurants are a joke. The local Chinese and Mexican are horrendous (The woman at the Chinese restaurant doesn't even label her menu right). To get decent food, you need to go to bigger cities further away and you're not going there on foot."
College Freshman,2,"I'm not a picky eater (thank God), but sooner or later, Dana food gets really (and I mean REALLY) repetitive. It doesn't help that the quality of the food is at the lower end of the spectrum."
College Freshman,2,"If I could go back in time, I would not apply to this school. It is too expensive for a poor student to afford. There is not much diversity. Don't let them fool you. If you are from a big city, diversity on campus is a joke. If you are from a small, mostly all white town, then this place has tons of diversity. Not just racial diversity that is lacking it is also economic and ideology diversity. Most kids are from upper middle class families, dress the same (it is like a uniform), and think the same way. People are generally nice but there is a lot of stuck up kids. The African Studies program, and Global Studies programs are really good and unique. Other than that, other departments are as good as other, cheaper schools. I really do not like how there is nothing to do outside of campus. You can be caught easily in the SLU bubble and most people are. Personally, this school is too expensive, homogeneous and ignorant student body and there is nothing to do in Canton. I've only met a few people who don't fit the mold of SLU that I am really good friends with and I have good bonds with some professors. Overall, I don't like it and I most likely will transfer. You really have to be a certain type of student to like it here."
College Freshman,2,The aid is great if your middle class but for an extremely poor student it is not so great. My roommate who has both parents working and can use her parent's credit card when she wants gets more than I do. Nuts isn't it? If you have some money consider going here otherwise stay away if you need a lot of financial aid.
College Junior,2,A lot of old buildings that are run down
College Sophomore,2,Really not a whole lot of options outside of the school. St. Lawrence does a great job of making the on campus part really inclusive. Everything you need is really there for you
College Sophomore,2,"Most campus housing is too cramped, or too filthy, or too old to warrant paying nearly $60,000 per year for. Visitors have been disgusted by the living conditions."
College Freshman,2,I know it is difficult to live off campus and few people do it.
Recent Alumnus,2,98% of SLU students live on campus. It's not worth it to live off campus. You are guaranteed housing all 4 years on campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I had a terrible internship while abroad in London. I think some people have better experiences, but I didn't."
College Sophomore,2,"We have a lot of foreign students that make up most of the diversity on campus and I would like to see more diversity with the American students. Religions is diverse, but not very. While a lot of students have a lot of money, there are many on financial aid and most of the time you can hardly tell someones economic status."
College Freshman,2,Some weekends you really have to hunt for something to do.
College Sophomore,2,"Girls: preppy, stuck up, think they're all that

Guys: Egotistic, pretentious, honestly just mean"
College Sophomore,2,"I couldn't wait to transfer. Actually, I had to withdraw mid-year because it got so bad. The weather is terribly cold, and the people are stuck-up and only care about themselves. Socially it was hard for me because I did not feel like I fit in, and other people did not make it easy. If you are looking for a real college experience, this is simply an extension of high school. 

I do have to give the professors credit though, because they are some of the most genuinely intelligent people that I have ever met. If it hadn't been so bad socially, I think I could have pulled through because of the professors."
College Sophomore,2,This school is very wealthy. And they know it. They could at least put a little bit more effort into giving students scholarship money. I received very little.
College Sophomore,2,"This school is so expensive, I didn't receive nearly as much aid as I needed and they are very disorganized and continue to charge me for things that didn't happen or put me on financial hold for a bill that isn't due yet. However, they always fix their mistakes."
College Senior,2,We get so much snow here in the North Country and the temperature drops to freezing!
College Sophomore,2,It is very cold and snowy from the months of November to April. Although it is cold the campus is close and all the buildings are always heated. The snow is always managed so it is safe to walk around and class is never canceled.
College Senior,2,"Canton is a very small, rural town. Very few seniors get a chance to live in an apartment off-campus. I think you have to go through an approvals process with the administration in order to do it, too. On the other hand, most of the things that you want to do are on campus, not off, and there are senior townhouses are that are very nice. It's like getting an apartment, but on campus and without the hassle of rent or a landlord."
College Senior,2,"You are in the North Country, so expect the cold weather for most of the year."
College Sophomore,2,"There If You Want It, No Problem If You Don't – A while back greek life dominated SLU and became a real problem on campus, but the school really got involved and now going greek is completely optional and it's only something you do if you happen to like a certain frat or sorority or have some friends already involved.  They throw parties and do the usual charity stuff, but most people aren't in the greek system and that's fine.  No one is treated differently either way.  Hazing is pretty harsh for some of the sororities and frats, although one or two don't do any dangerous hazing at all."
College Freshman,2,Middle of No Where – getting home if you dont have a car is really hard if you dont know someone with a car who you can get a ride from
College Freshman,2,"Not Much – living in upstate ny means theres not much compared to a city. there are a variety of restaurants if you have a car, but if not theres little options besides the few delivery services"
College Freshman,2,Semi Existent – Greek life is there if you want to be and not if you aren't interested. There are a couple party sororities and even less frats but it adds a nice university feel to campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Not Very Diverse – There is not very much racial diversity at St.Lawrence, and many students of different ethnicity are here to play sports. Also there is not a diverse sexual orientation.  However there is high acceptance of different ethnicities, economic diversity, and religous diversity."
College Sophomore,2,"I've lived here all my life so I've gotten accustomed to the lack of dining options near SLU's campus. There are very few. Especially if a student is used to living in a more metropolitan area. There is a family-run Italian eatery, Sergi's, that my friends and I like to go out to, however it is a little bit more on the expensive side. It is totally worth it because the food is amazing, but you'd have to take that into consideration."
College Sophomore,2,We have mostly whites on campus.  The diversity is truly limited but there is not any racial discrimination whatsoever so it is not an issue.
College Sophomore,2,"Nothing Special – The town doesn't really have much to offer because it is so small. Not really a college town, but there are some local restaurants that are really nice. 
Montreal is really close though, so that is really convenient!"
College Sophomore,2,What Options? It seems like if you dont have a car you're walking.
College Freshman,2,"Ancient Greek – The Greek life on campus is bust, with many frats and sororities being shut down by campus security. Greek life has disappeared."
College Junior,2,"There's no public transportation or long distance transportation, which is unfortunate considering the school is in the middle of nowhere."
College Junior,2,"Huge Party School – There is nothing to do here, so everyone just drinks or smokes weed all the time."
College Senior,2,"The local bus system is ridiculous--you can't really go anywhere with it other than upstate NY. I wish there was one to Burlington, especially since Canton is really in the middle of nowhere. Fortunately, I love being on campus so it's not too much of a problem."
College Sophomore,2,There isn't really any available. We have theme houses but they are exclusive and specialized in one area. I wish that there was more availability for living off-campus or even just apartment-style living.
College Sophomore,2,"A Balmy -20 Degree Day – It is either snowing, or raining and its always chilly. Everyone knows that going to school here means you have to tough out the North Country weather. The campus seems to bond over the weather more than anything, and even though it sucks it builds character."
College Sophomore,2,"We have to be on campus all 4 years unless arranged otherwise. St. Lawrence buys houses that are for sale in the area so they are not on campus, but still count as on-campus housing. The housing costs are very expensive for the quality."
College Senior,2,"There's Nothing to Do in Canton, NY! Nightlife at St. Lawrence is usually drinking in dorms and heavy partying. All social events are focused on the school. There's nothing to do in Canton. Canton is very depressing. I usually just go into town to the Blackbird Cafe (when I get sick of school food)."
College Sophomore,2,"There Is a Diverse Group of People but They Are Separated for the Most Part – There is a diverse group of people on campus but i don't think the University does the best job of making sure that there is acceptance and bonding amongst us. However, they do try."
College Freshman,2,I wish it was easier to explain your financial situation.
College Senior,2,"Winter is FRIGID. This year, we had temperatures drop past -30 degrees F in January.

Classes will never be affected or cancelled due to weather."
College Freshman,2,There are 4 sororities and 2 fraternities.  They do not play a very dominant role in the social scene here.
College Junior,2,Average Drug Use – From what I can tell there isn't a high amount of drug use that occurs. I would call it average for a college campus.
College Junior,2,There are two or three Greek houses affiliated with St. Lawrence so there is no real emphasis on Greek life itself.
College Junior,2,"Lack of Options – Most of the students at St. Lawrence and encouraged to live on campus. There is a lack of variety for those who are allowed to live off campus within the Canton area. Although Canton is small, the majority of the off-campus living buildings are not in good proximity to the school itself."
College Junior,2,Drinking is a huge part of campus because of the rural location.  Drinking and parties occur every weekend at the townhouses or somewhere else on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Many people participate in drug use, you just have to find those who abstain and you will be ok."
College Senior,2,"Fix It! I don't know if it is because of lack of funds or lack of enthusiasm but I would have to say that ~50% or so of the buildings on campus are as they claim to be. The new ones are great, the old ones neglected."
College Freshman,2,Mostly Whie – Mostly white. A lot of prep school kids. But some diversity and a few international students.
Sophomore,1,"The classes are simpler than any course I took in high school. There is nothing to do outside of dorm parties, the Tick-Tock, and Java, which between the three get old after about two weeks. The food here is absolute garbage (whether it be at Dana or one of the few restaurants in Canton), if you're from a city (or anything resembling a city) you will be bored out of your mind. The people here are closed off and arrogant. I can't imagine being more miserable at any other school and I can't wait to leave."
Alum,1,Attending here after prep school was total downer. The curriculum reads like a midwestern public school. The classes were boring and often taught by assistants. The aura of wannabe preppydom reeked of desperation. And winter lasts from October to April. Then the ice thaws and its Mudville. You'd be better off going to community college or just joining the workforce.
College Sophomore,1,"I thought I would love the school and while it has good points, such as its academics, it is just a miserable place to go to school. My first year was very disappointing and I've decided that I'm going to be transferring after 2 years. A lot of students transfer after their first year but that's something no one tells you! There are a lot of rich kids that do and get whatever they want, there is nothing to do off of campus and getting here is a pain. I absolutely regret attending this school. The price is ridiculous and if you aren't into partying 3 days a week there is nothing to do. The nearest town with a choice of restaurants or stores is at least an hour away and there are a lot of pretentious students. I'm very excited to be leaving this school."
Recent Alumnus,1,"SLU has a ""use, don't abuse"" policy, which seems to enable the problem. Safety and Security tends to give lenient punishments to offenders, and students are encouraged to report problems to Safety and Security rather than the Canton police. Peer pressure is prevalent, and there is a definite sense of being left out if one chooses not to drink or do drugs. Alcohol is the most prevalent substance on campus, followed by marijuana and ADD/ADHD medication (like Ritalin and Adderall), although other substances are also used to a lesser extent. Some students attend class or extracurricular meetings visibly impaired."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Canton is a very rural area, and entertainment options are virtually non-existent. There is one ""club"" in town, the Tick-Tock, which is popular with drunk students. There is also a small bar on campus--Pub 56--which has a Foosball table, a TV, and a small selection of mostly fried foods and a drink menu. Also, a short distance off campus is another bar, the Hoot Owl, which has a wider beer selection and a popcorn popper, but not much else in the way of food or drink. However, it has numerous games and activities to keep patrons occupied, and a fun, dive-bar-type atmosphere. As for transportation, there is none unless you have a car, or know someone who does."
College Freshman,1,Look up Canton in Google maps. And laugh.
College Freshman,1,"Horrible. Canton is literally in the middle of nowhere with nothing in it.The student body out numbers the population. It is not even a town, it is a village."
College Freshman,1,There are not really any options and you cannot live off campus anyway unless you have special permission.
College Freshman,1,"There are not many places to eat around here. There is a Chinese Restaurant which is average. Sergi's is the worst pizza ever and only drunk people order it. It is super expensive for the value. A lot of kids here think their pizza is the best thing on the planet but if you tasted real pizza or grew up in a city (which most of these kids didn't) you will know it is crap. There is a Dominioe's and Pizza Hut about a mile from campus. Not a lot of options, things are close until the weather gets cold and then one mile becomes five."
College Sophomore,1,"Canton is a fairly economically depressed community, so there are few options for off-campus housing. Most professors don't even live in Canton, but in the nearby town of Potsdam (10 miles away)."
College Sophomore,1,Boring. No variety. It can be pretty unsanitary at times.
College Sophomore,1,SNOW. -30 DEGREE WEATHER IS NOT A MYTH. IT RAINS ICE SOMETIMES.
College Sophomore,1,"People usually party in their dorms. There's Java which sometimes has good music, and there's the ticker. But girls, if you want to be objectified by men (I mean boys) and be treated like their little toys, go right ahead and be part of the nightlife scene."
College Sophomore,1,"There are some decent people in Frats and Sororities, but the majority of girls and guys are stuck up and think that the world revolves around them."
College Sophomore,1,"Besides one pretty decent restaurant, there is none. No options."
College Sophomore,1,The food is absolutely horrible. It is impossible to find something to eat. I would never eat at the school if i didn't have to. The chicken tastes like 20 year old rubber. Avoid at all costs.
College Junior,1,"No university-sponsored transportation is available, unless a university-sponsored trip is approved for use of a security van. Otherwise, an expensive car service may need to be used to cross-town transportation. Most destinations can be reached by foot or bike, however."
College Sophomore,1,"There are houses off campus but as a student you will have to purchase and sell the house as if you are living there. But don't worry only 6% of the students live off campus, so being on campus is where you want to be anyways. Therefore, stay on campus it's easier anyways to get to class and the dinning services."
College Senior,1,"Winter makes me depressed and sad, and there should be more activities or trips organized to break the monotony during cold months."
College Senior,1,"Greek Like Review – There isn't much of a Greek Life on campus. A lot of the fraternities were suspended or kicked off campus in the past couple of years. However, there are a fair number of sororities. The public's view of Greek Life can go either way, some people hate it, some people love it. The major remaining frat on campus would be ATO, where as, some of the sororities on campus would include KO and KDS."

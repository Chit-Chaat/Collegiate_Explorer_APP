Graduate Student,5,A welcomed and great college where you are able to communicate and study with the professor and the classmates.

Niche User,5,"They represent the nation's 2 most Hispanic-serving college, with a focus on teaching commander and practitioners of the 21st century that are culturally cogent and have a strong comprehension of various cultures' backgrounds, dialect, and principles. What I like about this university is that if you need help, professor are willing to help you. It is also very affordable."
Niche User,5,"For this semester, I did take classes online. It is different from going to classes than actually taking them online. My classes are asynchronous which means we have to do our work at our own pace for some classes. They have videos where they leave lectures for the work. They have office hours through zoom in case we need help.  Asynchronous classes do help students during this pandemic because with a lot going on, they can do their work when they have time. However, it does affect because they leave it to last minute and accumulate work when its due."
Senior,5,My over all experience with the university I would have to say has been great. The professors have all been great instructors. And campus life is also great. I also worked in the orientation department for a year and that has to be the best job I've had to date.
Senior,5,"During this pandemic the university offered almost all its courses online, at the moment I am only taking two but so far the professors have been doing everything in their power to make the classes go smoothly."
Alum,5,"The things I really love about UTRGV is how interactive and helpful the teachers are. Their professors are some of the best I have ever been taught by and will go above and beyond to help make sure you know what you're doing, especially during this pandemic. Counselors are very helpful in making sure all documents are done correctly and try to make sure you get the most out of your educational experience. The only thing I wish they did was to give more reminds on virtual meetings."
Alum,5,"Ever since COVID started, all my classes have been online. The professors were very understanding and are willing to work with you if you had any issues and needed extra time. They usually answer as soon as possible to any questions needed and are very good at being specific. The professors are amazing and the university provides so much help to all students."
Freshman,5,Great online learning experience. I feel like I have learned a lot of material despite staying at home.
Freshman,5,Great university! Provide everything you need to be successful in your future career. Beautiful campus with very welcoming staff members.
Alum,5,Attending UTRGV was the best decision I have ever made. I was able to graduate debt-free in 4 years. The faculty in the communication department was always helpful and supportive. Lots of activities to participate in and events to attend. Great school! Go Vaqueros!
Alum,5,I never have any problems with any of my online classes. UTRGV uses Blackboard. Its was easy to use and navigate.
Junior,5,"Students and professors at UTRGV are very kind and helpful. We work with a mindset that we are one team, so we are not too competitive. This is coming from a civil engineering student. I am not sure what the experience is for other majors. The library should be open more hours that way students can take full advantage of it. They should have more study areas outside where it is shady and where wind passes through freely, because it can get very hot down here in the valley."
Sophomore,5,"My online experience has been pleasantly great, as my professors and advisors are patient and very helpful, which is what we need in a time like this."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley is known for always helping out their students, and I can vouch for that. As they never want you to fail or get lost, it is always recommended to talk to advisors and get the necessary help and guidance."
Sophomore,5,I am part of the UTRGV Guitar Orchestra and it is a great experience. I feel much more involved because if I was not part of this ensemble I wouldn't feel complete. Like some students are just taking classes are no clubs and stuff like that. I really enjoy class and campus. All the professors are really on task and ready to teach. Students are not childish and act mature and very ready to learn. Campus was very nice and welcoming. I enjoy the student union that feels like a food court for hanging out with friends.
Sophomore,5,I took online classes this semester and I prefer going in person. I felt like I learned more and was more engaged. Online classes are alright for those that just have assignments and don't really meet. For me I am a music major and I love have face to face class because playing an instrument does not work online. We have done our best to get trough. All my professors have done a great job with going online. They were very prepared with work and course materials.
Junior,5,I like that the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley is a great school to further one's education. This college has many degree programs for someone to choose. This college has given me many new experiences and has enabled me to learn from great professors in my field of study.
Freshman,5,My online experience has been fantastic. It is easy to communicate with my professors and it is easy to learn as well.
Freshman,5,The school taught me how to gain the skills and education needed to live autonomously and successfully. School also taught me social skills I will need in my future life and careers
Freshman,5,"Hello, I am currently a Freshman at The University of Rio Grande Valley. So far, I haven't had a bad experience with my online classes. I like the way how my professors are putting the effort to teach me the materials in times like this. Also, I love how easy it was to get to know other students online and how we started group chats to help each other with the work.  Honestly, the school is a very fine institution and I would definitely recommend it to other students around the US, even around the world to come here and give it a chance. UTRGV will not fail you."

Freshman,5,The teacher are  friendly and give us number to all kinds of services to the school they think or know we may need. The older kids make you feel welcome and aren’t disrespectful because they also know how it is being a new kid in campus.
Freshman,5,"The professor knows it’s a first time for everyone and don’t force you to show you face, but the do make you participate to at least know that your  there."
Freshman,5,The university is great! It is very effective and full of staff committed to student success. I find myself loving something new about the campus every day.
Freshman,5,The online learning experience is great. The teachers are always prepared and it makes learning a comfortable experience even with a pandemic going on.
Junior,5,"Great place for locals to go to school and still be close to family and friends! I live right down the road, so its an easy commute as well."
Junior,5,"Before the pandemic began, I had never taken any online course nor did I plan to. For me personally, I learn better from in person teaching and classroom setting. However, when the pandemic started, my in person courses such as lectures and labs were switched to online in the middle of my spring semester. This change at first became a major challenge for me since I had never taken a online course before. My professors additionally faced the same challenge in adjusting the material to online. We both worked together to make sure that we were still able to understand the material being taught. This adjustment allowed me to experience something new and as well as strengthen my learning skills. I was able to go at my own pace when listening to online lectures and obtain the material more efficiently since I had the ability to go back or pause on a lecture video to understand every word the professor had taught."
Junior,5,I really enjoy attending UTRGV. The amount of assistance you get is amazing! I like that professors are making their classes online to help those students who do not want to be on campus because of the pandemic.
Junior,5,I have been taking online classes since I was a freshmen and I never had trouble with any of my classes and I am about graduate.
Sophomore,5,Online classes are made easy you just have to be dedicated to your education. Plus some professors put the entire reading material for the semester up so your able to prepare ahead of time if you'd like.
Sophomore,5,This university provides many opportunities for a variety of students whether they take the opportunity or not.
Graduate Student,5,I have taken classes online at UTRGV. Throughout all the online class I have experienced throughout my student life at UTRGV was very enjoyable. The professors are very helpful and very well off in communication to help their student succeed.
Graduate Student,5,I love UTRGV! It is a very cultural and close-knit university. It has a great variety of diversity and allows students to take pride in themselves and their education. I have enjoyed going to UTRGV!
Freshman,5,"I really hope it is an amazing college, I don't have the money needed to pay but I want to keep studying."
Freshman,5,"He makes the class interesting by being funny, It really helps to learn. It has been great so far and I can't wait to have both semesters with them."
Junior,5,"My experience with UTRGV has been great. Since my first year in college, everyone has been very inclusive! It still amazes me how close and friendly students are. Go Vaquero's and  V's UP!"
Junior,5,"Since COVID-19, my school has moved to online learning. It was hard to adjust last semester, but all the professor and faculty made it an easier transition."
Graduate Student,5,"I liked everything about the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. It's one of the main attractions from my community, so I loved being able to say that I am an alumni of this campus. I definitely recommend this campus to anyone who enjoys diversity and a strong embrace of everyones culture. Whenever I'm on campus it's like my second home. It is a very comfortable environment from the library to the student union to the athletic events. The campus atmosphere is just very enjoyable and comfortable overall."
Graduate Student,5,"I did and currently am, taking online classes. I enjoy online classes as much as I enjoy in-person classes. The professors make it very easy to get in contact with them and respond in a timely manner. There was always a very detailed explanation for pretty much every assignment, and if there was ever any questions the professors were always open to answering promptly.  I would recommend online courses at this campus, along with in-person classes."
Sophomore,5,"The staff is very informative and helpful. The classes aim to be flexible and work with the student body. If you experience any technical difficulties, the staff members are more then happy to help and respond emails quickly."
Junior,5,UTRGV is an amazing university where you get help from staff members! Professors are great at teaching and helping you out!
Alum,5,"Online classes are the best. Blackboard is easy to navigate, professors are highly responsive, and the overall experience is extremely convenient (so long as you don't forget you're taking online classes)."
Freshman,5,I have yet to attend but my brother went here and I’ve been taken here and I love it. It’s a really big school with loads of people to get acquainted with!
Freshman,5,I think it’s a very good thing they’ve decided to wait and have online classes at a time like this. Having many students under one room can be a way for people to get the corona virus.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley has been amazing. The environment of this university is very friendly and calm. Everyone is very helpful including staff and students. Both in person and online classes are well taught, and formatted. The campus is big, but it's easy to get around."
Sophomore,5,The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley is a very good university that has grown and has made our community known. They have now built a school of Medicine that has really brought more opportunity for our area. We are in an area where there are mostly Hispanics. Know for a fact that you will love the various delicious tacos you will find around the area.
Sophomore,5,My experience with taking courses online while in UTRGV have been very favorable. The professors have been very knowledgeable and helpful when navigating through the virtual online experience.
Sophomore,5,"I finished all my classes online because of the Covid19, and the professors were well prepared. They answered their emails and fix some misunderstandings right away."
Sophomore,5,"What I like the most of UTRGV is its diversity, and also the support the professors give you. Besides, you get an excellent education."
Alum,5,"My experience at UTRGV was great. I was able to work on campus at the recreation center, be involved in student life, and be involved in Greek life -- all while taking a full set of classes."
Alum,5,The classes that I did take online with UTRGV were well organized and put together by the professors. I always felt like I could reach my professor when needed.
Sophomore,5,The professors made the online switch as easy as they could for us regarding classes that were hands on.
Junior,5,I enjoy taking in-class courses. I prefer having an interactive learning because the professors are able to explain things in detailed and the way they would like to explain. Online may be a good option but it is still limited to learning. I have only taken online classes once the situation COVID-19 occurred. I am glad that professors managed to find a way and communicate with students.
Junior,5,My university is amazing! There is a lot of workshops for students. I’m happy for the study area. There’s an area for everything when it comes to students. I enjoy seeing presentations about clubs. Just before COVID-19 Occurred there was an introduction to studying through virtual. The Virtual graphics on each app were detailed and contained a lot of information.
Senior,5,"All of my professors tried their best by always being available through email. Their teaching mechanisms changed and they tried to accommodate to all of the students. Every week was something new, but no matter what their spirits were high.  They  went above and beyond during the transition of class teaching to online school. Overall, all of my professors did everything that was in their reach to help myself and my classmates during this trying time."
Freshman,5,"Its great, honestly I've enjoyed my time learning more and more about the university. They campus is not too big so I can explore and not get lost like many of the other universities."
Alum,5,I did not feel like just a number at this school. The professors were always willing to help their students. This school provided many opportunities to get involved in school functions.
Graduate Student,5,"It is located in a border town between Mexico and the United States. Being so close to a border town has exposed me to the best of both worlds. Brownsville, Texas is the perfect combination of the Mexican and American culture. We celebrate quinceaneras and sweet sixteens equally. We are able to listen to Luis Miguel and Aerosmith at the same party. We developed a new language that switches and combines English to Spanish in the blink of an eye.  I get to see hard-working Mexicans live the American dream. I enjoy seeing Mexicans going to the university working for a better future."
Junior,5,"So the campus is divided in two location Edinburg and Brownsville. The experience we are having is that if you need a certain class, you might not find it in the city you live in like Brownsville. You would have to travel to Edinburg which is about 60 to 75 minutes away from each other to take that class or wait for it to be moved to the Brownsville campus the following semester. They do provide transportation so the hours can work for some student or hurt them. The later the transportation can affect students that are parents and pay for sitters or being close to home incase of emergency. Everything else I have experienced on the campus has gone so well, the professors that I have had the pleasure of being taught by has gone very well and no complaints."
Junior,4,"I have begun to take classes online amidst this global pandemic, and so far this has been a great experience even though i am used to taking classes in person. I have nothing but good things to say about the professors and them helping me to make the transition to online learning."
Junior,4,"I am currently attending my third year at this university and so far have had a great experience. Throughout the three years that I have attended the university, I had the opportunity to meet my best friends and as well as adapt to a whole new environment in terms of transitioning from high school to college. Additionally, I adapted to changes in my studying skills in which now help me to prepare for examinations given by professors and as well as use those skills to complete assignments. An important lesson to always keep while attending college is to work hard in your educational process (studying and assignments) but as well as have fun and enjoy your college experience. Overall, my experience at the university has been wonderful and I hope this inspires others who are planning to enter the university to have the same, if not, better experience."
Senior,4,"I have taken various online courses and overall they have been great. One once have I had difficulty due to a professor giving me a B as a final grade when it was an A, thankfully he changed it but 1 month had to pass. The majority of professors are direct and organized with the online curriculum."
Freshman,4,This university is close to home. They care about their students academic needs and are very involved. The university is affordable and gives many opportunities to their students.
Sophomore,4,Great and helpful staff. Cheaper then most other universities as well as many student activities available.
Junior,4,I enjoy going to the Brownsville campus because it is not as packed as the Edinburg campus. I also enjoy the library there because there is always space available. The things I enjoy from the Edinburg campus is the better student union there and better activities.
Junior,4,"Since this pandemic began, the professors and staff have been super helpful trying to get into a nice groove into fully online. It has a been a bit difficult but everyone of them and us (students) have all tried to make it work for all of us as smoothly as we can."
Sophomore,4,"I've taken several courses online, and all of which I've preformed well in. Some professors do a module type of class or assign weekly assignments. However it is all manageable, and are given enough to complete everything. Discussion boards are so ver helpful in helping understand the overall material."
Freshman,4,"So far I like it here in the valley.  Its cheaper than many colleges and gives good education.  I'm part of FSA, Filipino Student Association, and the people of different backgrounds make college so much fun.  It's easy to be engaged in the clubs at UTRGV and the school spirit is so cute."
Freshman,4,"Good amount of teachers try to always be engaged with their lectures.  Many of the online homework is easy to understand and do.  Sometimes it gets overloaded with too many to do at once, but not too bad."
Senior,4,"In the courses that I took online, everything went well. I have nothing to complain about except the video presentation uploading system, which is unnecessarily complicated. Making a video presentation is essay, but uploading a recorded group presentation is very challenging."
Senior,4,"I love everything about it. It a university with a reputation that snowballed as I attended. The Brownsville campus is a beautiful, vibrant, new campus, however, the Edinburg campus feels like an old college in comparison. Edinburg does need a big renovation in some of the buildings, though some feel new. The Edinburg campus is also really dark at night, which is a big safety concern. Another issue I have about UTRGV is the lack of availability of courses that I need for my majors in my home campus, therefore I would either have to travel to the campus I need to take the course or take it online (which isn't my preferred option). The tuition is also very affordable and it can make going to college debt-free possible. Overall, this is an amazing college."
Sophomore,4,"It's not bad, it's well planned, but I wish there weren't so many zoom classes, the workload isn't that bad since I have more time to do it, but teachers are all eager to answer questions."
Sophomore,4,"It's a very good school, everyone is very nice, the buildings and indoors are clean and well thought out, most teachers are eager to help, and the school does a lot to keep the spirit alive."
Senior,4,"The university of Texas Rio Grande Valley has been an incredible university so far. There are many programs that offer help to students in need. Since this university is located in the Rio grande Valley, it is hard to see diversity on our campus life. The university is made up of mostly hispanic students. Those who are not hispanic are usually from overseas. I really enjoy this university, but it might be a little uncomfortable to those who are not used to being around one race at all times. Even though there is not much diversity at UTRGV, everybody is very respectful. This campus has helped its students so much, especially during COVID-19. UTGRV awarded every student $1,000 to pay for their summer classes, a free parking sticker for FALL 2020, and UTRGV merch. The professors at this university are also very intelligent and provide diverse ideas and material. I am thankful to have experienced so many good opportunities at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. UTRGV is great."
Senior,4,"My online experience with UTRGV has been positive. The professors are trained to use blackboard, Zoom, skype, etc. All of my professors have offered a great learning experience through online classes at UTRGV."
Senior,4,"Online learning will always depend on the student and professors. Some of them will use Lockdown Browser in order to take tests, not all of them, if you have problems with that I would highly recommend to check which professors use it."
Sophomore,4,My time at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley has been a positive experience so far. I just finished my freshman year and it’s safe to say that I am liking this school and that I’m liking college much more than high school. I believe UTRGV is a very underrated school because of where it’s location is and it’s comparison to other UT system and Texas schools. Compared to most colleges UTRGV is a very cheap school and has good programs to offer with more being developed now.The school is growing at a very rapid rate and professors from all across the country are coming to this university which is making it more diverse due to this being a border university which is a place where a lot of research can be done. On top of this the school has a very nice campus that isn’t too big yet too small.
Sophomore,4,I like that UTRGV is a very affordable school with good programs for students. As we speak UTRGV is a growing school in terms of programs being created and professors coming from all over the country. On top of this UTRGV is a very safe campus that is also easy to navigate around. So overall UTRGV has good professors and environment. I will say though that UTRGV should remodel the restrooms it has in some of its buildings. They are very disgusting and I think that should be changed immediately because this is a university and not just an ordinary public restroom area.
Sophomore,4,"Offers a good range in a variety of classes and major, but not all classes are offered at all campuses. They have a good cafeteria and have many clubs and organizations you can join. The professors care and are helpful when you ask questions. They offer tutoring, mentors and counselors to all the students on campus."
Senior,4,"School has been good ever since I started my freshman year. There are some aspects that could change. Such as there being more help for the less privileged students by providing them with more scholarships, school books, and computers."
Freshman,4,"As a first year student, my experience has been quite well. There are sufficient resources and knowledgeable staff that can help you out. There are also many support systems and fun activities going on around, you just have to find time for them."
Freshman,4,"Awesome staff! Quick help for all categories.Clean facilities. Resources at its finest. Yet, the only change I would like to see is the availability of more scholarships. Love it!"
Niche User,4,"Based off my own experience and others around me, I have seen the advancement in education and the exceptional growth they and I have experienced."
Niche User,4,"It is a great place to attend college to. The complex is beautiful and the professors are great to talk to and they will help you out with anything. The food is great, and there are many organizations to join, and be part of a community that will help you grow. The area does get pack, but it is cheap to buy a parking ticket compared to other universities. When I went there for a tour, everyone was kind and welcoming. Overall the place is a great environment, and the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley is one of the top colleges to go to in the state, and the cost is very low."
Niche User,4,It's a great school that really reflects the surrounding community. The school has a very welcoming environment and has a comforting presence among the student life. Going to this UTRGV would be a great choice for anyone looking for a solid education.
Niche User,4,When i visited the university because of interest in the school i really enjoyed the diversity and involvement that there was as a campus. I liked the welcoming of the new students and the  investment that they put in the school.
Senior,4,"My experience in this university are really good, i know that everyone in this school are really nice people and they always work hard to make any assignment perfect."
Niche User,4,"The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley has a great campus, excellent professors, and an amazing atmosphere for students coming from Hispanic heritage."
Senior,4,"Attending this university has opened the door to a world of opportunities, keeping academic standards high while making cost of attendance affordable for the majority. It is a school full of kind and motivated people who seek to better themselves and their community. I am very satisfied with my decision to attend this university."
Junior,4,"The school is really pretty ,but the parking is horrible. There isnt enough parking spaces and it seems to me the school is trying to take money from the students, a parking permit is $100..the majority of the students park in a public park. The school needs more organizing."
Sophomore,4,"Easily the majority of the population is Hispanic, which leads to not much diversity within the student body; however, the population of professors is rather diverse.  The campus, although not ugly, is not beautiful, with the exception of the new engineering building.  The fampus food that is available is very good; however, I think there can/should be more options."
Sophomore,4,I like that it is close to many restaurants and stores that I may need to run into quickly before class. Most students and professors are happy to be there and are eager about the work. You will often run into clubs and organizations that are asking for your involvement.
Sophomore,4,The University of Texas is one of the best choices if you are wanting to attend an awesome University at a good price. The tuition is probably half as other universities around Texas.
Freshman,4,I really like how the Brownsville campus is small and you're able to interact more with the professors. All the students have a lot of support from the faculty.
Freshman,4,"It is an interesting college that allows everyone a chance to get whatever beginning you need to succeed. As well with it's ever developing campus it grows to accommodate more and more people no matter the background. It always has something going on with the campus's own event or a event that some organization has made. Each day is a new day at this campus and allows people to know more about their own education while being friends with people in their classrooms and curriculum. Though the work is tuff the professors always push all the students to do their best and show them how to get more help whenever they need it. As well they tell the students different updates for tests, projects, and grades when it is necessary. There was never a day when I had a class and didn't know that I was having a test or something was due that day."
Sophomore,4,UTRGV provides a great education for people down here in the Rio Grande Valley. It is a well known university in the southern part of Texas and can be compared to other great universities with the majors and great opportunities it offers. Classes are challenging as expected but professors always give you the hand to help you achieve a good academic standing.
Senior,4,UTRGV feels like home and it always takes time to get used to your community if you're a really shy person but the people there are usually always kind to help around.
Niche User,4,"Overall great experience, but some of my professors seemed a tad weird. There grading systems were a little weird, making my final grades not as good as I would've liked them to be."
Sophomore,4,"It is a great university to attend if your looking for something affordable and a great campus atmosphere. It has a great local area, always prioritizing safety, a lot diversity, and great academics."
Niche User,4,"I've not visited the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley yet, but I can tell that my experience there will be remarkable. The majors offered come in a massive variety, and hours look to be quite flexible. It seems to be the talk of the town, and it's easy for me to get there due to my current living situation, so I'm looking forward to applying to this school."
Sophomore,4,"Good staff, Very clean and calm place. Teachers are UTRGV are incredibly involved with the students and they show interest in student success. Overall a university that wants the students to shine."
Freshman,4,"I liked that in the university everyone is helpful and ready to answer your questions. It is a very friendly environment.  If I could change one thing, I would make the classes more challenging."
Niche User,4,"I like how everyone there students and staff were so nice and friendly. I think the housing should change its not bad but it could be better, the campus is pretty big with a lot of cool spots to hang out."
Niche User,4,It is a wonderful school. I toured it and it seemed like a very nice and descent sized school. The staff working there were very helpful if we ever needed them.
Junior,4,"Great school, the campus is great and there are many activities that one can participate in throughout the semesters."
Sophomore,4,The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley has one of the best student services I have ever received. They will help you with anything and everything immediately. They have such a fun and exciting student life.  Always organizing activities for the students as much as for their staff. The only things they are slacking a little bit on is PARKING! It's almost impossible to find a spot during certain parts of the day.
Graduate Student,4,"The availability of the staff (not professors). there is always a line for food places on campus, financial aid, and events. 
there are not a lot of food choices on campus that are healthy. the food that is sold is expensive and for the price that is is sold, the quality is very low."
Senior,4,My experience at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley has been very good. All the professors I have had have been very helpful and knowledgeable. If I could change anything it would be better communication between the advisors and the students but other than that it is a great college
Junior,4,"University of Texas Rio Grande Valley is a great University with great faculty and staff. I as a biology major have had nothing but good things to say about the STEM professors. There are a lot of restaurants around the campus, so there is no need to feel the worry of starving the whole day . There are many countless amount of organizations and clubs to join."
Alum,4,"It's a good and cheap school. Not your party scene school, most of the people in the college are local students. It can be very good if you put effort to get opportunities."
Freshman,4,Going into a first year in college I really got the feel of it with this university because it was the perfect environment for someone going into their first year. The people are very friendly and the benefits they give you are amazing! I would like them to change into a bigger university because they are so looked down on.
Junior,4,The University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley has excellent professors that want nothing more than to see their students succeed.
Niche User,4,"I liked that most of the professors I had when taking classes care about the students when they schedule a time to meet and actually take action in improving their grades or achieving their academic aspirations.   I also like how a new restaurant was added to the Student Union to create more options for the students to pick during lunch hours. However, one thing I would like to say would be about how long the lines are during the lunch hours and that sometimes I don't have enough time to eat because there are so many people.  The express app where you order and pick up your food, Tapingo should be available to every restaurant they have on the UTRGV campus and should be more publicized so that students will realize it is a faster alternative."
Junior,4,I enjoy the environment at the Brownsville campus however they tend to favor the students that take the majority of their classes in Edinburgh when choosing into specific programs.
Junior,4,It's a very professional school with kind staff that understand you and work with you. There's an abundance of resources and places to study and some pretty decent places to eat whenever you get hungry.
Sophomore,4,UTRGV has two campuses and this allowed for more students to be accepted. I liked the clubs and organizations around the school. I joined a fraternity in this institution that helped me expand my networks. One thing i disliked was that there were fewer choices in classes and teachers in the Brownsville campus as opposed to the Edinburg campus.
Sophomore,4,The University of Texas of Rio Grande Valley is a really good college for those looking to attend. The school offers great programs for students. The campus of large but not too bad to get around by walking. The only complaint I’d have it the parking which is actually quite terrible. Students have to arrive way before their class start time in order to find a parking spot. The food made by the cafeteria is really good and the safety is also really well as I’ve seen even various security guards even at night.
Sophomore,4,So far the experience I have had at UTRGV is very exciting and I cannot wait til next year! I greatly enjoy the hard work the teaching staff puts in and I appreciate the hours they put in to make sure I get what I pay for in an education!
Junior,4,"What I like about the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, is the campus food, and the student life. The campus food is great, there's plenty of restaurants within and around campus, there's Pizza Hut, Chick-fil-a, El Pato and many more. Besides that, there are restaurants such as Popeyes, and Taquerias. The student life is another great thing, they have so many clubs on campus, and there is a game room to de-stress on tough days. The game room has electronics and a tv, and on certain days they have game tournaments like super-mario video game tournament. Everyday is something different, they have a tennis tournament as well. The clubs that are on campus some have to do with religion, or sports, and even foreign clubs like American Sign-Language Club. The student life gets everyone involved with an activity. These are the things that I like the most about the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley."
Junior,2,"all of my classes are online, and it's terrible. The professors are disorganized, the university waits until the last minute to tell you anything. I had a teacher wait until 2am the day of classes to post the syllabus and tell us what textbook we need AND THEN told us that or assignments were due the same week before we even had time to order the book."
College Junior,2,Greek life has a very low impact on college life. I know we do have a rush week but it is not anything like the movies. It seems like a pretty calm atmosphere. There aren't too many greek clubs and there isn't on campus greek houses. They pretty much blend in with all the other school clubs.
College Junior,2,"My school does not have a football team so a large part of the advertising for sporting events goes to the basketball team. Although they constantly send out emails to the students during the season, i have personally never attended a game and have never really felt much hype for it on the students side."
College Freshman,2,there really isnt any sports im willing to join or are interested in at the moment.
College Junior,2,There should be more cameras
College Sophomore,2,Only a small section of the student population cares about the athletics teams.
College Sophomore,2,Fan support is not all that great.
College Sophomore,2,I want to get involved in internships but I do not see opportunities.
College Freshman,2,They might have a good team in basketball but they are missing a football team that makes everyone go and attend. The spirit on campus is so poor I'd go as far to say its dead.
College Sophomore,2,"I will never take night classes here because both males and females have been robbed, sexually assaulted, and two years ago a young woman was abducted in the parking lot."
College Student,2,"Students at my school have no idea of what they do in class, theres a majority of people are involve in gangs very rude."
College Junior,2,They changed the tuition which makes it harder for me to attend school.
College Junior,2,"I don't particularly like the education I'm receiving from my school. Courses are not taught as they should be and some professors are simply unqualified to teach the subject itself. I contestant lay had issues in the chemistry department and I didn't like how they were handled. Class availability isn't too great either as some of my required courses are not offered. Additionally, class sizes are way to big."
College Junior,2,"Strictness is pretty intense on our campus, especially regarding parking violations. The police issue tickets for almost everything and I've constantly had trouble with them year round. Recently, I had problems getting my parking ticker that never came in the mail. I got frustrated because they made me pay for a whole new one. I always hear about campus police, but rarely see them doing anything else. They focus on traffic and students riding on bikes mostly. I will say that there are emergency posts in place though, so that's good."
College Freshman,2,i don't pay attention to guys
College Freshman,2,"The university is surrounded by restaurants and a lot of traffic, it is very dangerous."
College Senior,2,The school isn't very Greek-lively here at UTPA. It's not a huge deal.
College Sophomore,2,Social atmosphere. Depends on what type do roommate you get and the friends that he or she bring into the dorm.
College Junior,2,Not a lot of help
College Junior,2,Parking sucks overall its takes hours to find a parking considering you don't want to walk a whole of block just to get the university if you're already running late.
College Junior,2,"Robberies are the only bad thing about the school life. There are a lot of stolen objects that the police has deported, and is more frequent during breaks and during night time."
Recent Alumnus,2,The off-campus dining options near my university happen to be all chain restaurants and fast food places. Out of a 7 of the fast food places near campus only one offers a student discount. Not much variety and not too healthy.
College Freshman,2,Not many people get it.
College Senior,2,It is way too hot to want to stay and do things there.
College Student,2,"when its hot it's hot, when its coold it's freezzing"
College Student,2,people here are confusing sometimes when you apply for fincial aid and you ask for help their even confused
Recent Alumnus,2,"The campus housing is old. They need remodeling and increase the space. The personal space for two people in the dorms is ridiculously small and their is no room for cooking, only a microwave. The dorm students need to share a shower with three others and the increase of clutter is there. It is too constricted. I think they should increase the size by two for the comfort of two people and one restroom for every two people. It's bad enough to understand the way of living with one other, but four people is just bad. At TSTC dorms for two, it was spacious for a bathroom and sink with cooking counter, mini fridge and microwave, including the closet and bed. The dorms for 4 included two restrooms one for each side and a opened living room and kitchen that had a lot of storage area, sink, full refrigerator, storage room for trash, box and canned food and a take for 4. Need I say their technical college is smaller."
College Student,2,My school did not have dorms.
College Freshman,2,My school doesn't give me any financial aid or workstudy and according to the university I do not qualify for direct wage either. I have 2 sisters that depend on me. I have a job but it's part time and I would really like to have a job on campus because I'm here most of the time
College Sophomore,2,"Weather down here in the valley can be described as bipolar. At one moment it is super hot, the next day it will be very cold."
College Junior,2,"I have grown up here, and I have met many people that come for a visit and they end up moving down here. It is a beautiful place, but I want to experience the world!"
College Junior,2,"The buses that pick up in McAllen do not stop by apartment complexes around campus, this would be helpful. It would save me so much gas and time (wasting time finding a parking space)"
College Junior,2,Bars and restaurants are the safer way too go. Not enough security for the club scene down here.
College Junior,2,I applied and got nothing with the exceptions of a bunch of loans. Scholarships are generally awarded purely on need-based only so that doesn't offer any of the other students much help.
College Freshman,2,The Greek life isn't that great. It doesn't look good socially if you are in a frat or sorority because they are a joke.
College Junior,2,Live off campus if you can
College Junior,2,It is pain to find parking sometimes
College Freshman,2,"My university is in need of food options, students get tired of always eating the same things."
College Freshman,2,Apartments are expensive and the university doesn't really help you unless you're living on campus.
College Freshman,2,"There's drugs and alcohol, but it's not really a big deal. Pan Am isn't a party school."
College Junior,2,"I have not applied for financial aid at this campus because, I need help in doing so. Some of the people who work in the financial aid office are not the nicest."
College Freshman,2,i need help with money
College Freshman,2,"sometimes are sunny and hot, sunny and cold, windy, rainy "
College Freshman,2,because it looks that the events are only for the people living in campus
College Freshman,2,"Not much to do after class, which is a shame, as the workload at Pan Am will oftentimes leave you with a lot of free time, without much to do."
College Freshman,2,"Advisement within the department is virtually nonexistent, and I spent the entirety of my year doing basic coursework, without any sense that I was achieving anything that would help me in the future in regards to my major path."
College Freshman,2,"Parking permits are a hassle to get, and the first week or so of classes is a test of patience, as permits are sometimes not issued, and tickets are incredibly hard to get expunged. Parking for freshmen fills up rapidly every day, and oftentimes one will find themselves circling the freshmen parking lots until someone walking to their car shows up."
College Freshman,2,It is way too hot. 
College Sophomore,2,There is seriously no parking
College Sophomore,2,"many people commute, so there is little to no choice. 
Also, expect to have a stock of food for past 7:30 pm. "
College Sophomore,2,"i didn't come here to meet people in that sense.
Anyway, again, this is mostly a commuter school, so I don't know much about what's going on with everyone's life. "
College Sophomore,2,"many people commute, so the dining option is really limited.
Expect to have microwaveable stuff for past 7:30 pm. "
College Sophomore,2,"there is no football team.
our school is pretty local, so there isn't much to say"
College Sophomore,2,"it is a small town and there is little to nothing to do.
I don't go out and I don't have a car, so I don't feel like I am ""missing out"" but even then, I feel a bit claustrophobic  at times
"
College Sophomore,2,The wireless is so bad that it is better to just go to the library or the computer labs to use the internet.
College Junior,2,"I dont have a meal plan, but I have gone to the dining a couple of times like 5 times with a friend that those, and he stopped going, because of the secuently repeatable food everyday. He also thinks he has gain weight ever since he started eating at the dining hall. "
College Junior,2,"When it rains a lot, everyone in campus has classes very separated from each other and there is on a campus trail, that pretty much also gets wet, but is not connected to the buildings. Campus tends to put heater on, when it is raining, because 90 percent of students that do not carry an ambrella get soaken wet, and books and backpacks also."
College Junior,2,"Ive gone with a friend to the dining on campus, and he says he stopped going because he got fed up of the same fast food burgers, pizza and cakes and sandwiches offered everyday."
College Junior,2,"I think there are a couple of students involved in school clubs, but not majority. Our school spirt week is one where almost 90 percent of students and faculty are well involved. I attended a basketball game on campus, and the bleachers were very empty. "
College Student,2,I really haven't heard much about sports. There are sports but it isn't the life of the campus. A lot of variety of sports.
Junior,1,"I registered as a transfer student and filled out my paperwork and was accepted August 2nd.  The whole college experience has changed and become more convoluted in its process for registering through the external website.  Once past the registration I submitted ALL my paperwork only to run into another mess and have an advisor call me with all the incorrect and missing paperwork I submitted.  They didn't have my transcripts, 2nd degree application, and had me classified as a freshman.  I'm STILL waiting for them to do their job and get my classes uploaded to their state of the art program called ""Degree Works"" which SHOULD simplify things for the advisor but has proven to be another mountain to cross.  At this point I'm not sure I'll be registered for Spring.  Beware if you want to go here register at least a year or two out so they can figure things out."
Alum,1,Going back to this school would be like going back to an abusive boyfriend. ............................................................................................................................
College Freshman,1,I do not get financial aid and it is very hard for my mom to be paying every semester out of pocket.
Recent Alumnus,1,There is probably only one club in the whole city for college kids to enjoy but it is always pack and not always fun.
College Freshman,1,"I wish I could have afford a college where students and highly active on campus. More than half of the students in my university just go to campus for the class and then leave home. My first semester actually I didn't go out at all, I attended all my classes and after that I'll just head to my dorm, I've never heard of any activities on campus."
College Junior,1,the lines and the wait for answers. Yes you can get help online but its not the same when you can speak to someone.
Recent Alumnus,1,There's not many places to go to hang out and many don't have transportation. Not very big on parties.
College Junior,1,the valleys weather is by far the worst in the local or neighboring areas. hot and humid
College Freshman,1,I hate parking at my campus. There are never any spots and people are very rude.
College Freshman,1,i never find a spot and its always far away when i do
College Freshman,1,I personally hate the Greeks because they think they are better than everyone else in the university when they are practically the same.
College Freshman,1,"Dining is limited to the restaurants found at the Student Union, and while you do get a variety of places to eat, the prices are higher than they should be. Quality is also suspect, particularly the Chinese restaurant found in the Union, which also happens to have some of the highest prices in the Union."
College Sophomore,1,I don't think there is any transportation around the town from my school.
College Junior,1,I never hear of this before.
College Junior,1,"There are no clubs, like party clubs, in my campus. Ive been here around quite a bit, and Ive only heard of a halloween party other than that no parties. I was in campus when that halloween party took place, and it was very empty. To go to a club, you have to look for one outside campus maybe 30 minutes away."
College Freshman,1,"There are no ""costs"" that you have to pay to park. But finding a parking spot can be very difficult. Most students have to arrive at school 2 hours earlier than their first class to park their car. It's terrible. Like playing a never ending game of musical chairs."
College Sophomore,1,"The majority of Greek students are very sociable and friendly for the most part. However, I've come across some that are very stuck-up and snobbish. "
College Sophomore,1,Information regarding the use of transportation is hardly ever discussed much less easy to access. It seems to be that transportation between in-campus locations is reasonably fair. 
College Sophomore,1,The weather is very hot for more than half of the academic school year which makes it very uncomfortable at times to navigate around campus. 
College Freshman,1,"As a freshman in college, we are having to park the farthest from the school. That means we are having to walk for a long time to get to class. The permits are $45 and in m opinion is very expensive."
College Freshman,1,"There is many paperwork to fill out. Personally, I feel I should have received more financial aid than what they had given me. I almost did not qualify for financial aid and still struggle with trying to pay bills."
College Freshman,1,I don't believe their is a big diversity. A large portion of the university is from hispanic background and from low income families. When you take a look around their isn't much diversity
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is terrible. The permit costs are not too bad, but it takes at least an hour to find a parking space. If you park somewhere without your permit you get a ticket."
Recent Alumnus,1,It is very difficult to find a parking spot close to class.
College Senior,1,"The transportation options at the school are poor. There is one bus, but I seldom see people riding it, and I dont know it's exact route. Most people walk, drive or ride a bike. It can be very dangerous crossing the street. Traffic gets busy and people can sometimes be reckless and aggressive."
College Freshman,1,Parking is the worst. its always jam packed and freshmen have to park off campus
College Junior,1,"UTPA stupidly issues far more parking permits than there are spaces. Every morning will be a battle for parking unless you get there early. Another option is to park at the art annex on Closner and take the shuttle back to campus. It's a 15-minute ride, so take that into consideration."
College Sophomore,1,"In the year that I have attended, not once have I seen people doing drugs. Although of course it depends on who you hang out with. But considering I make friends in every class I've had I've never had the drug topic come up. Drinking would be the main thing the students do."
College Sophomore,1,All parking lots are full by 9AM. It takes my friend 30 minutes to find a parking spot.
College Sophomore,1,"As a freshan, the parking permits received are restricted to zone 1 parking. As far as I know, zone 1 is only the parking that is the farthest away from the campus. Finding a parking space is another thing. If you want to even find a spot, you have to get there relatively earlier than your class."
College Junior,1,Should Get Better – University is building 4 new parking lots so these should alleviate the horrible parking situation. But yea parking is horrible if you do not get there before 10 you will have to wait til class is over so people can leave.
College Student,1,"Mostly Hispanic With a Few Others – It's mostly Hispanic and Catholic, with a few others of different races/religions."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The University is about and hour away from the border so the majority of students are Hispanic, Catholic, & Democratic.  There are other races and also many international students especially from Mexico.  Everyone is friendly though.  If you're from somewhere else, students are more likely curious since you're a novelty.  It's a pretty isolated area so diversity isn't very good."
Recent Alumnus,1,Might as Well Park at Wal-Mart and Walk to Campus! They are strict when it comes to parking.  Park the opposite way or park in the wrong section (parking permits only give you one section of campus to park in) you will be hit with a ticket.  There aren't enough space for everyone.  I've seen those orange/yellow tire clamps on several vehicles during my stay.  At least the paperwork for a ticket is easy.  They sure want their money fast.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Anywhere but Here – There's not much of a party scene at campus or off campus.  It's a small university so not much is happening.  Better to go to McAllen where there are more options.  Nothing interesting in Edinburg to keep me there so I head home.  Anything worthwhile would be UTPA events on campus, but during evening time is kind of rare.  Just skip it."
College Junior,1,"Barely Visible – In all the years I have attended UTPA, I have not seen any usage of drugs or alcohol. I have heard people say they have used it or attended parties; but I do not associate myself with those people."
College Student,1,"If you want to get good parking, you need to show up early, and by early, I mean 7 AM.  If you want to get a parking spot AT ALL, you need to be there BEFORE 10am.  Of course, this isn't a problem if you have morning classes or can tolerate going into campus 5 hours before class, but if you don't have a choice but to come right at noon, you're pretty much screwed.

Something needs to be fixed."
College Senior,1,"Too Many Tickets – The campus police focus too much attention on parking violations and don't do much when it comes to real issues. Any given day you will see many campus police officers roaming the parking lots. Not to keep the students safe, but to give them tickets. If you live at the dorms, be careful with your belongings! If they get stolen, campus police won't do anything. It will be lost forever."
College Freshman,1,"Greek ""Life&quot – It is so over rated! It looks like a waste of time to be part of their so called ""Greek life"" at least in this school."
College Freshman,1,"Not Enough Space – Parking is very hectic here at UTPA. For residents, not so much, but for students who don't live on campus parking is tight. I've heard an abundance of stories about circling parking lots over and over again until parking had been found. This problem will be eliminated in the near future, however. Renovations are being made and parking is going to expand."

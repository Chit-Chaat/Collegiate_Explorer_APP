Freshman,5,"I love being a student at Waubonsee Community College! The professors are all very helpful and want to see you succeed. I absolutely love how great the professors and staff are at the school, I cannot stress this enough. I feel I get more out of my campus and academic experience than what I'm paying for! The campus itself is safe and has good security. However, Waubonsee is most definitely not a classical ""party school."" And while the college offers a variety of student activities and clubs, it doesn't necessarily have the same school spirit as a traditional 4 year school. But overall, Waubonsee is a good place to pursue your academic goals whether you're fresh out of high school or you've been out of school for a while."
Sophomore,5,"I have taken a few classes online, more recently due to the pandemic. Online classes have been very easy and professors have been helpful in setting up office hours to help with any problems."
Junior,5,"It’s a very good experience. A had friends there and I made new friends. The teachers are amazing, but you have to be careful. Some teachers are better than others. Having the right teacher is important."
Sophomore,5,I had the best experience at Waubonsee. All of the professors I had really took the time to make sure everyone understood the material being taught. They went above and beyond.
Sophomore,5,"After graduating from High School, I was kind of stuck on where I wanted to attend. I was originally going to take a gap year to figure out what I wanted to do. But, after some time and logical thinking, I decided to take some classes at the local community college. It was the best decision ever.  At first, I was skeptical that I wouldn't like it and that I wouldn't make any friends. But I was wrong. All the professors I've had were very good and actually passionate about teaching. They were there to see me succeed. The counselors were also very helpful. They made sure I was taking the right classes and never made my transferring very easy. They were always there to explain and answer any questions I had. Not only that, but I went to school full-time and worked. Going to Waubonsee Community College defiantly saved me a lot of time and money and will forever be thankful for this college."
Sophomore,5,"Waubonsee Community College was the best choice I made! The professors are super welcoming and outgoing, I got along with all the students and enjoyed the walks between classes as it was always kept nice."
Freshman,5,"I loved Waubonsee, I took all of my classes at the Sugar Grove campus. However, to get the best experience, it is crucial to be a part of student life or partake in a club or event. I am involved in a lot, and because of that, I have gotten really close with the staff and have opened many doors. What you get out of it, is what you put into it. I registered for Waubonsee at 17 years old essentially by myself as an early highschool graduate. Because of the programs in place and the helpful staff, I made many connections and the process went smoothly. It's a great place to start when you don't know what exactly you wanna do!"
Sophomore,5,Waubonsee Professors are excellent. They are passionate about their fields of education and excited to share their knowledge. The sugar grove campus is beautiful. There are always multiple sections of a class to choose from.
Freshman,5,"Aurora Campus, been very accessible able and welcoming. A lot of opportunities.  Professors are average. You can find some gold and some coal, my freshman year has been great!"
Sophomore,5,The campus is pretty and fairly new.  The professors are very helpful and kind for the most part and makes Waubonsee a great place to learn.
Sophomore,5,"I love Waubonsee! Some of the best two years of my life. I played two sports here so I was able to meet a lot of friends. They have a lot of fun events if you actually look into it. I had some of the best teachers and some of the worst. I would research them on rate my professor before signing up for classes. The school is always super clean and professional, one of the nicest junior colleges I have been in."
Freshman,5,"Really good school ! Very good counselors & athletics is amazing ! Soccer team is a very diverse team , very amazing coaches , amazing programs ! Student life good , get so much help from a lot of resources !"
Freshman,5,I recently and unexpectedly had to transfer to Waubonsee and everyone has been so helpful. Im taking online classes and I feel challenged but feel as though I am learning a lot and it's manageable.
Sophomore,5,It is a wonderful school with so many great classes and teachers. They really care about the students that attend and give students resources to excel at whatever they are trying to achive.
Freshman,5,Good experience looking forward to continue my education in their facility. I am a transfer student which felt like an easy transition from my past college to waubonsee. Im thrilled to continue my education at wuabonsee.
Junior,5,"Going to Waubonsee was not only a fun experience but it was also an enjoyable experience with many different things, people, and elements to help you not only grow as a person, but helps you take some of the best steps in life."
Sophomore,5,I liked the atmosphere. Every one was very helpful. I also enjoyed all the help and resources that they offered. I recommend this school to any one wanting to start at a community college.
Sophomore,5,"The teachers and professors here actually care about you succeeding in your academic career, and their main focus is having you actually learn the material and being willing to help you in any way they can academically. The quality of education that one gets for the price they pay is unbeatable, and in some ways it rivals many of the more selective schools, who charge a lot more money and fees while at times not meeting the needs of a student or doing as successful of a job teaching. There are plenty of areas to study around campus and plenty of seating for those who have a substantial amount of time between classes. The campus also has a reasonable amount of parking, as I have never been unsuccessful in finding a parking spot, no matter the time I arrive on campus. There has never been a point where the school has felt too crowded or overwhelming in the time I have studied here, despite its population."
Niche User,5,Admissions department is very helpful! They are well prepared and can offer great advice for your future.
Sophomore,5,Waubonsee is an amazing 2 year institute where they let you grow at your own pace and figure out what you want to do. The faculty is amazing and I truly recommend it!
Sophomore,5,Great school. One of the best nursing programs around. All the professor are great. They have alot of night classes available to work with your schedule
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Waubonsee! I went for TV/film, and learned so much. All of my teachers were wonderful, but I had some teachers that were amazing and inspired me to learn and engage in other subjects that I may not have considered without the right push. I wish this was a four-year institution, I would have never left!"
Sophomore,5,the classes are straight forward and i like the cleanliness of the campus. professors will gladly explain how to work on a problem with a student.
Sophomore,5,"Overall, it is a great community college to earn your education. Professors are very passionate about what they teach and yearn for your success."
Junior,5,The campus makes me feel safe and welcomed. It’s clean and updated has everything I need in order to study and create projects. So far everyone I crossed paths with are involved with the school and are Passionate
Junior,5,"Waubonsee Community College is an exceptional junior college. The professors are knowledgable about what they teach, and they take the time to connect with their students by adding humor and real-life scenarios during class. I have noticed this with almost all of my professors so far at Waubonsee, and it has made my experience much more enjoyable. Also, the campus is super nice and is always clean. I have met so many good friends at Waubonsee because everyone is incredibly nice and compassionate towards each other. Everyone is basically there for the same reasons, so it is easier to connect with others around you. I have learned a great deal of knowledge and information not just about the classes and the subjects, but about life as well. The professors take the time to teach you about lifelong skills and lessons that will help you as you further your education."
Sophomore,5,The atmosphere is great and the professors are amazing! I've enjoyed my time here. It has definitely prepared me for my next stage of education.
Sophomore,5,Waubonsee is a great start to a college journey. I can list so many reasons as to why Waubonsee is a great education choice. By choosing Waubonsee you are choosing a caring and supporitve community. The administration does everything they can to get their students involved and to engage in school events. Our counselors are very helpful and are willing to help you get to where you need to be. They want their students to be successful and they will go above and beyond to help you become that.
Alum,5,Waubonsee really cares about its students and they want to see them succeed! They do what they can to help you get to where you want to go.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Waubonsee  Community College has been interesting, but some of the professors there have made my time there the most memorable, and I wouldn't trade that for anything"
Sophomore,5,Great campus and support! Online courses are well coordinated and the educational experience has been very positive as an adult learner.
Graduate Student,5,"I started going to Waubonsee only as a means to an end but I gained many friends here, life long connections that will stay with me forever. I also gained a lot of opportunities I wouldn't have had otherwise.  Waubonsee changed my life for the better and I am so thankful I went."
Junior,5,"Waubonsee is a great stepping stone towards a future career or furthering your education. It's local and the scheduling is flexible with classes offered anytime you may need them. They have great options for specific careers including fire science, emergency medicine, and mechanic without costing an arm and a leg."
Sophomore,5,Affordable and worth it! Small class sizes means better opportunity to learn. I enjoyed majority of my classes and professors so far. They encourage involvement. I am an athlete and loved the athletics side of the school but I also was apart of a club so I was able to get the best of both worlds. Waubonsee really does want the best for each and every student.
Freshman,5,I really do like Waubonsee it is a great community college to start out with and it's easy to get apply here. There are so many people to help you out with whatever you need. Everyone here is very nice and helpful
Sophomore,5,"The professor are awesome, the students services. I had a lot of opportunities get involved in college, and that made my experince greater!"
Sophomore,5,I really have enjoyed my time so far at Waubonsee! The staff has all been fantastic and I have found my classes to be interesting.
Junior,5,"The teachers there, as a whole, care about the students. The campuses feel safe and the prices are decent."
Sophomore,5,"One of the best community colleges in Illinois! I loved my experience here. Social life is not the best. FYI, some of the counselors are not very helpful. Tom and Ulysses are great though. I will be transferring to NIU this coming Spring."
Sophomore,5,"I love waubonsee, even though it is not a college or university. It does a good job with helping students with pursing their dreams and many of the professors are very willing to help you when asked. The campus layout also makes it feel like a real college and also brings sort of a peaceful setting towards it, which is very important when finals are coming along as many students would agree."
Sophomore,5,I am currently a Sophomore at Waubonsee and it has been a great experience.  The teachers are willing to help you any way possible and I love the tutor center.  I go there daily for help with assignments.
Niche User,5,Waubonsee Community College in Sugar Grove has a beautiful campus. Although I have only taken two courses in the summer I do feel that the professors here teach materials to the best of their ability.
Sophomore,5,Waubonsee is a great school for kids who want to take their general education classes at a great cost! 99% of my classes transferred to the school I want to get my bachelors at!
Alum,5,I received my Associate's Degree from Waubonsee and those two years were the smartest decision I made. So afforable and close to my house. However anyone who has gone there can vouge that the parking needs some change...
Freshman,5,The professors are very passionate about what they teach and their courses and programs are very high quality and intelligently designed. One thing the teachers could improve on is being more flexible with their office hours.  
College Junior,5,Classes are good size and the teachers really help you take the next step to help you achieve your goal.
College Junior,5,Its amazing to be able to fit classes when ever you get a chance and work it out with your job schedules
Recent Alumnus,5,I love online courses i have taken over four online courses and have done very well in all of them. I really like how you can study and do the assignments at your own pace without the distractions of others around you. I think the discussion boards also really help because you get to see others perceptive on the same topic that you otherwise not may have thought of on your own. I think the professors do a great job in responding to your questions in a timely matter.
College Junior,5,Classes are very easy to schedule around your life.
College Junior,5,I'm not a fan of online classes but the ones at WCC are simple and easy to navigate.
College Junior,5,The career center and alumni network are very helpful.
College Junior,5,The teachers and office staff are all very caring and helpful!
College Junior,5,The student career center is incredibly helpful!
College Junior,5,An amazing program that is very eye opening!
College Junior,5,"Out of all the schools I've been to, WCC is the best!"
College Freshman,5,"If you pick the right professors, you're all set for smooth sailing at Waubonsee."
College Freshman,5,"It's amazing here. I reverse transferred from Bradley University, and I have to say, at a fraction of BU's cost, this place KICKS ASS. The campus is beautiful in Sugar Grove, the grounds are well maintained, and most importantly, there are always people willing to make friends around every corner."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors work with you make their expectations clear at the beginning of the semester. There is almost never any kind of miscommunication and if you seek out the professors during their office hours, they will give you whatever help they can provide or direct to where you can get it."
College Junior,5,WCC is a nice campus and the teachers give great lectures and get back to the students easily and fast
College Sophomore,5,My counselors advised me that my credits are transferable to the schools I am looking forward to going to in the future.
Freshman,4,"Waubonsee does all of the online instruction through the CANVAS learning system. While there has been difficulties at times, the school has done a good job with making sure everybody is comfortable using the system. While I wish we could be in-person, I do appreciate that the college has expanded their online learning and they have made sure it has been an easy transition for all of the students and faculty."
Freshman,4,"I really appreciate all of the options they offer for class delivery. Especially during this difficult time with COVID, the school has done a great job with expanding its online programs and they have put lots of precautions in place to protect everybody."
Freshman,4,"Due to COVID-19 Waubonsee is offering most courses online unless it's necessary to be in person. COVID-19 has impacted many student's lives, many were left without a job, some had to move back in with their relatives but whatever the case, the professors were very understanding of the obstacles caused by this turbulent time. Professors are generally compassionate and helpful. Many of my professors provide private zoom meetings to discuss any questions we may have on the material. At the beginning, the transition from in-person to online was disorderly, but that is to be expected from any college suddenly making the transition to online. I think the professors did a great job in handling this radical change."
Sophomore,4,The best thing about Waubonsee is how easily the credit hours transfer over to 4 year universities. The counselors are very helpful and guiding towards students in their transfer process.
Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of resources available at Waubonsee Community College. All of my professors wanted all their students to succeed, even past attending Waubonsee."
Sophomore,4,"For me personally, taking classes online is better. I get to pace myself and make my own learning environment. However online classes may not be for everyone."
Graduate Student,4,This is a great starter school for students For returning students that still have to work or have families outside of school. It is close to home for those students that still want to live at home.
Graduate Student,4,I had a great experience learning online. The ability for my teachers to post all of the required learning was exceptional. The feedback from my teachers was extremely helpful
Sophomore,4,Waubonsee has fabulous professors that care about the students taking their classes. The sugar grove campus is beautiful and well looked after. Buildings are nice and the technology available is sufficient. The college offers many resources to students. Counselors are great as well! Student life could be better but Waubonsee does offer an assortment of student lead clubs and honor societies.
Sophomore,4,Online classes at Waubonsee are an affordable alternative for those who are full-time workers or unable to attend in person. Waubonsee offers a wide variety of online classes to suit all majors.
Freshman,4,They are very help full. also they gave me assistants if i need a laptop for test etc. There are people always there to help you. A very good automotive program and also welding.
Freshman,4,"So far, all of my teachers are very helpful. I feel like they want me to succeed in my future education. With the Virus going around I had to switch from face to face classes, to online classes. The professors have been nothing but helpful. They respond quickly to any questions I may have."
Sophomore,4,"Waubonsee Community College provides a great educational environment for students. Professors are very involved with students and are willing to help you along the way. The small class sizes allow for one on one engagement between students and professors, which is uncommon. The school is also very accessible to students. The satellite campuses in the area make it so students don't have to travel far for a great education. A couple of things that I believe Waubonsee Community College could do better are promoting sports events and student life events to students. While I attended Waubonsee Community College, I was never encouraged to go see a sporting event. I never even knew when they were happening. I feel like I missed out on a part of being a student by not being able to go to one of these events."
Sophomore,4,A really great school with wonderful students and faculty. The campus and facilities are amazing and standard.
Sophomore,4,I've enjoyed my classes at Waubonsee. I have taken classes at the Sugar Grove and downtown Aurora locations.  Most instructors are helpful and easy to speak with.
Niche User,4,"Close to home,  relatively easy to navigate site, guidance counselor and financial aid counselors available to speak with. variety of classes."
Freshman,4,"Online classes are easy to take and understand. The Campus I go to for exams is clean and easy to navigate. The only issue is when I have a problem (finances, exam dates, ect.) Sometimes I get differing accounts from faculty. Overall, it is a good community school for people who don't have a high income."
Sophomore,4,Professors were okay. There are some that make their courses harder than others and had about two professors like that. Online courses are really easy just by doing the work. It's pretty quiet and calm.
Sophomore,4,"As an online student, I was surprised that the feedback has been, for the most part, prompt and helpful.  The courses have been interesting and engaging."
Sophomore,4,Waubonsee community college is a small 2-year college. Most people think community colleges are for students who aren't smart or don't want to be in school. Waubonsee community is for students who want an education and can not afford to go straight to a 4-year institution. Waubonsee also offers certificates and associate degrees to those who are only pursuing a 2 years degree in college. The thing I like the most about this college is that it offers high-quality education at a low price. I am getting the same education with someone at a 4-year institution but the difference is that I am paying less for my classes. Waubonsee also helps students planning to transfer to get all their credits they need and plan ahead. Waubonsee community college offers a future and a good education to the students with financial problems.
Freshman,4,"Waubonsee is a great school, the academics are great and so are the professors, but it would be nice if they tried to host events that would engage the students to make student life more exciting."
Sophomore,4,"I went to Waubonsee for 2 years to get my associates degree. I thought they were a great school and if I could go there for 4 years I would. The Sugar Grove campus is especially nice including the buildings, amenities, and staff. It did not feel like I was attending a community college at all. I enjoyed the classroom sizes and learning environment."
Freshman,4,This college is very good for a good price. I highly considered coming here for 2 years then transfer for students can save money.
Graduate Student,4,"For the two and a half years I attended, I met an incredible amount of people and met some of the most passionate teachers I have ever had. Every teacher I had truly set their class up for you to succeed and learn through class discussion, not just through notes alone. Their campus is very clean, modern and have a large library. An area of improvement for the school would be the challenge of the classes I was able to take each semester; finding out some classes had been dropped due to low attendance or other reasons. These were classes I needed specific to my degree and needed in order to transfer to my current university. I was fortunate enough to take the Human Service courses between one year, while they were offered, but a lot of them were only offered at night and the lack of option proved difficult in my schedule. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Waubonsee and will never forget some teachers who significantly impacted me both academically and taught me lessons of life."
Alum,4,"Waubonsee Community College offers a basic education w/ a low cost. Going to Waubonsee was the best decision for me because it allowed me to get an associates degree transferable to my new university at an affordable cost, for this I am grateful for the opportunity. This institution offers the foundation scholarships and matches you to scholarship opportunities, this was very helpful in making my education possible."
Sophomore,4,"Waubonsee is a great school to start at, especially if your undecided on what you want to do. Waubonsee has many transferable classes. The professors are all willing to help you whenever you need it."
Sophomore,4,"All of my professors and counselors have been caring and very helpful! I have attended both the Sugar Grove and Aurora campuses and they're both in a good area, with lots of places on the outskirts that you can go to in between classes. The buildings are also very clean. I LOVE this school! The only con about it is that there are not many opportunities to be social (school events). Although 
it is an open campus and anyone can walk in, I have always felt safe. The school has officers and police cadets monitoring the area."
Sophomore,4,One thing I really enjoyed there were the teachers. They almost all seem to truly care about the students and their success. They are all very friendly and open to any questions.
Freshman,4,"The campus is the perfect size for a community college. I've never had a bad experience with a teacher here and, for the most part, all of the staff members seem genuinely interested in helping students do well and further their education. I love the library and the henning computer center is just one of campus' excellent free resources for students."
Alum,4,I really enjoyed going to this school. Small class setting is nice because you are able to get the right amount of help you need. Faculty and staff are very helpful and there are a lot of class selections.
Freshman,4,"Waubonsee is such a smart choice for after high school. Whether you don't know what you want to do yet, you need to save up some money, or you just want to learn, this school is so beneficial. It will get you ready to transfer to another school while the classes are less than half the price. The professors here are great as well."
Freshman,4,There are a wide variety of different classes for a community college. It also has multiple campuses which makes traveling easier. There are also many different professors to choose depending on the course you plan on taking.
Freshman,4,"Good place to start, and has a lot of friendly professors and students. I loved the sugar grove campus, it is so beautiful in the fall. Plus the food is very good too."
Sophomore,4,I really like Waubonsee Community Colleges so for. This is a great place to start especially to save  extra money before going to a 4 year university. The lunch room has improved drastically from the time a started up til now. The have been improving the school each year to make it better for the students.
Alum,4,"I've had two separate experiences with Waubonsee. The first right out of high school and the second as a returning, adult student. I would say I had equally successful and good experiences both times. The Sugar Grove campus is beautiful and my instructors (for the most part) but nothing but knowledgeable and helpful."
Graduate Student,4,"Really did enjoy Waubonsee Community College. For it being a community college, it is very beautiful and the teachers are very helpful and there are people who are very nice and enjoyable."
Graduate Student,4,This campus has great resources and environment to study as long you want and it's clean and pretty building.  Easy to access for course books and printed stuff.  Computers available to work in quiet environment 👍
Sophomore,4,"Waubonsee Community College is a great college to start off with, it has every class you need to start your path to your dream career. They have tutors, and counselors to help you when your struggling, and they have a computer lab if your having a hard time doing your work at home. Your able to text or email your teacher if your having issues with your homework or getting to class which helps not missing homework assignments."
Sophomore,4,For a community college Waubonsee is top notch. The professors really make your experience on campus. The facilities are very nice and clean and staff is always friendly.
Sophomore,4,"All professors are very understanding of individual circumstances and are willing to accommodate plans that lead to your success. The Sugar Grove Campus is the most busy due to its larger size, and that being said, it has a very local collage feel to it (in the best possible way)!"
Junior,4,"I like the main campus, but some of the other small campuses need some work and renovation. Most of the professors are great"
Alum,4,"Attending this community college was a secondary choice of mine, but I am ultimately glad that I chose to attend Waubonsee. There is a stigma about community colleges not being the best of places to get education, but that was not my experience. I had some wonderful professors and my choir professor was phenomenal. An education here is just as good as an education at a four year school, without all the student debt."
College Junior,4,The career center can really help you to find out more about your career and see where your studies are taking you.
College Junior,4,Waubonsee Community College makes it easy for the student to work and go to school. The price per class is cheap and makes it affordable for the student to pay.
College Junior,4,There are a lot of classes available online.
College Junior,4,"The first classes are similar to high school, but are more interesting"
College Junior,4,"The teachers are enthusiastic about their work, and care that students are taught well. The campus is really nice from the outside, but is a little older on the inside."
Recent Alumnus,4,I could easily work my classes around my job and it made my life a whole lot easier.
Recent Alumnus,4,The faculty in the career center really helped me to figure out what I want to major in and what schools would be best for me to transfer to.
Recent Alumnus,4,Class size was always just the right amount of students and the teachers remembered everyone's names and formed a relationship with us that made us feel like they really care about our success in class.
Recent Alumnus,4,Waubonsee's campus has the ability to make you feel safe and all of the faculty truly cares about your well being and success.
Recent Alumnus,4,I really enjoy each course i have taken here. I believe the teachers really do go beyond to help there students understand the topics. I think there are a lot of courses offered except that i wish more online courses would be available because those always seem to fill up very fast.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I think being a nursing major is great at waubonsee because all the required classes can be taken at waubonsee, classes can get pretty tricky at times and they require a lot of time outside of class for example to study but i think the school has a lot of resources that you can go to if you're having any trouble."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I really enjoy my school, I especially like that the number of students in the classrooms is small, this way I feel like the teachers really get to know there students unlike in bigger universities where you get lost in the crowd. I also really like that there are multiple campuses you can choose from, that makes it very convenient."
College Freshman,4,"If you ever need to change something in your academic or even life plans, all you need to do is speak up. The school is more than accommodating to its students."
College Freshman,4,"Faculty and guest speakers are around every corner, hoping to get you closer to a job or career of you interests."
College Freshman,4,There are plenty of courses offered at convenient times you can make it work.
College Freshman,4,The online class experience depends on the class. I took Sociology online and I loved it. I also took Spanish online and even after taking four years in high school I struggles in the class.
College Freshman,4,The class sizes are very small which I enjoy. The quality of the professors is overall very good. The courses are informative and there is quite a variety.
College Freshman,4,Being a CRJ major at Waubonsee is great. The professors are former police officers from my hometown making their stories more interesting to me.
College Junior,2,"In my opinion, online classes are bad because you don't get the chance to interact with classmates and the teacher in person"
College Junior,2,"I recommend speaking with trusted teachers, other students, etc in addition to talking to the counselors because some of them are not good.  Jamie is the best but some other career people have no clue.  Seems like there are a good amount of programs, certificates, jobs, and work-study programs"
College Freshman,2,I have never had any career service reach out to me
College Freshman,2,I have yet to see a recruiter on campus  and job fairs are not advertised well
College Sophomore,2,"At first, I thought the class registration process was really confusing but after doing it 5 semesters I really mastered it. However, I had to do it all on my own and really had no help from councelors."
College Sophomore,2,I did not receive any financial aid whatsoever. My family made the smallest amount higher than what financial aid would consider. I paid my tuition straight from my own pocket.
College Sophomore,2,I was never informed on any post-grad services from my school.
College Junior,2,Definitely taking all night classes from now on.
College Junior,2,"I thought this school was going to be a lot better but should've known from past graduates, friends, Internet, etc. That it's not what their ads say."
College Junior,2,Wish I would've never taken online courses. Evening classes are the way to go
College Junior,2,They don't care if you're doing well or not they just want your money and will send you multiple bills. They often overcharge from your financial aid account.
College Sophomore,2,There is very limited student interaction depending on what classes you are in.
Recent Alumnus,2,Do not offer all the post-grad services for some careers. 
Recent Alumnus,2,The computer access is not always the greatest. Sometimes it won't connect or will kick you off for no reason.
College Freshman,2,Nursing and fire safety are two of the popular studies.  
College Freshman,2,"Academics at Waubonsee Community College are average. The interest level of students really has to do with the teacher. There are some teachers that are rude to the students. That, obviously, makes students not want to be in the classroom. There are many different quiet areas to study, along with special tutoring rooms across campus."
College Freshman,2,It was just an average community college. Most of the teachers were great but there were some not-so-nice ones. One of my favorite experiences was in my Biology lab. We got to go outside and collect specimens from the woods and from a pond. It was an awesome learning experience!
College Sophomore,2,I'm currently registered as having an Computer Science Major and unfortunately most classes are what I expected; General Education. What else can you expect of being enrolled in a community college.
College Freshman,2,"Not the best. Fairly slow. The computers in the computer lab are The only good computers. Everywhere else it's terrible. The school website every month makes you change your password. And the printing is very slow, and confusing. Computer staff is very unfriendly."
College Senior,2,Waubonsee's Career Center is not helpful whatsoever
Niche User,1,"Terrible. Place has undergone a lot of changes and under  new administration most of the interest is on running it like a corporation and making money. Learning first has become a thing of the past.  Last they care about is students, faculty or program development.  Tuition cost is decent but you end up getting what you pay for. If you want quality education you would be much better taking your money and looking elsewhere."
Freshman,1,"I tried registering for the spring and got the run around for 2 months.  No one could help me, no one knew what to do or who to talk to.   The day school was starting they dropped me from the class.. just a horrible experience.  I have never been so sick about trying to go to school. All other schools the process was one day.  Here, no one knows what they are doing."
Sophomore,1,Entire experience depends on the professors you get. Most are part time. Some pt professors are great and are invested in the class while others don't care at all. The school only sets up transfers to NIU and ISU. If you are looking to go out of state you need to set everything up as far as coursework goes by yourself. 
College Sophomore,1,"My major is business management,my future is to build my own company. I have recently joined the NTHS. I am interested in business internships after i complete my sophomore year with my degree."
College Freshman,1,they were not prepared for the class
College Junior,1,I've received no help whatsoever from Waubonsee regarding financial aid.  I've had to explore and find things out on my own.  Very disappointed.
College Senior,1,Even though I am middle class does not mean I don't need financial aid. They did not help people like me at all money wise.
College Junior,1,"My overall experience has not been the best. I have attended 3 other schools in 2 different states and this is by far the least organized. I have had separate issues with Admissions, Registration, Financial Aid, Counseling, and the Bursar - all due to miscommunication amongst themselves. Needless to say, I am looking for alternative colleges."
College Junior,1,"It took three trips in two semesters for them to apply all of my credits. Counseling had half of the info, admissions had the other half, and they both were telling me I had missing info even though it was all there from day one."
College Junior,1,Poor Internet Access – The network is slow and doesn't work in all classrooms.  It is often temperamental.
College Senior,1,The counselors are horrible! I can only say one counselor is helpful the rest have been rude and completely useless!
College Freshman,1,High School All Over Again. Waubonsee is just a continuation of high school. I suggest potential students go to College of DuPage or go to a 4 year school. This school is only good for its prices.
College Freshman,1,"The campus has the basic resources that other schools do but the staffing is down to a minimum, the staff are disgruntled, and there are very few helpful resources available. Academic Advising is terrible and offers no help. You're on your own. Commuter campus has you feeling alone already, but the lack of resources makes you regret your college choice."
College Freshman,1,The Biology major is pointless. I have taken 2 actual Biology courses and I have my associates. Most classes are History and English. The workload for the actual major is all busy work but it takes forever to do and is hard to understand. Read reviews on different teachers BEFORE you register for classes.
College Freshman,1,"Transferring Credits – Many general education credits have to be reviewed before they can be considered for transfer and higher-class colleges/universities. Waubonsee acts as a feeder school in that most Waubonsee students end up going to Aurora University, Illinois State University, or University of Illinois at Chicago so the general education classes seem to be based on what classes these schools want. Other colleges prefer students take different, more advanced courses."
College Freshman,1,"Cheap, but Incomplete – Tuition is fairly cheap compared to most schools in the state. However, most students are paying out of pocket or their parents are paying. The commute to the school alone takes up most of a student's time, as well as poor class scheduling. It is hard to pay for school with limited time. The financial aid office is unhelpful and disinterested in students. They see the job as a means for a paycheck. Not enough financial aid available for students with actual needs. Most financial aid goes to minority students."

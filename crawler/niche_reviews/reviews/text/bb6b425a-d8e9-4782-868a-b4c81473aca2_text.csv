Freshman,5,"While applying, I had multiple outlets to contact faculty and administration. The admission office was extremely helpful and willing to answer questions throughout the entire process. I am extremely excited to start this Fall!"
Freshman,5,Highly regarded Liberal Arts College. Academics and Athletics incredible. Located on one of the most beautiful campuses in America. A true gem in higher education. This college should be on every high school senior’s radar if you truly appreciate being academically challenged and are looking 4 years ahead for career opportunities in your course of study. Go Herons! Go Statesmen!
Works Here,5,"I have worked for Hobart and William Smith Colleges for the six years and have loved my experience. The students, faculty and staff all contribute to a community built upon exploration, growth and inclusivity. I am confident our students leave here prepared to make a global impact."
Alum,5,I had an amazing experience at HWS! I truly feel that it  prepared me for the next steps in my life. I'm currently in a competitive graduate program and feel that the connections I made at HWS will continue to help me and add value to my life for years and years to come.
Freshman,5,It has a lot of opportunities for students which is good. The faculty members are there for their students and the college itself is small and community-based. I like how friendly people are and everyone's open to helping you out and making sure you are taken care of in an orderly manner. I appreciate the help I received and I will always recommend this school to other high school students searching for a small private school guaranteed to make them successful in life.
Senior,5,"The entrepreneurial studies minor has helped me realize the importance of an interdisciplinary education. I've had the opportunity to meet students from a variety of majors, who think differently than I do. This has challenged me to think and work in different ways. The professors are there to support and guide you through the initial idea generation and final pitch process. The skills I use in class are applicable to everyday life and often highly sought out in the job market."
Junior,5,"The freedom that comes with the academics at HWS is unrivaled. My minor, Social Justice Studies, emphasizes interdisciplinary learning in a way that has given me the chance to explore a wide variety of departments across the HWS curriculum, including theatre, anthropology, LGBT studies and political science. I’ve always believed in the power of people helping people, and minoring in Social Justice Studies provided me with the tools to create meaningful change in the community. I truly believe that I am a better friend, peer, and citizen because of it."
Alum,5,I loved my time at Hobart and William Smith! I was a Biology major and women's studies and psychology double minor and the professors made learning a great experience. I was also a member of the William Smith crew team and met countless friends and made lifelong connections.
Niche User,5,Excellent Education with a amazing atmosphere in a unique environment. The athletics is one of the best and also their unique curriculum!
Freshman,5,I cannot wait to start in the fall! It has everything that I can ever hope for. I am excited to travel with their international program.
Sophomore,5,"Great professors and administration. Just get all promises down as emails, otherwise, you won't get things done here."
Freshman,5,I love that Hobart and William Smith is such a local school. The college is very involved in the Geneva Community as well as the entire Finger Lakes Community.
Sophomore,5,Top tier education. Strong sense of community. Professors care about you as a person. Party scene sometime lacks because of the rigorous academics
Junior,5,"Great College Economics department is very high quality! Lots of fun so may nice kids, meet lifelong friends during my first week at the school. Work hard play hard type of place. Professors really push you! Expect to work!"
Junior,5,"I love this place! I was choosing between here and Villanova, so glad I chose HWS. Hobart is a classic college ecpirence. The teachers are some of the best, and classes are so small, you have a lot of access to them. I have met some of the best people here too, friends I will have for life! The Campus is so beautiful right on the lake make spring so much fun. Lots of Hanging out on boats and chilling on the shoars of Seneca Lake. One of the best career services going, they are so good to work with and great at getting your high paying jobs after college."
Freshman,5,"Everyone here is so warm and welcoming; it felt like home pretty fast. The campus is absolutely beautiful, the people are incredibly friendly, and the professors are absolutely fantastic. It's easy to make friends and get close to people including professors and even other staff because of the small size of the Colleges."
Alum,5,"Environment always supported learning. The professors truly cared about their students regardless of the subject and would allow every student to succeed. The campus continued to grow with new buildings and new places for creativity to excel. It would have been nice to have seen all students treated fairly, however, a lot of special cases were made for students that paid full tuition and parents donated to the school."
Senior,5,"I love this college. The career services program is one of the best in the country, as is its abroad program. The athletics are very strong here, with dedicated coaches and athletic directors who care about you beyond your student-athlete identity. The academics are challenging and rigorous, but the professors only want to bring out the best in you. The facilities are plentiful and modern. My only complaint is it can be hard to find parking, but that's just a small detail. The location is beautiful, as we are right along Seneca Lake and downtown is only a minute drive away."
Alum,5,"HWS is a beautiful, quiet campus ... as a student who took my academics seriously, the professors seriously couldn't be beat. There are a lot of upper-middle-class students on campus, so it's not really the most diverse place - but that's the same for just about every small liberal arts institution."
Senior,5,"HWS has provided me with the most amazing balance of challenging academics, competitive athletics, and lifelong friends."
Junior,5,"If I could do it again, I would still absolutely choose HWS. The opportunities available to students here are incredible — from the outstanding career services office to the extensive study abroad programs. Classes here are small and the professors make an effort to help students succeed. For a small school, HWS also has a great social scene. Students here are serious about studying and have high standards for themselves, but also like to have fun and enjoy the weekends. Both the lake and Downtown Geneva are a large aspect of the social life, and students can also enjoy the beautiful surrounding region full of local farms and wineries. The sports teams at HWS are also top programs in their divisions, more often than not finishing in the Top 20 or as Conference Champs. The school is not only committed to excellence in athletics, though, as evidenced by the impressive new Performing Arts Center on campus. I have had an amazing experience here and recommend the school to everyone."
Alum,5,"I had an amazing experience at Hobart and William Smith Colleges. I made lifelong friends, and got an amazing education thanks to professors who challenged me to think differently."
Alum,5,"I knew instantly when I set foot on the HWS campus that I wanted to go to school there. The people were friendly and genuine, there was a great reciprocal relationship with the town of Geneva, and you couldn't ask for a more beautiful campus. I'm so thankful I found HWS. I made lifelong friends and tons of professional connections thanks to the strength of the alumni base."
Alum,5,"It’s a really personal place, everyone is there to support you and it’s a great community feel. It’s almost too easy to get involved since there are so many clubs, activities, and sports teams on campus. Academics are rigorous but there are tons of opportunities for peer tutoring and meeting with professors outside of class."
Senior,5,I loved living on a lake for four years! Great education and great career services. Also a very fun growing downtown with lots of great restaurants.
Alum,5,"I had an absolutely amazing four years at HWS - from the people, beautiful campus, distinguished academics and more, it really was the perfect school for me and helped get me to where I am today. The Career Services Center helped me obtain multiple internships and connect me with a more-than-willing-to-help alumni base, through which I’ve used to get all of my jobs thus far in my career."
Alum,5,"At HWS, I was academically challenged and enriched by small classes, engaged faculty and a interactive administration. I had professional and volunteer opportunities in the community that integrated my studies with community development, and also helped launch my career."
Alum,5,"Hobart and William Smith feels like home long after you leave. The professors personally invest in your success, going far beyond expectations of the classrooms and helping you figure out who you want to be and what your strengths are. There are endless opportunities to challenge yourself, thrive and discover something new. Your classmates are your teammates, rather than your competition, and will cheer you on through your success and help build you back up when you fall. 

Geneva is a growing, but modest city-- so students who are resourceful, creative and want to participate will be happier here."
Junior,5,"HWS was the right choice for me. It's a campus where if you want to be involved, then you have to take the initiative and get involved. It brought me out of my comfort zone and I'v deffinatly grown as a person since coming here."
Junior,5,"I like the large variety of activities available for many interests. However, communication to inform students about some of the activities could improve."
Alum,5,"I chose Hobart over other higher-rated Liberal Arts colleges and it truly transformed my life. I am so thankful for the time there, the professors and administrators I met, and the ways that they impacted my life."
Alum,5,"An excellent college for any student looking for an exceptional college experience!  Most class sizes are small, allowing for professors to really get to know their students and provide them with individualized attention.  The study abroad programs are phenomenal and an experience every student should take advantage of!  The sports programs and coaches are extremely devoted to student athlete success.  The town of Geneva is quaint and supportive of the colleges.  The campus is right on the border of NY Finger Lakes Wine Trail and Seneca Lake!  :)"
Freshman,5,"I am currently a first-year at HWS and I absolutely love it here. The courses are challenging, but the professors are committed to your education. They have teaching fellows offered for nearly every subject that are able to help you if you are failing to understand a lesson."
College Junior,5,"The housing is what you make it. The room sin all honesty are pretty nice!! So when people complain and call a building ""dirty"" it's because of the people that live there... not the building. Overall, the housing process, social atmosphere and convenience is very good!"
College Freshman,5,What you really get from graduating here is the name. The alumni network is extensive and the name of the school alone speaks volumes to the outside world.
College Freshman,5,"After the incident, there was a whole building dedicated to sexual assault. You can seek help if needed. Freshmen are required to watch a show dedicated to sexual assault along with a debrief afterward. Weeks after orientation you are also required to attend a 3 hour seminar on sexual assault."
College Freshman,5,"There is a whole center dedicated to this. If you go to the career center, you are gaurenteed an internship."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm so glad I found HWS and i couldn't be any happier there.  It's challenging, but not too hard, it pushes me to my limits but not over them.  I've found a great group of friends and even though its cold and not in a big city, we make our own fun and always find something to do.  I found it through sailing, and even though I decided not to join the team I'm so glad the sport I love allowed me to find the perfect school for me."
College Freshman,5,"I tell all my friend to apply here because the financial aid office is magical. For no application fee you stand the chance at landing anywhere from a 60,000 to a 30,000 dollar a year scholarship based off of merit or need. Talking to my friends and evaluating my own experience, I have consistently seen high merit students rewarded with 20,000-40,000 a year scholarships and my other friends have most or all of their need met. The school also uses a very holistic approach when awarding need based scholarships, and those scholarships bring in some of the most diverse and interesting members of the student body. Many students earn scholarship for a culmination of factors such as: low income families, hailing from an impoverished town, hailing from a rural area, minority status, community engagement, first generation college student, and/or hailing from the Finger Lakes region—and that's just to name a few factors considered."
College Freshman,5,"As is the case at all schools, campus housing can be a little gross for freshmen, but still, the freshman dorms at HWS are larger at other institutions. Upperclassmen housing only gets better with dorms ranging from spacious to down right luxurious. Many upperclassmen live in theme houses or suit/apartment style housing. The only complaint I've heard is that you are forced to live on campus until you're a senior, but on campus housing is just as nice as anything you'll find in Geneva, so complaints on that end are very minimal."
College Freshman,5,"Received all the money I needed to attend this school. Very generous. I know of below average student who received 20K+ a year to come to this college. The cost is high, but very few pay 60K."
College Sophomore,5,"A burrito bar just opened up in town that uses local and homemade ingredients. Costs about the same as Chipotle, but has a wide variety of extra sauces to put on your meal."
College Freshman,5,"professors keep it interesting, and the work load isn't too heavy but expect to be in the library a decent amount of the time"
College Junior,5,only guys frats some of them are nicer than others
College Junior,5,The town has some bars and descent food. lots of wine. definitely an us and them atmosphere with townies
College Junior,5,Camp O is laid back unless you are rude
College Junior,5,"If you are obvious or in a freshman dorm, they will not care. If you get too messed up and you go to the hospital there are ramifications, but even then three is a three strike policy."
College Freshman,5,campus safety is always there but for the most part they leave you alone
College Freshman,5,"One nice quality is the lake that borders our campus. It's very clean and in the first and last few weeks, you are guaranteed to find students swimming"
College Freshman,5,"Our campus is absolutely gorgeous. It's very small, but it's overflowing with asthetic appeal"
College Freshman,5,"Most students at the school receive financial aid and if you excel in the classroom or the arts, they will not hesitate to reward you with a very nice scholarship"
College Freshman,5,"we have a goals program in which we are required to take at least 1 class in 8 different areas of study, but we are free to choose what classes we take to fulfill those goals"
College Freshman,5,"The academics are really solid.  As a liberal arts school we are required to take classes in all different subject areas, but all of the departments are top notch"
College Freshman,5,Hobart is absolutely amazing. Unless you hate friends and a great social life with solid academics...
College Freshman,5,"pretty good, there are a lot of computers in the library and if you want one you can get one."
College Sophomore,5,"I love my major and department! The professors are extremely passionate about what their craft and are always encouraging you to develop as a critical writer and intellectual. This department encompasses a good range of other subjects taught on campus, which is appealing because it provides the student with a well-rounded knowledge base. So many great things about this major!"
College Sophomore,5,"I'm a HEOP student, which is the Higher Education Opportunity Program. This program is designed to provide talented students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds with both financial and academic support throughout their undergraduate years. This program sounds like a great opportunity, right? It is, however, like all forms of affirmative action there will be those who stigmatize it's entirety. This is something that I have personally dealt with during my time here at the colleges. I've heard things like, ""You're a writing major?"" ""That's new, there aren't that many black writing majors."" Also, ""HEOP students don't deserve to be at HWS because they did not work as hard as everyone else did to get here."" These sorts of ignorant commentary provide me with a motivation to succeed here at the colleges in an exceptional manner."
College Sophomore,5,"Athletics are a great way to get to know new people and enjoy great games in our top of the line facilities. Everyone has a great time and, when it comes to our Division I lacrosse team, we really get loud."
College Sophomore,5,Our new athletic center is state of the art and serves as the hub of student activity. There is also a wonderful turf outdoor field as well as a field just for soccer games right in the heart of campus.
College Sophomore,5,"There are a lot of different food options, though the main dining hall has the best (and most) food."
Senior,4,"I overall enjoy my time so far at HWS. I have made the most genuinely sincere friends and have had a lot of fun. However, not all students are this way. Much of the school population is very wealthy and uppity. You can definitely find your place here, just might not be with everyone."
Alum,4,"The school is working to become more diverse and promote the learning of other perspectives, which is admirable and necessary."
Works Here,4,"Hobart and William Smith Colleges sit on one of the most beautiful campuses in the Northeast. Seneca Lake provides endless options for fun and photo opps. Geneva and the surrounding Finger Lakes Region have amazing restaurants, hiking and biking trails, an ever growing beer and wine industry and history galore. Day trips are popular on weekends and students can always be found downtown Geneva at shops and cafes. 

HWS students have access to opportunities that prepare them for their life after graduation and help them stand out from their peers. Students can take advantage of the career center as early as their freshmen year and go abroad as early as their sophomore year. Undergraduate research is popular as are senior honors projects. Faculty mentorship extends far beyond the classroom and students feel supported during their four years."
Freshman,4,I love the school. I personally wish there was a little more diversity but the school and academics are great.  The teachers and class sizes are good sizes so you get a lot of personal interaction with the teachers and they're willing to help you at any time. Campus activities always have a good turn out and the people on campus are really friendly
Junior,4,Hobart and William Smith Colleges focuses on community service and civic engagement. They really work to break down the town-gown relationship and create a connection with the community of Geneva.
Senior,4,"I strongly believe that the education here is phenomenal. I have learned so much from my professors and have personal relationships with many of them. I joke that when I graduate, my celebration will be only faculty members. Even those I chose two unconventional majors, I feel competent in several practical skillsets on top of traditional liberal arts skills. 

Campus is gorgeous. I could stare at the lake all day and have many good memories of hanging out at the dock. The surrounding area is full of waterfalls, hiking trails, and quirky small towns if you have a car. Geneva is home to a lot of good local restaurants and wineries. 

 I like the food and the dining hall was just renovated. If you need junk, a McDonalds is close. A hidden gem is the Shabbat dinner hosted every Friday by the Abbe Center. 

As far as changes go, I think the community needs more intellectual diversity and more school spirit."
Freshman,4,"The Professors I've had have all been ready and willing to work with you if you are struggling in a class.  The food isn't great but it's bearable. Housing isn't bad, the room sizes are decent.  Support services are helpful and great."
Freshman,4,"Classes are challenging.  Professors are great, food is not.  Open minded faculty and students.  A lot of student athletes here, this is a good place for high level D3 athletes."
College Sophomore,4,"Career service is very helpful, they reviewed my resume for a summer job application that I was considering."
College Sophomore,4,"So far I love HWS, yes there are things that I wish could change but I love all the experiences that I've had."
College Sophomore,4,I lived in an all female dorm my first year and I loved it. The space was generally kept clean.
College Sophomore,4,"This school is great, except for some snobby students."
College Freshman,4,I like how close the students and teachers become and i like the size of the classes. I like that you arent just another face in the croud but they actually know who you are.
College Freshman,4,There are both Single sexed dorms and Co-Ed which is nice for the people who like their rooms quiet or like to be right in the center of attention.
College Freshman,4,Everything a the school looks really good and there are work out areas for people who dont play sports too.
College Freshman,4,So far the overall experience is really good and everyone is friendly and makes you feel welcomed to the school and campus.
College Junior,4,There is a wide variety of courses that are offered depending on what you are interested in. Class sizes range from 5 to 30 (30 if you are in a highly demanded course) and there is a lot of 1:1 time with your professor. All the professors I've had are funny and very approachable and are willing to work with you. They are also very concerned about your well-being and your performance in their class. Classes use media and textbooks a lot.
College Junior,4,The quality of the alumni network is amazing! And there are several opportunities to meet them at campus alumni events. The career services office is very good at helping you search fro jobs/ internships around campus or your hometown.
College Junior,4,"Since the incident, a ton of necessary steps and security measures have been taken to prevent a reoccurrence."
College Junior,4,"My favorite experiences are at school events that take place at ""classic"" school places such as the Quad and The Docks. My school is unique because it is very liberal, so every student's voice has an opportunity to be heard, and issues can be addressed. If I had the chance to do it all over I would not choose this school only because academically it is too liberal for my taste. I came in to college knowing exactly what I wanted to do, and the liberal system is set up so that you can experience a little bit of everything, which is not bad per se, but it can be considered a waste of time for those who know what they want. So it's really a personal preference."
College Freshman,4,The counselor and student mental health facilities are wonderful and super helpful if you ever have any issues at all with anything
College Sophomore,4,"Although there are break-ins and burglary, Campus Safety notifies us immediately and updates/instructs us if any action is to be taken. Walking around campus never feels unsafe (unless walking to the arts campus)"
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are knowledgeable in what they teach and are passionate about it. They typically require interesting and relevant material. Class sizes are small so you really get to know your professor. Class styles vary, from lectures to more hands-on activities (really depends on the professor). Depending on your major, there can be great variety of courses you can take to fulfill your major, others might be more limited (such as an International Relations major versus an Economics major)."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a guaranteed internship program that the Colleges provides, and as long as you attend certain meetings, it can be very useful. The career services helps a lot of with resumes and preparing for interviews. There are many employers that visit campus that also give lectures and a look into real jobs, which also helps us tailor our interests. It is very easy to get into contact with alumni and even seek help through them via career services."
College Sophomore,4,"Living in a dorm in the past was horrendous in terms of cleanliness. I also had to pay for fines for broken things that I was not responsible for. Other dorms had activities available so that the floor could bond, but my dorm did not, thus I did not feel a strong sense of community. Living in a house now, it is much cleaner and socializing is much easier since you choose who comes in and out of your house (in terms of inviting them over). It is also quite close to the classrooms so it is very convenient. The way housing is selected can be stressful if you have a bad number and do not have friends that can pull you in. Writing essays for theme houses is also a little tedious."
College Sophomore,4,"Although school spirit isn't huge since the football team is at the D3 level, there has recently been strong support for individuals that have succeeded (such as the recent graduate who was recruited by the NFL). Most students are involved in sports. Our soccer teams are very strong, and hockey is also popular. Varsity sports have their own gym for lifting, which is convenient."
College Junior,4,more than half of our student are participating in club or varsity sports
College Junior,4,"There are great student based, student run clubs"
College Sophomore,4,The school encourages students to take advantage of career services and want students to succeed. They help to network and find people with connections to get a job quickly after school.
College Sophomore,4,Most if not all of my professors are very interested and excited about what they are teaching which makes me want to learn more. They are available outside of class if i need help. Some professors aren't as willing and available. They encourage me to try my best and are understanding if I need to miss class or need an extension on my work. They truly care about my learning.
College Sophomore,4,"Many people are involved in sports, both varisty, JV and club sports. There is a lot of school spirit and people enjoy going to sporting events."
College Sophomore,4,"My school provides me with all the tools I need to succeed. The professors are available and willing to help and want to see all of their students exceed. Classes and assignments are challenging but make me an overall better student. My school also encourages me to get out of my comfort zone and try new things, which help me to grow as a person."
College Freshman,4,"The frats have been on probation recently, but now coming off probation, there is a lot more to nightlife. If you are underage I would NOT go near the bars unless you have a fake ID, in that case they barely check to see if the ID is real. If under 21 I would go to some of the sport houses or a frat. Lacrosse and soccer is always packed, but fun to go to. Hockey is the best to go to in the winter time. Beer is available at all of them, but if you are looking for hard liquor I suggest buying yourself or going to a trust- worthy frat that will not drug you. Kappa Sig and PSK are great places to go as a freshmen. The cocane is present at some of the frats, but there is no pressure to do so. Most parties shut down around 1 and everyone goes downtown."
College Freshman,4,"If you are a freshmen boy that is not a legacy or in a sport, you aren't getting in anywhere but possibly Chi Phi. It's the nerdy frat that most girls don't go to. If you are a girl you can get in anywhere. Kappa Sig, PSK, and Sig are the best places to go. Lacrosse and soccer are also a lot of fun."
College Freshman,4,"Small class size, well educated professors, good amount of courses offered."
College Freshman,4,"If you are a girl as a first year I suggest all girls housing, you will most likely be put in a dorm with chandeliers or a large flat screen television. For guys most of the dorms are not in as good shape, but that's because the guys make it that way. First year Co-Ed dorms are pretty gross. You'll either be placed in JPR or Sherrill (don't get in Sherrill it's the worst housing option) which are both older and Housing options but certainly livable. As a sophomore your housing options open up and you will be more satisfied."
College Freshman,4,"If you want to work out there's definitely room for you. There is a separate gym for the varsity athletes so there is no intimidation and regulars can work out when they desire. Lacrosse overshadows the sports at Hobart, mostly because they are our only division one team. The football and soccer games are attended, but there is less of abundance of people."
College Freshman,4,If you are interested in finding a school with a good career center with great job opportunities and preppy kids this is for you.
College Freshman,4,"As a first year here, things are going really well so far. While ""preppy"" is the main trend here, the school is pretty diverse. Most people are kind and approachable (of course you will find a few people here and there that aren't particularly nice), but that goes for any school. Having strong connections both nationally and globally, the colleges have a great reputation for helping students find an internship or a career path. Academically, it can be challenging and rigorous, but it is completely feasible to succeed when you put your mind to it, and when you make use of the resources that are provided here. I love this school, and I look forward to being here for the next four years."
College Sophomore,4,My school is great! The community is wonderful and the teachers really care about your future.
College Junior,4,I learn a lot and made many of friends and really enjoy the classes and learning and the campus.
College Freshman,4,"All and all, I can't complain about the food. Saga is all you can eat, and most meal plans allow reasonable access to The Cafe and The Pub. Saga gives between 5-7 different meal options for both lunch and dinner, so I'd say there are maybe one or two times a semester I really can't find a descent meal in the place, and besides that I'd say I sit down to three meals a week that I would call high quality restaurant food. Besides, if you're not feeling Saga, The Cafe and The Pub both offer a higher quality food option."
College Freshman,4,"HWS is division III so sports aren't that big of a deal. Still, you can see a lot of student support for lacrosse, football and girls' soccer. Almost all of campus is involved at some level of sports whether it be varsity, club, or intramural. So we like to be active, we like our teams, but no one goes crazy over sports."
College Freshman,4,Geneva is a great town with a fair number of downtown restaurants. There is also a mall strip with fast food places adjacent to campus.
College Sophomore,4,There is a large amount of support for the Hobart football team when the team is at home. They do win a majority of their games. Other sports on campus are attended but not as much.
College Freshman,4,"Lots of alum work on wall st. You will be able to make connections and get where you want, regardless if you're competent or not."
College Freshman,4,"The students are what really define this place. 90% of them are just terrible people. Rich, elitist, snobby, preppy WASPS make up the majority of the student body. Most came to the school because it was simply the next step to getting a job from daddy/someone in their family. There is a distinct lack of a collegiate environment. I've been told that it is almost exactly like prep school, just with slightly more freedom. Practically no one wants to work hard, and finding someone who you can have a decent conversation with is impossible. On the upside, almost everyone is gorgeous. The guys are all clean cut and the girls are hot as hell. Very homogeneous though. Everyone fits the same mold."
College Freshman,4,"The DI lacrosse team gets the most love. The football team has had a couple of strong years and is sending a kid to the draft. The hockey team won their conference. The basketball team is above average. What they share the most in common, however, is the lack of student support. Most of the sports team are good for their divisions, but no one gets pumped for games unless it is the playoffs, and sometimes not even then. It's pitiful."
College Freshman,4,"A few nice restaurants that are hard to get to without a car, but no more than a 5-10 minute drive. Dominoes is the drunk food of choice if your'e lazy, but the best is Joes Hots, located downtown and near the bars. The garbage plates are a great drunk food, and everything else they serve is delicious."
College Freshman,4,The campus is nice and clean.
College Freshman,4,Local restaurants in town give discounts to the students all the time. They deliver fast and easy and its generally pretty cheap.
College Freshman,4,The financial aid people are amazing. They helped out every step of the way and made sure that I got all the help I needed so I could go to school.
College Freshman,4,The staff that work at Saga are amazing. They are kind people that generally care about the students. The food is pretty decent for school food and they try to understand certain allergies so everyone can find something good to eat.
College Sophomore,4,"I know that those who have lived in a coed Freshman dorm such as JPR or Sherill may disagree, but I've enjoyed campus housing so far. I've only lived in all-girls housing on the hill (Hirshon and Blackwell) and both have been good experiences. Nothing incredible, but they were both clean and quiet."
College Sophomore,4,"The academic environment suits me perfectly: rigorous, but not overly competitive. There are some colleges where programs are so intense that the atmosphere feels cutthroat, but at HWS the environment is more supportive. I've found that at HWS you get what you put into your studies. If you work hard, keep up with the readings, and participate then you will find the academic scene to be enriching and comprehensive."
College Sophomore,4,The sailing team definitely has the most beautiful sailing area and boat house than most other schools. The women's locker rooms are also awesome.
College Sophomore,4,New offices and procedures were just enacted in order to help combat sexual assault on campus and provide support for victims.
College Sophomore,4,"I only say it's great because I have a number of friends who live in various frats and off campus parties, if not for that I wouldn't know of much to do."
College Freshman,4,They've improved a lot and force it down your throats.
College Freshman,4,"The 2013 summer rape case cause the Campus Police to crack down on policies, busting many parties within the first hour."
Freshman,2,"The food is awful, the people are okay, but its the faculty that really sucks. Im a freshman, and I feel like nobody really cares. My advisor could honestly care less about me, and the counseling center feels like a joke. If you need help regarding your mental health, good luck."
Sophomore,2,"Due to Covid-19, most of my second semester was online, at times it felt as though taking these classes online was not worth the price and that I wasn't getting the same education I would be getting on campus."
Junior,2,"You are paying for a liberal arts college and a small community but most of the time you just get administrators who don't care. Center for Teaching and Learning, Counseling Center and other student support services they mention in their material - are a joke."
Freshman,2,"Barely any parties, will charge you for things you didn’t break, isn’t inclusive for people with dietary restrictions (especially allergies), housing is a mess, Geneva is small with barely anything to do."
Sophomore,2,"This College has its prestige, but each incoming class is stupider than the last. They try to entice you to come with a very high financial package but don't take it. This school's future alumni won't live up to its name. I have spent a year and a half here, and this is a continuation of high school (not a college). I socialized and tried to integrate into the school but, what I found was a very toxic atmosphere. Everyone who goes here seems to be entitled to judge and criticize every other person even friends. If you want to stay in the high school mindset, go here everyone is still bickering."
College Junior,2,"At my school Greek life is only available for Men. Which is disappointing because then they control majority of the party scene and girls are left at their mercy (in terms of trying to get in). I wish there were sororities on campus but I've heard that's a long uphill battle that not many are willing to take on. Apart from that Greek life does participate in community activities, so they do, do their part!"
College Freshman,2,"This school, being a coordinate college system, only offers fraternities. Women do not play a role in greek life and have zero opportunity to be in a sorority."
College Freshman,2,All of the male dorms are right on the quad and much closer to classes than female dorms which are up the hill and much harder to get to. I find this unfair and feel it adds to the gender disparity on campus
College Freshman,2,"The frats are alright, but there are no sororities on campus which leads to a huge disadvantage for females on campus in housing, connections, etc. It adds to the disparity between genders on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"The Colleges caters to a certain type of people, and it is hard to thrive in an environment that is very monotonous and with too many like-minded people. The people who do want positive change are made fun of, and if you don't fit the standard, you may find yourself isolated. However, joining clubs and meeting people with similar interests as you does alleviate some of these stresses."
College Freshman,2,Campus safety is not the best.
College Sophomore,2,"The party scene is bad because there is a limited amount on campus, the party life is not extreme. When looking for a party, race, unfortunately, plays a part on if you can get invited or let in."
College Freshman,2,"This place sucks. If you are an upper-middle class prep school kid with average aspirations, hoping to meet a good husband, or coast your way through life, by all means go to this school. However, if you want a college experience that is worth the money, stay away. You are judged mainly on how much money you have and your appearance. Not only is the social life lacking, the academics are also unfulfilling. This school only has a strong reputation because of the connections formed, not any of the material learned. By no means should this school have a good academic reputation. The administration is incompetent and do not understand the students, and the students themselves are terrible people. I have had dedicated and intelligent professors who would love to delve into their subject deeper, only to be shot down by the lack of student interest. This place is terrible. I wouldn't recommend this school to my worst enemy."
College Freshman,2,"I know it has been a tough year for the college. Dealing with the New York Times article was definitely going to change the school. But damn, the nightlife is rough. Yeah, if you know people from prep school or have a ton of money, there is usually a party happening. But there can be nights when absolutely nothing happens. The hardest part is actually getting into a party. Once you are in, it's alright. Almost always dancing and loud music. The best part by far however is the free booze. There is never a cover fee, and there is always free booze/liquor early in the night. The keg might eventually run out, but by that point most people are already drunk."
College Freshman,2,"Pretty out of touch with the student body. I heard they get better as the years go on, but my first year experience with campo and the administration has been awful. They are convinced that every first year needs constant supervision, and treat the freshman as such."
College Freshman,2,It is almost scary how easy it is to get away with things on campus. Living in the campus dorms there have been numerous times that students have gotten back drunk and in danger from their drinking. Oddly enough they are very strict on clubs and protest for social issues.
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't any sororities, but the frats are viewed by non-Greeks as very- to put it delicately- douchey."
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot of options.
College Sophomore,2,"Geneva is a really small town. The locals are generally very kind and gracious (despite some of the students being quite elitist/ condescending towards ""townies"") but there isn't much to do. Downtown Geneva is a couple of blocks with a few decent restaurants and small stores. There's a small movie theater that only plays 5 wide releases at a time. Not a lot going on."
College Freshman,2,"They put many freshman in forced triples, double occupancy rooms with three people in them."
College Freshman,2,"The town dislikes the college students in all aspects. It's regarded as poverty-stricken. Professors don't even live in the town. There are strained relationships between the students and the residents. There aren't many attractions besides wine, which is only accessible for students 21+. It takes at least 45 minutes to get anywhere remotely attractive and is five hours away from major cities (New York/Boston). Airport transportation is costly and not available through the Colleges unless over a major break."
College Sophomore,2,"It's an hour and a half to the nearest airport, large concert venue or train station."
College Sophomore,2,"My freshman year there was a stabbing across the street from my dorm in which a man stabbed another man over a drug deal and then hid in the closet of the neighboring house, the S.W.A.T. team was called and there was a standoff between the police and the man until 3 a.m. with all of the freshman dorm and the man's wife and children watching. There were police canines walking the halls of the dorm that night and a couple years earlier there was a massive drug bust in that same complex, not 30 feet from the freshman dorms. There is also an issue with robbery along Hamilton Avenue."
College Sophomore,2,I want to study film but they don't have a huge amount of options for film at this school.
College Sophomore,2,"All I can say is I hope you are coming here for the school and not the local atmosphere, because the area pretty crap. There aren't many things to do; there is one cinema in a strip mall nearby. The shopping is pretty much limited to Wal-Mart and a couple smaller, cheap clothing stores. If you want another, bigger, strip mall with more you can drive 45 minutes but this probably isn't something you want to do often. The local events and cultural aspects are practically non-existent as far as I know."
College Student,2,"The only public transportation in town is to the local bars. The on campus shuttle doesn't start until 7 pm and is never on time. Ride sharing is hard if you are not from Boston, North Jersey, or the New York City Area."
College Student,2,"Winter is LONG, COLD, and lasts forever. There is a period of time where you think it will never end. Tall rain boots and snow boots are a must. A long down coat is also necessary. It snows ALOT and being right on the lake makes it very very windy."
College Junior,2,"Expensive, bad, no options, horrible hours, school shuts it down for random activities... pretty bad"
College Sophomore,2,Geneva is for the most part rundown.
College Sophomore,2,Almost everyone is white. A few asians. A few blacks.
College Sophomore,2,Most kids drink and smoke. Tons of kids do blow.
College Freshman,2,"There are a few cute places downtown that are pretty nice, but in terms of walking distance eateries it's pretty much just fast food. Not great."
College Freshman,2,"Geneva weather sucks, to be frank. Being near the lake makes for some really windy days, and there were about 3 inches of snow before Thanksgiving. Very cold."
College Freshman,2,I'm transferring ASAP mainly because they don't have the program I want. So no. 
College Freshman,2,"The actual diversity here is lacking, but acceptance of the little diversity present is high. There are small but high-profile minority cultural activities, like LGBT stuff. Many of the actual male students on campus are disrespectful to women, but there is a very strong feminist presence at the school, both academically and ideologically. "
College Freshman,2,"Unless you are truly poor, don't expect to get significant financial aid. I received some, but am still paying through the nose to go to this school. "
College Freshman,2,"It's Geneva. People party in off-campus student houses and the frat houses, ""going out"" isn't a thing. "
College Freshman,2,"Campo will write you up even if you're in the same room with people who have been drinking. You can get written up even if you're not drinking and in a room with a 21 year old who is. However, this doesn't really matter because getting written up is pretty arbitrary and inconsequential. You get about a million warnings before there is actual negative consequence. Just the functioning of the bureaucracy, giving the officers something to do. "
College Freshman,2,"At SAGA, there is no truly good food, you just have upper mediocre and lower mediocre. Everything is salty. It's truly amazing to go home for the first time and eat actual food again because your body kind of forgets what it tastes like. That said, the people who work in SAGA are awesome, it's not their fault the food blows. "
College Freshman,2,"I am transferring out of here for next year, mainly because they don't have the program I want to be in. Also it just feels like a false start. I am not into the social scene here at all, which is very much alcoholic douche bag frat style partying. Sure, there is SOME diversity, but most people who go here are spoiled rich Vineyard Vines white kids who love athletics and drinking. Definitely not the worst school in the world, but nowhere close to the best, even in terms of rural liberal arts colleges. "
College Freshman,2,"I can't speak for everyone, but I have not had a great experience here. If you want to pay a lot of money to play excellent sports and not have too focus too much on academics, and you don't mind being in the middle of nowhere, come to HWS. "
College Freshman,2,"Unless you're taking all science and math, don't expect to be challenged at this school, especially as an underclassman. Academics is just not the priority of most of the cohort here. I would hate to be a professor at this school, because most professors I have encountered are definitely qualified and competent, and many of the students they deal with are idiots, so the material they (the professors) are passionate about can't be delved into to its greatest extent. Overall, meh. "
College Sophomore,2,"visible, and present it has the cocaine reputation for a reason"
College Freshman,2,"Geneva is ok there is some tension between the locals and the students. But it is a really small town.
"
College Freshman,2,"Geneva weather is impossible to predict. It can be windy, rainy, sunny, and snowing all in the same day."
College Freshman,2,"All they do is throw parties, not many people join them"
College Sophomore,2,"HWS is comprised of a variety of races, religions, and economic backgrounds. However, that is not to say that HWS should be dubbed ""diverse."" Although HWS displays some diversity on charts and graphs on their website, once you step foot on campus the numbers seem non existent. A blur on the radar if you will. Naturally, this type of ratio creates some kind of tension-both racially and in matters of privilege, but in the end we all are going to experience some form of racial tension so we might as well endure and conquer it now."
College Sophomore,2,There are a lot of rules that have almost no explanation as well as severe punishments for breaking the smallest of rules
College Junior,2,"The frats are the basic location for people who got out on weekends and don't head downtown. You can count on there being a party at one of them very weekend night. They don't dominate the social scene or demand attention like they do at other schools, so whether you want that in a school or not is up to you. Basically they're there if you want them, and if not, you don't really care, but most people end up at them for a night out at some point."
College Freshman,2,"The administration, especially Dean Streeter, who is a massive prude, is tough on first year students who commit small infractions like possession of alcohol etc. They like to put on a show here, but it's almost impossible to get kicked out. I knew a kid who got caught with 4 ounces of weed in his room as well as a scale and he didn't get kicked out. You can virtually get an unlimited amount of possession charges and never come close to social probation, much less expulsion."
College Student,2,"There really isn't too much diversity here on campus.
They have made huge efforts, but I find that the school itself is pretty split with who hangs out with who, etc, which tends to mostly lie on socioeconomic and racial lines. People are accepting, definitely. But not necessarily willing to step out of their shells."
College Student,2,"It's pretty strict. But at the same time, it needs to be to ensure the safety of the students. Basically, just don't act stupid in public, and don't go out of control on the streets and you'll be fine.
But the consequences of acting out while under te influence and making it known to the world how drunk you are, etc, is generally not good."
College Sophomore,2,"One of the least diverse places I've ever seen in my life(regarding race, ethnicity, economic background, political beliefs and religion)."
College Sophomore,2,"Campo Is Ridiculous – Even if you're in the right lot they have a tendency to ticket you and not inform you that the sign has changed. Which leads to the hassle of having to go down and have them void the ticket. Not a lot of parking either, so you have to park pretty far from your dorm and in the winter it stinks."
College Sophomore,2,"Some Tension – The local people of Geneva have mixed feeling about the school.  Many of the students come from quite wealthy families in contrast to the mainly lower middle class families of Geneva.  To say there is a social gap between those attending (and most of those working or having to do with the colleges) the colleges and the town is an understatement.  The colleges have many different programs that engage students in community service and help to unite the two communities.  HWS is actively involved in giving back to Geneva and making it a better place.  Whether or not some of these ideas and services are welcomed by the townspeople is a different story.

There are vineyards and some good local restaurants in Geneva.  The Waterloo Outlet Mall is a short drive from campus in neighboring Waterloo. Shopping in downtown Geneva is minimal."
College Freshman,2,"Its There. Snowbart and WIlliam Sniff. If you want a drug you can get it. you just have to know where to go. Its common to see people drinking and smoking weed. However, harder drugs like coke are present. Certain frats and sometimes bathrooms can be places where you can expect to find coke. There are many sub free clubs and housing though and if you want you can avoid all of the drinking and drug use easily."
College Freshman,2,"American Food – If you want American food, you have a few options. Anything else isnt great. Mac's phillycheesesteaks is great though."
College Freshman,2,"The lax team tends to be the focus, but they struggle to compete division 1."
College Freshman,2,"I'm Transferring Next Fall – If you like to party from Thursday to Sunday and work your butt off from Monday to Thursday afternoon, HWS is the place for you. Sadly, the few who don't like to party are entirely stranded. Other than lectures, there's not a lot going on on campus, and Geneva is a fairly impoverished area so other than a Wegman's (that only students shop at), there's nothing to do but watch a movie. The academics and curriculum are incredible, but also very downplayed by Admissions. Look up the 8 goals, it's the only reason I picked the school last fall."
College Freshman,2,"Definetely Room for Improvement – Mostly white students, though a significant amount of Asians and African American students. Kind of diverse in class, many wealthier coming from private schools. Financial aid has allowed for lesser wealthy students. Not very diverse in sexual orientation."
Junior,1,"The College is pretty misleading. Honestly became a student here two years ago and I was really excited. Slowly I saw how stingy the Residential housing office was when they would charge nominal fees. For example I was charged $150 for leaving my dorm 15 minutes later than expected. Or I broke an exit sign once and for the rest of the year campus safety would come into my room at 6 am on Sundays to make sure I hadn't broken another and would try to pin other broken exit signs on me. Furthermore, HWS advertises how nice it is to live off campus but its honestly impossible because they charge 7,000 dollars per semester to live in residential housing so they have an incentive to make it hard to live off campus because they want the housing revenue."
College Freshman,1,This school is not diverse at all.
College Senior,1,"Hobart College is a beautiful place, the students are friendly and professors knowledgeable. Never the less, the administration at the college makes the entire experience extremely terrible and will forever leave me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Never did I imagine a institution of higher learning could act with such an attitude, belittle students so much, or play favorites as much as they do. Don't get me wrong, I am a highly successful student here, I have been on the Deans list every semester- it is the outside of the classroom life which is despicable. Every year it has become worse and worse, and I would not recommend Hobart and William Smith to anyone. Administration does not even begin to understand how to ensure a quality of student life and the social life here is dead. Any parties that students try to throw are shut down by campus police in minutes and on any given night there are groups of hundreds of kids squatting around main street looking for a glimpse of social life."
College Sophomore,1,"In a lot of schools you don't have to know a specific person to get into a party, you just show up with a couple of dollars for the door if anything. This is not the case at HWS. Granted the social scene is particularly bad this year following the NY Times article/ Title IX offenses, but my friends and I pretty much went to 3 parties all semester (and we tried to go out every weekend). If you don't know someone at the frats/ sports houses you're pretty much doomed to drinking in your room with a couple friends. The frats, even when you can get in, pretty much suck. They're stingy on beer, play bad music, and are all stereotypical ""bro"" types. The sports houses are easier to get into, but the parties are sloppy and never any fun. There are off campus parties but as an underclassmen it's hard to find them/ get in. Granted I'm not a huge going out person, but it's definitely strange for a sophomore to be able to count the number of fun nights she's had at college on one hand."
College Sophomore,1,SO COLD!!! But when it's warm its fun to go down and swim at the lake
College Sophomore,1,Always cold. Winter is brutal.
College Freshman,1,"As a New York City girl, I find Geneva pretty stifling. Not a lot going on at all. "
College Sophomore,1,"Geneva weather doesn't make sense, it can be 60 degrees and sunny and then snowing with brutal winds in the same day. Generally expect to say goodbye to the sun in October and not expect to see it again till may. And the wind... No one can prepare you for the icy winds off the lake."
College Freshman,1,"Saga food is literally the worst food ever. Sodexo, the company who runs the dinning hall, is only worried about making as much money as possible and don't give two hoots about food quality. The gold plan, as well as any other meal plan, is over priced and not worth it. Also, their is no proof, but students say that Sodexo puts laxatives in their food to prevent a potential food poisoning crisis. They may or may not practice this, but the food certainly makes for explosive bowel movements within an hour of eating."
College Sophomore,1,"ResEd, the office that handles Campus housing is a disaster. This place is a train wreck. If they find four walls(doesn't matter where) they will try to put a bed in there. And their ""fire safety code"" is the worst. They think everything will catch fire. I do have to agree that there are some great buildings and houses that have been maintained very well. But as a whole, I would give a F to housing just because of ResEd."
College Freshman,1,THe food at Saga is not great. Food is prepared with laxatives so you will have to s*** your brains out afterwards.
College Freshman,1,"The town is very small, if you live in a big city it is very hard to adapt. They are few places to eat. There are few places to drink. THere are few places to do almost anything."
College Freshman,1,"There is hardly any. I you plan on attending, I would advise you to bring a car if you want to go long distances. The transportation that is offered is unreliable and has weird times."
College Sophomore,1,"Freshmen Housing – Co-ed freshmen housing is horrible. There is a lot of screaming and you can always smell stale beer and pot. If you are a girl, I would recommend all-girls housing. It is quieter and cleaner. It makes no difference in making friends and dating. All boys housing is no better than co-ed freshmen housing."
College Sophomore,1,"Hubbs Health Center – They are not helpful at all. The health center has wierd hours that do not fit in with the students schedules. It is also very difficult to make an appointment and to hear back from the staff if you have a test. If you need immediate attention, you are better off going to the emergency room. With that said, almost all services are covered by the mandatory school insurance. This keeps costs a lot lower than other colleges."
College Freshman,1,"not much at all.
mostly white, upper middle class, private or prep school students, there are several clubs like south asian culture club, Caribbean association, jewish house and club, etc. 

I was shocked to find so little diversity when I moved in."
College Freshman,1,"Not the School for Me – They over admitted my class, so when I arrived on campus, I was stuck in a forced triple for most of my first semester.  I was shocked at the lack of diversity at the school. We have maybe 10 Muslims on campus. Really small town around- wegmans and walmart are the only big things in town. Not much to do in town at all. A few nice food places- pizza, coldstone, local diners but no TGIF, ponderosa, ethnic cuisine, or cultural activities except the movie theater and Smith opera house. The smith is a gorgeous building, cheap movie tickets when they play films, and many free events to HWS students.

The administration and residence education can be difficult to deal with, although are accessible to make meetings with.  The Health center is awful at drawing blood, and not the most reliable.

there are a lot of upper class students, and it can feel awlkward if you don't look like everyone else. Rowing, sailing and football are the big sports here. 

 The academics are great. The teachers are dedicated and very. knowledgeable.  Being in small classes give you access to the professor, you can actually ask questions in class, and its small so you can walk around campus easily. Waterloo outlets are nearby, but hard to get to except by car. 

It feels like an extension of high school for me. I need bigger school with more diversity and a bigger city."

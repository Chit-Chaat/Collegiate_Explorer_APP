Alum,5,"When I went to Austin College, they didn't have an online community but as an alum I can tell you that they've really done a good job of responding to the digital demands of modern media."
Alum,5,Amazing school with incredible instructors. The Jan Term program is especially outstanding and provided me with opportunities to see the world without having to leave school for a traditional semester.
Alum,5,"I don't recall taking any classes online. However, I believe that if I did, it would have been just as academically challenging and rewarding."
Alum,5,"The opportunities are endless at Austin College (AC). It's easy to get involved with many different aspects of college life: student organizations, Greek life, athletics, community service -- you name it. The professors care about their students. The liberal arts education has both broad and depth, allowing you to deeply learn in one or two (or more) majors but also take courses you'd otherwise never take at a larger institution (film, music, foreign language, sciences, humanities, etc.). It is a very close knit institution and allows you to be friendly/acquainted with the vast majority of the college students, staff, admin, and professors, but also fosters the opportunity to have deep, lifelong friendships. I am very grateful to have attended AC and proud to call it my alma mater."
Alum,5,"Austin College is a special place. It has great professors who care about the students and actually teach the classes - there are no TAs. The town is small and the entertainment options are limited, but all the more reason to get creative, enjoy friendships and social activities with other students on and off campus. Dorms are old and food is OK, but that is part of college life. Most importantly it is a close knit, caring community, where you learn critical thinking and communication skills and can make life long friends."
Alum,5,Not applicable. I did not take online classes but could not leave this blank as the submission kept being rejected by the app
Alum,5,Great! The basic skills and take-a-ways from Austin College's liberal arts education still come through.
Alum,5,"Austin College is the reason I am where I am today. There is no other institution that prepares a student for the realities of life: that there is no homogenous background, opinion, or thought-process across all people. In work, life, and civic duty, my liberal arts education and experience as a student-athlete at  Austin College has prepared me for life."
Alum,5,Professors used all of the online materials available to them at the time. None of my classes were taught online.
Alum,5,"AC is where I found my family and my passion. Yes, it's very small. But I made so many deep relationships from sharing the same experiences with a small network of people which I felt was very rewarding."
Alum,5,"Attending Austin College was life changing for me. I made life long friendships with my peers and professors, and was able to experience things I know I never would have had the opportunities to do had I attended college anywhere else. From JanTerms, to discovering exoplanets and researching best practices for observation astronomy, to hosting star parties and sharing with my peers the marvels of our night sky. I also had the opportunity to travel with funding from gracious donors for three weeks to Tanzania for a GO Fellowship where I also had once in a life time experiences and met some of the most amazing people on this planet. But perhaps, most importantly Austin College provided me with a skill set and confidence that have taken places in life I did not know were even options when I started off my freshman year at AC. I owe everything to this school and the people it harbors and choosing to attend Austin College has by far the best decision I have ever made."
Alum,5,"Austin College was truly a fantastic place to receive an education. The faculty and staff really get to know who you are, and treat you like a member of the community."
Alum,5,"I did not every take online courses at Austin College. Before COVID, Austin College was entirely in-person classes."
Freshman,5,I like how welcoming the school is! The staff is so enthusiastic about this school and so welcoming. Being a Roo is like having a whole new family!
Sophomore,5,I liked our online classroom. Teachers hosted class in the normal or an adjusted time slot and then uploaded videos on Moodle so we can rewatch them. Tests were opened booked and the questions were fair. Teachers were quite understanding of circumstances and did what they could.
Niche User,5,My overall experience was good. I really like the way in which students are seen as important members inside the campus.
Niche User,5,My overall experience was good. I really like the way in which students are seen as important members inside the campus.
Sophomore,5,"I like that the professor to student ratio is a lot lower than most schools. You really get to know your professors which can help if you have any questions on an assignment. Another thing I like is that you get to meet a lot of new friends. I have had a chance to meet plenty of people that have become my friends. I also like the culture that the school has. It is a very prestigious school that challenges you, and I have learned so much ever since I stepped foot in the school. The professors at the school are really good because they have an excellent ability to connect with the students. Overall, Austin College is a very great school and I am so happy that I am there."
Sophomore,5,I’ve been going to Austin College for 2 years now and I think that the time I have spent here has been the best time of my life.
Freshman,5,Austin College has so many opportunities for everyone which provides experiences and adventures. Being a small college it is expected to not have as many opportunities but Austin College gives so much to the students to provide things that even feel impossible.
Niche User,5,"I loved the experience I had at Austin College's preview day. I really enjoyed their beautiful campus. I also loved the fact that they have many clubs and sororities. I also love the XC team, I got to meet almost all of the team members and they were all very welcoming and amazing people. The XC coach trying to recruit me is amazing also. I also love their only graduate program. And that is the teacher program. They get you right into the hands on learning experience with children and I am all for that!"
Sophomore,5,Class sizes from 8 to 28 grants more access to professors and personal connection with classmates. Assignments are fair and challenging. Peer tutoring is offered through many forms and highly encouraged.
Alum,5,"I have heard Austin College described as ""family"", an ""atmosphere"", a place where Professors ""know you and really care about you."" and, a ""an oasis of personalized and customized education in a cookie cutter world"". 

All the descriptors are true but the value of Austin College is the education.  The Liberal Arts education prepares you for the next step, whether a graduate degree, entering a professional program, or starting your own business."
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Austin College! I made life-time friends and still keep in touch with some of my professors. The professors are top notch and teach all of the classes - and they want you to call them by their first names. Some even have events for students at their homes, and many provide personal sponsorship for the various organizations/clubs on campus. I really enjoyed the close-knit community and camaraderie between students, professors, and staff. There are many opportunities to get involved and hold leadership positions, within the college community and beyond. I looked forward to Jan Term every year, and the opportunities to study abroad are excellent, which many of my friends took advantage of. My experiences at Austin College also prepared me for a variety of careers that require analytical, interpersonal, and leadership skills. I would definitely choose Austin College again - my time there truly was one of the best times in my life."
Freshman,5,I can’t wait to be apart this this amazing school. I walked on the campus for the first time last year and I feel in love with it. Anyone who is lucky enough to attend this college is one VERY lucky student.  I will be playing baseball for the Austin College and I can’t tell u how excited I am to call myself a Roo.
Niche User,5,it was a  very unique campus which is one of a kind in both diversity and the academics not forgetting the soccer team is very good.
Alum,5,"A life-changing experience- Austin College had such a welcoming and close tight-knit community that drew me to attending there. Despite its size, it is filled with many amazing and unique opportunities like their JanTerm/MayTerm where you have the chance to study abroad! The professors in all areas are excellent, and the study body is very diverse and open. I got the chance to broaden my knowledge through the interdisciplinary courses and meet people from all over the world. I highly recommend a campus tour as it is how I came to love and go to AC!"
Alum,5,I loved all my time at AC. I made great friendships and connections at the college and across the community. The faculty are incredibly approachable and I don't think I would have had that experience at a bigger school. Career services helped connect me to a fantastic nonprofit organization that I worked at for nearly 3 years which launched me into my career.
Senior,5,"Austin College has been a home away from home for me personally! If you are looking for an excellent Liberal Arts education, Austin College is the right place for you! While I was a student at AC, I had the opportunity to get involved with diversified organizations, took on multiple leadership roles, and executed independent research/studies on the topic of my interest. I have grown to become a strong and capable student with great critical skills that will prepare me for either graduate schools or the professional world."
Alum,5,"Austin College is the opportunity of a lifetime. They are an extremely generous school and the professors are lovely people who help you think for yourself and find your own path in life. The academic experience is intense and satisfying. I learned so much in my time there studying computer science and Latin and made some amazing friends. I run into Austin College Roos everywhere I go in the industry. It's like one big family!

Campus is absolutely beautiful. It's tucked away in a small town and it's very peaceful. I've never been around so many nice people in my life all at once."
Alum,5,The study abroad opportunities are absolutely life changing. The small classes foster academic growth and amazing relationships with the faculty that last far beyond the four years at AC.
Alum,5,"Best 4 years of my life. The education is the unsurpassed and great for getting into graduate schools. You will be challenged in each and every class, you will be rewarded for original thinking, and you will spend 4 years with a world class student body. 
The city of Sherman is strange but offers little distraction to studying. When it’s time to blow off stream Dallas is a short drive away.
Graduated class of 1989"
Alum,5,"I had planned on going to an Ivy League college until I visited the AC campus and changed my mind.  That was the best decision I ever made!  I loved it while I was there, and after going through medical school, residency and beyond, I genuinely feel that I got a better education from Austin College than I could have gotten at any Ivy League school!
I feel that AC has even continued to improve over the years.  5 of my family members have now attended AC, including my 2 sons, and we all feel the same way.  
Best decision of my life!"
Alum,5,"The education I recieved here made such a huge impact. Austin college connected to a nonprofit organization that gave me so many opportunities to excel and learn. Through my education, and the experience they connected me too I have been able to succeed."
Alum,5,AC taught me how to think critically. My minor was Communications/ Sociology but I became a nurse. The only way I made the transition from social science to hard science was my ability to think critically.
Freshman,5,"So far I have loved every aspect of Austin College. The small size, the community, everyone on campus is extremely nice and friendly, the professors are some of the best I have ever experienced. The only thing I would change is the food and the amount of living space."
Junior,5,"My experience at Austin College has been great for me to grow as a person. The environment very much encourages one to work, and the professors are more than willing to help students. Class sizes are not very large. My largest classes have under twenty students in them. One thing I would like to see change is how students can view their grades. It is not an easy process."
Freshman,5,"Everybody at Austin College genuinely seems to care about you. The access to a mentor throughout your college career was something that was unique to me. Having somebody who is there to guide you towards success is an incredible tool. While the college isn't perfect, I believe that it will only get better in the years to come under the current leadership."
Freshman,5,Overall Austin College has one of the most beautiful environments. The dorms are quite small but overall the environment is beautiful and the class sizes are small allowing students to have more hands on work.
Niche User,5,I loved everything about this wonderful school!  The campus is beautiful and a great place to study.
Freshman,5,"I have loved the school since my first tour. The student faculty and staff are so welcoming and are always sure to great you with a warm smile. The professors a re amazing and they definitely know what they are talking about. They have office hours where you can go in with any questions and they will be happy to help. They only thing I would like to see change are the dorms, maybe a little renovations. They are a bit old but they aren't anything you can handle or jazz up."
Alum,5,"Austin College takes academics very seriously and the classes can be very challenging. However, I was able to play football while attending and completed the pre-med prerequisites while majoring in psychology. Even though I was pre-med the whole way through, I decided to go to law school and the rigor of the Austin College classes has prepared me greatly for all the challenges that I have faced."
Sophomore,5,"As an Austin College student, my experience has been nothing short of exciting and educating. The campus is clean and nice. The faculty and staff are extremely helpful. Courses are rigorous and student life is beyond exceptional."
Senior,5,"This is a solid school. I got to change what I was studying quite a bit my freshman year and I'm still able to graduate on time. I know my professors well on a personal level. There are parties and greek life if that's what you're looking for, but there's enough other things planned that you don't need to party to make friends and have fun on the weekends."
Sophomore,5,"I love everything about this school.  If you prefer a small high academic school with small classes and professors that actually know your name and care about you and your future, this is the school for you.  Plus, I am on the basketball team and I have a great coach and team.  We do a lot of group activities and service projects together to help the community.  Being a D3 student athlete allows me to be fully invested in both academics and athletics, as well as have the time to make personal connections with both coaches and professors."
Freshman,5,"This is a great school for college students that take being a college student seriously. It's got sports. It's got parties. Neither of those two things are the main focus at all, but they exist. It's small, cozy, and green. There are squirrels and little study nooks everywhere. People are, for the most part, kind, understanding, and here to learn as much as they can. The classes are small and personal and I have yet to meet a professor here that I didn't like. Living on campus is not at all luxurious for freshmen and sophomores, but it's tight knit and feels like home. The only complaint I have is the food. It's like a half-step up from public school lunch and unless you have money for eating out, you're eating it for breakfast lunch and dinner. Overall, it has its quirks but it's home."
College Senior,5,"A degree from AC goes a long way.  This school is highly renowned and when employers see a degree from Austin College, they know that we have received a top-notch education and work toward a very high standard."
College Sophomore,5,"Athletics and sports are an important part of our school. However, the best part about it is that there exists a balance. Sports such as football and basketball are greatly supported but so are other ""smaller"" sports and clubs. The facilities for all sports are kept up-to-date and the facilities available to non-athletes are also great so that everyone can participate in the physical activities of their choice. School spirit is always displayed at every sport, competition, and club. The students will stand by their fellow classmates no matter what the sport is."
College Freshman,5,"Rigorous workload, faculty and professors try to help as much as they can. The most popular study area is the library and certain spots in the IDEA center."
College Freshman,5,Professors are engaging and want you to succeed and everyone is very welcoming. There is a crap ton of opportunities as far as community service and internships. Most of the students are hardworking probably because the courses are intense.
College Freshman,5,"It is a rigorous workload, but every teacher tries to help every student out. The teachers want their students to succeed, and really encourage us to take advantage of their office hours. The campus is very close-knit like, I recognize almost every face on the campus. I have heard that the career services is very helpful in resume building, interviews, etc. Austin College offers plenty of community service opportunities and internships through the school email. Overall, it is a great community, with rigorous courses."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I loved attending Austin College. The class sizes were small and I was able to have access to all of my professors more than I thought I would. Sherman itself sucks, but campus life was great!"
College Freshman,5,"Depends what you are looking for- if you want parties its the best, if you don't want a party then its the worst. Parties every night here, drug use and alcohol constantly."
College Freshman,5,"I got a whopping scholarship- could've been better since the school is so so expensive- but I am really happy with what I got. 90% of students get some form of scholarship whether need based, merit based, or both"
College Freshman,5,I got a full scholarship here
College Freshman,5,This school provides excellent academics
College Senior,5,"Scholarships are very plentiful, and the school does their best to make sure that most students have scholarships."
College Senior,5,"Dorms are good, people are respectful (and when they aren't, you have a well-trained staff of RAs). Dorms are pretty spacious, have enough space for all your clothes, and can find room for activities. I can't compare the cost to other schools and dorms, but the process is easy and nothing is more than 10 minutes away"
College Senior,5,"Professors are great, and most are open and available to students. Curriculum is varied, but (in my opinion) majors are pretty general and vague. Application and ability to think is important. Registration is aight. Its organized and easy to use. However, I think it would be hard to find a school that has a registration system that all students love. Admin will work with you to get all your requirements and get you to graduate on time. Workload is pretty heavy, but manageable if you can manage your time. Study abroad opportunities abound, and most students study abroad, even if only for a janterm. Library, study rooms, and bedrooms are top places to study."
College Junior,5,"I am a biology major. I don't see it as particularly different from the rest of the school, though I believe we have the most faculty. Most of the biology majors are premed. Recently, they have been trying to integrate leadership components into the curriculum. As far as I can tell this hasn't made much of a change, but they say that the added components aren't meant to be immediately noticed."
Freshman,4,"I took my classes in person, and the teachers were great! The desks were spread out and the class sizes were so small that there were no issues with social distancing."
Senior,4,"I've enjoyed my time there. I was disappointed with the swim team, I was hoping it'd be more ""team-like"" but it ended up being extremely cliquey and I experienced some pretty intense bullying. One downside is that it's a small school, so it's almost like high school all over again with the small social circles and cliques but another upside is that it's a small school, so the professors are more accessible and the academics are absolutely worth it. The food is disappointing, and they trick your parents into thinking it's high quality by saving the good stuff for visitation days lol. We always get excited for visitation days because that means good food that's worth the high price we pay. But overall I'm happy with Austin College and highly recommend it."
Alum,4,A good liberal arts education that allowed for learning about topics that I previously did not think that news interested in. Highly recommend.
Freshman,4,"AC so far has been a good experience for me. AC is known for the academics, professors, and helping students achieve in the classroom in order to achieve in the real world. Athletics are very popular and there are usually a lot of students and professors who come to support. Student life is amazing as well and there are many opportunities to get involved whether it's with Greek Life, volunteering or joining clubs. The only negative thing about AC would be the dorms/resident life. The dorms are in need of some renovation and the process of next year living is very slow and questionable. Other than that, AC is a great college for all."
Sophomore,4,"Austin College is a small liberal arts college. This means you get the opportunity to have a close relationship with your professors. However, due to the campus being small you know everyone. Which at times can become difficult when problems arise. Overall, the school is excellent in academics."
Sophomore,4,"I'm currently a sophomore at Austin College and I have to say the academics and how they prepare you for success is absolutely astonishing. I really liked their small campus and how everything is only a 5-10 min walk away. The professors are very welcoming and there are many opportunities to do stuff like research and CSOC. The Student Life is also very involved with many fraternities, clubs, and organizations you can get involved in. However, I have to say that the residence halls are about average, with the ones in Dean Hall being almost poor to average at best. In Dean, there was not much room as compared to the other residence halls and I'm glad I'm not staying there anymore. Also, the food was average as you can only eat for so long until you get sick of it. Overall, Austin College is excellent with only a few problems that it can work to fix or improve upon."
Sophomore,4,I am currently a student-athlete at Austin College and I have enjoyed my time at this school a lot. I met many new people and the professors are always there to help out.  This school really puts emphasis on academics and their importance.
Junior,4,"I have found that, overall,  Austin College has been a great fit for me. The teachers and administration have been very willing to work with me through my issues. The teachers are interested in both the subjects they teach and teaching their students."
Freshman,4,"High in academics, very good mentors, lots of help in many area's if needed.  Some dorms are noisy but comfortable.  Athletics are above average with good competition.  Small school with low teacher to student ratio.  Well kept outside area's with good security, diverse student activities for all students.  Café food good with lots of choices. Good selection of choices in academics with good scheduling. Local area has good shopping and activities and a huge lake nearby with a campus resort."
Freshman,4,"Austin College is a place where you will truly find who want to be in the future. The community is very welcoming and friendly, and the administration here is very helpful and understanding."
Niche User,4,"When I went to visit Austin College for a basketball camp I felt loved and welcomed from the first second on campus. The staff and the students were both really nice. I had a great time visiting and the was the coaching staff interacted with their athletes was amazing to watch. The head coach had a different style of coaching than I have seen in the past. She used positive reinforcement to build her team up. One thing that she said that stuck out to me was when she said ""sugar attracts more flies than salt,"" meaning that if you are uplifting and have good attitudes you become more appealing than some one who is always trashing people or tearing them down."
Junior,4,The one on one interaction the professors love having. The professors really care and are there to help. The advisers are always around to help no matter what.
Sophomore,4,What I love about Austin college is the family like environment that;s created here. We stick together through rough times and good times.
Alum,4,"Austin College offers a great liberal arts experience. If you want to go to a small school where you know your peers and professors, this is a great place for you. Austin College also offers many opportunities for study abroad."
Freshman,4,"There's nothing to do in Sherman. However, the professors here really put effort into their lectures, and the classes are always fun to take. I don't regret coming here."
Sophomore,4,Austin College overall is a very good school academically. They challenge students and encourage them to work hard inside the classroom and out. The facilities at Austin College could be improved. Some of the facilities are not up to date with the current needs of the students.
Niche User,4,"I visit Austin College while on a field trip with my students. The college seems like a real awesome place for a study the is interested in studying aboard. Tuition is pretty expensive, so what would be great is not being force to stay on the campus."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Austin College thus far has been great. Yes, I have had ups and downs but that is apart of being a student in college. One of the greatest things about Austin College is the relationship you can build with your professors. Since Austin College is a small campus with a small student body, it is very easy to talk to teachers and get help whenever you need it. I have developed a good relationship with all of my teachers and many faculty members who are not teachers. The downfalls of Austin College in  my  opinion are minor for the most part. The biggest downfall of Austin College is the tuition. The blessing is that the financial aid office is very willing to help everyone out as much as possible. From and academic and social standpoint, overall I would say that the amount that you are paying for tuition is worth it in the end."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, the school provides an excellent, world focused, and well rounded education for their students. It has a killer pre med program, and all the faculty is wonderful. I would love to see a greater investment in the arts. the art building itself is great, but the music building is in desperate need of an overhaul. The music faculty are extremely intelligent, and deserve a facility that matches the rest of the school."
Freshman,4,The school overall is great and seeing that it is in the top 40 most life changing colleges has been proven in my time here.
College Senior,4,"The classes here are tough, but rewarding.  The students are held to such a high standard by the professors but are also very well supported by them.  Grades are given fairly depending on attendance to class and, of course, class performance.  Professors are very available and facilities like the library, computer labs and study rooms are readily accessible."
College Senior,4,"Frequent student body meetings are had over things like sexual assault and discrimination.  These things are not an issue here because they are made so aware by our staff.  There have been a few cases of accused assault, but this has not been a recurring problem at our school."
College Senior,4,"Greek life is a lot of fun and very involved.  As a member of the Gamma Gamma Gamma fraternity, we participate in various on campus events as well as activities around the community.  These events can include service events, or philanthropy events.  And of course, parties are always a fun part of greek life at AC."
College Senior,4,"Austin College really pushes you to expand your view on the world.  The teachers encourage you to think critically, and your classmates inspire you to see things from a different point of view.  I cannot imagine being at a different school and my experience here has changed my life in so many positive ways."
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life is a big part of our school and has a much better role than just the ""party-throwers"". All Greeks strive to make an impact in the surrounding community and find ways to improve life on campus. They take part in a lot of community service. There is also a very good relationship between greeks and non-greeks where everyone gets along and can work together."
College Sophomore,4,The rules on drugs and alcohol are quite strict. I believe students know better.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are very passionate about the courses they teach which is very encouraging because it makes you curious about their interest which gets you more involved. The small class sizes allows you to be heard and engaged in the topics discussed.
College Sophomore,4,"The quality of the alumni network is great, there's a student career service dedicated to helping students find internships, their career path and their goals in life."
College Sophomore,4,"The biggest thing that stands out about my school is the different point or views and opinions. It encourages one to try to be a liberal educated person as well as entertain new ideas. Not necessarily to make it a belief, its simply to understand."
College Junior,4,I am having a great time experiencing college in Austin College; the professors are easy-going and willing to help and I have made pretty amazing friends through clubs and other people.
College Junior,4,The school has engaging professors and interesting students
College Sophomore,4,"My school is very small and extremely competitive. Austin college is known for their pre-med program and it is extremely difficult. Class sizes are very smal, campus is really small. I wish there was a little bit more people and they lack in communicating events or important dates. Otherwise the people here are great and it's a tough school but I feel like I'm getting an outstanding education."
College Freshman,4,Cheaper than on campus housing.
College Freshman,4,Great parties held pretty frequently- especially first semester of school. It dies down second semester and becomes closed to members of sororities and fraternities.
College Freshman,4,Around Austin College you can find a lot of places that give you discounts toward meals. Cheddars I am not sure if they give a discount but it is fairly cheap to eat there especially if you are dining for one or two.
College Freshman,4,Most nights there is something going on. Whether it is a casual get together or a full on party. Wednesday through Saturday nights are the big nights I guess but like I said there is always something going on some where around campus. I believe the party scene helps since the curriculum is so demanding at times it is nice to blow of some steam.
College Senior,4,"From freshman to senior year, the quality and variety has greatly improved. The cafeteria is the main option, but there is also the pub."
College Senior,4,"Off campus housing is reserved for seniors. As otherclassmen, you can live in school provided housing that isn't dorm-style living. You can find a place to live without too much problem, and the school makes the housing process easy."
College Senior,4,"At AC, you don't have to get into a program. If you can take the classes and get the major, you can get the major. There are no barriers to different majors. Some classes are difficult, and the liberal arts part makes you think in ways you aren't used to. No, we don't have an abnormal admission process."
College Senior,4,"The school doesn't have a large alumni network, but career services will do their utmost to help you succeed. They provide opportunities, feedback, practice interviews, and more. They also don't discriminate based on grades or potential to succeed."
College Senior,4,"Campus crime is pretty low. Some people's cars get broken into, but for the most part, it isn't a huge problem. Campus feels very safe, and I've walked through the town to my off-campus housing at all hours of the day and night. The school has also made a big push against sexual assault and harassment in recent years, but I've only rarely heard about sexual problems."
College Senior,4,"We have great facilities that are used by varsity teams, but are also available and easily accessible to all students. The weight room provides a lot of diverse types of stations."
College Senior,4,"There are a lot of chains in Sherman, which have cropped up in the new mall. However, there are a lot of hole-in-the-wall restaurants in and around Sherman. To find them, I suggest talking to upper class men."
College Junior,4,"If a student isn't on a sports team, they're probably not going to be at any of the sports games. Athletic facilities include an indoor pool, two gymnasiums, one workout center, and tennis ball courts locked by card access (which must be gotten from the tennis coach). There are a few small sports groups that play together weekly- rugby, soccer, ultimate frisbee (i believe the lacrosse group all graduated, or disbanded, or something)"
College Junior,4,"The campus has a decent number of exchange students, but even so, the school is mostly white. As far as I know the majority of the school is straight, but has nothing in particular against anyone who isn't. The ethnic minorities seem to mingly freely and independently with the white majority, with a few exceptions. There are Republican and Democrat- centered clubs (both pretty young). There are also several church groups, one specifically catholic, the rest not specified.The school is officially Presbyterian, but welcomes all faiths. There is an asian student's association, a black expressions club, an indian dance team, a country dance club, etc."
College Junior,4,"The workload is somewhat heavy though you can find a lot of advice from teachers and other students as to which classes will be the hardest and which should not be taken together. I am in the biology department, which is more or less the largest department in the school. Each professor will take two or three students for research during each semester, including summer (though that is somewhat more selective). There are a few jobs that biology students can find, mostly having to do with lab work. Most bio students also take a good deal of chemistry, so some of them end up working as chemistry TAs."
College Freshman,4,The classes are definitely hard and challenging but still entirely manageable and reasonable.
College Freshman,4,"The dorms available for freshmen are definitely not the most luxurious, but they are pretty okay. They were all built in the 60's or 70's and have been renovated so there's little quirks. I can hear conversations from elsewhere in the dorm through the power outlet by my bed. The elevator in Clyce dorm is the second oldest one in Texas. 

Roommates are based on the Myers-Briggs personality types unless you specifically request a roommate, and for the most part this works out. There is, however, enough dorm housing for all freshmen (it's required) which is pretty nice."
College Freshman,4,"The college works pretty hard to get students internships and job placement. I'm definitely planning on doing an internship, and the teacher program especially gets students directly in classrooms as observers and actual teachers."
College Junior,4,"There are some loose rules, but they are only enforced when really necessary. I know of people and fraternities that have been thrown off campus, but otherwise there are many points at which security is extremely relaxed, perhaps on purpose. RAs are responsible for most of the discipline, and will generally only be really harsh if you are bothering someone or if half of your dorm has noticed it. While people can be very brittle and serious disagreements should be expected and prepared for, the administration is mostly invisible. Teachers are very supportive of students and will often ask about them or offer advice if there is cause for concern. However they generally expect the student to take the initiative in actually doing anything."
College Freshman,4,Lots of people form different countries and different ethnicities. Mostly Christians but religion is not at all pushed here.
College Junior,4,"What would be without homes? If you're not living under a roof, I don't envy you! At this college, rooms are but a pathway to enlightenment and fulfillment. Rest in peace under a nice soft roof. I love my roof and you'll love yours. Great!"
College Junior,4,"The off-campus housing will change your entire outlook on life. If you think you've experienced freedom outside of college, think again! This place has all sorts of cool houses for all kinds of cool cats. Who knows what sorts of kooky adventures you'll get into when you take your first steps off the college green? You can barely smell the vomit!"
College Junior,4,"Our program encourages internships and reasonable workloads. The curricula make the student body go nuts. If you've ever been academically inclined, you'll find a nice comfy spot here in this college. Wow!"
College Junior,4,"If you ever wanted to be a marine biologist  or an astronaut or anything like that, you'll be very excited to learn that the sky's the limit at this school. Our majors make all the other colleges' majors look like minors. It's a truly mad, mad, mad, mad major program."
College Junior,4,"If you are a nice sub and love discipline, you may have to pick another college. This place isn't a Nazi camp like some ""universities."" In fact, it's an epicenter of anarcho-punk political agitation. However, don't take this to mean that anything goes or that the campus police don't do their jobs. They are the heroic saviors of the student body."
College Junior,4,"My school is wonderful. I wouldn't trade my experiences there for anything. Great staff, great student, and an excellent sense of academic propriety."
College Junior,4,"The financial aid people are really nice, the only hassle is getting them a tax transcript now when before it wasn't always required."
College Junior,4,"It's not hard to get into AC, but once you are in it is difficult."
College Sophomore,4,"Austin College takes most things pretty easily, however if you are caught you are responsible for the consequences."
Sophomore,2,Austin college has been an eye opener for me and I have seen how tings can change as fast as the flip of a light switch. I have had people fall out of my life since I've started going to school all because of the social groups they choose to be around but in the end the academic side of the school is pretty good.
College Junior,2,I have only heard bad things about some of the Greek fraternities/sororities from friends. I have only associated Greek Life with parties and occasional community service.
College Freshman,2,"If you leave the door open to your room things will get stolen. Calling campus PD late at night if something is going on is worthless. I had a group of guys jump out at me and chase me and they told me to relax because it was just some kids ""fooling around"". Sherman is definitely sketchy at night and the campus can be at night too. Campus PD rarely gets involved in any claims. Sexual assault is fairly common but rarely reported, and usually involves alcohol or drugs. Campus health center is worthless crap. The nurse is never there, clinics with the doctor are very consistently cancelled. When the nurse is there she tells you things that are medically incorrect. Clinics in the surrounding area are equally as unhelpful- you likely need to drive 45 min to an hour to the mckinney area to get reliable healthcare. Campus would probably be safer if less people were intoxicated all the time."
College Freshman,2,"I do not feel as if I have gotten my money's worth on the food in the cafeteria. They will reuse materials at times and call it something else, and the food will be overly salty or just nasty in general. Sometimes I find something good like pasta or a soup but most of the time, I just eat the food because I have to not because I want to."
College Freshman,2,AC NEEDS to renovate their dorms. ALL of them.
College Freshman,2,"People here all know each other, so if you slept with you-know-who, it's extremely likely the entire campus will find out the next day."
College Freshman,2,Who would want to live in Sherman?
College Junior,2,"Very small town with little to do. There are nearby grocery stores, one bar, and several parks. Most of the restaurants are chains. You will go to Dallas (1 hour drive one-way) for anything really exciting (I personally don't bother)."
College Freshman,2,I only got a scholarship and wasn't even able to get any aid based on my family income. We have a large family (six people) so my parents are actually thinking of me transferring even with the biggest scholarship they have because it is not much aid.
College Freshman,2,The nurse in the office is very distasteful and seems more judgmental than to help the students. Also if there is a personal conflict the administration doesn't seem to take it very seriously at all.
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot of internships, only a few in the hospital. gotta get your own way out if you want to get ahead. Also the workload is pretty intense for just a few number of classes that you are taking. The library is really tiny for the school and is usually really packed during finals."
College Freshman,2,"Most people don't care how they look for class. If you are dressing up for class then something is definitely wrong. Girls are basic, mostly leggings and shirts and guys are too. Guys don't look very good for the most part and not very good selection."
College Freshman,2,"The course variety is not very good and often the classes are filled before the freshman even get a chance to register. The worst part is that if you can't get into a required class you are held back a year from progressing forward in your degree plan. For example if you can't get into a bio115 class, you can't take chem 111 or any other chem or bio course for the rest of the year and you are held back until you complete that bio115 class"
College Freshman,2,The campus only cares about how the school is viewed now how the students actually feel or anything to benefit the students
College Freshman,2,The school is rated in division three so no one cares.
College Freshman,2,The campus is small. My dorm is next to all the abandoned buildings like the abandoned moody science center so it is hard to get to places on time. Also the dorms are quite old and have not been renovated. The only thing nice is the Idea Center and the Wright Campus center
College Freshman,2,"The campus is pretty cut off from Sherman, and if you don't have a car you're pretty much absolutely stuck at AC."
College Freshman,2,"Sherman isn't as bad as it chalked up to me but its not by any means nice. Sherman is mostly low income, and the neighborhood around the college has some pretty shabby houses. They have a lot of discount bargain stores, and fast food chains. Shermanites tolerate AC students but don't like them. I would say this is mostly because AC students are VERY rude to Shermanites. Not sure there would even be a Sherman without the college though. Definetly don't want to be walking around at night in sherman. Its not completely desolate though. About 10-15 minutes away there are a lot of shops, jc pennys, claires, target, walmart, office max, pet mart, dress barn. You have to have a car to get there but if you need something you can find it. 

I would say my biggest complaint is not having a natural foods store like whole foods."
College Freshman,2,"Honestly I think they aren't strict enough at this school. People come in completely plastered and walk straight past the office and they never do anything about it. People next door screaming at 4 am? Too bad. You aren't gonna be getting any sleep. People have dogs in the rooms. People have pot in the rooms. There are parties every night with minors attending. We have bad visitation hours but they aren't enforced. Rooms are rarely checked, maybe once a semester, so you can get away with having a lot of stuff your not supposed to have and no one ever knowing. If you tell the administration about a problem they usually say, thats just how college kids are, they want to party. Most of the professors would prefer that you are in class and they will notice if you aren't for the most part but I haven't met one who said attendance was mandatory. I can't really speak to parking. There is always parking on campus, so if your getting a ticket you must be really stupid because you can park pretty much anywhere. I will say that academic integrity violations seem to be taken pretty seriously here. Students are frequently getting reported for plagiarism."
College Junior,2,"I understand we are a small school, but we could use a little more parking spots closer to the WCC.. what's the point of building it but not having enough parking to support it.."
College Junior,2,"There are never enough dance parties, people socialize way too much"
College Junior,2,"The workload is terrible, but the opportunities that we get to do CSOCs for Jan Term is awesome!"
College Sophomore,2,Austin College is not known for sports
College Sophomore,2,"The only transportation available at Austin College is the Roo Route, basically a shuttle bus. The shuttle bus can only take students to public locations and is only available from 4 to midnight. Because the campus is in a small town, it makes having your own car almost a necessity since places are not walking distance and the dissatisfaction students have with the Roo Route."
College Freshman,2,The local atmosphere is very limited and there are not many activities off campus.
College Freshman,2,The fan support is very minimal.
College Sophomore,2,We have a library that functions only as a study area- it has no fiction section. We have a fitness pavilion and two gyms. There is nothing even remotely resembling a recreation center.
College Sophomore,2,"The only real social scene is centered around the Greek groups. They throw house parties all the time, and that's about it. You never hear anything from the administration except when the president or someone comes to speak at an event. The only real activities are hosted by CAB, and they're mostly a joke."
College Sophomore,2,"There's an organic market just down the street. Other than that and the cafeteria there are no vegetarian or anything options. The cafeteria food is unpopular, and the only open at night are fast food and the 7-11. You are basically trapped an hour away from anything interesting."
College Sophomore,2,Minorities come please! I need more culture here
College Freshman,2,Since Austin College is a private school the tuition is very expensive. The school does give a grant to each student. At least 95% of the students are on financial aid.
College Freshman,2,Since this is a small school the parking lots are small and they fill up pretty quickly. There is one main parking lot that is closest to everything a person might need but unless you're extremely earlier you won't find a spot.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The local atmosphere really is not that great at all. If you want entertainment beyond going to the theater, you drive to Dallas, Allen, or McKinney. Or, you see what's happening on campus. Thank God for campus activities."
College Junior,2,"Sherman is pretty much dead. All the stores downtown close by 5-530. We do have some chains that are open longer. Those are located relatively close and the bus goes to all of them. Austin College is, however, very very close to Dallas, so many students will take a weekend trip down there about once a semester. Chaktaw(Casino) is also fairly close on our northern side. If you want to live in a town or city in which something unrelated to the college is always happening, AC might not be for you."
College Junior,2,"The computers are still running XP. They are all linked together, which is nice and all, but..... XP's was released 10 years ago, and the tech they use is just as old! additionally, about once or twice a semester, the Wi-Fi is completely dead for about 3-4 days(occasionally as long as a week). In fairness, the Internet speed is VERY good(generally speaking) when it is working, and the IT department gives out free Ethernet cables."
College Junior,2,"Housing isn't great, especially for freshmen and sophomores. If you go the language track and live in the Jordan Language House however, it's fairly good. Senior Cottages are nice, but pricey, and the school tries HARD to force Seniors into them."
College Junior,2,"The school provides a bus system that students can call up if needed. However, it runs at limited times and is known to strand students in Sherman. You're best bet is to have your own car or reliable friends with one."
College Junior,2,"Be Creative About It – Sherman does not hand you entertainment opportunities, you are more or less left to your own devices. With that said I am never bored.  There is plenty of fun to be made here you may just have to find it in different places than a culturally rich city.  But if you want that, Dallas is not too far!"
College Junior,2,"Not Much Going on – There isn't much to do in Sherman. It's small and pretty boring. There is limited restaurants, shopping, and attractions. This leaves many students with the option of either going back home or partying on weekends."
College Junior,2,"It Could Be Better. Meal plans are too expensive for what you're paying for. The dining hall food isn't the best, and it gets old after a couple weeks into the semester. The Pouch Club is the only late night option which isn't fantastic either and unhealthy."
Recent Alumnus,2,"REALLY Small-School – I never experienced much involvement with athletics.... I think I went to a total of 2 football games, and those were both at homecoming.  And I watched a volleyball and/or basketball match here or there, but only for extra spirit points during the homecoming competitions that our sorority was competing in. School spirit with athletics, at least in my experience, was a minimum -- not because we don't like AC, but because it was just never really on our radar.  Our football team wasn't super great, either...I think that's just what happens when you go to a small private liberal arts college in Sherman, TX."
College Senior,2,"All of the dorms are old and disgusting, as well as, way more expensive than they are worth. The best thing to happen to Austin College are the Flats on Brockett apartments that were recently built. They are the best value available. The worst thing about the dorms are the bathrooms."
College Junior,2,Bring a car if you can. There is a bus called the ROO route thhat runs to places around town for students free.
College Sophomore,2,"Austin College requires you to live in on-campus housing (which is REALLY expensive compared to just about every other school I looked at) until your senior year. You are also required to have an outrageously priced meal plan as long as you live in any on campus housing that does not have a full kitchen, which is basically all of the dorm halls."
College Junior,2,"It Could Be a Lot Better, but It Could Be a Lot Worse – The only campus sponsered transportation is the Roo Route which is not very reliable from what I've heard. You have the driver's cell phone number to call them, but I've heard of my friends being stranded over at Target for an hour waiting on the Roo Route to come get them. Otherwise the Roo Route goes and makes rounds every night, and longer on the weekends. Otherwise, there's the city bus system and the Greyhound for longer trips. You're probably going to want to have a car on campus."
College Junior,2,"We're Definitely Not a Sports School – We are not a big sports school. There are varsity teams for those who are interested, but not many people attend the events. School spirit isn't too big in terms of sports, but I feel like everyone respects the school in terms of academics. Athletic facilities are just the right size for the kind of sports teams we have. However, I'm not a big sports fan so I may not be seeing the whole picture in terms of how the sport teams are doing with their facilities."
College Senior,2,"Greek Life – This exclusive, bull**** group of people monopolizes the party scene, kick GDI's (and others) out of their parties, and in general bring down both the GPA and the generally decent atmosphere at AC. As a member of Greek Life (shhhh), I would proudly support its demise."
College Junior,2,"You Think Premed Students Are Naturally Smart? Yeah, right. If you see someone who claims they are premed out partying every school night, it's because they have a good supply of vyvanse. No joke. The students who don't take ADHD prescription drugs are the ones that have absolutely no social life. Pre-med is extremely tough and takes away from all aspects of your social life. So, either give in and study all day long, or take some adderall and have fun in college. OR drop being premed, like 3/4 of the students do, and major in something 'easier' And if you have to take drugs for that, you are just plain lazy."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Mostly Fast-Food – Most of the off-campus dining is fast-food. Where there are a few chain sit-down restaurants, it's nothing spectacular, like Cheddar's or Chile's. There are a few local restaurants that I hear are very nice, but you have to know where they are to be able to find them."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Sherman Is a Questionable Town – While campus is safe, and there is a lot of on-campus housing, the off-campus housing around Austin College itself is often questionable. While there are some nice places and rent isn't bad, a lot of the houses are in poor condition or are in bad neighborhoods. If you want a nice place to live, you have to look on the other side of Sherman."
College Senior,2,"Computers available in the library are starting to show their age.  I think the computers in the Kekk lab are nice, but I'm not positive; I've never used them.  Wireless and internet networking is horrible, and has always been horrible.  Download speeds rarely every exceed a full gigabyte.  It is down, or so slow it is useless at least once a week.  Printing is generally convenient.  There are stations in each dorm, the library and the wcc.  Having printing stations in class buildings would make it that much better.  It isn't a requirement to have a personal computer/printer, but it is nice to have."
College Senior,2,Football Is Painful – The football team went 0-10 last season.  'Nuff said.  Volleyball is consistently competitive and fun to watch.
College Senior,2,"The Student Center Could Be More Student Friendly – Though I'm never bored at Austin College that is primarily to do with my involvement with extracurricular activities and friendships. The campus center at AC doesn't seem to cater to the social desires of students. Though the Pouch Club has pool and ping pong, i think more students would spend time on campus if there were more fun things to do."
College Sophomore,2,if you are really messed up walking back to your dorms they will help you but if you park in the wrong spot for 15 seconds they will give you a 200 dollar fine
College Sophomore,2,Boring and Depressing – the weather is always the same. dull. no rain no sun no nothing. whenever it does rain the campus turns into a swamp but thats only a few times a year
College Sophomore,2,"UGLY GIRLS, but 90 Plus Percent Smoke Weed – Out of a total of 1300 students there are, liberally speaking, five women that are attractive. Everyone at the school is miserable with everything there except for the fact that it is a stoner school. everyone smokes and everyone knows it. you can go up to 9 out of every 10 students and they will either smoke heavily or at least seldomly. there is a set party every night of the week, but the parties usually revolve around greek life which is fun but only consists of about 15-20 people at a good party. not worth the 45k a year that it is to go here"
College Junior,2,Free but Limited – The TAPS service provides a bus for Austin college students but it only comes from 4:00pm-12:00am. It comes by once every hour and goes only to a few places.
College Junior,2,"The Housing Is Not the Best – The dorms are fairly awful; however the RA's are usually pretty awesome and the campus does a lot to try to make it better. Other on-campus housing is way better, especially the new Flats. But, the Flats are given priority to Juniors and they have very little. They are the best option financially as well because your utilities are covered and you don't need a meal plan."
College Junior,2,"Food is awful, the hours are awful,  the variety is nonexistent. I use my hopper dollars for coffee and smoothies"
College Junior,2,"No One Cares – I'm sure the athletes must have their own scene and groupies here, but I never see them. The games have extremely low attendance. I've only been to one and it was to get a free t-shirt."
Senior,1,"The college is in surviving mode. They cut corners everywhere. The more they do that, the earlier they would have to close."
Freshman,1,"I went to Austin College my first year of college and it was the worst decision I’ve ever made. Greek life is a complete joke, The food is terrible, Housing is Horrendous, And the teachers are so liberal that you can not even express a difference in opinion."
Sophomore,1,"When I made the decision to come to Austin College I was so excited and ready to learn. Soon after arriving and attending classes my opinion changed. The professor to student ratio is really nice, but if you are not a teachers pet or a ""favorite"" you will not get much out the the professors. While I did meet my best friends through the school, the student life is all over the place. The size of the school makes everyone very clichey. The Greek Life opportunities are present, but it's really who you know to get in. If you turn one down they also tell everyone they know how bad of a person you are even if it isn't true. The housing situation is honestly horrible. The dorms are old and gross, and it is very hard to get out of the dorms until you are a junior. They won't let you live off campus until you're a senior so they can trap you into having a meal plan. The food in the cafeteria is gross, there are not very many healthy options and they often reuse food."
College Freshman,1,"The administration is basically non existent, either they don't know things are going on or don't care that they are going on. Drinking and drugs are rarely cracked down on, dorm rules are never enforced. People cheat in almost all of their classes. People take drugs to study. Pledgeship was ""banned"" this year, but still continued the entire time. school just chooses not to do anything about it"
College Freshman,1,"The caf closes at eight at night so if you want food after that you will need to pay for it. There is a lack of options- food choices are the same every week. If you don't eat meat good luck finding anything worth eating. Food is mediocre at best, and usually people get sick from eating in the caf. Things are bland or taste bad. Food is almost all unhealthy options. Food quality is low. Fruits and vegetables are always marginal."
College Freshman,1,"There are a few frats and sororities. You can have the party people, or overly obsessed Christians. Take your pick. AC also banned pledge ship this year, so rush is more like turning in an application and receiving a confirmation e-mail the next day."
College Freshman,1,Sherman is probably the worst college town there is.
College Freshman,1,The off campus dining is located pretty far away. The places close to the campus are run down and are pretty bad places to go eat. The off campus dining is best if you get on highway 75 and go near the new target complex near the edge of the city closer to denison
College Freshman,1,The dorms are pretty bad. They are never clean and are quite small for the price. Also the dorm that I live in live far away from all the buildings
College Freshman,1,"Depends on what your looking for. I say its the worst because I hate partying. If you like parties than look at the rating as its the best. There is a party going on every night of the week if you want it, and a lot of students do go every night. All parties involve alcohol, it is extremely rare to find someone here who does not drink. Its the equivalent of finding a giant diamond in the grass. This school does a good time advertising and saying that they aren't a party school- but its reputation in texas is that its a party school. I think its number 9 in texas for parties. People are always coming back late completely wasted. Do NOT come here if you hate parties because you will hate it. They are all over the place!"
College Junior,1,Sherman is a scary place to live and nothing to do. It's all old people
College Junior,1,Being vegetarian all we ask for is alittle bit more variety and warm food.
College Junior,1,"For some reason walking within AC like the library back to caruth seems like the safest part because it's in the heart of campus, but those that walk back to the flats or like me the cottage late at night is very sketch and scary. There have been many times people have gotten robbed walking back. The campus seems to be okay, but around us is a terrible area"
College Junior,1,"I lived in Caruth for a year. Honestly community bathrooms are the worst, I don't know how I did it. But the Roos, flats, and cottages are a major upgrade, but very poorly built and expensive"
College Sophomore,1,"Restaurants are chains with substandard quality and painfully boring. There are public parks, but no attractions, sports or recreation centers, or appreciable malls. There are lots of cultural events but none of them are very serious. No one cares about the sports teams except a few of the professors."
College Senior,1,"Sherman has terrible food, your only bet of getting a decent meal is hitting up a chain restaurant. The school does provide discounts which is a plus."
College Freshman,1,It is scary. It is always best to travel in groups or to carry around pepper spray. Since there aren't that many lights around campus at night it is difficult to see farther than a few feet in front of you.
Recent Alumnus,1,The Grade Says It All. We are not a NCAA Division 1 or 2 school. So athletics are so-so. We lose a lot. :(
College Junior,1,"Sherman Is a Very Small Town – Sherman is a very small town. The mall is not up to the standards of many students and the only social environment the city proposes besides a bar or two is a movie theater. Sherman offers limited options for students to participate in. It lacks potent landmarks, cultural events, extensive shopping, etc. However, for basic needs, the town is sufficient...only if one enters with low standards. Safety on campus is well taken care of but the same cannot be said for the town. Dallas is only an hour away though."
College Junior,1,"Slim Pickings – I feel like the ratio of attractive guys to attractive girls is a little lopsided. The number of hot girls at AC is definitely low. Anytime I have friends from other schools visit, they always ask, ""Hey, where are all the pretty girls at?"" I have even been asked by a prospective student and his parents where all the attractive girls on campus where because that would be a factor in their college decision!"
College Junior,1,"Not Enough Guys – The guy to girl ratio is horrible so all of the hot guys are probably taken and if, on the rare chance a decent guy transfers in, he'll probably be taken soon. Also, since it's a small school, chances are you'll see your exes around campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,"As AC is a very small campus, driving to school on a daily basis is unnecessary for most students, and many who live within a few blocks chose to ride bikes. However, there is very limited parking, especially for certain residence areas (Roo Suites parking is terrible). While there is enough room for everyone to get a spot, you may end up having to walk halfway across campus just to get to your destination. Campus PD can also be a stickler for parking regulations and will not hesitate to hand out parking tickets. However, having a car on campus isn't entirely necessary, as the whole campus can be traversed in ten to fifteen minutes."
College Junior,1,"Once leaving, it is impossible to find a parking spot upon return."
College Senior,1,"Roo Route – We have the Roo Route, but nobody uses it.  As far as I know, it is the only alternative transportation offered by the school."
College Junior,1,Sherman is not one of those cute small towns. It's a run-down wreck filled with The People of Walmart.
College Junior,1,"Why Do We Even Have a Football Team? Our football team went 0-10 this year, there is extremely poor performance at games, and no one honestly cares that much about sports. The IM sport program is a lot of fun; I enjoyed playing lacrosse my first year. But there is again a lack of involvement or general enthusiasm in that area. School spirit tends to go towards the more academic side of things, such as pride in AC's great Model UN team or performance at psychology research conferences. I like the workout facilities, but they could be bigger."
College Sophomore,1,You Cannot Live Off Campus Until You Are a Senior or Have 6 Semesters – its horrible! you have to live on campus in the bubble that the school is in. there are not even greek houses
College Sophomore,1,"The only thing there is to do in Sherman is go to Walmart or Taco Bell. Those are the only places that don't close at about 10 o'clock every night. The town is hideously ugly and sketchy, too-I never felt comfortable enough to go out on my own. There are a few places in Downtown Sherman that seem like a nice place to hang out, but most of the friends I made at AC never felt the need to explore. I come from a large metropolitan city and I found that Sherman just flat out crushed my spirit. I felt like I was never going to leave there and would be sucked into nothingness."
College Senior,1,"Non-Transferable Credit Hours – Before you decide to go to Austin, understand that the courses claim to be 4 credit hours.  This is not accepted or transferable to accredited universities.  Austin rarely accepts credit hours from other colleges.  This forces students to take all coursework at Austin.  Since each course alleges to be 4 credit hours - it's a snap to get a fast degree."
College Junior,1,"Awful If You've Ever Had Fresh or Unique Food – Some of my peers enjoy the food but, I'm sorry guys, you're probably not used to good food. The meat is nearly inedible except for the chicken strips in the Pouch Club. Nothing is ever seasoned. I suppose most of the food represents ""southern"" cooking as chicken-fried steak, (super bland) mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and over-boiled vegetables. No ingredients are freshed and I've had wilted lettuce on several occasion. Not to mention that the lettuce is often only iceberg, which has no nutritional value. As far as I'm concerned, the only edible vegetarian option is the black bean burger in the Pouch Club."
College Sophomore,1,"Nasty nasty – Contrary to what many say, I come from a big city and since high school have been accustomed to an active social life. Many people that say they enjoy this school are typically from a small town (Sherman, Plano, areas around Dallas), thus moving to a small town with really nothing to do is a pretty easy change. Also if you liked high school with the gossip, lack of privacy, and seeing the same people day by day this school is for you. The Greek scene is a little ridiculous, and overruns campus. Basically visit this campus before you accept, or you will probably end up regretting it. "
College Junior,1,"Austin College doesn't have nearly enough parking, and they just took out a large parking lot near the biggest dorm on campus and built a new one, half the size of the other, in the most inconvenient spot imaginable."
College Junior,1,"Dorm Life – Our dorms need MAJOR renovations. They are very outdated, and the rooms are oddly small compared to other schools similar to ours. The bathrooms are sub-par and the study rooms are nothing great. Overall, they just need a complete revamping."
College Sophomore,1,"Strict Dorm Visitation – There are strict rules for visitation in place, and they are always upheld ""to the fullest extent of the law."" It's a wee bit ridiculous. Even in the coed dorms, women cannot be on men's floors after hours and vice versa."
College Freshman,1,"The food at AC is rather bland, on a short rotational basis, and offered at weird hours. It is WAY overpriced and could use some major revamping."
College Junior,1,"It's great for fast food and a decent coffee place, but that's about it."
College Senior,1,There Aren't Any – I guess we have the Roo Route but no one uses it.
College Sophomore,1,"No Real Clubs, Parties Are the Only Way to Go – There is only one bar that students 21 and up really go to. It's a lot more fun to go over to a friend's or a frat house and hang out and party than to go out. It's cheaper too to just all pitch in."
College Junior,1,"Not the Most Exciting of Atmospheres and Absolutely No Nightlife – Sherman is a small town with few attractions that would appeal to students. The main thing students can do for fun is go to parties. Local businesses are supportive of students if they are asked to participate in activities or fundraisers. Otherwise, the college and the community don't associate with each other very much."
College Freshman,1,"The sports at such a small liberal arts school are barely accessible, to say the least. The people involved with them think they are all magnate, but in reality, they don't matter that much. There is barely any team spirit except from those who wish to relive their high school ""glory days"" by occasionally attending games."

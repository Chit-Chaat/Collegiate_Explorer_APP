Not only this I managed to join a club with people similar to me allowing me to have a safe place filled with my peers. I got to learn so many things and improve my skills. However, I did have problems with some of the professors who taught in a different way as well as transportation from my home to school."
Sophomore,5,"Yes, I took classes online this didn't really affect the class as much as many people originally thought it would. The professors posted their assignments and added notes and tips for their work to help us. The professors took their time to email each student as a way to better help them improve. Also, I personally have trouble speaking to people too crowded but by being online I didn't have to worry about that issue as much I felt comfortable at home while doing my assignments and attending the classes online. In addition, by having classes online, you have an advantage that you may not have previously had, also your professor seems more understanding if you have a problem."

Freshman,5,I love the staff and academics. everyone is there to help. there are so many clubs and sports welcoming you

Freshman,5,"while I was a senior in high school at the time, my high school took a school trip to mercy college. I could say that the moment I took two steps on campus I felt at home. I knew mercy college was for me. mercy college was my first and quite honestly my only choice. I knew this school would help make my dreams into accomplishments. now,  being a freshman at mercy college, I knew I made the right choice. I had the opportunity to dorm here and the students are amazing, the faulty and staff was top tier in my eyes. it was not a day on campus I didn't feel like I wasn't meant to be here. I highly recommend mercy college to any new high schoolers."
Freshman,5,"At first, it was hard to adjust since everything came in a rush. However, the teachers were great with helping the students adjust. They were very understanding of the students situation."
Sophomore,5,I like the teachers the size of the classes and the conviencieve the busses are close by and mery provided busses to train which is excellent
Junior,5,They understood the situation and provided the students with laptops if they needed any. Also even though the amount of work didn’t differ they did have more office hours to help those who needed it.
Junior,5,"Mercy College is a great school. It’s challenging and offers its students many opportunities. There’s a lot of internships and job opportunities as well as research opportunities. The campuses, Staff, and students  are also amazing.  It feels like being a part of a huge family. I would recommend this school to anyone that is looking to apply to a college."
Sophomore,5,Teachers always stay connected while online to make sure students always understand the topics being taught. Hands-on participation is always valued and recommended.
Junior,5,My classes online was clear and straight forward. The professors were very helpful to students who needed help learning the system. I would be fine doing more online classes at Mercy College if needed.
Junior,5,I love the opportunity they offered me after the College of New Rochelle Closedown. During the pandemic they offered help on all levels.
Sophomore,5,The campus is very nice and my peers are always willing to help when I need it. Throughout the stay at home order my professors did their best to help with the awkward transition. I feel as though I got the same quality level of education going online.
Freshman,5,"The teachers are very helpful, students are friendly and very respectful, the dorms are worth it. Living on campus is worth the experience."
Niche User,5,Beautiful campus and small classes . Took a tour today and loved it . Only downside is the individual dorms were very small with limited shared bathroom space
Graduate Student,5,"Mercy College is a great school. During the years I have studied in Mercy for my   undergraduate and graduate degree, I have gain an extensive amount of knowledge in many different courses. The diversity of the students in the school is huge, which is a great opportunity to also learn from others and their culture. Professors and staff are so helpful and always willing to provide advice in anything you need."

In this school you will find an acceptable environment because students are striving under the same mentality, which is to excel."

They offer a lot of tutoring and assistance for you to advance in your classes. The pact mentors check up on you to make sure you are taking the right classes and that you are on the right track"
Junior,5,"I am an adult transfer student. Admissions were extremely helpful in helping me to register. I originally went to Mercy to obtain information about obtaining my CASAC, however upon speaking with admissions I decided to apply for a Bachelors program in Behavioral Science. My second semester at Mercy, I enrolled in Introduction to Social Work and upon ending the course, I knew that I wanted to major in Social Work. I applied to the Social Work Program and was accepted. I am currently working on my Bachelors and plan on going to graduate school to obtain my Masters. Mercy has flexible schedules which accommodate my work schedule. Professors are experienced and knowledgeable. My experience so far at Mercy has been encouraging."
Senior,5,I love the diverse campuses and class times. They offer great online classes for a busy mom like my self . The staff is always willing to help and communitating with them through email is a breeze.
Junior,5,"I like the area and the teaching. and they give out scholarships and financial aid. I agree that the school can be disorganized--but I went to Hunter College for grad school and they were worse. Furthermore, we're adults (or supposed to be) if we're in college, so we can fight the system to get what we need.

I had some professors who didn't care--but I had that in one of the top ranked graduate programs in the country too. I also had some AMAZING professors; James Towey and Ori Shinar come to mind. Furthermore, I was paying $9000 a semester (heavily subsidized by scholarships) and never had a class more than 25 students. My friends who were paying $40,000 a year often never had classes UNDER 100 students."
Senior,5,The Professors and educational staff at Mercy are always ready and willing to help the students when in need. If they do not have an immediate answer to your question or problem the staff is willing and able to find some who does.
Senior,5,Good student life especially with the honor's program. Business Department is the best in the area with specialties ranging from accounting to international business.
Sophomore,5,"Mercy college has given me the greatest opportunities in regards to academic advancements.  The professors are amazing, the campus is beautiful, and there are so many different people to meet!!!"
Senior,5,Mercy College is one of the best/safest colleges in New York. The professors are great and everyday you learn something new. The college is there for the students every step of the way and helps them achieve many great things. You will never feel alone because everyone is so supportive and wants to see you shine.
Junior,5,"Mercy College is in a wonderful location, beautiful campus, and has very helpful Professor's. Every class that I have taken so far at Mercy College has been pleasant, and the professor's do a great job at keeping their students' engaged."
Niche User,5,"Small classes,the ratio of students per class offer personalized teaching experience. Competitive program in Speech Pathology  with a clinic in campus to have a hands on experience , Easy commute for students who decide living out of campus, train station in very close. Nice housing in the case you decide to live in campus. Campus in not overwhelming in size."
Freshman,5,"I go to Mercy College and to sum up the experience at this school, it was overall pretty nice so far. I am a commuter and I take the train to school every day. The transportation in New York is very accessible but I feel as if living on campus would be significantly better. I also feel that the library should be open a little later or 24/7 especially for those who are awake late and have work in the day time."
Graduate Student,5,"I have earned a Bachelors from Mercy, and I must say I am very thankful. The classes were so flexible and all the different campuses and times made it so easy for me to finish my degree in a couple of years. Also A bunch of my credits from my community college were transferred over so I didn't have to take many classes that I didn't need. The professors were so understanding, and the assignments and what they expected from us was reasonable. Now I am doing my graduate degree here in Physician Assistant studies and I could not be happier. The fact that the campus is in the bronx, and I am able to provide care even as a student to people that I could have grown up with. People who could have been my neighbors. I am a Latina from the bronx that is so proud to represent in a predominantly caucasian field."
Senior,5,I love how helpful Mercy College is. The staffs are really concerned about students.It could improve in offering more courses.
Freshman,5,"Mercy college is a great place to study your career of interest, as well as build new relationships."
Senior,5,"Socially, the college is great for close nit friendships that last forever. The academics are also great, professors are compassionate and fair. They teach with passion unlike those that teach for money elsewhere. Everyone will push you until you get to the top."
Junior,5,"I have only been at Mercy College a very short time, but I have found it to be so much more convenient than WCC, which is where I obtained my Associates degree. I had plenty of bad experiences with that school and I am still trying to get a single copy of my diploma that it’s taking month to obtain from them. Mercy has a wonderful staff that makes it very easy for me especially with working a full time job!"
Senior,5,I would like to see more deaf and hard of hearing. I feel like I am the only student with this type of disability.
Sophomore,5,"Mercy is amazing, they made me feel at home when arrived on campus. The classes are small and the professors are available 24/7. Student life which plans the events on campus to uplift students."
Junior,5,"I'm currently in my third year of obtaining my Bachelor's Degree in Mercy College. I am studying Speech Language Pathology. I want to help people around the world who have trouble speaking due to natural impediments or severe injuries that have caused them to have trouble speaking with ease and confidence. My experience so far at Mercy College is great. I have built great friendships with my peers. All of my professors have been amazing as well. They are all very understanding and helpful. My college campus overlooks the beautiful Hudson River which is very admiring to look at especially when you are mentally stressed with essays, midterms and finals year round. Overall, Mercy College has been such a great experience for me so far. I cannot wait to see what these last two years have in store for me."
Senior,5,"I like Mercy College, because the classes are small and you gain more attention from the professors. The professors take their time and help you to understand each and every concept."
Senior,5,"Mercy College is located in a great area, along with a very well maintained teaching staff. The student to teacher ratio is perfect as well. Mercy college is a melting pot of students from all over the tri-state area. College is whatever the student puts in, but there is no way you can't go far when attending Mercy College. Its impossible to not reach your goals with the resources available here at Mercy. The classes are groomed exactly for your major, and they don't waste your time."
Senior,5,"Mercy is an excellent colledge the staff is very helpful, of coures there are a couple of professors i don't care much for but that is the nature of college and of life. i love mercy college and so do my friends."
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy the professors and their desire to teach us at the best of their abilities. In the college, there are so many opportunities to enter into programs and be engaging. One thing I would want to be changed is the ability to consistently see my over all grade of classes I am taking rather than having to wait until the end of the semester"
Sophomore,5,Mercy College is a great school for you to grow in as a student. They have many recourses to help students in their academic life.
Alum,5,"Mercy College is a great overall school. Great academics, great professors, and a great learning environment. The only problem that I have with the school is that I believe the library is too small and should be expanded. Besides this, Mercy college prepared me for a career in the health and sciences, and as an entrant to a PA program of my choice. Highly recommend Mercy!"
Junior,5,"I am a transfer student who hasn't been to college since 2005. The last college I attended never informed me about the financial cap from FASA and other loans, however, since I am unable to get promotions without my degree and very limited with money, I decided to return to college, but specifically to Mercy College because the staff, professors, and others listened to my concerns and allowed me to set up affordable payments to earn my degree."
Junior,5,What I like about Mercy College is that they truly want to see you succeed. The PACT counselors are on top of everything. They want each student to make an appointment each month to review or update them on courses the student is taking. They also make sure you are registered on time and know what courses you have to take in order to graduate. They are always there as a helping hand.
Niche User,5,"Visiting Mercy College for the first time blew me away. To think I could go to college at a really beautiful place sounded so surreal. I visited Mercy College because of their Women's Soccer program, but I never thought I would fall in love with the school as much as I did. The diversity there was amazing and I felt so welcomed at a place where I thought I was a stranger."
Graduate Student,5,I love the MBA and MSOL program in Mercy.  I attend the Manhattan Campus and it is very convenient.  The professors are very accessible and helpful in finding your direction.  The MBA program is year to 18 month program depending on the direction you take your career.  I am only 4 months from a year i the program.  I truly feel fortunate to be here.
Senior,5,"My experience as a transfer student was amazing and stress-free. The Admission department staff guide me through applying to the college till class registration. I was well informed and directed to all the needed departments that required my attention. Overall, Mercy College is well-organized and students should be honored to be part of this school. I can't wait to experience the rest of Mercy College years."
Niche User,5,I will be going to Mercy next fall. Mercy is one of only 5 colleges in New York State to offer Vet Tech and only one of two private schools.  I love the location and the size of the school and they offer my chosen major.
Freshman,5,"Mercy College is an excellent place to attain your Bachelor’s/Associate’s and a well-rounded choice to pursue higher education. With a wide variety of majors to choose from, small class sizes and excellent professors to teach and guide you, there’s not much to look elsewhere for when you attend!"
Niche User,5,"I planning to apply there. Mercy college  caught my attention because it was close to my family and had international business, the major I want to puruse."
Sophomore,5,Mercy College is a great college to attend. During my first year I have met amazing people and had amazing professors. I would like to see more activities on campus to relax our minds after a long day of class.
Sophomore,5,"I love Mercy ! I commute to the Bronx Campus, and to be honest I love the space and the fact that t isn't all that big. However I have visited Dobbs Ferry and Manhattan and all campuses are very resourceful and engaging with students !"
Alum,5,I love it. They are very convenient with online and on site classes. Everyone is friendly and helpful.
Sophomore,5,the student -professor relationship is very great they always have time to help any student out.  the student atmosphere is also very great it is very easy to make friends and communicate with friends.
Sophomore,5,"Business Honors is a bright spot at Mercy College. Beautiful area and the honors students are all well mannered, driven, and focused students. Occasional frustration with administration and the common students, but as a young, developing school, that is to be expected."
Alum,4,Online classes were straightforward and I did not find them to be a disadvatange to in person classes. I primarily used this for my pre-req requirements.
Sophomore,4,"Most of the professors are great, though there are some that have a bad reputation with their way of teaching. Mercy offers a variety of clubs and activities to do out of class. The lunch is good but may get boring for those living on campus. Overall great college."
Sophomore,4,"Teachers and other staff members are so helpful and polite, I haven't even graduated yet and already  they have helped me in starting my career at a wonderful company"
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience with Mercy College is very good. It feels like my secondary home, and everyone who works in the campus are very kind, helpful, and respectful. The campus has many activities for students such as sports, clubs, and volunteering as tutor for those who struggle with a specific subject. The administrators, teachers, and staff will always help. in many ways possible given us the full experience of the college life in order to fulfill our dreams yet with struggles along the way."
Sophomore,4,Professors were very flexible when it came to online teaching. I personally don't work very well online but all of my professors were very encouraging and accommodating about having every student have it as easy as possible.
Sophomore,4,Mercy is a great school for students looking to study the sciences. The campus is a good size and has a very diverse community between both professors and students. The only drawback is that it can be difficult to get a direct answer from people such as residential life and financial aid.
Sophomore,4,"Mercy College is a great school for the reason being that you feel as if you are in your second home. The school provides many activities for us the students to help one another trying to understand the criteria that we need help in, and offers a wide range of support for every student in campus with financial Aid, picking the right classes, help to improve your studies, Many clubs to chose from and everyone will do whatever they can to help take that next step in your career. Therefore, Mercy College is a very good school, and just feels like I'm in my secondary home."
Freshman,4,Took one online class and it was great I like to have assignments to do instead of listening to a teacher talk. I took intro to business and the teacher was great
Sophomore,4,"I like the size of the Mercy College campus as well as the community.  I was intimidated by leaving my home to go to school full-time, but the community at Mercy College acts as my home away from home.  You're not just a number here, you're you!  You have a lot of opportunities to become recognized and get the best out of your education here."
Sophomore,4,Very welcoming and classes are mental stimulating Hands-on participation is always valued and recommended.
Sophomore,4,Mercy is a great choice to spend four years of college. There are many supportive staff members that are always willing to help students become successful.
Freshman,4,I did the last part of the semester online and it was a very different experience. I was focused more and doing more work but also taking a while to meet deadlines as it is hard to study sometimes
Sophomore,4,"Mercy college is one of the most beautiful colleges in weschester county. Looks aren't everything, but Mercy has more to offer than just looks. The most captivating aspect of Mercy is the staff. As boring as that may sound, it's true! PACT Mentors are Mercy's version of guidance counselors, and they do their job well. You aren't just another number passing through their office asking them a FAQ that you could've googled. You're an individual, and treated as such. The faculty in the financial aid office are competent, which is more than you can say for most colleges, and they also do their job decently. You may be wondering, if this guy is talking about how great Mercy is, why not give it 5 stars? One of the reasons Mercy isn't a 5 star school is for the same reason it's great; that reason is location. Mercy's location may have allowed it to be beautiful, but it is somewhat far away from typical hangout spots (think movie theaters, malls, etc)."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Mercy is amazing, everyone is very nice and it's very fun. But the food is a little bad but good."
Freshman,4,"The small college makes it easy ad simple to make friends and find a community of people who you feel comfortable with. It also makes it easy to get close to administrators that can help you with anything you need, whether it be academic, financial, after college jobs, or simply to talk. However, because it is small, it makes you feel isolated and disconnected at times."
Alum,4,"I had an overall good experience at Mercy college. The pact mentors which are your advisors are extremely helpful. The downside of this college is the dorm experience isn't exciting. There is only one dorm building on campus, this doesn't allow for a lot of students to house there. But in general I loved my educational experience."
Junior,4,I'm currently a psychology major in my junior year and I've loved it so far. The professors I've taken my courses with are excellent instructors and give lots of information and connections for possible careers. The PACT mentors are also excellent. They are assigned to students by major so every student has an adviser specialized in the field they are studying. Every PACT mentor is trained and equipped with relevant information and are always on top of student activity. Mercy College provides several resources for students with all types of necessities so everyone is able to fit in without feeling discriminated or disadvantaged. Mercy College also offers a variety of clubs and programs along all campuses and everyone is welcome.
Sophomore,4,"I love how Mercy college is so diverse and openly welcomes every new student to walk onto campus. The campus is clean and small but still a sociable place, the food is good and the dorms are sizable and clean as well. The professors are amazing and because of how small the classes are it is very easy to build relationships with them and get help whenever you need it. However, it is quite unorganized when it comes to letting students know on financial aid help, due dates and shuttle schedules."
Sophomore,4,Mercy’s professors are very knowledgeable. The parking on campus is very limited and makes it hard to find a parking spot since it’s mainly a school of commuters.
Freshman,4,"Mercy College is affordable and extremely helpful for students coming from all types of backgrounds. Mercy College offers many growth opportunities as well as free tutoring and academic help. Mercy College, however, is lenient with its staff and the professors are often below average. Professors often show up late to class or cancel last minute."
Junior,4,"I like the location of the school, close to the water and also close to the metro. Very supportive of all athletic teams. Great professors and students."
Senior,4,The school as a whole is a lovely environment. Food on campus is expensive for small portions. Currently a FT CLS major. Hate that the program ONLY starts on fall. I had an entire semester off and just want to graduate already!!
Freshman,4,"staff is nice, in my experience professors are understanding. great location, beautiful scenery, cute small town, and a train ride away from NYC."
Freshman,4,"Mercy College is very diverse and very welcoming to everyone. Everyone there is always very quick to help whether it be financial problems, academic problems, or mental health problems. They provide any aid they can and offer plenty of free programs that students are allowed to attend. They provide incoming freshmen a peer mentor that helps guide them through their first year. Overall very friendly environment. Classes are also small which allows students to connect with professors, there is also free tutoring at the library center. There is plenty of academic help. Overall very kind environment."
Senior,4,"My experience at Mercy College has been one of my best college experiences so far. I transferred from a big college campus. It was a major change for me but I found myself working better within the smaller classes. I like the fact that the classrooms are filled with students, It allows everyone with a chance to connect with the professor. Rather than having to share the professor with a class twice the size. I find that working in smaller classrooms are the best for me because I won't hesitate to ask questions during class. The staff are always willing to help and are always making sure you're on the right track to success."
Sophomore,4,My experience so far has been real. Everything people would say about going into college was absolutely true. I enjoyed the way teachers actually connected with the students which made class work much easier to understand. Being able to choose my schedule was a very big advantage. My schedule made it easy to work and go to school so in one year I got two experiences. Traveling from home to school and back is one thing that I would say is hard but I am still very much satisfied with where I am going.
Freshman,4,"The experience that mercy offers in is absolutely incredible one on one conversation which can guide you in the career you chosen and the ways you can become more confident in what you decide to study for . Mercy has many faculty that are willing to help you as much as possible for example Free tutoring , books that your professor requires from the student to bring , someone to talk to on a personal level, and treat you as family ."
Senior,4,Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry is an overall good school and the campus is nice. The staff in the Exercise Science departments are a great help. The professors and staff are helpful. They are strict and will put a hold on their registration for classes if there is an outstanding balance remaining.
Senior,4,"Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry is a beautiful campus. The staff in certain departments are a great help. The professors are wonderful in teaching their courses well. However, some things need to be changed in the financial aid department. Student balances should be something to be worked on as students continue to finish their degree. They are very strict and will keep a hold on their registrations until their total balances are cleared out which is sometimes impossible for students to do."
Sophomore,4,"Mercy College is a good school overall. There is always room for improvement, dorms should be improved, also some professors should be re evaluated because they don't have the best teaching methods."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed the diversity and making friends. Most people are friendly and nice. For the most part it's clean mostly. We definitely need better food here its decent, but it's not the best tasting."
Junior,4,Since I had an experience at both campuses one in the Bronx and at Dobbs Ferry. I prefer Dobbs Ferry because there’s more parking and the professors are willingly to help
Alum,4,"Overall, I liked my time at Mercy. I attended this school years ago, circa 2006 - 2009 and took a long break and now I'm considering doing my MBA here. There are many positive changes since back in the day with professors. These professors are accomplished, from competitive schools, giving real, substantial information. I see the quality is on the rise and I'm happy because the reputation of the school is important to us as students. 
 The school is also much more expensive than before. To any current or perspective students reading, make sure you research scholarships and grants in the undergrad  catalog. I received additional aid by asking my advisor about these opportunities. Also, join COP or SSSP for a free class each summer (B.X campus). Take advantage of the resources they offer like internships and career fairs. So many students just go to class and graduate to find they are having trouble obtaining jobs because they have no experience."
Senior,4,"I must say, I was blessed with some great Criminal Justice professors.  Professors who came to educate not just collect a paycheck. Passion of their job showed their instructing.

If I could change one thing it will be to experiencing more Aiding in my Financial Aid then financial."
Freshman,4,I love Mercy because the campus atmosphere is very friendly and helpful. I didn’t know who I was until I found my place on campus and joined clubs and extracurricular activities. And  the program of study I’m currently in is very rigorous and is currently preparing me for graduate school so by the time I graduate I know I will be completely prepared for it and won’t  struggle with time management or have trouble organizing my social life and class schedule.
Junior,4,"I just started classes at this school. So far I have no complaints the professors are pretty good and the campus is nice.  I go to the Bronx campus so the party scene is not existent. As I get to spend more time at this school I will get to experience more of what the school/campus has to offer me.  My professors are pretty clear on what the assignments are, and I am thankful about that."
Junior,4,I’m doing very well in Mercy College. I made honor roll my first semester there and plan on making the Deans list this upcoming semester. I am looking forward to graduating in 2021 and then getting my masters in either as a athletic trainer or in exercise physiology. I also plan to get my PhD in Health and Wellness. My ultimate goal is to own my own Health and Wellness center. I want to travel all over the world to help others countries live a healthy lifestyle.
Senior,4,"I enjoyed working with other students and most importantly  the professor at Mercy.  I found the professors to be very helpful, patient and easy to contact."
Junior,4,the campus is beautiful and located in a wonderful area. overall the school is great. just wish to see  better professors.
Junior,4,I have been attending this school for one semester and so far it has been delightful. I attend the campus located in the Bronx and I can't complain. The toughest part of New York is the commute. The nearest train is a bit distant to the campus but Mercy provides shuttle service to and from the nearest station. The campus has lots of space to study and computers are accessible even in the lunch area.
Alum,4,"I transferred to Mercy College for the end of my undergraduate career. My experience was great, but because it is a private institution, it was very expensive."
Graduate Student,4,"What I liked most about mercy college was the psychology professors. Almost every psychology professor I have had so far has been very supportive and goes out of their way to facilitate learning in the classroom and online. I really think the Hudson hall dorms are fantastic, due to the fact that they are brand new suites and are very comfortable compared to the very small dorms you tend to see on other campuses. Something to work on is the food, which after a while of dorming there can really just be tiring. Also, this wasn't really a party school, but I find that to be something positive."
Senior,4,"I loved the online classes. The professors were great and very devoted to teaching their classes. I like how helpful the financial aid staff are with keeping up with deadlines for loans especially. Although I was a transfer student, I was welcomed to Mercy college and enjoyed being a student here."
Sophomore,4,It is a decent school. I suggest they add sports in the bronx campus in order to make it easier for student to stay fit.
Sophomore,4,Mercy college is a college that you need to get use to. At first i wanted to leave but I gave it a chance and I am glad that I did. I met so many amazing friends and when I look around there is just so much diversity which is great!
Niche User,4,"Bit expensive but you it is a quality institution.

Sophomore,4,"The campus is beyond beautiful the professors aren’t  like any other , things are so easy to understand and comprehend, mercy college makes me feel like I’m welcomed and like I’m home , I chose the right college for me"
Alum,4,Mercy has many opportunities for those students that seek them. Guidance from PACT counselors can be incorrect at times therefore I took charge of signing myself up for classes. The campus is beautiful especially with the additions and renovations they have made on campus in the last few years.
Freshman,4,"It is a very diverse school, which is great. The main campus is really nice and the professors are very helpful. They have many resources which makes adjusting to college a lot easier."
Sophomore,4,"I love the way all of the faculty staffs embrace you while you embark on your educational journey there, I actually didn't have any intention on applying to Mercy College until I attended one of their open house events, and the treatment given to me that day made me sign up immediately because I couldn't say No to everyone who was willing to help, and make sure that I succeeded in life especially after a previous traumatizing college experience."
Sophomore,4,"Mercy college offers the private college quality of education and experience at a very affordable cost. The college consists of a very good and aware administration, that will reach out to you and help you with what you need. The professors are professional and understanding, helps students as much as they can.  There are different campus throughout New York which makes it convenient for anyone who doesn't dorm. If you do dorm, Mercy college offers different and great options in Dobbs Ferry, New York."
Junior,4,Mercy College is a great school for those who like small classes. The small class sizes allows there to be more communication between the students and professors. Mercy also has a great program called PACT which gives each student a mentor who helps you with college journey. The staff is always welcoming and willing to help.
Freshman,4,When I went to orientation I had a great time. Everything was organized and well placed. The school is known for it's degree programs.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at mercy College  is good. Professor are flexible and understandable.  They highly professional and student have to work hard gor the grade. The school have a variety of program also, few campus close to new york and online classes. The only thing I would like they add is transportation discount for queens and Manhattan students."
Sophomore,4,"Mercy College has the resources of a major University with individual attention being a primary source of learning. Mercy has given many opportunities not only to myself but to my peers. The school is what you make of it. If you go in with the intention of learning, you will do so.  If you go with the intention of being lazy or complaining about others then go to a community college where such immaturity seems to be common. They have PACT mentors who help you throughout your 4 years."
Freshman,4,"When I first looked at the school and the vet tech program, I wasn't super impressed. I chose to go to another college, and found myself very upset there and started to look into transferring. I decided on Mercy because I had seen it before. When I got here, I was shocked and so mad I hadn't come here in the first place! Everyone on campus has been so friendly since day one, all the professors I have had have been helpful and good, the food actually isn't bad, and the vet tech program is amazing and much better than the previous one I was in!! I was turned away by the negative reviews left, so I wanted to leave a good one so looking seniors will have a real experience, and not an upset kid complaining. Mercy is wonderful, and if you are looking into the vet tech program here I recommend it so highly! The program's staff are willing to speak with you and help you in everything and the program is always improving."
Freshman,4,Mercy college is not a bad school at all. You just have to find the right people to connect with and the professors are willing to help you improve your grades if your struggling. It not a party school but wee do have some parties once in  while. and the academics side to it is great.
Freshman,4,"This college has very friendly people and teachers. The tuition is very cheap for a private college. However, the staff are not very helpful or understanding when it comes to setting up a plan to pay the tuition."
Sophomore,4,"Mercy college is a fun campus to be on you can interact, connect, and build friendships with people from all types of the world. Mercy College is a campus I can most definitely recommend to anyone it is an easy, cheap and understanding school to go to. It's student life department always tries to get its students involved even if we are all trapped in our dorms on a snowy day."
Sophomore,4,I like most aspects of Mercy College except for the Biology program and some of the closed minded students.
Sophomore,2,"For me personally, I didn't really learn anything essential while doing my classes online, if anything, doing online classes made me have less motivated to do work as oppose to doing work on campus."
Graduate Student,2,Mercy has many flaws once you become a student that you find out when it’s too late. They have a graduation rate of 32% and a rententiom rate of 72%... The information is not clear and they are not very consistent with their requirements. I wouldn’t recommend this college until their graduation rate increases
Niche User,2,While the main campus is exquisite in every way. The satellite are not as impressive. The lack student engagement makes for a terrible experience. They need to reevaluate the faculty that they hire and renovate the satellite sites. It is known that some faculty do the bare minimum leaving students in the same fashion they entered their class with no knowledge of the subject being taught.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I never went to a college game. There is a large football field, and there are tennis courts, fitness center. I never used or went to games."
College Junior,2,"Not a lot of parties take place and when they do, they can only be small house parties."
College Junior,2,The only transportation students use are cabs or designated drivers.
College Sophomore,2,we don't yet have any greek life chapters at my school.
College Freshman,2,"The teams suck. They always lose, or they sometimes win but it's few and far between."
College Sophomore,2,"It's worrisome  that the dorms were a hospital before. The room I was in last year was super small, and it's unfair how some were really spacious, and some had no room to customize the furniture. The overall look of it was really ugly. The bathrooms were clean, but also not the best looking. Dorming at Mercy just didn't fulfill my expectations for the college experience."
College Sophomore,2,"As a former softball player at our school, our field was terrible as the infield is uneven and the outfield grass isn't as good as it should be. Our turf field is the only good part of athletics, but I don't like how for the baseball field, there isn't an outfield wall, so if balls are hit that far, it's never ending. Our basketball gym is so small, it's really embarrassing that it's supposed to be a division 2 facility. There's 3 rows for seating and it gets really hot in there during games."
College Junior,2,The security here is a joke. They security guards are nothing more than parking guards that occasionally open locked doors.
College Sophomore,2,we don't have Greek life
College Freshman,2,"Greek life lacks in Mercy College. Many people are trying to bring it ""to life"" although I do not know how and when that is going to work."
College Sophomore,2,"The academic level is not exceptional, it is ok, but it is better to transfer as soon as possible."
College Freshman,2,"The PACT system is alright and the teachers are good, but overall the school is incompetent. They lose everyone's records, boot people's cars for mistaken reasons, and really just don't know how to run their school."
College Sophomore,2,everything around dobbs ferry is highly expensive so i just usually bring lunch
College Sophomore,2,"The food is literally the same, they never change it up or have it a little festive! the same food everyday gets boring and nasty"
College Freshman,2,"Honestly you,ll think it's really fun at first but once you realize the same people come to the same parties to do the same things it gets dull really quick. Also it is freezing cold after winter break so good luck finding a decent party from Feb-Mar"
College Freshman,2,There needs to be more healthy options
College Freshman,2,Off campus housing is expensive
College Freshman,2,i wish they can offer scholarships for undergraduate international students
College Freshman,2,"We honestly do not have many parties, if you're looking for a party school, mercy is not the place to be."
College Freshman,2,"No really parties, dry campus. Only partying if you know older people, but RA's are always there"
College Sophomore,2,"Any apartments near by are for rent through landlords, not the school. They are very picky about renting to college students and it is difficult to see an apartment if you're interested."
College Freshman,2,There is almost no party scene
College Freshman,2,"My room in the dorms is so tiny! I almost didn't even get a room this year as well! Many people got screwed this year and got put in the hotels instead of getting a dorm room, so get your forms and payments in early to secure a room!"
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't much to the local area. The campus is basically located in a medical center. The school is also located next to a psychiatric center. The neighbor is not so great, but they are building a hotel and added a gym and restaurant to the area so liven it up"
College Freshman,2,"There is currently no Greek life, but from what I have been told it is in the works."
College Sophomore,2,took forever to get all my financial aid figured out.  Mercy lost paper work and some of my scholarships.
College Senior,2,Poor communication between professors and students.
College Junior,2,The parties at the Manhattan campus are a joke. The one's at Dobbs Ferry are a little more populated but not much better.
College Junior,2,There's a lot of drama over very petty things and the school is divided into those who do work and to those who don't even really try. Gossiping is common and it all just feels really immature at times.
College Freshman,2,Mostly white people on campus with black people sprinkled through. A lot of them (all the races prevailing at Adelphi)come from middle class families so not a lot of diversity
College Senior,2,"People could be nicer , call more , have better customer service skills"
College Senior,2,"Nothing unique , seems like a high school"
College Senior,2,"Should have more activities for students at night , have buses run more hours"
College Senior,2,Food should have more healthier options
College Senior,2,"Parking , there is never parking"
College Senior,2,We dont have Greek life
College Senior,2,It's extremely difficult because not one person can provide the right direction to go in and some of the professors are not the best or don't really care to teach.
College Senior,2,"There is not enough security on campus, anyone can walk into the main building and as a matter of fact I have seen it happen."
College Senior,2,Mercy needs a lot of improvement because the staff itself particularly the counselor a do not provide much help to students to go in the right path of major.
College Senior,2,I have been told that the hotels are small and crowded and very far off campus.
College Sophomore,2,Upstate New York gets very cold during the winter.
College Junior,2,"It snows a lot in Westchester, forcing school to close."
College Sophomore,2,I actually never seen that much athletics on the campus that i'm studying at
College Student,2,It is really cold. Some classes have the heater all the way up which terrible because you're wearing 3 layers because of the cold.
College Junior,2,not much to do near the main caMPUS in dobbs ferry
College Junior,2,"the financial aid office is useless, you have to constantly be on top of them to fix errors"
College Junior,2,counselors should tell students about opportunities
College Sophomore,2,Campus dining isn't too great. There is not a lot of choices and the dining center closes very early. 
College Sophomore,2,The parking is horrible. I don't think the parking lot is even big enough for all the students who go there. On some occasions I have to circle the lot about 3 times just to find a spot even if it's far away
College Sophomore,2,"The night life at Mercy College is extremely dull. Westchester is an extremely expensive area to live in so students are not able to rent houses off campus easily. Also the dorm rooms are extremely small, making it very difficult for any type of large social gathering to occur in a room."
College Freshman,2,never open past 8 and its weird ethnic food 
College Freshman,2,if you get written up once you are on their radar 
College Junior,2,people drink in the hallways and in there rooms
College Junior,2,It a room with a bed and desk and chair
College Sophomore,2,Students do not have the need to drink in school. 
College Sophomore,2,The school library in the Bronx campus is extremely small. 
College Sophomore,2,So far i have not seen any alcohol or drug abuse. 
Freshman,1,The admissions team were rude they declined my admission into the nursing program because they said that I didn't meet their 80 average in STEM requirement for admissions. However I exceeded this requirement since I had 92 average for my math classes. When I confronted them about it they switched their story and told me that their nursing program was full.
Junior,1,"Listen to your peers about the professor's reviews. Financial Aid is an absolute mess completely detached from the school. No one communicates with other departments. You will receive a pact advisor every two months. If you do not believe me read the reviews on indeed for Mercy employees. Also, save yourself thousands of dollars and move off-campus. My quads look great after the Hudson elevator. It breaks down every 3 days. My last little input is security really does not care. I ask for someone to walk with me from the creepy train station to the dorms. They told me that no one is available while a car drove right past me. Other campuses have walking buddies or security guards who care about their students."
Sophomore,1,I think the classes are excellent however it's not for everyone you must be super determined and on top of it work other wise u will fail
Freshman,1,Worst school possible. The admissions department will lie to you and tell you that you have grants and things to help pay for college but it isn't true!! Don't fall for it!!
Junior,1,"Compared to community college Mercy is a joke ! The teachers and staff are very unprofessional. The financial aid department messes up a lot with your money and keeps money from you. The dorms are dirty and the food is horrible. You will NOT get the college experience here. Also you need a car to go anywhere around the area ( stores, bar and etc).The school is diverse however the students  are in cliques and act like high schoolers.  People who keep saying that mercy is a good college clearly have NEVER been to a good college. Please save your money and go to a public school. All mercy cares and I cannot stress enough is your money."
Junior,1,"Worst college ever.  They drain you from all of your money in the forms of financial aid, scholarships and payments.  No assistance from Guidance counselors until its time to signup for classes a week before school.  Other then that you can not get a hold of anyone.  The teachers are awful, they have egos like this is an ivy league college or something.  The entire staff has no idea what is going on.  Lastly they advertise for online program degrees but they only give out the degree to about 4 specific majors.  If you plan on going online then double check you'll waste time and  money and have to transfer.  Good luck."
Alum,1,"Aweful, do not come here especially if you’re being recruited! Coaches lie, there’s literally nothing to do and there’s zero school spirit. Place is dark and depressing, girls are beastly and faculty are just as bored as students. PACt team passes everything off and it’s ghost town every weekend. Unless you like sitting in your room alone do not go here. Definitely NOT a college experience"
Alum,1,"I went through 7+ advisors in my five semesters there, had to do so much of the admin work on my own and had to remind faculty to do their part. Dorm rooms are Bad, no A/C and heaters only after several weeks of REALLY cold weather. Dust and grime so thick in the vents that we had to keep windows open to prevent daily asthma attacks from roommate, making the temp problems worse. Bad food and rude staff in cafes. Crazy expensive bookstore. Some of the professors were awesome, but many more were terrible. Basic education, for the most part, that I could have paid much less for at a community college. Dobbs Ferry campus is gorgeous, but the admin for financial services and Yellow Ribbon program were almost always awful. Contacted school three times about when and how I would get my diploma, got three different stories from them. Have to call when you submit any paperwork because they do not send any confirmation emails or anything."
College Sophomore,1,They don't have Athletics in the Bronx campus. They do offer I believe in the dobbs ferry
College Freshman,1,"To my knowledge, there is no Greek Life to be offered on campus."
College Sophomore,1,Everoyone smokes on campus including the lessings staff
College Sophomore,1,"Cant wait to transfer, i was so excited about this school in the begining but bow its just a waste of money and possibly time"
College Sophomore,1,"Administrative Financial aid and student services are mean, unhelpful, very lazy, we all get our refunds late at the end of the semester and very inconvenient. The staff is racists and mean.  The classroom in Arabic class was a conference room so weird"
College Freshman,1,The admissions people are all very nasty.
College Freshman,1,There's no Greek life at all.
College Freshman,1,"If I said in the first question that my school doesn't have Greek life, why was I prompted to answer everything else on this page?"
College Freshman,1,I was very stressed out because I wanted to make sure I could afford college.
College Freshman,1,"Do not waste your money here at Mercy. The classes are a joke and the school is unorganized about almost everything. The campus is so small there is nothing to do on weekdays, or weekends on campus. The only good thing about this school is the view of the Hudson River. If you do not play sports, or are in the business honors program, you're pretty much nothing here. Do not waste your time, money, and effort on this school."
College Sophomore,1,The school does not display or help with finding off campus housing
College Freshman,1,"We do not have Greek Life at the Dobbs Ferry Campus, however there are many people who are trying to bring this an an issue to the school."
College Freshman,1,hardly is a greek life
College Freshman,1,"We don't have any greek life, and that sucks. If we did, Mercy has the potential to be the best college ever."
College Junior,1,It's living in Manhattan as a college student. Close to impossible.
College Freshman,1,"One club near campus, and you had to drive to get there, and it sucked. Went twice and sucked both nights. Adelphi's party scene was horrible."
College Senior,1,"By far the worst, the counselor a are no help whatsoever. Better and knowledgable staff should be hired for such an important department."
College Junior,1,I have to take the metro north to school and back home. It is extremely expensive.
College Sophomore,1,I'm not too sure if we have a Greek life
College Sophomore,1,I was told that the scholarship deadline was the wrong date and wasn't informed that I needed references. 
College Sophomore,1,Extremely hard to get a computer in the school. you're better off bringing your own.
College Sophomore,1,I have smelt marijuana in the halls on more than one occasion and have had to tell other students to be quiet after quiet hours more than once because the RA's have failed to do so themselves.
College Sophomore,1,There are no fraternities that I am aware of at Mercy college.
College Freshman,1,if you dorm they make you park a mile away. horrible 
College Student,1,Mercy College continually made mistakes on my financial aid information. Providing me with money and then taking it away in the next month. I repeatedly had to readjust the number of classes I was going to take each semester and how much money I needed to put up myself to cover the cost of school. I have already attended college once and my experience with Mercy College has been the worst I have ever had in terms of applying for and receiving my financial aid. 
College Sophomore,1,My school is very small and most of the fun happens in the main campus. 
College Junior,1,"Do not come here if you are interested in finding someone ""special""... just don't."
College Junior,1,"Dry campus, no visitors allowed other than Fri and Sat... Cannot park anywhere but secluded lot away from any light. You must attend class or you will not received financial aid... List goes on and on.. "
College Junior,1,Mary jane is around every corner and prescription pills... This comes back to the type of people Mercy admits to the school... I wish they would up there requirements because it is a beautiful campus. 
College Junior,1,"If you love sports, look else wear! Athletics at Mercy are pretty lame and don't go beyond the occasional game... I've never seen the gym used for anything other than  the school athletics. "
College Junior,1,"Roaches, expensive, loud and small.. it doesn't get much worst. And, if you don't get on-campus housing they stick you in hotel rooms they rent out for the semester that are up to 9 miles away!!!!"
College Junior,1,"So expensive! But, worth it if you are ready to live off-campus.. Especially since Mercy has very, very strict dorming rules. "
College Junior,1,"If you take the Metro into NYC you have every option! But, the metro stops at 1:30am and that means early nights for any party-goers. It is expensive to go out unless you take advantage of the sports team parties which are few and far between and fairly ""exclusive"". "
College Junior,1,Applying is difficult at this school if your family has working parents and are above lower-middle class... You get very little aid and most people I have come across have to figure out complicated loans to afford school. It is very inconvenient. 
College Junior,1,"Not too many opp-campus dining around. Everything far driving distance, not much is around campus"
College Junior,1,There needs to be more parking spots and the spaces are small
College Junior,1,"While Mercy is extremely strict with their overall security and it its a very safe school, they tend to shrug off the quiet hours policy in the dorm halls. As a student with morning classes, its less than ideal and very aggravating to say the least. Students also have to park on the opposite side of campus. I have actually had to fight about it with security because they gave me a ticket on move-in day because I was parked in the dorm parking lot for around 15-20 minutes as I was moving in."
College Sophomore,1,"Honestly Mercy college is so un-organized. Their faculty ALWAYS ""loses"" paperwork and messes up things. And at the end of the day Mercy college ALWAYS says you owe more money than what you owe. They do not do their job how they are supposed to and something has to change. Don't get me wrong the school is nice and teachers too but if they mess up so much on your paperwork, financial aid and the money you pay for your education that's really what matters at the end of the day."
College Senior,1,Mercy college fails to give student the majors we ask for. Its always great to check if you are registered for the right major.
College Senior,1,People at this school don't really get along. The worse thing is meeting a group of people that will then become phony and act like they don't know you. The way students dress is good though. You can be comfortable wearing a sweater or sweat pant every day because no one is trys to compete.
College Sophomore,1,Not many options. So much food that's nasty. The only thing that is probably good is the salads
College Junior,1,I was told from other students and a worker in the cafe that traces of Ghonerria have been fonund in cafe on sandwhich counter. The thing that bothers me is they plan on firing lessings (cafe servers) next semester. Why not now ? Also where is the health inspectors to close them down now? Something has to be done.
College Student,1,"Money wise they will screw you over & won't think twice about it, this is just a bad school. Thats how i feel about it"
College Student,1,Pretty much one of the most boring places in thr world. If it wasnt for my roommate & friends i would have died
College Sophomore,1,"If you are looking to go to a 'party school' Mercy IS NOT the place... and I mean this in the most sincere way possible. It is a dry campus, and most RA's enforce that rule. The city is just a train ride away but that can get pricey. "
College Sophomore,1,Most of the spaces available at the time classes start are a good five minute uphill walk from classes.
College Junior,1,The worst ever. The meal plans are of and the food is alright. Just picture eating the same thing every day
College Freshman,1,"In the dorms, there aren't very many people who can actually enforce the rules. There is a lot of drinking and drug use on campus. Many of the RA's attend parties over the weekends and come back to school  intoxicated. They are strict about the use of extension cords though, they will take those away if they are found in your room."
College Sophomore,1,"I have had trouble with my financial aid, to the point where I dread doing it every year. The school is very unorganized in this department."
College Sophomore,1,Mercy College doesn't really have a Greek Life. It would be great if they did but they don't. I'm at the bronx campus so we have very little of any activity.
College Junior,1,"One Person Can Change Everything – As a student in their 'seemingly' corporate world, if you happen to have your own opinions about something, or are a strong willed person who values ethics and education and you come across a director or coordinator of an assistance program, you are doomed to ridicule ; as they spread the news through the entire faculty and staff when possible to damage your reputation as a student with truth and honor when you stand up for your self when they do wrong to you or others. It becomes a cat fight instead of a resolution process."
College Junior,1,"The college does not discriminate against sexual orientation. If anything, I've been taken advantage of a woman dressed like a male in a higher up position. This college has no problem with  that, but my religion [Catholic] has not been taken seriously, even mocked by one of my professors in the Math department.  The campus is not that diverse, with most of its population made up from African American, Hispanic , Bronx residents. (Including myself, mixed with Native American Indian) and as such, most of the students are from low served, underrepresented communities, or parents returning to school, and so on. The political beliefs are not important on campus. The college displays Caucasian marketing schemes, even on its website. When helping to host a give back service initiative to make the world 'a greener place' the flier only showed Caucasian students, and it was hosted April's black history month. On top of this, during the last 6 months, 4 African American employees/staff have resigned."

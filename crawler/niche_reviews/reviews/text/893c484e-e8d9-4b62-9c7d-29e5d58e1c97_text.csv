Senior,5,"Great university, great location, great professors, cost to attend is higher than most other universities"
Senior,5,"Due to covid-19 all of my classes for fall 2020 went online, but my previous in class experience was great"
Junior,5,"I love Monmouth University. What I love about college is the fact that the campus has about 5000 students enrolled, small class sizes, amazing professors, and great learning techniques."
Junior,5,"Although I would not prefer online learning at Monmouth, it isn't as bad as I expected. I do like the zoom meeting that my professors assign because it makes the lessons much easier.r"
Sophomore,5,"The professors are very nice, they like to see their students succeed in their classes. The ones that I have had are understanding, especially during the COVID-19 situation."
Sophomore,5,"I love the location of the school itself, it is so close to Long Branch Beach and they have great food options as well. The campus is not too big which is a plus to me because I like not having to walk so far to classes and knowing most of the students that I go to school with. All the professors I have had so far are all so helpful and very motivating to do better with school, work, and for my future. I am very happy to be at such an amazing school and can't wait for the next three years I have left."
Graduate Student,5,"Excellent school. The student is body is great with amazing professors in every department. The history and anthropology department is easily the greatest department there which is full of amazing faculty. The campus is beautiful, and I learned and am currently learning so much from being there."
Sophomore,5,All of my professors adapted incredibly well to the online switch. They emailed us every day and it was always very clear what they expected of us. They were also very forgiving as they recognized we were all going through a very unusual time.
Sophomore,5,"Incredible school if you want it to be. The opportunities are there if you make the effort to network with professors. The small class sizes allow you to be a big fish in a small pond if you work hard. Beautiful campus and location, great community. If you have a good scholarship I couldn’t recommend it more. Just make sure you reach out to professors who are in your field of interest and you can get far."
Sophomore,5,"The transition to online learning was definitely challenging for professors at MU but most of mine were up to the challenge. Older professors did not know how to work the online system we use, ""On-Campus"", which lead to my class being completed at mid-terms. Other classes had Zoom meetings and weekly discussion boards on topics we covered. All in all, the professors had challenges at first but became very reasonable and flexible as the weeks continued."
Sophomore,5,I had no issues completely my semester remotely. All of my professors responded and were there when we needed help.
Sophomore,5,I love Monmouth University’s culture. I love all the staff and dining hall workers. The vibe of being by the beach is unbeatable.
Senior,5,I absolutely love Monmouth. Amazing professors who truly care about their students. Student welfare is their main priority.
Alum,5,"Monmouth is an incredible place to start and complete an academic journey. It's environment is one that cultivates and fosters education for the sake of learning as much as one can in his or her own field of choice. The professors help and challenge students to become the best versions of themselves. In all, MU is a great university where 70-75% of the professors have terminal degrees in their respective fields. This knowledge and small class size only further empower a student to acquire as much information as he or she possibly can in a relatively short amount of time. In all, MU is a great value when comparing it to other institutions in New Jersey."
Senior,5,"Monmouth has such a warm, inviting campus. The professors are really amazing and always willing to help in and out of the classroom to help students succeed. The campus has so many amazing resources such as tutoring and clubs to help students meet others."
Sophomore,5,"I am in love with Monmouth University, it is such a beautiful campus. All my professors are very helpful and kind. My classmates as well are very cool, friendly, and easy to make friends with. I would highly recommend anyone who is debating going to this campus. I would want them to change the aspect of having to take law for an accounting major. It is one of the hardest, confusing, classes that we have to take as a business major."
Senior,5,Monmouth is a wonderful school that provides many opportunities to its students. Professors for the most part were professional and helpful and classes within majors are great.
Junior,5,"Monmouth University has given me a widespread amount of opportunities. From the involvement on campus to the academics, Monmouth is the best option."
Freshman,5,"Monmouth University is such a unique college and I love how diverse, and impactful it is. I can’t wait to start my journey and eventually complete it with my Bachelors in Mathematics!"
Freshman,5,"There are so many fantastic things about Monmouth but the one thing I always tell everyone I love is how small it is. All the professors know your name and encourage coming to office hours, everyone at the university wants to see you succeed. With the size, you get a ton of individualized attention and effort to help you learn and grow. You make many friends and it is so easy to make them because of all the constant campus events/activities. The only thing I would like to see change on campus is including more food/places to eat. Which the student government is actually currently working on right now for next year."
Sophomore,5,"Monmouth University is a beautiful, inviting campus. The small classes make it easy to get to know your professors and peers. The staff around campus are always pleasant. They have some of the nicest dinning hall staff. 

The freshman dorms are very small but most of the buildings are nice. Some buildings have a gym attached. This is very convenient. 

It is not a very big school but I wish there was a bit more school spirit and attendance at sporting events.   

Overall great experience at Monmouth university so far."
Sophomore,5,Very beautiful campus with small class sizes. Professors are attentive. Multiple clubs and organizations to get involved in.
Sophomore,5,"Monmouth University offers a high quality education and sets one up for success in the future. The professors are very helpful and class sizes are relatively small, no big lecture rooms etc. Also, Monmouth gives students many opportunities through job/internship fairs for plans after their time at the university is over. And always there are opportunities to get involved in something or do something meaningful."
Sophomore,5,This was my 1st choice school and I love it here. The classes are easy to manage yet challenging at the same time. The campus and area around it are beautiful and relatively safe. Greek Life and parties are a plus the residential life also do a good job of running activities and getting students involved. I feel I am on the right track with what I want to do in my life thanks to my time at MU.
Senior,5,Monmouth is a great school if you're looking for a friendly environment and a challenging intellectual environment
Freshman,5,"Beautiful campus and surrounding area while feeling safe at all times. Some really great professors with interesting and challenging classes. Party scene could be better and you can feel like an outsider if you don't know anyone there or who is going there, due to the fact that majority of students are from New Jersey."
Junior,5,"This school is by far the best university I’ve attended so far. This school really cares about your education, your concerns, questions, and your future. They have an amazing staff of professors, counselors, and students. Whenever I need help with something, they transfer me to the best person that could handle my concern. The classes are small and easier to learn. There are plenty of majors and minors. When undecided, they also help you on finding your passion. The professors push and help students achieve their best work. No other university can care as much as this school does. It is expensive but it is worth it, when trying to receive the best and most stable education."
Senior,5,"Monmouth University has become my second home the last three years, and has helped me grow into the person I am today. I have strived in college so far achieving a 3.95 GPA due to the great professors, the curriculum, and all of the resources provided to us students here at Monmouth. I have met so many new friends and nice people, and I feel as though Monmouth is one of the most welcoming and family type colleges out there."
Junior,5,"My favorite part about Monmouth are the many opportunities I was able to gain access to through attending. I have become a host of my own radio show for Monmouth, joined numerous clubs, and this semester will be my first year in the wrestling program."
Freshman,5,Small University near the beach. Student to faculty ration is low. Very personable and friendly. Beautiful and safe campus.
Graduate Student,5,I loved attending Monmouth University about the Professors truly care about each and every one of their students. Every professor I had knew me on a first name basis by the second week of classes and I could reach out to them at any time. They always made office hours available and helped me as much as possible to make sure I did not get behind in class. I believe my college experience was stress free all thanks to my professors and advisers.
Freshman,5,"Monmouth University offers many ways for students to become involved with the community, ranging from athletics to volunteer work and even jobs. It is much appreciated coming from a poor background and allows me the opportunity to give back to my community and gain experience in my major, that is, Communications. I have only heard great things from this school and hope to make the best of it!"
Niche User,5,I do  not go to Monmouth University as a student yet. I was accepted and will attend in the fall. When I went to take a tour it was very beautiful
Freshman,5,"I have absolutely loved my experience at MU so far. As a first-year student who came from out of state, I would say that I adjusted well and became comfortable with the campus and the school very quickly. I have met a great number of new friends, have had some very good professors, and have as well become quite involved on campus. There are ALWAYS things to do and events being offered for students. It is very easy to find a job on campus as well. The food is not bad, and the hours for the dining hall are nice. The campus is absolutely beautiful and very close to the beach. The campus has an amazing community feel and I always feel safe. There are so many nice students here, and you get the opportunity to see familiar faced around campus all the time.  I have loved my first year at Monmouth University and can't wait to return in the fall."
Freshman,5,"Overall Monmouth is a great place to get an education.  The only thing is that tuition is continually on the rise, but scholarship packages increase as well."
Freshman,5,The people around campus are great. The school itself is beautiful and it has so many internship opportunities.
Graduate Student,5,"The campus, the social life, the location right in the heart of the jersey shore. I cannot say enough good things about Monmouth. I transferred there in 2014 as a junior and had the most amazing memories in two years, that some don't even get to experience in 4. Thanks, Monmouth for a great education and time!"
Niche User,5,"Monmouth is a division 1 school, that offers a large range of majors. It has the appropriate size for my liking, and its not far from major cities in the surrounding area."
Niche User,5,"I love everything about Monmouth University, the location, the students, the athletics, and the food."
Graduate Student,5,Monmouth University has a very strong Education program. Education majors get out into the schools early and are provided with many opportunities to observe teachers and teach their own lessons throughout the required courses. Monmouth University's professors and other employees are very approachable and will offer any help they can to ensure that Monmouth students have everything they need to be successful. The campus is small which provides a great space to build community and relationships with fellow students.
Alum,5,"As a recent graduate of Monmouth University, I am pleased to say that I’ve received my degree from this institution. I firmly believe that what you put into your college education is what you will get back, and MU provides every student the opportunity to succeed. I’m extremely grateful for all of the connections I’ve made with both professors and peers that will serve me well as I continue my education."
Niche User,5,I love the campus at Monmouth University. I grew up just a few minutes away and every single aspect of Monmouth makes you feel at home. The beach is extremely close which makes it fun during the warmer months.
Niche User,5,i loved everything about Monmouth. I truly felt at home when I visited and felt a genuine connection with everyone I met.
Graduate Student,5,I like the professor but I am not a fan on how dark the parking lots are at night and not that many security driving around
Sophomore,5,"Going to this school has changed my life. I came from very far out of state and I feel at home here. People are generally happy and laid back, it makes it easy to make friends. class sizes are very small even in 100 level courses. For the most part the professors care very much about what they teach and in my major (chemistry/biology) they activity work in the field as well as teach. The campus police (MUPD) are very present but they are not overbearing.  The area around Monmouth is a nicer area so with that you get quality options for off campus housing but a more active police department. Many house parties are shut down because of noise complaints from annoyed neighbors.

*For student athletes*
Monmouth has the best weight lifting and sports med programs ever. The lift trainers are engaging, knowledgeable, and very committed to your progress. Sports med will help you out with anything from a sore throat to a broken leg."
Niche User,5,I went only for a tour but the environment was so welcoming and friendly. The campus was really beautiful and have a 13:1 student ratio is really good. The nursing program is very small which gives more room for one on one professor talk.
Freshman,5,"Monmouth University is an excellent Institute and defines my personal dream of what college is to me. Monmouth University is gorgeous with its unique architecture which was actually used in the film, Annie. They offer various majors, minors with accessible technologies. Also their sports programs are high quality throughout each types of sports."
Sophomore,5,"Being at Monmouth was an amazing experience for me because although the campus is small, there is so much to do. Everyone is involved with everything, sports games are amazing, and everyone is friendly. Although it’s D1 for sports, the athletes don’t necessarily keep to themselves. I had plenty of friends that were on sports teams that would hang out and go to eat with me and were just very inclusive to everyone."
Freshman,5,"The experience so far has been amazing the people are nice, the dorms are not too small not to big. The activities to do around campus are surplus so many. You kind of get involved without knowing."
Sophomore,5,"I love how its a medium size campus. its like everyone knows everyone etc.
the frist semester I was going to Monmouth I just fell in love I mean it was my dream school since I was 13. I love how I can possibly take a semester in DC thats so cool."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Monmouth University and the community connect to it. It is such an amazing place to learn with the beautiful campus and outstanding professors. I wouldn’t change anything about this school!!
Junior,5,I love that Monmouth University is a small school.  I rarely have more than 30 students in my classes and it allows more interaction with the professor which helps academically.
Junior,5,All faculty and assistance members who are at your immediate aid and so genuine and helpful only add to the already-present beauty of the school! Love it and everyone there so much!
Junior,5,"As a recent transfer student, Monmouth has opened a whole new set of doors into my future!  Best decision I ever made!"
Freshman,5,"As I am ending my first year at Monmouth University, I have experienced a lot and love the place that I put myself in from the start of the year. Being a student at this university has shaped me into a better person because of the responsibilities that I have on my plate, as well as being shaped to be an adult and live in the real world once I am out of college. The small campus had made me feel at home, I know I am safe here at all times, and even though this school is a little bit pricey, I would never want to go anywhere else."
Senior,5,The experience I receive from Monmouth is incredible and the professors and advisors are very helpful with career and future choices according to your corresponding major.
Alum,5,College is what you make of it.. monmouth offers those looking for opportunity to grow amd learn exactly that!
Senior,5,"The school has a small, close-knit, family-feel without being too small.  I love the faculty and staff, and there are always academic challenges to push me to my best.  The Honors School is incredible, and the English and Education departments are top notch."
Junior,5,"As a current junior at Monmouth University, I noticed that the professors are willing to work very hard with you to ensure you succeed. I enjoyed all of my classes so far. The administration work to help you in any way they can and the campus is absolutely beautiful. Everyone seems friendly and you feel safe on campus as well. There is a sense of community that you feel even off campus because the surrounding stores support the university as well. The weather is great and you are right by the beach. This university, I feel, really works hard to get you where you need to be and teach you what is needed to get into the field of the major you chose. I would definitely recommend this university to others and am proud to be a Monmouth hawk."
Freshman,5,Monmouth is a beautiful university. The campus is diverse and feels safe at all times. It is a campus that you would benefit to have your car. A lot of people going home on the weekends but just as much stay. The teachers care about there students and are always open to answer any questions.
Freshman,4,When I visited Monmouth University I noticed that the campouse was really nice and that everyone on campus was really nice too.
Alum,4,I had an amazing time at Monmouth but graduated with a degree that has no real value in the real world. Unfortunately it does not help students find a good job
Alum,4,I did not really have an online experience but I am sure they have the best technology available to help students.
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience with Monmouth University is very good and some of the reasons is that the professors are very helpful, there always programs/tutors to help with classes, and it's overall a friendly environment. Everyone helps one and other."
Sophomore,4,I took online my second semester and it was fine. The some professor would make video conference to lecture the lesson and other ones would send the work/reading assignment through email. And I found both fine with it.
Sophomore,4,"The classes are smaller and the professors are very caring and are willing to help. The campus is small as well and it makes it much easier to get to classes on time. Although, for commuters it can sometimes be difficult to find parking spaces."
Sophomore,4,"Since the rest of my semester this year was online since COVID, I had a better understanding of what online school and classes look like. As I am not the biggest fan of online classes, I am glad that I was able to try it for the first time even though COVID was the reason on why we had online classes. My professors were all very helpful online and gave us the ability to have one-on-one zoom calls if we needed assistance or a better understanding of the lesson that was taught. The reason why I give it a very good then excellent is because I have taken a language this semester and it was hard to understand it over the zoom calls. It is much easier to visualize it on a white board then just talking to my professor about the lesson."
Graduate Student,4,"Professors helped me transition to online very well. I was also a teaching assistant, and teaching online was very easy with their ecampus and virtual classroom systems."
Sophomore,4,"As an out-of-state student I was terrified of the reviews saying how Monmouth is very cliquey and only NJ people. However, after my freshman year I knew right away this was my home. College is all about putting yourself out there and if you're one to sit in your room crying over how you have no one after the second week of school, I would try a little harder. There's going to be mean people anywhere you go so finding ""your people"" is the most important. I found my people at MU and I absolutely love it here. The food and on-campus housing at MU could definitely improve but you start to embrace it as one of the things you love about the school after your first semester. Class sizes are smaller and very easy to learn from being only 35 people MAX, professors are ALL accessible and welcoming. Greek life and athletics run the campus but welcome all people as long as you are friendly as well. Join Greek Life if you aren't an athlete, you'll thank me later."
Freshman,4,"Easy to make new friends and great professors. Although the party scenes at Monmouth could improve and the RA’s could be nicer, Monmouth’s Student Center is awesome"
Freshman,4,"Monmouth had its up and downs. But overall, I would never regret coming here. The amount of opportunities Monmouth offers their students, is remarkable. Their internships, study and social opportunities are exceed beyond what I can pair and it!"
Sophomore,4,I liked the grounds at the university.  The class sizes were perfect for what I was looking for.  The only thing is that sometimes you don't get the classes that you feel would be most beneficial to your goals.
Senior,4,It is a very small and welcoming university that has a lot of resources for students to take advantage of. The professors here are very caring for their students and are very concerned with student progression. There are many clubs and organizations for students to get involved with on campus as well.
Sophomore,4,"I have loved every second at Monmouth. The smaller class sizes creates a very unique and personal connection with professors, unlike many larger schools. The student and faculty around campus are very friendly and always looking to lend a hand."
Junior,4,"Monmouth University is a wonderful school with lots of opportunities to get involved. Contrary to popular belief, you do not have to be an athlete or join greek life to have a good experience! There are numerous clubs and activities to get involved with. You will meet your closest friends!"
Junior,4,Monmouth University is a great college.  The professors really care about the students and are very helpful.  The campus is very pretty and well maintained.  The students are diverse and welcoming.
Sophomore,4,"I really like the size of the campus. The professors spend time getting to know each student because of smaller class sizes, and the workload is never too much. The options available to students are great and the faculty wants their students to succeed."
Niche User,4,"While attending accepted students day, I had the pleasure to hear from some of Monmouth's students.  They all had very different stories and reasons for attending Monmouth, however each student was in love with their school.  Each student was already very far in their career paths as well and have had many internship opportunities provided to them by Monmouth."
Freshman,4,The teachers are really great and helpful with the students. There are also many things to do on campus.
Sophomore,4,"Monmouth is a small community but it is a close community! The small size allows you to find your place easier, make friends easier, connect with professors and staff, and allows it to feel more like home. I never regret coming to this school."
Freshman,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Monmouth University so far. In just one semester, I have had many opportunities to branch out and try new things that I never would have before. This is coming at no loss to my academic career, as I feel adequately challenged in my courses and enjoy working with my professors and peers."
Sophomore,4,Monmouth is a very small predominantly white university. not much to do outside of campus. if you don't have a car on campus it isolated and boring
Alum,4,"I transferred and commuted here because Monmouth offered me generous scholarships. I now work in the Los Angeles entertainment industry.  This college is what you make of it.  I thought Monmouth would be a joke, but  was surprised by the level of challenge in the political science and sociology departments in particular. The professors here were  great and I still keep in contact with them two years after graduating. 
    The campus is divided between ditzy rich kids and students who are incredibly intellectual.  My only complaints are that Monmouth must take steps to be more selective in admissions, and bring more awareness to the college outside of sports. Monmouth is perfectly positioned to be a research University if it takes the steps."
Sophomore,4,"Monmouth University is overall a great location and area. More importantly, the education opportunities available at Monmouth University are amazing. As a freshman, I was not too overwhelmed with all the new changes. The faculty at Monmouth are very helpful and supportive in creating a comfortable environment to live and learn. The reason Monmouth does not get five stars is because I was not overly impressed with the living arrangements for freshman."
Freshman,4,"Monmouth makes every student feel like an individual, you are not just a number in the classroom. Coming from a small, Catholic high school, this was exactly the type of classroom experience that I wanted. I was nervous that I would not be able to put myself out there academically and socially, but Monmouth makes it very easy to become involved! I have even won a Dean's Excellence award during the Education Department's Scholarship week in the spring! Without Monmouth, I would not have been able to accomplish certain things and I guarentee I would not have accomplished these amazing things at  any other college!"
Sophomore,4,"Monmouth my first year has been a great experience, beautiful campus and lots of teachers and helpers to look out for you academically. The only downside to monmouth was food selections were poor. There is few to chose from at the student center, and the amount of dining dollars we receive should be a lot more than what it is. With all the money the school is making, we should be getting a lot more things for free/with our dining dollars"
Junior,4,"I really enjoy being a student at Monmouth. There are so many different activities going on daily, which gives students the opportunity to get involved and meet new people. The school is great for connections, however it is extremely expensive and financial aid is not helpful at all."
Freshman,4,"As a Freshman at Monmouth, I am having a great time.  The campus is beautiful and there is enough to do in the surrounding areas. Granted, it is a summer town so the options may be on the limited side during the winter months.  As for the classroom, I like how the class size are on the smaller side, lest than 35 students.  In addition, I enjoy how all of my professors have a connection with their students that you would not get at a big state school.  I will say that Monmouth is a big Greek school but there are opportunities presented by student ran organizations to have an active Friday night without going to a party. I recommend Monmouth but I will not say it is a perfect school because they do not exist."
Freshman,4,"I personally love Monmouth University. (Most) of the professors are very nice and helpful, while of course there are a few the school could replace. The campus is beautiful, spacious, but also not that big. The residence buildings are kept clean for the most part, unless you have dirty fellow students. The food is above expectations, as there is a regular dining hall and a students center with a Dunkin’ Donuts, Jersey Mike’s, and a few others. But above all, the best thing about the school is the squirrels."
Alum,4,"Overall, I enjoyed y experience at Monmouth University. I found the professors to be very supportive of their staff. The grounds were always well maintained by their excellent grounds crew. My only issues with the schools were with the actual organization of the school, i.e. the admissions office was disorganized, parking for commuters was horrible, etc."
Junior,4,Monmouth is a great school that offers good class sizes and many options for majors. The campus is beautiful and it is easy for students to become involved and enjoy their time at the university.
Sophomore,4,"Monmouth is located in Long Branch, New Jersey, which is a shore town. The campus and surrounding areas are beautiful. The university attracts students who are academically motivated to succeed. The athletic teams participate in NCAA Division I. School spirit is okay, not the best, at athletic events. Social life is average. Monmouth prides itself as being one of the most beautiful universities with a good return on your investment as a student."
Niche User,4,I went to Monmouth University on a college visit and then for several tours and open houses because I just couldn't get enough of it and they always had more and new information to tell me about. The campus gave such a nice feel and they show you all the safety features where if you have a class late at night and you feel uncomfortable going back you can have security walk with you and its open 24/7. Food was good and professors are very nice and understanding of there students.
Niche User,4,The campus was beautiful but the freshmen dorms were very small. other than that the campus was very big the facilities were clean the teacher to student ratio is small so you get a lot of one on one interaction with your teacher for help and the safety in the dorms are very well.
Freshman,4,I enjoy the classes and academic atmosphere at Monmouth University. The University has provided me with a place to call home and expand my academic knowledge in a place where I am inclined to put forth my best performance and effort.
Niche User,4,Monmouth has a beautiful campus and is right by the beach which doesn't hurt. The school events and sports are pretty big if that's something you'd like. Professors are nice and willing to help if you're willing to help yourself. I'm not a huge fan of the traditional residence halls but they offer many options which is good.
Graduate Student,4,Monmouth is a beautiful school with amazing people and staff. So much to do in convenient timing. The sports are unbelievable along with tailgating and the students that support the campus and sports is surreal.
Freshman,4,Not only is its campus beautiful but its academics are very challenging. Its food comes with a variety of options and the faculty are incredibly helpful and friendly.
Alum,4,"I got my bachelor's in science at Monmouth University. The class sizes were small and professors were very helpful. If you're not 21, the party scene is lame."
Senior,4,"Choosing to spend four years at Monmouth University was the best thing I could have ever done for myself.  Although it is not a big institution, everything I need is offered. The professors do expect a lot out of their students, so I am always focused and ready to reach new goals with the help of them. The environment and the people here make it even better. It is my home away from home."
Junior,4,Monmouth is a place to really strive towards your goals. The people here really care for everyone's well being. Professors make it easy to reach out to them and create a very welcoming environment. The campus is beyond beautiful and only a mile away from the shore! Getting involved on campus is easy and  highly recommended. Clubs are always open for more people.
College Freshman,4,I am a music student hard to find this major at other. Schools.
College Freshman,4,I have see many diverse people on campus from many areas
College Senior,4,"As an art student, the stereotype of having people from all walks of life is true. Yet, everyone is very accepting regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, etc. In the general school seen I have never experienced any challenges in the acceptance of a specific person for any reason. Overall the campus is a very inclusive and accepting one."
College Senior,4,"Usage and peer pressure of drugs and alcohol are rarely seen, if students are doing it it is discreet but it is college so it is happening."
College Freshman,4,I am a music industry major and being so close to Phili and NY is a big plus when it comes to internships.
College Sophomore,4,School is nice the professors care and its must my type
College Sophomore,4,Our athletic facility is great for all students
College Junior,4,"Class sizes allow connections with professors, and there are hundreds of courses to pick from."
College Junior,4,Finding jobs and internships are made easy and it's a great location. Professors I've had always encourage students to visit during office hours for additional help. They want you to succeed.
College Sophomore,4,For the most part my professors are very passionate about their course topics and encourage students to take other classes with them again! The class is small and that makes the environment more intimate with the students and gives students the oppurunity for a one-on-one question at any time!
College Sophomore,4,"No matter what sport, the athletes at my school are amazing and wake up early before class and manage to dedicate themselves to the the team and to their classes! It's amazing to see hardworkers living up to their full potential!"
College Sophomore,4,"Monmouth University is a home to many and the scenery is relaxing. Even as a commuter I've still made some friends and just meeting all types of people in the same situation as me, makes it an enjoyable experience! Learning about different lifestyles and habits are my favorite parts about my school. The classes are for the most part not too long and the professors use the time wisely. If I could, I would choose Monmouth all over again, because I'm certain that the education I'm receiving there will lead to a great outcome in my future!"
College Freshman,4,I think the biggest sport at Monmouth is definitely Basketball.
College Freshman,4,Monmouth University is a great college. It is very small and some people do not like that but it makes everything more hands on and personal.
College Sophomore,4,"It's great, but not the best. Many people are pressured to join Greek life or a sports team to gain access to the most parties. With the cops of the town being very strict with students, a lot of parties can be exclusive to Greek life or sports. There are a lot of mixers. However, the frats do throw open parties and they can be a lot of fun. Although there are mixers, there's a chance that there's also an open party going on. Many students will see familiar faces at parties and that's what makes it more fun and comfortable to go out. Frat and sports parties are definitely the best, and when the weather gets warm out, day drinks are the best part about Monmouth."
College Sophomore,4,"Monmouth is located in a wealthy, suburban town. The campus has its own police station with policemen. There are emergency phones all over campus to contact the university police station in case students do not feel safe on campus for whatever reason. There is not much crime on campus and people generally feel safe all the time."
College Sophomore,4,"Career services has a group of vibrant, positive workers that make it so easy to communicate to them and ask for help for internships and jobs. I have been there to ask for recommendations for where to get internships and assessments to help me me figure out which program would fit best for me. They are so friendly and make asking for help so easy. It's easy to access and you can pretty much walk in and talk to someone. Also, career services sends out an email every month with hiring jobs and internships around the area."
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life at Monmouth is huge. So huge that people are pressured to join an organization to get the best of Monmouth. With the school being small, people see Greek life as a different unit on campus. People believe they are snobby and are only good for the parties. Although I'm not in an organization, some of my closest friends are in Greek organizations and they are great people. Greek life throws down a lot of parties here, both fraternities and sororities."
College Sophomore,4,I'm learning a lot and doing well.
Senior,2,"They have the size and atmosphere of a small school, with only about 6,000 students. However, the offices of the President, Registrar, Bursar, etc. have no care for the individual students. Asking them questions is futile and the reasoning behind going to a small school goes out the window. If it weren't for the few amazing professors and friendly people around campus, they would be 1 star. Monmouth administration does not put in the effort a school of its size is expected to.  Not to mention a terrible mental health system on campus, no point whatsoever in approaching them at all. Socially, half of the campus goes home on the weekends. Plus, the school has policy after policy that disrespects and undermines the potential success of BIPOC students. This University certainly has its positives, but the negatives are blaring."
Freshman,2,"Overall, Monmouth was just not the school for me. Although having small, intimate class sizes was nice, the overall size of the school was too small. There wasn't much to do if you aren't a part of Greek life or athletics. The environment was not enjoyable and I found myself miserable going there."
Freshman,2,"a lot of money for mediocre experience (food, classes, housing, activities, area). unless you have a car there isn't much to do. many of the people are from the area so they're not friendly to people they don't know. parties are boring, sports (except basketball) are boring. all around not great for the crazy amount of money you spend."
Alum,2,"If you are not half brain dead, do not go here! The academic level at Monmouth is a complete joke. I majored in Business Finance and i graduated with a 3.8. The classes are not challenging enough but boy do they make some of the worthless gen ed classes a nightmare. Nonetheless, no matter how much they award you in scholarship do not be lured in just because of that .If you still want go here then definitely join Greek life or your time at Monmouth will be a complete let down. Trying to end on a positive note, I will say since the school is near the shore the bar life is great, the campus is gorgeous, and its D1 athletic teams are pretty good for a small private school."
College Freshman,2,"Freshmen dorms are very old, outdated and no air conditioning.  No not get much but pay alot."
College Sophomore,2,No success with internships but hoping this improves next year.
College Sophomore,2,"If anyone asked me what I didn't like about my school, it'd be the issue with diversity. There is absolutely no diversity on this campus as most people are conservative republicans, white, and wealthy. Many people are also split into Greeks and sports, causing a divide on campus. I believe there would be more social stimulation on campus if there was a higher degree of diversity. It's hard to experience different cultures and backgrounds as it is a homogenous student body."
College Sophomore,2,"With a large population of students in Greek life and sports, many of them partake in alcohol and drug activities at parties, such as drinking and smoking. The campus is strict with it and if you're caught, they treat alcohol violations like a burglary, over dramatic and everything. No one is peer pressured to do anything, just a lot of people partake in it."
College Freshman,2,The RA's are the worst.
College Junior,2,"My freshman year I lived in Elmwood Hall. There was no air conditioning and you had no control of the heat. It was about 90° in the dorms until about mid-October, where the heat was then turned on for the rest of the year. The rooms were cramped and communal bathrooms were rather dirty. This year I live in the University Bluffs. The apartment is so nice yet I live in a newly renovated one. I hear the others are not even remotely as nice."
College Junior,2,Still waiting to see when my tuition will pay off in career opportunities and placement. But they still ask me to donate every year.
College Freshman,2,"The dining hall food just goes right through you. However, we are supposedly getting a new supplier for food next year so praying that it is 10x better."
College Freshman,2,Sports teams that have been caught drinking on campus have been able to avoid any summons or online alcohol class while those not on a sports team the RAs seem to be stricter and automatically call the police. When complaining about noise the RAs rarely do anything if they do anything at all.
College Freshman,2,"Very difficult to get in, not much benefits."
College Junior,2,"Black kids and white kids hang out together, especially amongst the athletes. This is nothing special though in 2014 obviously, so besides that everyone is pretty homogenous. Every girl has long hair, alex + ahi bracelets, riding boots, leggings, and a north face on at all times and the guys are just as predictable. Not the school to go to if you are unique...this was the hardest part of adjusting to monmouth for me."
College Junior,2,"Hazing, gross parties, just ew."
College Junior,2,"I would not ever feel unsafe walking around on campus, but my drink was spiked at a frat party my first semester of my freshman year. I never went to one again and I as lucky to make it into a cab and home until the drugs took full effect...scary."
College Sophomore,2,The school is majority white. It's the typical white girl who is trying to outpretty the other white girl when at the end they all look the same. The typical white jock whose always wearing some type of athletic gear.
College Sophomore,2,"From what I have heard the shuttles are terrible. They tend to run on there own time and if there is bad weather they will not work even if classes are still on, failing to advise the students as they wait. The public transportation is all over the place (again this is what I hear) constantly changing year round."
College Freshman,2,"I recently just graduated with a BA in psychology from Ramapo College of New Jersey.  I will be attending Monmouth University to receive my masters degree in Mental Health Counseling.  Monmouth has a great psychology program, and I am grateful for receiving this opportunity.  However, it is $36,000 a year and financial aid only gave me $20,000.  I am 21 years old and only have a waitressing job while interning on the side.  I do not know how financial aid expects me to pay for the other $16,000."
College Junior,2,I WISH IT WAS BIGGER AND BETTER :( IT MAKES ME SO SAD
College Junior,2,Not diverse. White kid U.
College Junior,2,"AWFUL AWFUL REG. system, No TAs, COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE ADVISORS, and little to no class avail."
College Junior,2,"Very few printers, and most computers are outdated Dells."
College Sophomore,2,My major is health and physical education which is really broad. I want to be an athletic trainer so many of my classes are bull and don't pertain to what I want to study.
College Sophomore,2,Predominantly white. Very few minorities.
College Sophomore,2,The school could be a tad overboard making the college experience not as awesome.
College Freshman,2,I did not receive any financial aid. Monmouth is too cheap and would rather spend the money on the landscaping than their students.
College Freshman,2,"The social scene is terrible. Everyone is stuck up and is living off mommy and daddy's penny. No one knows how to work for themselves. There are very few genuine, down to earth people here. Everyone thinks they are better than everyone else."
College Freshman,2,There's really no place  to hangout. And who wants to walk around on campus in 2 degree weather anyway? Its a beautiful campus but its not a place to call home.
College Sophomore,2,Tuition is very expensive and I feel as though I did not get as much aid as I deserved. 
College Junior,2,I believe the cost of living is absolutely ridiculous. There are some dorms that are in no way the same of others. Its just about luck when getting housing freshman year.
College Freshman,2,Shuttles aren't needed for our campus. The school does do different trips around to different places like NYC
College Sophomore,2,The campus is very conservative and there is a lot of politics that goes behind trying to get approval for having certain events and programs ran on campus. The police can also be very strict with how they enforce the rules.
College Sophomore,2,There are not that many people of different races at Monmouth. For the most part the University is made up of mostly white students.
College Senior,2,"Monmouth seriously lacks diversity.  A huge percentage of students are from NJ and NY so you'll probably know many of them or have at least one mutual friend with them.  That helps when you're getting to know people as a Freshman.  Almost everyone is white and either middle or upper class.  Appearance is important for most and some complain that everyone has a ""Jersey Shore"" look.  Most girls are pretty, tan, and dressed nicely.  Guys think its a big deal to work out all the time and some go tanning too.  If you're looking for diversity this isn't the place for you, but there are so many great things about MU that if diversity isn't super important to you you'll see past it."
College Freshman,2,"The police force is pretty strict here when it comes to drinking and drugs. If you are considering any of this, just be desecrate and not obnoxious about it. People still partake in these activities. When it comes to parties getting busted. Most of the time people just walk out. Rarely do people get arrests and face the authorities. This isn't to say that it doesn't happen."
College Sophomore,2,"Originally I was awarded a very generous academic scholarship, for which I was very grateful. However, when my family circumstances changed the school was unable to increase my aid at all. It was very frustrating and all attempts on my part to receive more was unsuccessful."
College Freshman,2,I know a lot of kids that are involved in the athletic departments but it is definitely not one of the schools strong suits. Not very many people go to any of the games for any of the sports unless there is an even along with it like homecoming or if we are playing another big school like Villanova. The teams also don't have the best records.
College Junior,2,The academics here are not the best. The students whine and complain when they don't get the grades they want. Professors don't teach the understanding behind the concepts and leave the students feeling that they must memorize their way to an A. And then they inevitably fail in the endeavor and go on and blame the professor like children. The cycle continues.
Freshman,1,"I came here for my first year of college as an undecided student. I tried to declare a major in Marketing for my second semester and my advisor did nothing to help me. I had to choose all of my courses by myself. The community is pretty awful, to be honest. Everyone here thinks that they are above you and don't have time to care about you. I lived in a suite of 8 people and 2 of them dropped out and I along with 2 others in my suite alone will be transferring next year. Waste of money..."
Sophomore,1,"Monmouth is no ones first choice school and it shows... Greek life is dead, athletic parties consist of 10 people in a 4x4 basement... everyone else is really clicky and I came from a large high school with a class of 800 people and it wasn’t as clicky as this university. Dorms here suck and feel like literal jail cells the ac and heat NEVER works. Not to mention if you stay on campus past Friday @3- Sunday all you can eat is dining hall food which is always cold, undercooked and disgusting.  Campus is small which is convenient but there’s never anything going on so it’s rlly bland to look at grass and brick buildings. All I really have to say here is AVOID"
Niche User,1,"Over priced higher institution of B.S. I want the 90 thousand that I owe for the crappy spanish degree I wasted time, money and effort on which got me no where. Someone laughed all the way to the bank with my student loan which I now owe to make someone else richer. I want my money back!!!"
Junior,1,"This school is possibly the biggest scam out there. They constantly screw over students financially, the professors are horrible (as most of them are adjuncts), and the curriculum is a joke. They may give you an academic scholarship that is appealing, but after your first year if you don't hold a ridiculously high GPA (regardless of your major) that will be un-proportionately taken away from you. If you want to go to a school where you will get an A in an advanced science course without being challenged, but get a C in a class where you learn how to square dance and play corn hole, then Monmouth is for you. Ridiculously overpriced for the education you receive, but if you attend here its easy to see where all of your money is being spent. Consider a different university before it's too late."
Freshman,1,"Awful. Just terrible. Incredibly overpriced, the professors don't seem to care about how the students do in their classes, the people working in financial aid and the registrars office always have an attitude when you ask for help or information. I only stayed one semester before transferring out, which they made an incredibly difficult process as nobody helped me when i reached out and they took forever to send out my transcript. Basically, this school feels like a second part of high school, its cliquey and theres no real sense of community or diversity here. Don't waste your time or money at this university."
Freshman,1,"Nope. Don’t go here. Wonder why the acceptance rate is so high? Bc no one likes it here it’s miserable, small and clicky worse than high school. It’s wayyyyy to expensive for the amount of idiots that work here. Not to mention there are no food options all there is to eat is tofu, pizza and burgers. That’s it. And on the weekends? Forget about it all that’s open is the dining hall. This school sucks don’t go here. The only positive is the amount of financial aid they give you but the people in the financial aid office do not even know what’s going on. Don’t waste your money. Go somewhere else"
Senior,1,"Worst 4 years of my life
1. The professors are mostly adjunct who care more about their full time jobs than you getting a good education.
2. My advisor did little to nothing with helping me graduate within four years.
3. I had three different advisors at my time at Monmouth and not once did I put a change for one in motion.
4. Most professors have little to no education on how to educate.
5. Tuition + Housing + Books you never open + lab fees (art major) + supplies needed (art major) + Over priced meal plans = Working two jobs on top of being a full time student."
College Freshman,1,Dont go here. There is nothing to do ever. Its a big bore
College Junior,1,"I got two drinking tickets my freshman year, paid $1,000+ etc. and I am not a partier. BAD"
College Freshman,1,"The wifi goes all throughout campus, but it is horrible. Half the time I can't even hold a phone call or use my laptop in my own dorm room because of weak connection."
College Freshman,1,The freshman parking lot is so far away from the dorms. The road to cross just to get to the parking lot is so ridiculously busy and students have died while crossing it. I received a parking ticket for $15 after parking in the wrong lot for a few hours. I was in a car accident the night before and I did not get back from the hospital till about 3:30 am so I decided to park in the lot closest to my dorm as I had a back and neck sprain. The next day I got a lovely ticket from the MUPD. I brought it over to the police station in attempt to appeal the ticket and they told me I had to email a specific lady explaining my situation. I did as they said and did not get a response back from the woman until I started receiving emails exclaiming my ticket is now overdue and is now raised to $40. My car has not been on campus in over two months and my parking spot costs $375 and yet they want me to pay $40 for a parking ticket? You've got to be kidding me.

College Freshman,1,"The food on campus is horrible. The late night dining only consists of Shadows which is basically just putting grease and fat into your bodies. The dining halls close way too early. The company in which provides the food on campus is the same company that provides our state prisons with food. For such an expensive campus, the food should definitely be higher quality."
College Senior,1,"Unless my brother and I get to school REALLY early in the morning, there are literally NO space available near the buildings, which can be especially inconvenient during the winter time. I feel sorry for those who have drawing classes too, considering all the stuff they have to lug around.. Besides, the school's almost always making renovations which makes parking even worse half the time."
College Sophomore,1,Alcohol is probably the biggest drug used among kids on campus.  Marijuana is common but much more of a laid back thing.  I find that no one is often pressured into drinking or doing drugs.  It is all up to you if you want to do it or not.
College Senior,1,"Parking at Monmouth sucks.  It's probably the biggest complaint of students who have their car on campus.  Especially if you live off campus and drive to class, parking is a nightmare.  There aren't enough spots and you often have to park really far away or fight for spots.  It makes a lot of people late for class and sucks if the weather is bad.  It's something we deal with though and isn't a reason that people would transfer.  The school knows it's a problem so hopefully they'll build a new parking lot soon.  "
College Freshman,1,"Diversity is slim to none. That's kind of a big reason why I'm transferring.  This school has a lot of Jersey Shore look a-likes.  I could only handle so much of that. If you want real diversity, look elsewhere."
College Junior,1,"Monmouth does not have enough spots to accommodate their students. Stalking people for a parking spot is a must. They started valet-ing, but it is normally an inconvenience to the people whose car is behind the one they valeted."
College Senior,1,"If you are older (over 40) and considering graduate school DO NOT THINK about MU. Of the 14 professors I have had 4 have been hostile to older students. The last one telling a story how this ""old man"" took 15 years to get his degree."
College Junior,1,Greek life is known for the parties they throw. They don't usually do anything for the students. Most of the students who are a part of greek life act as pretentious people who already have everything in the world. They need to travel and humble themselves.

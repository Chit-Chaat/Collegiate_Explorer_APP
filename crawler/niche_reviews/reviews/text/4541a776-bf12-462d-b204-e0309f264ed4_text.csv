Sophomore,5,"I like that Solano Community College has so many resources and opportunities to offer their students such as free Transfer Workshops and leadership opportunities such as being elected president. I also like that since Solano Community College is located in one of the most diverse areas in the US, I have been able to learn from each person I have met whether it is about their ethnicity, background, or beliefs. The professors also give students at least one piece of advice whether it is about academics, careers, or life in general. I like that each professor does this because I can also be more knowledgeable about not only what they are teaching, but whatever advice they give. 

What I would change about Solano Community College is having more counselors because it takes a while to get an appointment with a counselor since there aren't many."
Sophomore,5,I think that this school is a great way to get your education and save up to transfer to a 4-year later on.
Freshman,5,"I'm starting at Solano this fall, and am super excited!! As for right now the only experience I can give, is that the counselors are both very knowledgeable and easy to get a hold of, but they can also not know what they're talking about. That does no change my views in wanting to further my education with them!

Freshman,5,"I have yet to start my classes online yet, but when I do it'll be full time. 
Excited to see how the professors work around the COVID dilemma."
Freshman,5,This is a fantastic school with great teachers and a good environment. The staff is also very friendly and helpful.
Freshman,5,They have great online classes the only issue I have has is with slow internet connections (due to living in the middle of nowhere).
Freshman,5,The teachers there are amazing! They truly try to help you succeed. They're aware that life has its challenges. I'm glad I started there. I've been going for over 3 years as a high school student and I'm pleased to say this was probably the best experience during all of my education years.
Sophomore,5,"Having attended private schools for the majority of my life, I assumed that most students weren’t focused and that the schools themselves were worn down. My hopes for Solano were high but my expectations were low, but when I attended, I fell in love. The community is caring and most members really do want to see students succeed here. They want students to be involved in the community, to transfer with pride, and to actively be politically engaged. I found instructors that although they wanted students to transfer within 2 years, they were also the people who understood how hard it was for students to really get their feet on the ground. They guided, and provided the necessary resources and advice for any student of any background. The resources are there, and instructors and the school board are actively trying to reach out to students. Going to Solano Community College has been the greatest choice I’ve ever made, and will forever be a backbone for my future success."
Niche User,5,You definitely feel at home and you are very well respected. Positive environment. There's room on the sports team and coaches are very welcoming
Freshman,5,It’s a lovely campus with teachers that are hands on and show you how to successfully pass the course and get as much out of your college as possible
Freshman,5,"Some of the things I like about Solano Community College is how diverse
the campus is, the people there are really nice and kind, they have different
programs for students that are essential, and they make it their mission to
encourage and prepare students to for the real world out there."
Junior,5,I really appreciate that a lot of courses are offered online. I started my education on active duty in the Army. When it comes to registering for courses they make it easy. Plenty of opportunities if you are interested in them. Currently taking advantage of the Community College Pathway to Law School (CCPLS) program offered.
Freshman,5,"Everyone is very friendly, and focused on helping you achieve your goals in a timely fashion. Thank you for years of success!"
Freshman,5,I must say Solano Community College has been a blessing. I've been trying everything to be a good role model to my 3 kids after a horrible divorce  that put me permanently disabled. So being a divorced Nicaraguan Latina mommy with obstacles Solano has been so understanding. First time trying to attend and I end up in the ER with stones ready to burst and I end up getting surgery and unable to attend. Secondly I give it another shot but super excited to enroll in Mechanic courses live I've dreamed. Then my partner finds out he has stage 4 cancer that we are still battling. Now they say 3 times a charm but with everything going on I pray that this time I can finally start what I've always dreamed of and that's to learn about cars. I was awarded a scholarship but I wasnt able to accept it because my partner needed me. So SCC I hope I can still get the awesome help that I've gotten from the staff and school. I'm ready in baby steps but excited to learn.
Freshman,5,Solano Community College has staff that will assist you with everything you need when it comes to settling academic matters or financial aid. SCC has many resources from the students in order to help them succeed. Tutoring and sports medicine opportunities allow students to be at their fullest potential.
Sophomore,5,I love how helpful the counselors and admissions and financial aid departments are. I love most of my professors however I feel that the school should take RateMyProfessor reviews seriously because there are some professors that should not be teaching.
Senior,5,I have been going to Solano since I started college and I can honestly say that my experience there has been great. I always seem to develop good relationships with my professors and connect with my peers. The professors always provide great tool to help you excel in the class to pass and pursue your academic goals.
Niche User,5,Look up the professors before you take the class to see which professors have your teaching style! I’ve had a pretty good experience with solano and their dual enrollment program is really beneficial and helpful.
Freshman,5,I love how friendly the staff is. Since I’ve started everyone who i have talked to has helped me in some way or another.
Junior,5,I really enjoyed going to Solano Community College. I was able to do all of my undergraduate classes at a very low price. Much better choice then going to an expensive university for the same education.
Sophomore,5,"Solano Community College is a great college to attend. The professors are great, they really care about their students and care about their students families. They really want to see you succeed and prepare you for the next step in your life."
Graduate Student,5,"I like Solano Community College. I went there and finished my pre- reqs for nursing. The online classes as well as on campus classes were good. They are also adding on a new science department. Unfortunately, they are still building it, but it is a great investment for future students."
Freshman,5,What i like most about solano is that they have a lot of resources for people especially single parents that receives cash-aid from the county.
Sophomore,5,"Solano helps students achieve their education goals and plans. They provide many ways to help lead their students in the right direction. Solano community college is a great way to save money, for an inexpensive educational plan. I loved every single one of my teachers and it’s great because I can still have one on one with them. I am happy to be attending solano because i can save money for my family and I."
Freshman,5,"When I first applied for Solano Community College I was scared. The application and  Admission process was very fast and easy to use, find, and complete. That wasn’t the hardest part for me; the hardest and scariest part for me was exactly stepping foot on the campus. The  counselors were super friendly and helpful in the class selection process. Once I got all of my classes and started I felt more comfortable, thanks to the administrators and staff but mostly my professors. They have made my college experience so far less terrifying  and stressful. I’m so excited that I picked Solano."
Freshman,5,Attending Solano Community College was the best option for me tutoring is free it is a good thing to take advantage of that I totally would recommend coming to Solano Community College.
Junior,5,"The faculty and administration genuinely care about the experiences of students at Solano Community College. I spent about a year as a Senator on the Student Government that worked closely with the Board of Trustees, the Academic Senate and the Administration as a whole and I was shocked and relieved to see how much people on every level cared about the experiences being had by students and what could be done to make that experience better in any way."
Sophomore,5,"Solano Community College is a great public college experience and it is currently creating an oppurtunity for me to make somethin of myself. The investment and return is extravagant due to affordable classes and great professors. I love this college because of the intimacy of the classroom setting. It is not jam packed with students, rather the classroom is usually a small size with the chance to get to know the professor on a personal level and to do group projects."
Junior,5,Is the best school. Eve I love it and it diversity the professor are very helpfull and student are amazing
Sophomore,5,"Solano honestly is what you make of it, as cliche as that is. Their communications department is AMAZING. The people in it really care and they're working hard to strengthen the Speech and Debate team every year. If you take the time to form relationships with your professors, those relationships will last you and take you far both academically and with your own personal growth. Like anywhere else, use Rate My Professor or word of mouth in order to make sure you're getting the good eggs, but those good eggs really are good haha. They honestly care. As my favorite professor always says, ""we chose to work here for a reason, we aren't stuck here""."
Sophomore,5,The teachers that are in this college are fully willing to help and educate students. Every working personnel in this college is kind and helpful. I will definitely recommend this college to my friends.
Freshman,5,"I attended my first semester and am very happy with the classroom sizes and cleanliness. The bathrooms were always clean and uncluttered since there are many around campus. The bookstore, financial aid, and cafeteria  employees are very friendly, but I didn't have a great experience with the admissions office they seem to only be concerned  about gossiping with each other rather than helping those in line!"
Sophomore,5,"I have been able to get the same education as my friends while only paying for my books. If I planned to switch majors, it'd be best to do so here since some classes may over lap and it is cheaper to switch majors here than at a state school or university."
Junior,5,"I've had great teachers at this college, even the professors with a low Ratemyprofessor rating were good teachers! I've learned something each course i've taken (That's the point right?) and I've grown a lot at this school and it's set me up for my transfer to my Vocational School!"
Sophomore,5,"Solano Community College is a great choice for those that can't afford to jump into a four-year university right out of high school. You can take all of the classes that you need to satisfy transfer requirements and graduate with an associates degree within 2 years. The professors are great and the small class sizes reduce distractions and allow for you to speak directly to your professor whenever you need. 

The campus is fairly diverse with students of all different kinds. There are multiple clubs to check out and join. For a community college, Solano has some fun activities and events always around the corner to check out. There's an art gallery in the Art building and there are usually little shop tables put out in the cafeteria for students to check out and purchase from.  Currently, the campus in also undergoing some renovations with the theater, so more stage productions will be put out."
College Sophomore,5,Not many people at my college are an English major so it makes it super easy to be able to talk to an English professor.  There's a lot of workload and an English major but when you finish the work everything is satisfying.
College Sophomore,5,I  absolutely love college .  The staff members and people at my college are super friendly and easy to talk to.  Oh my professors have been amazing and enjoy teaching their subject.
College Junior,5,The professors and counselors were all helpful.
College Junior,5,"The syllabus are pretty much easy and straight forward. Students are expected to learn each chapter beforehand. The chapters that will be covered, tests, quizzes, and homework are all at the syllabus."
College Sophomore,5,The counselor was very flexible and based my previous schooling experience off of proper math and English placement classes.
College Sophomore,5,A major pharmaceutical company is literally across the street and is always searching for interns and employees through this specific school.
College Senior,5,"I love being a communication major. I have taken a couple of classes that have gone into learning about my desired career field in broadcasting. I have taken a class that has gone into broadcasting and also a Sports Broadcasting Class at the Junior College level. Workload isn't really as much as I thought it would be at the start, but I expect it increase as I move on to a University Level."
College Sophomore,5,A great experience and its the best ever
College Junior,5,They've been quite helpful in getting me acclimated.
College Senior,5,I got all the financial aid that I needed and the fee waiver for my tuition was very helpful.
College Sophomore,5,The transition process went pretty smoothly as far as I'm concerned
College Sophomore,5,"Everything so far has been pretty great, it is my first semester here and I have no complaints (except for the parking fees where it was a one-time $5 fee at my last school)."
College Sophomore,5,"The class I am in now is superb, and the teacher is really understand and grades fair."
College Sophomore,5,I'm new here but the class registration and enrolling into the school was quick and easy. I am enjoying my classes so far.
College Sophomore,5,There is a long wait-list for the nursing program at my school; the classes I've been in so far have been great.
College Sophomore,5,"It's the best, nicest looking school I've attended so far."
College Junior,5,The staff is great and always willing to help.
College Senior,5,"I think Solano offers an amazing, wide range of classes that vary throughout the day and meet everyone's needs. I am currently taking 18.5 units, and between online and in-class classes that I am currently taking, I am only on campus Monday nights, and Tuesdays and Thursdays. I am able to still work and commit to other activities, while also getting my school work completed! It obviously takes a commitment and adjusting of priorities to fit school into your schedule, but you have to understand that when you make the choice to take classes!"
College Freshman,5,the best major to me is criminal justice
College Freshman,5,the professors are the best when it comes to helping students
College Freshman,5,it went pretty much straight forward
College Junior,5,Professors are always willing to go above and beyond to see that their student succeed in their subjects.
College Junior,5,"Being a geophysics major, is extremely difficult to accomplish. It is similar to being a engineering major. However, there is plenty of support as I continue toward transferring to another university."
College Junior,5,I would have to say hands down some of my favorite professors at the college would have to be Professor Kaur and Dr. Conrad. They have shaped to become a student that will be able to handle university level course work.
College Sophomore,5,Classes are small so you are able to get attention from teachers.
Sophomore,4,"Because of COVID-19, all of my classes are online. The professors/instructors leverage the internet or online platforms to enhance learning and communication for any class type by allowing students to email, call, or text them at almost any time if there are any questions the student might have. Also, many of my professors have commented about the strict rules Solano Community College has set in place because of COVID-19 that make sure the professors/instructors have accommodations for those who are disabled or need any additional help such as recording Zoom lectures to upload as YouTube videos with captions for those who need to look back on the lecture or have any hearing disabilities."
Sophomore,4,"I have been taking online classes since the transition online. I definitely think that it has been good, however, some teachers can be a pain when it comes to timing regarding tests and deadlines."
Alum,4,"I was able to take classes online and in class classes. Both were very helpful. In an online class, my professors replied within an hour, or that same day, when I needed to ask questions. My in-class professors, especially my science professors, are really helpful and try their best to answer my questions I have for them."
Alum,4,"I Solano community college, I love how the students and teachers are diverse. It is also a peaceful campus and I felt safe walking, even during my late night classes."
Niche User,4,"The campus is clean and the students are very friendly. The teachers are more than willing to stay after class and help you with any problems you may have and the cafeteria food is actually edible! The campus isn't too big either and it's easy to find your way around. The security there is also very comforting. They have their own safety app. The only thing I can complain about is the STEM-related clubs they offer. The clubs aren't very organized and they function more like a study hall. Since my major is in the STEM field, I was greatly disappointed by this but nevertheless, the campus is very good in all other aspects.
8/10"
Sophomore,4,"Solano Community College is really good for a starter school before transferring to a four year. Most of the teachers are very helpful and good at what they do. However, you have to be careful with the counselors because they don’t always know what they are talking about."
Sophomore,4,Solano Community College is a really amazing community college. People are kind and the campus is honestly really nice. There are 3 campuses and the best ones are the main and Vacaville ones. Professors are amazing and helpful too! I'm currently a sophomore here planning on transferring and taking my prerequisites for nursing school. The counselors know what they're talking about are super sweet as well. I transferred to this community college from Contra Costa because of how lonely I felt over there and I truly believe this is the best place where you can start off your education especially for free since I am a student full time and have kept up my GPA.
Graduate Student,4,"It is a fast growing campus, meaning the management is making a lot of changes be it new building or the equipment for labs and other things that are needed for students to succeed in their field of interest. Majority of the professors are really friendly and helpful when it comes to academics."
Senior,4,"I have attended Solano Community College as a full time student majoring in Human Services since Spring 2018, and will be graduating Spring 2020. I love Solano College primarily, because the campus is more intimate, and convenient to locate classes as well as other student services. There is a Math lab that helps support students who may need tutoring alongside a tutoring center that provides tutoring in a variety of subjects, in-addition the professors I’ve had the opportunity to experience have been awesome. The set up is convenient for students to locate financial aid, the career center, admission and records, Eops, Transfer center, Veterans office, and counseling services all in one area. One thing I would like Solano to change is having more events where they help students learn about the many different services the college has to offer."
Junior,4,It is a great school that has lots of resources available to students for both inside and outside of your education
Senior,4,"I really liked Solano, they provide you with a lot of different resources and help from counseling to make sure you're on the right track into furthering your goal. I would definitely recommend using ""rate my professor"" website before registering for a class. I've enjoyed my learning and education with Solano and I definitely recommend this college if you are planning to go to a community college to transfer to a UC or CSU after."
Freshman,4,"I recently just started my college journey a couple months ago at Solano. So far, I really like the classes I’ve taken and teachers I’ve gotten to meet. The students here are very diverse and most people I’ve met are nice and welcoming. Personally, I like how the campuses are spread out and aren’t only just located in one place. It makes it easier for people, like me, to choose a campus that is close by. I also like how the counselors and customer service are always available to help, whether it’d be through email or even in person. Although I don’t go to university yet, I’m thankful that I chose a community college first."
Junior,4,"I enjoy attending Solano because it is close enough to where  live as well as different restaurants and residential areas. I like how although it is close, it is far enough where it isn't directly in town and you get the feeling like you're sort of going away to college. They could improve their website and counselors, however the teachers and curriculum are great."
Sophomore,4,"I started attending Solano Community College as a high school student in order to graduate early. I was treated very well at a young age, and the process of enrolling and getting involved was easy even at my age. Solano takes pride of their diversity, offering lots of programs and clubs for people of different cultures, ethnicities, and economical background. 
The campus is relatively safe, making me feel like I can focus directly on my education."
Sophomore,4,"Solano is an excellent school to go to before transferring into a four-year college. It offers a wide range of classes of variety in taste, and an equal value of professors to choose from. Though it is a good school, I want to put emphasis on the fact that it is a transfer school and is designed to go in to complete required credits so that you may transfer as quickly as possible. Many people find themselves stuck here for more than the estimated two years. The good thing about that is that Solano is a flexible school and will not push you to leave so that you can grow at your own rate and really figure out what you want to do before transferring."
Sophomore,4,"I liked being able to meet a lot of people at the college and having a cheaper way of completing the same courses I would have had to complete during the first two years of a 4-year University. Solano is a great place to interact with others, and I have built many new life-long relationships with the people there as well as opening multiple job opportunities with some of the staff at the college in their theatre. What I would like to see more of on the campus, however, is better cafeteria food and more student club representation around the campus. Although Solano is working hard on renovating the campus buildings and as the President of one of the clubs on campus, I can see that they are trying to include the clubs a lot in a lot of the activities."
Niche User,4,"My experience with Solano Communtiy College has been a good. Most of the professors are very helpful when it comes to homework, and the overall feel o f the campus makes easy for me to get in or out."
Freshman,4,My only complaint is that the food options on campus are very expressive and not that great of quality. And campus is a bit far from other food establishments.
Niche User,4,Overall good experience at this college. Many professors invested in student's learning process and available to explain difficult concepts.
Sophomore,4,I started at Solano Community College at the beginning of 2018 and have been thoroughly impressed with multiple aspects of the school. I was able to find a counselor who cared and wanted to help set me up for success and I have taken multiple classes with teachers who have been helpful and challenging in my studies. I came here knowing no one but have not felt left out or neglected in or out of class.
Freshman,4,"Solano community college us often passed up because its a simple community college. However I find the smaller classrooms a lot more suited for me and the professors I had were all Wonderful. I really felt a connection and saw how they loved their jobs. The campus is easy to navigate but if you're ever lost you can always find the map telling you where to go. The staff and students are extremely welcoming. Their are plenty of clubs and sports available for you to get involved in. I will be going into my second semester at Solano and if its anything like my last one, I am going to have a great time"
Junior,4,"So Far, Solano Community College, aka SCC, is a fair educational institution where I picked up skills and experiences that o can implement in my personal life. The instructors and staffs of SCC are wonderful people who do care about students’ well being and future. The instructors number one priority is the student and they will excute their goal to pass knowledge and personal experience to the students so that they can be successful in their path. What I would like to change about the college are the buildings. SCC is an old institution that has buildings that are not up to modern specs. I do recall a time at student center/cafeteria a bat came flying out of the ceiling of the building. I would like to have the entire campuse to be renovated one section at a time."
Sophomore,4,Solano Community College is a great place to start your education. Your experiences here will be great. There are so many opportunities and people willing to help you succeed.
Niche User,4,"I loved my experience at Solano. It was really helpful for me as a high school student taking classes to get a head start on my college education while still fulfilling my high school credits. The teachers I had were great and the classes were highly educational. The only drawback was the pricing of the textbooks. But overall, my experience was a positive one."
Junior,4,The campus is a little old and could use revamping. Its easy to navigate and the teachers and faculty are kind and helpful.
Niche User,4,I go her to do my hours and along with my college class credits for my high school. I like to go here because how nice all the college students are and along with the professors.
Sophomore,4,"Despite its low amount of technology, its professors are quite good. The students are pretty nice too, overall it is a good school."
Freshman,4,This is a great school with good professors and I would recommend it to everyone. They have great support for the students and their campus is beautiful.
Freshman,4,I like that it is very clean and safe. But most of all diverse so there are a lot of people there just like me. I never feel uncomfortable.
Freshman,4,"I really like the teachers that I have had so far, however, just like any other college there are some bad teachers. The food is pretty good. I also like that it is close to home and a bad commute. The curriculum is very good and you will learn a lot."
Junior,4,"Solano Community College is a very good school for those who just want to get their degree. I would like to see more diversity on campus and more activities going on around campus. For example, when I went to DVC, there were multiple events going on on the quad area; with music and food and a lot of dancing. I think that if that same atmosphere was brought to Solano, it can create a better environment for the students."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Solano Community College has treated me well. I love all the resources they offer to help me as a student and an athlete. A good majority of my professors showed their passion for teaching and truly cared for the students well being. After attending for my first year, I knew I chose the right school. Although I wish I had a better atmosphere and had the chance to build more friendships with peers, that would be my only thought to bettering my experience. This was the least of my worries when first attending Solano, because my education is the most important of course, but making a couple more new friends could have helped to that."
Sophomore,4,I have been with Solano Community college for a couple years now and they make it so easy to be going back to school part time while working full time. The counselors have been helpful when I have gone and seen them.
Sophomore,4,"Most of the teachers really care about you passing their class, and as long as you work hard they can be flexible. Campus is safe for the most part and they are doing renovations."
Sophomore,4,"I personally like Solano Community College.
It is close to home, easy to commute to, and I don’t have to live on campus. The classes are good, good teachers, it is good for a cheaper college education. For those struggling it still makes it possible to get a higher education."
Sophomore,4,This College has been great school for the year and a half I have been here. I transferred from another JC and I have almost transformed into a whole new student. When comparing transcripts you would not believe they are the same student. Solano has a great staff and inviting professors who are easily approachable. The system and styles they use make it easy to build your own support system.
Alum,4,there are muliple campuses and variety of ways to help with classes. atheletes are offered priorty for classes which really helps plan a schedule around games and practices
Junior,4,I enjoyed attending Solano Community College. The staff is extremely helpful and  caring. It is budget friendly and a great place to start your college career.
Sophomore,4,"I really liked the Umoja Program that's offered on campus. They support throughout your entire educational journey in Solano Community College. They provide tutoring, computers to work on homework, counselors, a space to work quietly, and more."
Freshman,4,"Solano Community College is a commuter school. There isn't much student life or athletics because its a community college and not a 4-year. The great thing about this school though, is you are able to choose and get the classes you want. Most of the time, classes will be full due to many students registering for the same class, but mostly you will get in. I started my first semester here as a freshman and now I am in my second semester. There are some professors and counselors here that are helpful, some are not. But so far, my classes and professors have been great!!"
Sophomore,4,"Solano CC is a great gateway if you are planning on transferring to a 4 year university. You can do tag agreements with UC Davis and Sacramento State. There really is no social scene as it is a community college. The campus is busiest between 10:00 and 12:00 in the morning. Like other schools, there are bad professors and good ones. The physics department lacks any good teachers and some in the math need to go. Whether planning on transferring or getting some job training, there are a lot of opportunities to obtain Associate degrees. This campus is probably in the top 5 of most diverse campuses in the U.S. and the campus is easily accessible as it is right off the I-80."
Freshman,4,Staff and teachers are very friendly and more often then not informative as well. Students are very diverse and most are quite friendly and willing to help their fellow students.
Recent Alumnus,4,Everything seems to be convenient. There are many options that are available if you need to work around a certain schedule. Everything is pretty straight forward and simple to access.
College Junior,4,It was a great experience having an online class.
College Junior,4,The application was easy to access and had clear instructions.
College Junior,4,Professors are able and willing to help all students. There are a lot of resources at the school. A variation of classes are being offered and there are lots of professors. The college is great because it has other campuses from neighboring cities.
College Freshman,4,The career center helps with your resume as well as getting you out there to the right places to interview.
College Sophomore,4,Great selection of online courses so I don't have to travel far to the main campus for general education classes.
College Sophomore,4,I haven't started any classes yet but the availability of classes at one of their college centers was a lot better than expected.
College Sophomore,4,"The counselors are really knowledgeable and helped me to set up a plan to transfer to a four year. In the process of getting my general education, I will also receive two Associate's Degrees that I didn't event think was doable!"
College Sophomore,4,The counselors really cared and the variety of online classes will help me make a perfect schedule.
College Senior,4,I have a counselor who has given me a Student Education Plan (SEP) for me to follow. It is required for those on financial aid. Those are the classes I have to take. There was also a check list of which classes satisfied which requirement for the General Education and which classes are transferable and which ones are not.
College Senior,4,There is not a post grad service at my current school since it's a community college. I would give it a real high rating for the career service because they have a lot of resources available for the career you want to go into.
College Senior,4,"I was able to at community college take a class in Sports Broadcasting where I was able to work broadcast of school games, even for a final did a segment for a show that ended up on local access television. As an inspiring broadcaster that was a great way to get my feet in the door. I could use that for internship opportunities in the future when I am ready to make that next step. There is an employment center where students can go in bring in their resume to have it looked at, also help wanted ads are all over campus. At least twice a semester there are career fairs on campus from number of employers including local radio stations, military, etc."
College Senior,4,I have had a great experience with my courses and professors for the most part. There were a few times where I really struggled with the class. Classes at the community college level are pretty decent size. Professors for the most part are really helpful and are into their teaching. For the most they also set aside time to meet up with students when they are struggling. They go above and beyond to make sure I succeed in the classroom. Most of the core classes are available the community college level. I may end up having to take some classes when I go off to a University that were not offered at the community college either because they were not available at the time or were dropped due to low enrollment.
College Senior,4,"I really like my school because of the diversity of the students and also the support of my professors. There are reasonable office hours for the professors if you need help or just want to say hi. I like the fact it is close by and more affordable, saving me a lot of money especially when it comes time to transfer, my student loans are already cut in half because I choose to go to Community College from the start."
College Junior,4,The campus is close to my house and convenient. Professors communication with students is great!
College Junior,4,"Working two jobs and being a full time student isn't easy, but attending Solano really makes it work. Flexible schedules and classes and professors are pretty understanding."
College Junior,4,Great school with great teachers!
College Senior,4,"There are plenty of classes to choose from, a few collide, but there are plenty of options to make a good schedule."
Sophomore,2,"It's okay for a local school. Get in get out do your work and stick to the plan you make! Not really much to the school there on a block schedule, classes are generally M-Thurs. If you plan on taking a math class here expect a lab to accompany it."
College Freshman,2,I am not aware of post grad services.
College Junior,2,A lot of assholes here. Not very comfortable.
College Junior,2,"I don't like online courses too much. Solano uses a site called Canvas now, which you can preview yourself. It's pretty nice."
College Junior,2,I majored in Theater Arts: Acting. You aren't even required to be in a show. Most of what I learned about theater was the stagecraft. You'll learn from experienced professionals like Darcia Tipton and Darson Long.
College Senior,2,I feel i've been discriminated against by Solano Community College.
College Freshman,2,"Plenty of labs. You never know when the wifi will actually work though. Plus, the printer is broken a lot of times. You don't need your own computer."
College Freshman,2,Just cancelled football. Trying a rugby club. Student center always open. Libraries close early fridays. Not many activities. Really boring campus.
College Junior,2,Classes are not always available at convenient times or places.
College Junior,2,"Most of courses are not available
"
College Sophomore,2,Given that I have not applied for financial aid I do not directly know what the process is like. I do know that the schools tuition is one of the lowest in the area.
College Senior,2,wireless function is very easily accessible from any premises on the school. Not many computer labs actually only one :/ printing fees is 10 cents for each sheet
College Junior,2,I don't care to take online classes because of the lack of communication between you and the instructor. I have had experiences were the instructor was un reachable when I had a question.
College Junior,2,"I feel as though students are paying too much for the education they are receiving. Especially for students who do not qualify for financial aid and must pay for college on their own. Many times, students are expected and required to purchase highly expensive books that they would never use. In some of my experiences, teachers are caring towards their students and challenge them. Its not that my community college is a bad school, just the expenses and rude teachers, and unmotivated students make it a bad experience. If you are in a position where you must go to the financial aid office, make sure you are confident in what you are looking for, are over prepared, because they will end up being rude and unhelpful."
College Student,2,"Whenever they are doing ""club"" activities, they always do them in the cafeteria lobby.  Making it noisy, and hard to get to the bookstore or cafeteria.  There's no where to really sit and study or do homework in between classes, all the places are in the hot sun outside."
College Student,2,"I had to pay to print a paper, couldn't get on their internet with my phone when I needed it.  Just made it hard when you really needed technology"
College Senior,2,"They try to bring in other schools and set up job fairs but usually it's just local things, so if you're looking to get out of the area they really can't help you at all."
College Senior,2,financial aide dept. is slow moving and forget to make sure all papers are filled out so you end up going back ten times to fill out papers they didn't give you the last time you were there.
College Junior,2,i would have to wait till the teacher email me back with the answer of my wuestion and sometimes they did not really new what i was talking about.
College Senior,2,Solano won't do much for you. Your best bets here are nursing or cosmetology degrees.
Graduate Student,1,This college is terrible. Most of the professors teaching here do not deserve to teach especially those in the math department. Strange people are always on campus and even though there’s campus police.  Parking is terrible because students don’t know how to park. They don’t care much for student safety. The cafeteria is also disgusting. It took 2 weeks for them to wipe a coffee spill of the tables. They also purposely make classes that you need at the same times. The counselors are also awful. I once went to the counselor for adademic advice and he told me to give up. They also try to get you to take classes you don’t need to get money out of you. I’m glad I transferred and confirmed that not all colleges are as bad as this one.
Freshman,1,Professors are terrible and hurt students gpa. Classes are not accessible since they classes usually overlap and are only offered once a semester. Students often have to stay over 2 years at a community college due bad professors and inaccessible classes. I know many people personally who have had to stay 4 years due to the fact that the classes were into offered at specific times and overlapped. The equipment for science labs on the main campus are old and broken. I burned myself because one of the temperature probes kept showing the incorrect temperature.. We have to use cotton and tinfoil in our lbs because we have no proper equipment. The math department professors are lazy and rude. The school argues with students if they complain. They will not turn off ac during winter so we have to use hot plates in lab to stay warm. When it it warm they don’t turn on anything and we have to open the door which could possibly be a safety risk. I am very dissatisfied with the school.
College Junior,1,Don't major in theater if you want a job.
College Junior,1,"I wasn't able to receive financial aid because of my parents income, even though they are not contributing"
College Freshman,1,I'm in my last semester and I haven't heard or seen any-thing post-graduation related.
College Freshman,1,My only applicable transfer credits didn't even transfer. I filled out all the applications correctly and took the course at a University to transfer to community college. You don't get transfer credits here.
College Senior,1,"In my experience I do not see any thing regarding my major, which is sociology."
College Senior,1,I'm a theatre major and although the Theatre program used to be fantastic this past year they nearly completely cut the program. Most of the faculty was lost and the productions just aren't as good as they used to be. It's really sad that the school won't support what was once an amazing program.
College Senior,1,"The career center is woefully unhelpful and out of touch with the current job market. They rely solely on employers seeking students to provide job leads to the career center. The career center makes no effort to reach out to the students. Students must actively seek out the career center and when you finally find the career center, the staff is just plain uninterested. I honestly feel they just sit around collecting a paycheck."
College Student,1,"I give it a D+ because I know it is there, but it is a small club that is not very open to every student."
College Sophomore,1,"I have had tons of problems with financial aid, especially since they switched to this ""mysolanocard"" that replaces the paper checks we used to receive.  The guy who invented the company went to Yale.  When you're already a starving community college student, getting a bunch of fees attached to this card (which tracks your every move so they can sell that info to marketers) represents a complete breakdown in the system that's supposed to help economically disadvantaged students."
College Sophomore,1,the staff at solono is so uninformed it makes it impossible to get anything done.
College Sophomore,1,"All the technology on campus is way behind the times, i have even had problems accessing websites."
College Sophomore,1,the education I have been receiving is not nearly what I have been paying for.
College Freshman,1,"The department is no longer funded and you can never go to the
department for help.  It's like pulling teeth to get the help you need."
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid office lines are extremely long. They only had two employees at a time and the service is slow. When I call, Im on hold for half and hour. The independent/dependent student idea is crazy. They are not mindful of how hard it is to actually pay for schooling"
College Senior,1,"A  Joke – This past year I was denied finacially aid for having to many units and having an AA I should be looking for a job. I have three friends who have grauated from a four year institution and decided to take some classes at Solano, and they were able to recieve financial Aid. When the dean said he would look into this, I never got a return call, and was avoided when I came down to the office. It was also told to me  to focus on why i was tod know, not why others were tod yes. That is true, but I wanted to know the fairness and still can't find one, I can't continue with my education, J have no idea how to pay for the undergraduate."
College Senior,1,"Not Sure – I haven't graduated yet, and no one has talked with me about post-grad services."
College Junior,1,"I Guess U Can Try – there are of coarse extra curricular activities, but i haven't heard anything of alumni, and all of the job prospects seem to be flaky, and unrealistic. one must really do their research to get somewhere."
College Senior,1,"Alot of the people at Solano are local. And there are alot of people there that are forced to go by there parents or don't take school seriously. If you go to any community college go for you and get in, do it, and get out. Dont get caught up in the other stuff and focus really hard on school."

Freshman,5,"The staff is really friendly and welcoming, something that is very much appreciated. As a freshmen a warm welcoming is crucial to develop trust in an institution, something that Saint Xavier does very well."
Freshman,5,With this pandemic going on Saint Xavier really has demonstrated versatility and flexibility in terms of accommodating to their students. Online registration and orientation is very well done.
Freshman,5,"Due to the fact that I've went to a college visit, I liked the campus and on how neat and clean it is. The staff workers are definitely amazing and very nice on and off campus. The only thing I would like to see change is just more space for the visitors, commuters and residents that would like to reside on campus.  The nursing program for this school is very competitive and that is something I would like to hear because most schools wouldn't be the same."
Freshman,5,I like the small classes and how you aren't just a number. If you have a question they are more than happy to help.
Freshman,5,"I love how close it is to home and how it’s such a community based school. One thing that I would like to see changed is the amount of student involvement. Right now I do feel a lot of student are involved, but they aren’t trying to reach the students that don’t get involved or have no interest."
Graduate Student,5,Great faculty and professors. Always helpful and eager to teach. I attended after taking some classes at a community college. Great transition from college to university.
Niche User,5,I loved the atmosphere of the campus at Saint Xavier. The school has a lot to offer academically and students can really learn both in the classroom and with their peers outside as well. The school has a rich community and is very diverse.
Freshman,5,"The college is an amazing, and diverse college there are many majors to choose from and you don't have to worry about falling behind because the teachers are their to help and assist you."
Junior,5,"I am a transfer student here and since the beginning of the process, Saint Xavier University, has been so helpful. The counselors, financial aid office, and any department I have come across has responded to all my questions very quickly and thoroughly."
Freshman,5,"As a current freshman going through their first semester at Saint Xavier University, I school is very good. Unlike other universities the campus isn't so big so no worries about getting lost or late to class. The professors are great and the small classroom size makes getting help from the professor much easier. And to top it off it's affordable, not cheap, affordable."
Freshman,5,I really enjoy being a student here. I feel that everyone is included and happy to be a part of this growing community.
Sophomore,5,"It is so clean and safe, I feel right at home whenever I am on campus. Everyone is so nice and kind. The teachers really try to get to know you and are always there to help out."
Freshman,5,I like that the classrooms aren't as big as other universities because it helps be more one on one with the teachers and for me it is a easy learning environment. It's also convenient because I am already used to being in those smaller classes like in high school. I like that the campus is full of diverse races and how clean it is kept year round.
Alum,5,Nursing Major. The teachers are overwhelmingly engaged and passionate about teaching. They want students to succeed. The small class sizes mean they know you and will even help you to find the help you need to succeed. Very friendly atmosphere.
Niche User,5,It is a smaller university and I like the diversity in it .he place seems like a high school which makes you feel safe and connected to it. You are moving to a new stage but you are still taking some of your past with you.
Freshman,5,"I loved the campus and the students, professors are very welcoming and are fully invested in advancing one's education and overall success.  The campus was very lovely and didn't lack anything. The buildings were well maintained and had necessary resources.  it was a very comforting atmosphere and despite, the campus not being the largest it was very nice and respected."
Junior,5,"Saint Xavier is good for the student that wants to commute. They have good academics and they have very good financial aid. They are continuously improving their facilities and it is a tight knit community. With it being so small, it is very safe and everything is within a decent walking distance. Being a 30 min drive from downtown, it is a good way to get a taste of Chicago without having the expenses or danger."
Niche User,5,I start school in fall but so far love the campus and all the people have been very welcoming and nice . Can't wait to start this fall.
Sophomore,5,"So far it has been amazing! The teachers are overall great besides a few who fall behind in grading or understanding student issues that can arise. The food is pretty good, especially their bread bowls and paninis. The campus is well maintained but on the small side. Its a nice school and size for someone wanting to stay in a family environment."
Senior,5,I loved my experience there. The staff and professors are great and provided a ton of information I'll be able to use in the workplace. They're a fantastic university.
Freshman,5,"I recently went on a tour and the experience was excellent.  After seeing the inside and outside of Saint Xavier I can truly say that the campus is beautiful. The school has many different opportunities to offer, and is a top tier college in the Midwest.  I recommend looking at this school if possible it is a great atmosphere I promise."
Freshman,5,"Saint Xavier University is a warm and welcoming home for all races, genders, religions, and more. You will meet tons of new people and it is a guarantee you will make some of the greatest friends you will ever have in life! The professors genuinely care about your presence in their class and actually want you to succeed. Saint Xavier is everything any college student could wish for."

Junior,5,I love how everyone at Saint Xavier is so friendly. Saint Xavier University makes you feel like home with everyone so welcoming. Overall all the professors I have had are the friendliest and willing to help with anything that we need as students. Saint Xavier is kept clean which also play  a huge role for myself since it is perfect to be in a nice clean space. I love how I feel safe in school and around campus.  I do believe the only thing that needs to change is that there needs to be more clubs.
Graduate Student,5,Saint Xavier University has given me all of the tools to be successful in whichever career path I choose to go into.
Sophomore,5,"Saint Xavier University is a very welcoming school. A lot of people go to SXU to study nursing because their nursing program is one of the best and it is very challenging program that will guarantee a full time job at a hospital or anywhere you want to work. The school is a big campus and it is very nice, the professors are hard working and help many of the students."
Junior,5,The admission folks and counselors were wonderful in helping me transfer. They made it easy and uncomplicated. The campus is very well maintained and I really enjoy the atmosphere. The teachers all have been wonderful. I am proud to be enrolled at this school and tell all my friends about it and why they should enroll.
Sophomore,5,"Saint Xavier is an excellent school. The campus is small compared to other colleges but it is still nice and peaceful. They are always trying to get the students involved in either activities or by giving away free food. The teachers are extremely nice and they actually care about. All the teachers there will do their best to help you. The students are also very nice and friendly, it is easy to make friends at the school. Great school, I love it."
Sophomore,5,Saint Xavier is a great school to attend especially for nursing. Many people around transfer here once they get to visit the campus. The professors are always willing to help students whenever they struggle. This university is a home away from home for me.
Senior,5,"I love it here. Smaller class sizes so you get to know your teachers and peers. For the majority, the teachers are very helpful and knowledgeable in their subjects. They could use a little more parking, but other than that, I am extremely happy with my choice!"
College Freshman,5,The athletics at my school are great because there is a lot of school spirit and students who don't want to play on a varsity team have a lot of fum in intramurals.
College Freshman,5,"Hello I am a college freshman, so you may be wondering how could I possibly know about the school? Well because of the multiple visits I took up to the school and the two days I stayed at the school, I feel like I know this school already. My school is so unique because they really make sure that incoming students feel very welcomed. They don't try to dismiss our nervous feelings, they tell us to embrace them because it's normal. Because of this single fact and many others I would choose this school over and over again."
College Sophomore,5,"The career services has been a big help, they helped me complete my resume so I could start applying for jobs on campus and else where"
College Sophomore,5,All the teachers are great
College Sophomore,5,"Safety is good, the public safety officers and Sxu police officers are always around when you need them and when you don't need them."
College Sophomore,5,"I like the athletics, especially intramural because that gives a lot of students the opportunity to show there talent since they're not on any varsity teams"
College Sophomore,5,"I love the teachers, they're always willing to go the extra mild in making sure you get the help and education you need."
College Freshman,5,The facilities are a man reason I came to this school.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Absolutely loved the small classes. It was much easier to focus, get to know your peers, and your professors will know you better!"
Recent Alumnus,5,"Absolutely loved the small classes. It was much easier to focus, get to know your peers, and your professors will know you better!"
Recent Alumnus,5,"If you're looking to party, this isn't the school for you.  But, if you're someone who is serious about education, and your future, this is the place for you. I feel like the university only gets a bad reputation because people expect it to be some big party school. SXU takes pride in their education, and that should be the number one reason as to why people choose the school that they do. I am an alum who graduated a month ago, and already have a job in my field. Choosing Saint was the best decision I could have made, and I really appreciated the professors and small class sizes. Go cougs!"
College Sophomore,5,"There is no alcohol visible on campus, nor is there any drug use visible on campus. I have not seen or heard any reports of any drug or alcohol violations"
College Freshman,5,Most students come from the chicago area or the suburbs around it
College Freshman,5,"Public safety is on top of everything, highly organized, and always ready to go."
College Sophomore,5,Regrestration is easy and there are many different study spots.
College Sophomore,5,"There are many different political, religious and ethnic people at sxu."
College Sophomore,5,You can request an escort to take you to your car in the night. They are great and very secure.
College Sophomore,5,We have job fairs that really help students find jobs.
College Sophomore,5,"I love sxu it has amazing staff that truly care about the students success. All my education professors are great, l can't imagine myself at any other instatution."
College Freshman,5,Everything about this school is nice. Small classroom size. People are nice. Professors are helpful. You really feel like the classrooms was worth the money.
College Sophomore,5,"The experience at SXU has been great, I love being on campus, hanging out with friends, and attending classes where I feel I'm actually learning something."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm enjoying every minute of college. Sometimes the workload is a bit much, but it is definitely manageable. Some students do not join any clubs or attend any social activities, and those are the people who have bad things to say about the university."
College Sophomore,5,I always feel safe on this campus. Security and Saint Xavier Police are always driving around.
College Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy going to this school. The classroom sizes are small, making it easier to get to know people and the professor. The professors are all very helpful and open to questions."
College Sophomore,5,This school heavily stresses on the importance of having a degree.
College Sophomore,5,"My experience so far has been fantastic. The university is small, so it is easy to communicate with professors. The professors are all very helpful and it is clear to see that they want all of their students to succeed."
Recent Alumnus,5,Overall the application process  was easy and fair.
College Freshman,5,Love my school so far. I would choose my school again if I had the chance because everyone here is so welcoming.
College Freshman,5,The people over there really care about me.
Junior,4,Administrators are extremely caring and willing to move heaven and earth to make sure you are taken care of at the school along with some really great teachers who give more than just material education but an education that pertains to real life.
Junior,4,I had a very difficult time picking my classes as a transfer student. This was due to the lack of in-person communication and everything having to be virtual.
Junior,4,"I have hybrid classes at the moment and it is very confusing because the times we meet in person or online change every week, so most of us have to wait every Monday to see how our week is going to be."
Sophomore,4,"During my time at Saint Xavier University, I have seen, learned, and experienced many things. Some to which I would find quite memorable. One of these being that as soon as I step foot on campus, one may feel as though they are a part of the community. Always received with a smile from anyone you may come across on. In terms of classes themselves, they are given at a manageable pace where the student would not feel in any way rushed to get work done. In terms of the professors there, they are all very understanding and treat students with much respect and if anything would give up their time to make sure every student comes to an understanding with what is being taught. Overall, I would say this school would be a very good option to have when applying for college."
Sophomore,4,"At Saint Xavier University, my online learning experience would be described as different of course when normally being an in-person class taking student. Yet, the online learning experience at this institution has a very accommodating form of learning. Normally there aren't any issues, but if there were to be one, it is usually very minor and resolved very quickly."
Senior,4,"This is my fourth and final year at Saint Xavier University. I completed my general education classes the first two years and focused on my major in the last two. Overall, my experiences with academics and the professors were very good. The professors were all very helpful and would always stay to help or talk to you whenever you needed anything. It's a relatively medium sized school so everyone is very friendly with each other and you'll run into people you recognize a lot. There's always some type of event going on, whether it be in the diner or outside in the courtyard. The only thing that gave me a little trouble was the hunt to find parking before classes, but I'm sure that goes for any college campus."
Junior,4,I really liked the fact that the classroom sizes at Saint Xavier were small instead of giant lecture halls with hundreds of students. The small classroom size allowed for a better professor-student relationship. I felt like it was easier to ask questions and get help from the professors and other classmates than it would be in a room full of hundreds of students.
Freshman,4,I greatly appreciate that the University provides a peer mentor who themselves is currently studying in the University and they are always open to any questions freshmen have about the school
Freshman,4,"I've only had positive experiences at Saint Xavier University. While it is a small school it has a beautiful and welcoming campus. The facility is very helpful on campus and makes you feel heard and none, unlike other bigger universities. It has tons of clubs and activities to give you an amazing college experience."
Niche User,4,I love Saint Xavier University.Its a place where one can be themselves and be outgoing without judgement.It is very welcoming
Sophomore,4,"I attend this university as a nursing student. It is really expensive, no joke. However, I really like how small the school is and how you can get to know a lot of people in the school. I also really liked all of the teachers that I had so far."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the school very much, everyone there is so helpful and accepting. The school can just be more open-minded when it comes to certain things"
Sophomore,4,This school allows its students to be apart of a community of learners and professors who want to aid to be successful in the future
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love this school! The best thing about this school is that there is no judgement calls. Nobody is ever judged in a bad way. Also, the school willingly helps students to get their career started. Although I am only a freshman, I feel confident in finding the perfect career for me with the help of SXU.  A lot of people are very impressed when I say I go to SXU. The campus is just right. It is a little old-fashioned, but it works. The administration is wonderful. They really know how to do their jobs. Overall I think SXU is a great choice. The classes are challenging, you learn a lot, and it provides a positive environment for learning. The small class size enables you to form a closer relationship with your professors which makes it easier to communicates issues with curriculum or any other questions you may have. The only main improvement I would say is needed is the diner food."
Sophomore,4,"My first year in Saint Xavier was a bit challenging, however, the experiences are wonderful. I enjoined the freshmen orientation they had for incoming freshmen. Though my fall semester was not my best, grade-wise, my spring semester was good. The professors I had so far, have all been amazing. I commute to campus, which isn't a big problem, though I am sure the dorms on campus are great."
Graduate Student,4,The culture of the university is wonderful.   The diffent ethnics surrounding  the area is great for communication  and self growth.  The teachers there have great skill sets and experiences.  The advisers put in many long hours  & sometimes personal time to  communicate  to new and existing  students. Overall I Believe this University is great for and expansion  in a new driving career.
Freshman,4,"Saint Xavier is a good school overall, the reason why is because of the professors that have been hired and the diversity of the school. The environment is also very friendly and the classes are very detailed in teaching to ensure the students understanding."
Freshman,4,There is an attractive low student to professor ratio which allows you to connect with professors personally which adds a vital but unappreciated level to your college education. Although the small number of teachers could mean you end up with a problematic professor that does not teach well or respect you as an individual.
Freshman,4,I loved everything from the dorms to the professors. The classes were engaging and I actually wanted to go to class and learn. The campus is always packed with activities such as games and club activities. It is also very accessible and has loads of business and retail areas around it. The staff are very friendly and take the time to help you with whatever issue you have
Sophomore,4,Small classroom sizes. There are some amazing professors. Also some rude ones. I feel like they take my education seriously.
Sophomore,4,It is a very good school with teachers that care about their students. It is a safe environment with friendly people. Most classes give students a challenging but doable syllabus.
Freshman,4,"Saint Xavier is an amazing school, i love how diverse and small the class sizes are, i love the one on one interaction with professors and staff."
Sophomore,4,It is a very nice university. The professor are nice and the content of the courses are really good and interesting. I would change the way we pick classes because they get filled up really easily. I also think it is important to be active on campus and we have hat. There are a lot of different activities to be in which is really good to stay busy.
Senior,4,"SXU is in a convenient spot of the city, and located on my old stomping grounds. I have had professors that have made me laugh, made me cry, and taught me lessons about myself and my work that I never expected out of College. I am grateful for the many who are at this school providing the support that we need as College students progressing to the next steps of adulthood. I enjoyed my campus family when I did live on campus because it is literally a small community. If I were to receive this scholarship it would contribute to me moving back on campus for Spring 2019 semester."
Freshman,4,"I like the atmosphere and small classroom sizes,  as well as  the attention to detail from the staff. The football program is pretty nice and I'm glad to be part of it."
Sophomore,4,"I love being part of Saint Xavier. The people are extremely kind hearted and very helpful. I made alot of friends, and a lot of the stuff become familiar with you. I like that everyone makes everyone feel like family and very welcomed."
Sophomore,4,"It is simple since most classes are in one building or are near that building on campus. It’s not a party school, but you get the education you paid for."
Senior,4,What I like most about Saint Xavier is the school size. Since it is small you get one on one time with professors. Also they have a lot of resources to help you with your classes.
Freshman,4,After my first year at Saint Xavier University I have realized that it makes students focus on education and only that. The social life is there as far as freshman life goes because of the freshman dorms are made for community life. I’ve heard it gets hard to be social in the dorms once students finish freshman year because school gets harder and students get busier. Overall the education great and the staff cares for the students and most times go out of their way to help.
Sophomore,4,"So far I'm in my second year of college, and so far I have enjoyed myself at SXU. There are so many events that go on, and everyone can participate in. They have given away free ice cream if you take a survey in the diner. They also have bakes sales and days where students can post positive notes on sticky notes on a wall. Everyday is interesting and there is so much more to look forward to."
Junior,4,"I love this University.  I attended it back in 1991 and due to circumstances, didn't continue my education there.  I am back now in the School of Nursing Accelerated BSN program and am excited to continue at the university.  I love the richness of its history and the highly regarded school of nursing program.  The one negative I've seen so far is in the condition of the science labs, at least the one I have a class in.  The lab could use some updating, especially in the equipment and seating. More emphasis needs to be on updating those areas especially if they want to compete with area schools that do update their laboratories."
Freshman,4,"As a first year student at Saint Xavier, I am glad to say that it has been a wonderful experience thus far. I have met such wonderful friends, and the staff are amazing helpers. There is always someone who can help with anything anyone might need. I really like the fact that the school feels like a second home. Everyone feels welcomed and people seem to enjoy to spend a lot of their time on campus with friends. Something I would like to see changed is maybe add other clubs like sororities and fraternities like many other campuses have."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the atmosphere of the campus and the people are very friendly. It is pretty small, but seems very much like home. The campus is beautiful and easy to get around. The professors are very relatable and, 9 times out of 10, will do everything in their power to help you if you are struggling."
Niche User,4,I love that SXU allows Admitted High School Seniors shadow different classes. It is a nice sized campus that offers so much for its students and future students.
Junior,4,"I transferred to Saint Xavier University after attending a local community college and my transfer process was excellent! While working on my associates degree, I was able to take classes that easily transferred over to fulfill my bachelors degree requirements. This was very helpful to me because I didn't want to be put back in the 4 year college track. Saint Xavier also offers many scholarships and makes it very easy to set up a non interest payment plan throughout the year. What I would change about the school is that I would offer a greater variety of courses. I would also enjoy having more lounge space in the hallways since many of the students and myself are commuters. Furthermore, I would recommend the school to invest in finding a way to add more parking space because parking is always filled and very hard to find. Overall, I really enjoy the atmosphere and the small school setting, because the professors, students, and alumni are very welcoming and kind."
Freshman,4,"Saint Xavier is an excellent school when it comes to resources. The school has a large research database that can aid students in their research papers and projects. They also offer very good scholarships and financial aid to those attending. The professors are generally of high standard and are quite exceptional. All the professors I have are very open to help their students with any questions or any concerns they might have. They even encourage students to ask questions because ""the stupid questions are those not asked."" The campus is beautiful and wide-ranged. The diner, student lounge, library, and study rooms are all open to students who want to socialize, study or do both. There's a Starbucks, a convenience store, and a ""snack shack"" on campus as well. Saint Xavier is a very nice university for people wanting to receive a lot for their investment in a higher education."
Sophomore,4,"Saint Xavier is a great university-- academics, athletics, and social events make your college experience exciting. As I feel, it may feel like more like high school...small and local (Chicago). Everyone makes new students feel welcomed, despite the diversity the campus brings. Overall, highly recommended university. Definitely feels like home."
Junior,4,As a current student at SXU I can attest that this school does its best to help others and make their college experience the best it can be. I believe that having events on the weekends would help in the community and bring people the opportunity to get to know people and be involved in their free time away from the busy school week.
Junior,4,"I love the small class sizes and the professors are very willing to give you one on one help. They have a lot of fun clubs and programs that help you become a successful graduate. Overall the student body is very open and friendly and game nights are the best. Since this is a private school the tuition is pretty high and it increases by a $1,000.00 every year. This is ludicrous in my opinion but it is apparently a necessity for the university. The records and advising is a very helpful office and I recommend using their resources whenever available. Although, I found that there is a disconnect between the financial aid office and this one regarding the compatibility of certain majors. Even though there is a disconnect the staff in these offices are extremely nice and helpful. Also there are some programs such as SSP that assist in helping first generation students and I found them to be helpful. This program also offers financial aid to its participants each fall and spring semester."
Junior,4,Throughout my first year here at Saint X I have had some very interesting experiences. The academic branch of this school is amazing they really prepare you for your field. I'm also apart of the football team here and the atmosphere on game day is amazing. This school is perfect for me something I think should change is the food in the cafe.
Sophomore,4,Saint X is a great place with great professors! The location of the university gives you many areas to study! I believe here you become a well rounded student!
Freshman,4,I love the small school because everyone knows everyone. Its like a high school. I pefer a small school because I feel like it's safer. I would change the amount of students is the classroom. The number of allowed students is very low.
Alum,4,"If you aren't a big campus, or are not comfortable with large class sizes then SXU is perfect. It's a campus where most people know eachother. Just keep in mind that since it is a private school it will be pricey."
Freshman,4,"Very good school, I finished my first semester already and I found that I really like the regular class room sizes becuase they allow for more of a closer connection to the professor and isnt much of a transition from highschool so its easy to adapt. I Also like the landscape of SXU and the professors friendlyness and how they are all willing to help. They have there own book store and the offices are good at pointing you in the right direction, overall great experience, the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because of price, although it is a very reasonable price and they are geneous, for me personally it's a pretty penny."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Saint Xavier University as a freshmen in college was productive and interesting. Even though I could not afford to live in the dorms, the school reached out to me in various ways. There were many events to attend and the events were very social. The staff is helpful; they reached out to me and cared about my grades. Whenever I needed assistance, the staff was always there to put their oar in. My first semester here was fantastic. Also the diversity of Saint Xavier was a big percent. I met many new, fun, and interesting people that I never knew I would encounter. I learned from many people and professors many useful concepts. This school has taught me to be more open-minded and I have only been attending for one semester."
Junior,4,"I love the sense of the whole students, staff, and faculty being like a big, diverse family. Everyone is so friendly and accepting of each other. Sometimes I just wish the campus was a bit bigger."
Junior,4,The school is great. Has great staff and students. The environment is really friendly. There is help all around the campus.
Junior,4,"Currently a Junior at Saint Xavier University. The professors are great, and amazing! Lots of diversity in the classrooms, but very clique-y among the girls that go there."
Junior,4,"I think Saint Xavier University is a great school! Everyone is very helpful and friendly.  The teachers are very knowledgeable in their fields and are always willing to help! There are always so many things going around campus making it quite easy to become involved! I love how the classes are fairly small. One thing I would change about this school would be their selection of evenings courses. I understand that the university is more of a traditional school and has younger students, but with their increasing number of working transfer students, I feel they should take that into consideration and offer more evening courses. Overall, I really enjoy attending SXU! "
College Freshman,4,"I have not attended a game, but around the school you can see a lot of school spirit"
College Freshman,4,I am a freshman but I feel that I have been at this school for a very long time. What I like about Saint Xavier is that you feel welcomed right away. There are different activities held so that all students can participate in and help them feel included. You just feel like you belong here.
College Junior,4,we have career fairs and workshops to help
College Junior,4,professors are very helpful with office hours and other school work
College Junior,4,i feel very safe to be on campus
College Junior,4,its a good school with a decent size for classes so we can get to know each other i just wish we had more student life
College Sophomore,4,If it's on a weekday then night life is fun and chill! Lot's of jokes and shenanugins. But if it's on a weekend then mainly everyone is partying!
College Sophomore,4,"Mainly everyone gets along with each other, just a few altercations but for the most part the diversity scene is great at SXU!"
College Junior,4,"Our professors are generally fantastic. The curriculum isn't always great, but they do their best to make it engaging and interesting."
College Junior,4,"The campus is extremely diverse. One likely wouldn't expect that from a Catholic institution, but the Sisters of Mercy actually make it more diverse by being so focused on making others feel loved, cared for, and accepting (I'm not even religious and I adore them!). We have a large variety of religions, ethnic backgrounds, etcetera on campus and the majority of students are kind, accepting, and open to questions as well. Even complete strangers will support and stand up for each other here."
College Junior,4,"The courses and the professors are great. The majority of the profs that I have encountered are extremely knowledgeable in their fields and passionate about teaching and student success. Generally, the standardized courses (general chemistry, for example) are not as good as the courses more designed by the professors."
Freshman,2,"To be honest, I came in thinking this was going to be what College is meant to be, sadly I was terribly wrong. I'm a semester and a half in and honestly my whole experience here has been a blur. If you want to have fun in college, please do yourself a favor and go somewhere big. I had 10 times more fun in High School. The weekends here are similar to a ghost town, and I have not yet seen or heard of a party on campus or in a 10 mile radius. If you're gonna make possibly the worst decision of you're life (going to Saint Xavier), you better make sure you have a fake ID, because the only thing people ever do is go out to the bar, which is pretty fun your first time and even your second, but after that it's unbelievably repetitive."
College Freshman,2,We do not have a Greek life.
College Senior,2,Teachers dont care about students
College Sophomore,2,The school was just not what I expected. Not the college experience I want
College Sophomore,2,There's not a lot of parties.
College Sophomore,2,It's very close to an unsafe city so just always be in groups because anyone could walk on campus and commit a crime.
College Sophomore,2,The housing was terrible and very outdated. If you are a freshman it is not safe because you do have to share bathrooms and live with boys in the same dorm hall as you.
College Sophomore,2,Sports at this school from what other students told me weren't worth watching or participating in.
College Freshman,2,"Our campus housing is definitely not the best. The RA's are ridiculous and do not do their jobs correctly. If there are any serious issues like people stealing things from you, they do not do much about it."
College Junior,2,The teachers don't teach and the atmosphere is very high schoolish
College Sophomore,2,"Most off the off-campus dining options are just fast food chains such as McDonald's or Popeyes. If I don't eat in the cafeteria, it's because I packed my own lunch."
College Sophomore,2,Very limited options and inconvenient hours
College Freshman,2,"There are very few off campus options. The majority of students just live at home and commute if they don't live on campus. Usually, the only people who actually live on campus are athletes or come from outside of the local area."
College Freshman,2,"The party scene on campus is slim to none. Most residents go home on weekends, so it can be a bit boring."
College Freshman,2,"They need more options. My friends and I always say how it would be nice if there was one more diner, closer to the dorms, for students to eat at. Also, prices are too high--especially for commuters who don't have a meal plan. I personally eat way too much fast food, just because it is cheaper than what is on campus."
College Junior,2,You have to travel off campus to party.
College Senior,2,"Our campus outside is beautiful. There is lots of grass and open land, which i like. There's also a beautiful pond. Other than that, there's not much else."
College Senior,2,I don't go out with anyone from school but I do know people try to have parties. But it's Saint Xavier there really isn't anything going on.
College Senior,2,"The Map Grant that was literally helping me afford school is gone now! I know that's not the schools fault but a lot of students use that and we lost it, then the school raises tuition! If you are going to raise tuition raise how much money you give us because we can't live in debt to you and forever!"
College Senior,2,"They internet is literally the worst thing, I have been in the middle of a computer test and the internet failed me."
College Senior,2,"As a commuter they don't really have events for us, they try, but we aren't involved. A lot of the people there go to school to get their degree and leave, they don't sit around to make friends."
College Freshman,2,"The cafeteria food is pretty bad. I was not impressed. It is nice that you can use your meal plan at subway, gilhooley's. and starbuck's, but the food gets old fast. You have to mix things up or eating on campus is never something to look forward to."
College Freshman,2,Not very many people live in off-campus housing. While there are upperclassmen apartments they are limited and can be inconvenient. Most people live on campus all 4 years. Many people say it is because athletes are not allowed to move off campus but I'm not sure if this is true. OFF-CAMPUS HOUSING WOULD IMPROVE THE EXPERIENCE AT SXU GREATLY.
College Freshman,2,It can be pretty hard to find a parking spot. Definitely need to get to class a few minutes early to find a spot and walk to class.
College Freshman,2,A lot of people drink and smoke on campus. Plenty of people will smoke in their rooms and just blow the smoke out their windows. There isn't much peer pressure and the policies are enforced as best they can be.
College Freshman,2,There's not much to do around campus. It's not too difficult to get to downtown but other than that it's pretty slow.
College Sophomore,2,not many off-campus dining areas. you'll have to do some traveling.
College Junior,2,"The athletics are considerably impressive, at least most of them are.  Our sports teams rank among the highest in their division, but no one really pays attention to them.  The majority of the students are preoccupied with academics and the unattractive campus grounds does not promote involvement.  I am a Junior and have never attended a sports event.  This may be my own fault, but then again I never really know when the next football/basketball game is and quite frankly as a busy nursing student I don't have time to go around investigating."
College Freshman,2,Underage nightlife isn't exciting too many times on campus. Go anywhere off campus
Recent Alumnus,2,"they have not connected me with any of the right scholarships, very disappointing"
College Junior,2,The cost of eating is terrible and there are a lack of options.
College Freshman,2,People with my major get the lease amount of help on campus.
College Freshman,2,"the work load can be to the extreme, two essay assignments at one time is a hassle"
College Freshman,2,I would not ever choose this school .
College Freshman,2,it could be so much better
College Freshman,2,Bathrooms are by far the worst thing on campus
College Junior,2,"I neither drink nor smoke, so I cannot comment on the party scene. I would rather take the train downtown Chicago and go to the museums or to the Art Institute."
College Junior,2,I am not involved in Greek life.
College Junior,2,Parking is extremely expensive and trying to park without paying is extremely difficult! if you plan on parking on campus make sure you have a permit or the money to pay for the tickets!
College Junior,2,"The permit costs to me seem a little bit high.  I have no recieved a ticket or fine since I have been parking there.  I believe there should be more places to park for short periods of time, and I believe there is somewhat of a need for a car on campus just in case you want to go somewhere else to eat, or if it is colder out it is needed to get from building to building because the transportation is very limited."
College Sophomore,2,It is not easy to find a spot. The permit is a little on the expensive side and the lots fill up fast. It can get very hectic and cause you to be late for class.
College Sophomore,2,There really isn't much to do around here other than Gilhooley's. I personally have never been there but I've heard mixed reviews about the place. I can think of several bars and restaurants but they are a few miles from campus and the shuttle buses stop transporting students after a certain time and distance.
College Freshman,2,They are usually crowded and half of them are not connected to a printer and wont print
College Student,2,"I don't really party much, so there's not a whole lot to do on campus. Weekends and after-class activities are limited after the first month or so,so I suggest you don't get too used to being busy. Weekends here are seriously bleak."
College Senior,2,There needs to be more campus activities that will attract students to attend.
College Sophomore,2,"The off campus apartments are okay. Some are better than others, but the ones I lived in had constant problems with the internet and bugs."
College Sophomore,2,"Dining options near Saint Xaiver are about average I'd say. There's fast food down the street at the McDonald's, which is convenient but not healthy. In order to get more healthier options you must drive about 10-15 minutes away on 95th St.,  which is constantly busy and back up. This can be annoying, especially when you're in a hurry. Still, 95th St offers a variety of dining such as Chipotle, Olive Garden and Portillo's. There are no discounts for SXU students though. Gilhooley's is an on-campus restaurant that  gives discounts to SXU students, but the food isn't that great of quality."
College Sophomore,2,Its Okay – The parking at sxu is okay because theres plenty of parking spaces you just got to be willing to walk a couple minutes to your classes.
College Sophomore,2,"Few Choices – The Diner is pretty small and there are few choices. Pepsi is its supplier which means no Coke products which is hard for Coke fans like myself. I think of it as a small convenience store pretty much. Two great things though is it is affiliated with Starbucks, Subway, and a nearby Pub. All these restaurants accept our Meal Plan Card which is great and are all 5 minutes away walking. It does get repetitive and boring however."
College Junior,2,"Depends on Who You Talk to. Personally, I get a decent amount from the school to cover at least half my schooling. However, from other people I know, financial aid is not good and takes forever to complete. Honestly, it does take a while if you end up in that group that does not have all their paperwork together."
College Sophomore,2,Expensive and Barely Worth It – Freshman dorms are not the prettiest places to live. They are the places where you make your good friends. Pacelli is for quiet people and Regina is better for the more social types. The quad halls and apartments are much better but very very expensive
College Sophomore,2,There is much too little parking n this campus and Public Saferty makes it a pain by being asses about it. Residents have it easier obviously but if you are a commuter be prepared to get here at least 30 mins before your classes or walk. At least there is a shuttle if you HAVE to walk far.
College Freshman,2,"Process Was a Headache – The school didn't offer much money. My parents separated and I filed for more money and since the government gave me more money, the school took that same amount back from the money they were giving me. So there was no difference. I say just have money saved up and do plenty of scholarship applications and pray you get some."
College Freshman,2,Space Is Limited – My friends always have trouble finding parking spots. A lot of them have to park  down the street at CVS. It's too expensive to be so inconvenient.
College Sophomore,2,"The transportation at Saint Xavier University could be better and more available.  The Shuttle buses should be able to take us to the 95th Redline, not just to the orange line."
College Freshman,2,"my experience in going to Saint Xavier University has been different than my elementary and high school. i live in the city of chicago located on southeast side. my neighborhhod is very diverse, but mostly hispanic and black. At Saint Xavier it is predominatly caucasian. So I have seen prejudice right at orientation. For me it has been a struggle to hear how others view minorities. Actually saying we ruin there college. I like to be friends with all types. For the most part these types arent the main experience.I have learned to be tolerant of others opinions.Also, I wasnt raised Catholic so being ina religion class has been a new experience as well, but a good one."
College Freshman,2,"At SXU the diversity among races is great.  There is an equal amount of Mexicans, white people, Africans, and muslim people.  It makes the students feel comfortable because there is a group for everyone to fit in with, and there is a good mix in friend circles too."
College Freshman,2,Not So Safe – people can do whatever they want there is no security inside the school also anyone can just walk in there's no check-in or metal detectors
College Senior,2,"SXU is surrounded by residential neighborhoods, so it's relatively quiet and laidback and its not rare to see adults walking their dogs, riding their bikes, or going to the school's chapel.

Chicago Ridge Mall is a couple miles away, and there's a few places to eat nearby campus (Subway, Chinese take-out). They're building more places on the campus (another Subway and Starbucks).

Downtown Chicago is less then an hour away. Toyota Park (where they have concerts and the Chicago Fire play in the summer) is also located nearby.

It's not a party campus, at all. But there are options once you become familiar with the campus and local area."
College Senior,2,"SXU is pretty on the outside and falling apart on the inside. They devote a lot of time to raising tuition to build useless scenary while there's probably still asbestos in the floor.
However, my teachers are all amazing and go above and beyond when needed.  BUUUTTT, there's not a lot of class offerings... so its good for the intimate setting but you kind of miss out if you want something past the bare minimum.
There's not a huge social scene like public universities, but living on the campus allows people to make friends easily and find a group to party with. Downtown Chicago is less then an hour away but SXU does not provide students with bus passes so watch out.
Also, PARKING SUCKS."
Senior,1,"There is a great deal of corruption at Saint Xavier University. From self-avowed Communist professors, to criminally prosecuted administrators, this school has little concern for students. If you enjoy unrelenting political correctness forced upon you, and hate ideological diversity, SXU is for you! Good luck graduating from here though; SXU’s retention and graduation rates are abysmal."
College Sophomore,1,There are not any Greek life of sororities on campus so yeah.
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek life at my school
College Sophomore,1,Worst college experience of my life. If you have another college choice please save yourself the trouble and just go to the other school.
College Sophomore,1,"The reputation of this school is great, but my personal experience was terrible so I wouldn't value a degree from here at all."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't feel as if Greek Life benefits students, but there is no Greek life at St. X so it's irrelevant."
College Sophomore,1,"This school had me believing I would attend school for almost nothing because of scholarships but it wasn't until the day I was supposed to move in that they told me I couldn't move in because I didn't have $15,000 to give them."
College Freshman,1,"We do not have greek life at Saint Xavier University, no sororities. We only have 6 residence halls and apartments close by our campus. I wish there was a greek life though, I think it would make resident bonds better and create more events/activities for students."
College Sophomore,1,"They say the shuttle is supposed to take you anywhere in a 5-mile radius but it really doesn't. I got left out in the snow on a -5 degree day for 6 HOURS because my location was ""not within the limits"" but a shuttle had dropped me off and I watched shuttles drive by. They refused. They also don't make the trips they say they do. They won't take you grocery shopping or anything like that, even though they say they do. And when you do call them, they treat you like you're a pain.

As for strictness, they are ridiculous about the guest policy. No opposite-sex visitors can stay the night unless they live on campus, or unless they're a sibling between the ages of 12 and 17. So my 17 year old sibling? No. My 10 year old sibling? No. My 20 year old fiance? No. Cannot come stay the night with me. Total. Bull. Crap. They refuse to budge on this rule."
College Sophomore,1,"They always sell about 100 more parking passes than they have spaces. I once had to wait an hour for a meeting with a professor because they couldn't find a spot to park so they could meet me at the appointed time. The professor had gotten there 30 minutes early to be ready for our meeting, meaning they spent an hour and a half looking for a spot."
College Senior,1,We don't have and sororities of fraternities but that was not an option in the questions above.
College Junior,1,"It's my fault, I'm new to this whole process. Everything is so foriegn, I did receive a lot of help."
College Senior,1,No one wants us there and have safety warnings all the time!
College Sophomore,1,We don't have greek life and I'm sure a lot of people would like there to be some.
College Freshman,1,There is a shuttle bus that is supposed to take you places but doesn't do a great job about it. It mostly just transfers you to other campus related locations. Public transportation is abundant and cheap but can add a lot of time to a trip.
College Freshman,1,I still don't have enough money to pay for this school.
College Freshman,1,wifi is the worst at this instituion
College Freshman,1,everything here sucks and its way to expensive.
College Senior,1,I had an undergraduate internship. It has not helped me in my job search.
College Sophomore,1,"Even though it is a city school we get no cta passes, or even discounts on them. The only transportation would be the little shuttles of which always make me late for class."

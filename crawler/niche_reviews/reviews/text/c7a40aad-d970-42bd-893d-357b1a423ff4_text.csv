Sophomore,5,I have had a great online learning experience. All professors return my emailed questions within 24 hours. Very professional setting!
Sophomore,5,This is a great school! Caring teachers who take time to actually teach their students. I have learned a lot during the duration of my time at GBC. It is a very professional environment as well as a great place to learn. It is kept very clean. There is lots of people around to answer any questions I may have. Overall it has been a great experience.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy the environment at Great Basin! The instructors and academic advisors are really use great. The class rooms are smaller and more interactive. And the library is really a nice quite place to go study or to just catch a small quiet break between classes.
Freshman,5,Staff is very helpful and is willing to help you after hours. Everyone is willing to give you advice and help in any way possible I am so excited to get my degree here.
Freshman,5,"I attend online courses through Great Basin, so I can't say for the actual campus but everyone that I've had to contact to make sure that I'm getting the best education possible has gone above and beyond."
Sophomore,5,I really enjoyed my experience at Great Basin College so far. The classes have helped me discover what I really want to do with my education.
Sophomore,5,"I love Great Basin College! Amazing professors who are willing to help and guide you. I have taken only taken online courses with this college, but the way the professors guide you prevents you from feeling like you are alone or have no assistance. Anytime I have a question or any concerns, the professors are easy to email and respond almost immediately. Another thing people may be afraid of when taking their online courses, is if the work is too hard because you are not face to face. Any professor that I have ever had has provided me with many resources to help me pass their class. I am a full-time student and this is my second year attending Great Basin College and I have never failed a class or had any complaints."
Sophomore,5,"The administration is nice, they could have more food options. I love the people I am surrounded with and the teachers teach in such an understanding matter"
Sophomore,5,Great Basin College is a great college to be at. Most people from the surrounding areas come to this college. This college provides many majors and degrees. The only thing Iâ€™d love to change is to bring a Dental Hygiene program to this area.

GBC has allowed me to be flexible in my school, making it more enjoyable and less of a hassle, making it possible for me to work full-time as well as be a full-time student! This community college has also been easy on my bank account. I'm able to pay for college, the bills, and have a little extra for me. Two thumbs up!"
Freshman,5,Love this college! Its a small scale school so its easy to be involved and get the help you need. All staff is friendly and willing to guide you down the right road.
Alum,5,The student to professor ratio allowed for some very customized learning experiences. The professors are involved and aware of their students. The overall feel of the college is that learning is the most important thing and the grade itself is second. Great college for those that enjoy being active in their learning.
Senior,5,Very affordable. Great instructors and programs. Classes are small which makes it easier to get to know your instructor and the instructor to get to know you.
Sophomore,5,I enjoy being a part of GBC. From the staff to meeting new people every week. Being involved at my college gives me an opportunity to experience every situation every student has. This was not my first choice but I am glad I chose this college because it was the right choice and I do not regret it.

College Student,5,The college is well staffed. Signing up for school was quick and painless. I had know problem with the school at all.
College Student,5,It depends on the professor on how much interaction with other students there is. The registration process its extremely easy. The work load is easy to keep up with as long as you do your work when you are required to. I personally prefer in class classes but the online system makes it easy to do.
College Student,5,The people that are at the school and more country based. They seem to be small town people. The ethnic groups vary.
College Sophomore,5,"I love this college and I am proud to say that Great Basin is my college. The Professors are great and explain everything thoroughly. For instance, I tried going back to college once and I did not do to well at the community college of Las Vegas. I guess they were not used to older students and I had no idea how they wanted one to write an essay. Furthermore, once I started at Great Basin I was automatically informed on how to write an Essay and even provided me with the OWL site, which shows all the formatting and citations."
College Sophomore,5,"The college has plenty of ways to help for paying for college, such as, the pell grant, scholarships, grants, and school loans. Furthermore, spring 2014 my husband got laid off, however, he had made too much the year before to qualify for the pell grant. Therefore, I went and talked to the financial aid office and they helped me out with the need grant."
College Sophomore,5,"The college has plenty of flexibility. Furthermore, one can take three credits up to 18 credits. The professors give one plenty of time to finish their work and turn it in on time. One can take classes at the school or online. The college also provides study areas and tutors."
College Sophomore,5,"There is definitely a lot of diversity at the college. For instance, I am 30 and a mother and decided to go to college. Furthermore, it is really common for someone my age or even students, whom are older than me to go to school here. Their are a lot of moms, whom go to college here too. Furthermore, the college has a program for high school students. Therefore, we also have high school students going to college too. There have been a couple of high school students, whom obtained a general associates degree by the time they graduated high school. These particular high school students get classes at a highly discounted rate."
College Sophomore,5,"The college has a great arts program. Furthermore, they have their own arts magazine called the ""GBC Argentum"", which students can send in art for a competition. Several students can win, and their art is published in the magazine and is in the student art show."
College Sophomore,5,"This college is part of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, which provides access to lots of stuff during school and when one graduates. Such as, recommendation letters, honors on ones official transcript showing that one kept their grades up, scholarships, and career help after one graduates."
College Sophomore,5,"I definitely prefer the online classes. Furthermore, being that it is definitely more convenient for the highly motivated individual. There are still due dates when work is to be turned in, most professors do not accept late work, and there are discussion boards to discuss class materials with your peers and the professors. However, I would not recommend an online class for a student, whom is not highly motivated, because even though there are deadlines one can go on and do work whenever. For instance, one can even turn work in at 2:00 in the morning if one felt like it. Therefore, one has to make up their own schedule and decide on how much work needs to be done each day to have it turned in on time, unlike a regular class where one does most their work in the classroom."
College Sophomore,5,"I am a Graphic Communications major. I was actually going into Radiology Technology, however, when I took the Introductory class for that field I found what I really wanted to do. Furthermore, the assignment was to make a flyer of a Radiology machine, such as, the MRI, X-Ray, or an Ultrasound. I really enjoyed the project and decided to look into other majors. I found Computer Technologies with an Emphasis in Graphic Communications, and the best part is the college just got approved for a Bachelors in Graphic Communications. I am super excited."
College Sophomore,5,"I like the Professors a lot, they are super helpful. I take mostly online classes due to having a family. Furthermore, the best part about this specific college is because of the online classes and video linkups people in smaller towns of Nevada can have the option of going to college. There is also the options of scholarships. Great Basin makes it really simple, one form and personal statement, and it applies for all of the Scholarships."
College Freshman,5,The tuition price is very reasonable compared to other schools and universities that charge an arm and a leg to take one class. Most of the classes I've taken are worth the money I've learned a lot that I know will help me further my career.
College Sophomore,5,I decided on this school because of the online classes. The easiness of taking classes from home and not have the hassle of driving to the campus.
College Sophomore,5,The student body is very helpful to all students at the school. The are very organized to inform us what is coming up in the school.
College Sophomore,5,The education I am receiving is worth the money for my education. There is always someone to help you out in the financial aid office. Their process to send out financial aid is fast and easy.
College Junior,5,I only went to a branch campus for a couple semesters but when I did go it was pretty fun. The students varied in age groups and there were a nice mix of all types of people. I am strictly online now so I don't really see the student body.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The student body is amazing. Typical students are hardworking and willingness to work together. Everyone is actually nice to eachother,which is a big difference from highschool. The student body actually wants to go to school and succeed."
College Sophomore,5,The student center and computer labs are open to students every weekday and includes Internet access and printers; though its always nice to have you own. Like every network the schools system does go down but not to an extreme inconvenience.
College Junior,5,Tons of Resources. Great Basin has many resources of a much bigger school.  The tutoring and library are first rate.
College Sophomore,5,"The schools campus has everything that you need in easy walking distance including computer labs, library, and teachers."
College Sophomore,5,The classes and GBC are very flexible.  They have more than the one class you need so you can easily schedule around your schedule.
College Sophomore,5,I love how that campus isn't so big that I have to drive from one end to the other like my last college.  Every place that you need to go is at easy to get to.
College Sophomore,5,The tuition wasn't as much as I was expecting to be.  Some Colleges want a lot more and I was really glad to not have to pay as much.
Freshman,4,The learning experience is very rigorous. Itâ€™s hard college work but doable. Donâ€™t procrastinate. Also plan ahead.
Freshman,4,"Everyone was friendly. Advisors can take awhile to get back with you, but just stay on top of everything and youâ€™ll be fine."
Sophomore,4,Great Basin-Pahrump campus is a great campus. All staff including teachers and counselors are all super helpful when needed. Itâ€™s an all around friendly environment. Up to date with technology especially with the Registered Nursing program that is offered here. Multiple campuses throughout nevada which is very helpful for those who cannot commute
Niche User,4,I liked being able to take my classes online through GBC to allow for more flexibility in the classes.
Freshman,4,I've had a great experience at Great Basin College. All the teachers I've had really want to help you learn and are always willing to answer any questions. I'm a long distance student and this college makes doing my studies online simple.
Sophomore,4,I have been going to this college for several semesters now.  I go to the Pahrump campus.  The academics are good as our the professors.  The classes are small and the instructors are readily available to help the students.  I donâ€™t like that they are trying to incorporate athletics into the school.  This school is to small for any athletic program and this will result in higher tuition for the students.  Overall I enjoy my time at the college and am planning on taking more courses there.
Junior,4,"The reason that I love Great Basin College is because it is big enough to have all the resources of a big university, but small enough for the experience to feel personal. Whether itâ€™s one on one guidance with the advisory group or scheduling study sessions in the library, there is always someone to help out."
Sophomore,4,"Great Basin is so welcoming to students who have jobs at all times of day. For me, the online classes available made it so easy to navigate work, life and school. It is on the affordable end as well, the financial aid office is so helpful and will try to find you a grant that can help you. For busy busy people like me, this school really was a good choice."
Junior,4,"Great Basin college is great for many reasons but it is definitely not your typical college experience. Great Basin reaches out to all rural Nevada so I was able to move from winnemucca to Elko and stay at the same college which was ideal. It is also very affordable and has many bachelors degree. Well Great Basin does offer many online college classes, I am not able to take most of my upper level teaching classes online which can get very inconvenient. I would like to see a lot more online classes."
Freshman,4,I love that they offer so may different majors. I would like to see some requirements to get into some classes change.
Junior,4,I am a transfer student that recently started at great basin college. the enrollment process was really hard and resubmitting documents for financial aid was very time consuming but once classes started online everything was great. I like the online learning environment.
Sophomore,4,I like that courses are affordable. I would like to see the online course change in a way that gives students more knowledge. The online course are pretty simple.
College Freshman,4,I want to work so i can earn money and having online classes can help me be flexible with work but also get the college education that i need.
College Freshman,4,The online programs are pretty easy. If you dont have time to go on campus than online classes are great to look into
College Freshman,4,The programs help you pursue by getting into an internship program or even a job.
College Freshman,4,The class sizes are about 30 students
College Freshman,4,The staff and teachers at the school really want to help you get your degree at an affordable price
College Freshman,4,"The one thing about this school is being passionate about what you want to major. Everyone has their own individual major and being proud of what you want to major in, is a key to passing the classes and graduating."
College Freshman,4,"I will starting my first year of college but, from the past of taking schools here during my high school years, the classes are very helpful and the teachers want you to be successful."
College Student,4,"The workload of the online classes are completely manageable, along with physical classes. The professor makes managing the online course super user-friendly and always stays on top of grades, as well as keeps a solid professor/student relationship with everyone enrolled."
College Junior,4,"All of the teachers are very professional and helpful, in my experience."
College Junior,4,Great Basin Community College is truly a great school. It is small and is nothing like a university but it certainly gets the job done and for a much cheaper price. I've enjoyed my experience through GBC so far.
College Senior,4,"Not sure what this degree does other than get me into graduate school. I gues entry level business, but you don't need a degree for that."
College Senior,4,Great school! Online and IAV classes made well. Only problems I've had are with financial aid. They didn't approve my Pell Grant and didn't notify me or release me loans. I got stuck with a bunch of late fees that have to be appealed to be tajen off.
College Junior,4,I can work around my personal life but my work is another story
College Junior,4,This is a great school. You just have to be-careful of the the teachers. Some teachers are helpful and others act like they know nothing.
College Freshman,4,I really like Great Basin College because they make you feel like family. It is a small community college with a big heart that wants everyone to succeed in their future career.
College Sophomore,4,"I waited a long time to go back to school and when I did they were supportive, encouraging, and my local campus (main campus in a town 75mi away) has even called me before the start of the next semester to see what classes I need since they are 300 and 400 level classes that are not offered every semester."
College Student,4,There are many resources for the post-grad requirements. I don't know very much about the post-grad system.
College Student,4,The facilities at Great Basin College are very clean. The teachers well educated and teach very well. the work load is averages some classes are harder then others. The job opportunities are fantastic.
College Student,4,The work load is very doable. If you work hard and study you will succeed. There are free tutors available for you convenience.
College Student,4,"There are free math, science and English tutors on campus. The tutors are available several times a week and are very helpful. The library is very resourceful and provides about 20 computers from the students. There is also a the High Tech Center that has a lot of computer and work space. There is work out center for students. Every week there is a student activity including water fights, bowling and themed parties."
College Sophomore,4,"Becaide of the Town I live in , more like a village , I don't have many options , but in the bigger campus's an hour away there is a bigger selection"
College Sophomore,4,All of the technology is pretty fast and reliable.
College Sophomore,4,"Depending on the class, I feel the teacher cares more then the teachers that I see everyday."
College Freshman,4,"We have two computer labs, one is full of computers just rows and rows students can go in and type essays or check grades. Our other lab is more of a student center it has computers but not as many and it has a few desks with people who will tutor for any subject you are struggling in.  "
College Freshman,4,"The staff in the main office are great they are always available to help you if you have any questions regarding credits, transcripts or classes or basically anything you need. If you really want to take certain classes they will try to make a schedule that works best for everyone even if it means taking classes online.  Most of the teachers are awesome they really care about the students and want to make sure they are learning the material except one teacher. She was awful she always gave students the same score on everything and the score was always average making it nearly impossible to pass her class with an A. "
College Junior,4,I love taking online classes. They often require more work because you have to partake in discussions rather than sitting in class and just listening. I like that I don't have to be anywhere at a cetain time on certain days and that I can do my homework wherever I am at. I travel a lot so this works out perfect for me!
College Sophomore,4,I wish we could see ratings in how the teachers perform.
College Sophomore,4,The student Body makes sure there are fun activities
Niche User,2,"Disclaimer: I have not attended the college but I was originally planning to take online classes. My reason for not attending is because of my poor experience during the registration process, which I will go more in-depth about down below.

Simply put, the communication between students and staff is laughable. I filled out the application in April and by July it still had not been ""articulated"" as they call it. In general, the staff was bad about answering phone calls. I remember attempting to contact one lady numerous times and I left multiple voice messages but I never actually got to talk to her. Even my advisor blew me off! Almost nobody at the school acts like they want your business. The tuition is cheap but, after my experience, it is pretty obvious why. The school just seems so unprofessional and I only recommend it if you do not have the money for a better school; just be prepared for a lot of headaches when applying and registering for classes."
College Senior,2,I moved to nevada in 1994 and was told that my transfer credits were applied to my transcripts.  Not only was this false it took GBC until 2013 to transfer partial credit to my transcripts.
College Sophomore,2,"Courses in the EDU program must be taken in sequence. In Pahrump, there are zero classes offered during the summer."
College Sophomore,2,This branch of the college is lacking in all of these areas..
College Sophomore,2,There are literally no resources here.
College Freshman,2,"We have no sports teams or athletic centers, we do have a student center as mentioned above it offers computers to do homework or check grades and print we are allowed to print for free as long as we are moderate with what we print and it has to be for school. And also as mentioned earlier we have no library. "
College Freshman,2,"Where my school is located it is very tiny so no housing is offered. If you live out of town but want to attend GBC then you either need to find your own place to live or commute. i had two girls in one of my classes and they traveled every single day just to come to school. We have no library. A very tiny student center to get help. Parking is scarce especially since GBC is located right across from the high school so they are always taking our parking as well. And there is NO sports team making GBC a place just for academics, no fun. "
College Student,2,"Communication is a major part in online courses. Emails generally take longer to get answers to questions than phone calls, but it's better than nothing. Online courses require a lot of time and effort. You also have to be able to teach yourself and grasp concepts on your own. You don't have a teacher there cramming information into your head. As a student you actually have to take the initiative to cram all of the information into your head yourself. I also felt that it was a lot faster paced than most classes. You also need to buckle down and take the course work seriously. You don't have someone standing over your shoulder the whole time telling you what you need to be doing. You have to take initiative and manage your time wisely. Waiting until last minute is the worst thing you can do."
College Senior,1,No sevices that I'm aware of.
College Senior,1,"Battle Mountain Campus could be compared to  and undernourished third world homeless child.  While we pay the same tuition as every other person we are not furnished with even heat in one of the trailers class' are held in.  The satellite system could be great as at our sister sites if only we received the benefit of our own funds.  A television that is newer than 1990 could be a great help.  We are not able to go to the computer lab when we have time as it is't open like at other locations.  There is no resource center and quite frankly it feels like no one really cares if you succeed of fail, just as long as they get their pay-check."
College Sophomore,1,"I do not believe I get anything from my school's ""career center"" . I simply must take my state licensing exam and attempt to get a job"
College Sophomore,1,"The Pahrump campus is a rented building owned by the high school. It used to be a community college. It is ugly and outdated, and does not feel like a college."
College Sophomore,1,The demographic of students consist of what would be expected at a community college.
College Sophomore,1,"I haven't personally had any issues with the financial aid here but I had a friend who got screwed over by the financial aid here and they made her pay it all back or they wouldn't allow her to take classes here anymore. I understand there's issues within departments, but it was their mistake and they refused to make up for anything."
College Sophomore,1,"Honestly I do not enjoy on-line classes as much,  I would rather be right there in class never missing a beat. I think in campus class is so much more beneficial when it come down to it. A lot of technical problems can occur with on-line if your computer and network resources go down before a test or assignment is due/while your submitting tests and assignments there's only so much you can do."

Junior,5,I've taken at least one online class every semester since coming to MC. The professors are very attentive in terms of response time. The course material and curriculum isn't that hard at all. It's a very convenient experience.
Junior,5,"The atmosphere of the campus, as well as the academic atmosphere, is so refreshing. It's a small school, but you still get a great college experience."
Graduate Student,5,"There are so many things I really enjoyed about Mississippi College. The teachers are great, the student life is vibrant and active, and I feel like there are many great resources! I will say that I chose to go to MC because it advertises itself as a small, Christian college; which is true, but at times it seems there bottom line is a little bit too much focused on the money. The academics are absolutely great here! I am in the biology program, and as I am about to start my Master's program, I can already see how much they prepare their students for medical school. I am sure the other departments are just as effective!"
Sophomore,5,"I like the community that Mississippi college has. Mississippi college is like a family, you may have certain people that you hang out with the most but everyone cares for one another"
Sophomore,5,"The online classes depend on the person who is taking online classes. For me online class was not for me, because I am very forgetful so I will forget that I have an assignment due that week and not do it"
Freshman,5,"Mississippi College is wonderful. Everyone is very friendly; the professors are involved with each student. I am in the bio-premed course, and the academics are great. So far, my professors have been easy to understand and willing to work with me. I live in the dorms, and I've been happy with them. There are also plenty of ways to plug into the campus, including clubs, tribes, student government, and sports."
Sophomore,5,Love this place. It has become home. It is big college feel in a small town environment. The people care on campus and try to help us succeed.
Niche User,5,"I am a current senior in high school, but I can say my visit to Mississippi college was the most exciting and welcoming visit I have ever experience."
Graduate Student,5,I liked the family atmosphere about the college and the fact that it was academically challenging.  I'm happy that it wasn't too easy and it pushed me to do better.
Sophomore,5,"So far I have loved being here. It is only my second year, but throughout my first year there is an overall sense of home. Overall, everyone on campus is very welcoming towards one another and willing to help."
Niche User,5,"I loved how welcoming they were.  Additionally, they also try to welcome anyone to their campus. They will try their hardest to help you financially."
Senior,5,I love the campus. Great people! The professors are very helpful. Great food. Chapel is awesome. I just love it!
Senior,5,"I am a student athlete at MC and have always had lots of support from the academic community at the school. The people are incredibly friendly, professors are understanding and the surrounding community is very welcoming to students. For a quality education, exciting social life, and safe environment, I highly recommend Mississippi College."
Senior,5,"I enjoy going to MC because it's such a beautiful place to grow. My Music Education and Spanish professors are all very encouraging, understanding, and manage to see me as a person and they tailor my instruction to what will help me in my future career."
Alum,5,"First of all, I've slowly and slowly begun to love it there. The staff and community there are so friendly and loving. They always make sure that you will always feel at home at MC. I also know many other 3 and 4 year students there, so that is some accountability that i can depend on also making friends there is soo fun."
Alum,5,"Honestly, it's not the most fun college, but you meet great people there. The education is great and I found all my professors to be quality. Social life is... different because it does have a high school vibe. Clinton does kind of suck, but there is some stuff do, you just have to get creative. I use to hate the Cafe food, until I moved off campus, then i missed it oddly enough. Get you a good group of friends you'll have a good time at MC. Plus, they are adding onto the school every year."
Niche User,5,My experience at Mississippi College when I visit the college on preview day it was very pleasing. If you like a Christian religious environment that is best place to go. The campus is very beautiful place!
Freshman,5,"Mississippi College is an excellent school.  The school is friendly and welcoming.  When people arrive to the college, they immediately feel at home.  The professors at Mississippi College are personable and look out for the student's best interest.  The education system at Mississippi College is wonderful.  They set students up for the real world.  When graduated, Mississippi College students leave having both a great education and a family."
Freshman,5,MC is a place where you really grow as a person and find out who you are. I have absolutely loved my experience here anf the friendships I’ve made will last a lifetime. The teachers are beyond amazing and the classes are incredible.
Alum,5,"I transferred to MC from a local community college. For me, it was an easy choice. MC has a great reputation academically, the student to faculty ratio is low, and Clinton is a nice town that’s not too big and not too small.

I received both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Social Sciences in Administration of Justice from MC. Dr. Harry Porter, director of the Administration of Justice program, has developed a great program that prepares students for careers in law enforcement, government, the court system and investigations. The curriculum is very thorough. Also, there are outside speakers who contribute to the overall learning experience.  And again, the low student to faculty ratio ensures that you get the time with your professor that you need. I highly recommend MC."
Freshman,5,"All students seem joyous to be here.
Instructors want to help you understand/learn and are happy to give extra help if needed."
Junior,5,"Such an amazing school!! It is small, which makes it easy to get around campus. Most professors are awesome and really want to see their students secceed. Dorms are okay, and the food is eh, but bearable. Clubs and Tribes are amazing and very worth your time, so definitely try to get involved in those. I would recommend it to anybody."
Junior,5,Going to Mississippi College has been one of the best decisions and experiences I have had! The people are so friendly and caring! The staff put in so much effort to ensure your success and well being.  Not to mention the warm atmosphere and homie feel you get as soon as you walk on campus. Also very God centered and serving oriented!
Freshman,5,I love Ms. College. I was the right choice for me. Everything music is offered which is my major Music Education. I love all the teacher I have or have had to this point. They are very professional and knowledgeable about the subject they teach. I enjoy the activities I participate in and have made many friends.
Niche User,5,"Mississippi College is an excellent Christian university located right outside of Jackson, Mississippi, where the academics are rigorous, the professors know you by name, and each person makes it a point to brighten someone's day.  Every person at MC seem that they want to be there and develop deep and meaningful relationships and Christ, not just get a degree as quickly as possible and get a job (although their academic programs are some of the best in the state)."
Niche User,5,I really like MC's welcoming environment and atmosphere. I would like to see the surrounding area of Clinton to grow.
Niche User,5,The people there actually care about if you get a education. The believe in God and that God has a calling for everyone and no matter what point of life that you're at you can always ask and seek for help and God will help you. When you step on to the campus you feel like you're at home. Everyone there greets you and has positive vibes and talks good about the college. There isn't much crime on the campus because everyone there knows how to act and behave like a true adult. The classes are small and its easier for you and the teachers to get to know one another and get on the same page if you need help with anything. The college is great and i believe its my calling from God to attend and receive my degree in Elementary Education.
Senior,5,There standard of education and learning environment. The tuition is affordable. They have excellent instructors and professor.
Sophomore,5,"Mississippi College is a wonderful private institution nestled just west of Jackson, Mississippi. Located in suburbia, it is a safe and small environment. The professors are all top-notch and very helpful, with great Christian witnesses and attitudes. Professor to student ratio is wonderful, and office hours are helpful if needed. Free tutoring is also available! In the future, I would like to see Mississippi College expand and grow. It is a wonderful school."
Junior,5,"Before I came to MC, I thought I would hate it but I love it! While the campus is small and there are not a ton of students, I find that I know many people that I see while walking to class, but also see people I do not know. The faculty are great and really care to see your success in school."
Freshman,5,"So far, it has been a great experience here! I am part of a club named Kokoa Men's Service Club (there aren't fraternities or sororities on campus, but I feel clubs and tribes are better). It is a hard college with challenging academics. It has an amazing campus along with great people."
Freshman,5,"Mississippi College isn't just a place where you go to school. It is a place to call home and find life long friends. MC has the best faculty and staff. As a freshman I was scared moving far away from home, but this place quickly became my home. There's always so much to do and learn. The best part about MC is that it is an alcohol and tobacco free campus."
Senior,5,"I came to Mississippi College as a transfer student. At first it was a bit hard to make friends, but it got better by the time December came around. I would have to say that the academics at MC are way harder than a typical community college. I have been challenged by my professors in ways I never thought possible. I have grown as a person due to the challenges I've had to face. I know that by the time I go into the working field, I am going to be more than prepared to face the challenges my major has prepared me for."
Senior,5,Mississippi College has been the highlight of my academic career. The professors not only enlighten us with their knowledge but provide great mentorship. Mississippi College is not just an institution but it is a family.
Senior,5,No party scene but that was not what was important to me. This school works hard to be known for academics and on-campus student involvement and that is exactly what I was looking for. I do not have a lot of time for extra activities so this was a good fit for me.
Graduate Student,5,"For the past three years I have had good experience at Mississippi College.  Most of the students are respectful of each others. The writing lab is a good place to go when you need assistance with paper writing.  The Instructor are understanding and listen to student when they have concerns.  The campus is located in a good area in Clinton, Mississippi and can be access easy."
Graduate Student,5,"I live in MS, am a non-traditional student and looking to change careers by pursuing my Masters degree in a subject that is not associated with my Bachelors degree.  I had two colleges within the state on my list.  The first one was not willing to work with me AT ALL.  They basically wanted me to start over with a Bachelors degree and waste 4 more years of my life.  I then visited Mississippi College and it was a completely different experience.  The professors were extremely excited about my choice and assured me that my BS degree was not a problem and that they would build my pre-requisites into the Graduate degree.  They treated me like a perspective graduate student/adult instead of an incoming 18 year old freshman like the ""other guys"".  I am so pleased and proud to be a Choctaw!"
Freshman,5,"Mississippi College is a great environment for students to study, live, and get connected. It provides many resources to aid students in different areas."
College Sophomore,5,Our professors value their teaching and their students. They love helping us no matter what. All we need to do is set up a time to meet and they are more than happy to help us.
College Sophomore,5,All of our students on campus are very serious about their degrees and making sure they are fully prepared after graduation.
College Sophomore,5,"Our security officers pride themselves on being such great help for anyone who needs help. No matter what time or where at, they are always just a call away."
College Sophomore,5,The athletics are fully supported by everyone on campus. The members of any athletic team on campus are really involved elsewhere on campus.
College Sophomore,5,"I love my college. It has been the best thing for my life. Mississippi College is a Christian college and it has the most accepting and loving student body I have ever seen. If I had to do it all over again, I would still pick Mississippi College as the place for me to continue my education."
College Sophomore,5,We have sisterhoods and brotherhoods not Greek but it works the same way
College Sophomore,5,MC is a wonderful school full of Godly people and servant leadership
Recent Alumnus,5,never every had any such issues. i feel safe
College Freshman,5,"There is not a campus in America that I would feel more secure in. I have never personally been afraid to walk through the dark across campus at three in the morning, because I know that I have nothing to fear. Not only are campus security officers accommodating in regards to taking students wherever they need to go during the night, but they also go out of their way to give disabled students rides across campus. After spraining my ankle and not being able to walk the half or so mile across campus to class, a security officer would come to my dorm everyday at an allotted time, pick me up, then drop me back off to my dorm after class."
College Freshman,5,"The professors and staff at Mississippi College are truly what makes this school a place worth coming to. The quality of the academics is not only top notch and taught by the best professors with the most experience, but it is also designed with your success in mind. The professors have a desire not just to teach their material, but they truly want their students to know and understand the material. Class sizes aren't huge; typically about 30-50 people. Science labs are always limited to about 20 students so the lab instructors have the most individual time teaching with each student."
College Freshman,5,"The value of a degree from Mississippi College, as a premedical biology student, is virtually priceless. I have every confidence that when I graduate with a good GPA and an understanding of my course material, medical schools will readily accept me in their application process. Not only am I confident in getting a job post graduation, but I also know that I will be worked with to form a resume and apply to on-campus, and off-campus, jobs during my college career. Whether a student has never had a job or has consistently held a job since high school, the staff in the career center are there to assist."
College Senior,5,Extremely safe and secure campus.
College Freshman,5,"Professors are extremely personal. Every professor I had learned my name quickly and they all talk to me any time I see them outside of class. I have been interested and stretched in every class I have taken so far, even just my core classes that are unrelated to my major."
College Freshman,5,"Due to the fact that professors are so relational, it opens up doors to opportunities such as shadowing and in trenches (one door opened for me because of a professor just after my first semester). Mississippi College is well known and respected in the south (fun fact: it was the first co-ed university to give a woman a degree!). MC has one of the highest acceptance rates for med school, and students do well in further educational endeavors after receiving a bachelor's degree from MC."
College Freshman,5,"Mississippi College is a personal, close-knit campus with endless opportunities and a loving and wise staff. I've loved every class I have taken, even the ones that have stretched me a lot academically."
College Sophomore,5,Regional powerhouse for grad school; employment
College Junior,5,"I am transferring as a junior but feel in love with the school from my first visit. Students, faculty and staff that I have had an opportunity to mix with during my visits have made me feel right at home. I honestly can say that I have no negative comments on my experience so far."
College Junior,5,I heard great things about the food.
College Sophomore,5,"Everything you could want is close by, i.e. stores, restaurants, movie theater, fitness centers, shopping, etc. almost within walking distance. It is an extremely safe community with campus security on full watch 24/7 and the city police dept. one block from campus."
Recent Alumnus,5,It's a strong Christian school with top of the line academics.
Recent Alumnus,5,It is a great Christian school with very good academics and social activities.
College Junior,5,"I do feel safe on campus. There are always security guards riding around campus and are visible if you ever need help, whether you feel someone is following you or if you need directions or help getting around campus.  They are very friendly and helpful if you need them. If there is a time where you can't a security guard, there are emergency posts around campus that have a blue light at the top and you can help that way if you ever need it."
Senior,4,"Mississippi College is a good school.  The freshman experience is fantastic, but upperclassmen outgrow the small school.  Having to live in a dorm as a 21-year-old feels a little degrading."
Alum,4,"Took one class online for Nutrition.  The teacher was good at communicating expectations and due dates, and was quick to grade assignments."
Alum,4,"The class sizes are small and professors get to know students personally.  The curriculum is rigorous and faith-based in each class.  Student life is active, but cliquish."
Senior,4,"I am in the communications BS program for my undergraduate degree. My educational experience was a bit or miss with my professors.  I have had the opportunity in meeting 5 of then professors. 3 of those 5 are great but the other two make it hell to learn. One doesn't cair if you learn, it's all about him and not getting in the way of his life scadual....we literally were out of class half of the class time. The other professor was a big know it all and none had a better idea than he...on any topic he has to be right. I felt that since I didn't go along with his ideas, I got the bad end in grads."
Senior,4,"I liked the community and how easy it was to transfer over from Oregon. Everyone there my first year treated me so kind. However,y second year at the University, it seemed like everyone forgot about me...like I was old news. I think they need to work on their customer service. They only care and pay close attention to new comers and everyone else doesn't mean anything."
Graduate Student,4,"I have taken one or two courses online. While its not my cup of tea, I think the professors are really good at using online resources. I was also proud at how efficiently they handled the COVID crisis and switched all the classes online. The professors were advised on how to record and post their lectures. It all went really smoothly considering no body wanted it to go that way or was prepared for it to be online."
Sophomore,4,My online class experience was great! I found my professor to be very understanding and professional.
Alum,4,"Mississippi College is a good university.  It's located in Clinton, Mississippi which is on the outskirts of Jackson, Mississippi.  It's somewhat diverse and has a large population of Christian students due to being a Christian University.  The school of nursing is one of the best in Mississippi.  After graduating from Mississippi College.  I felt very prepared for my nursing career."
Freshman,4,I would like the sports other than football to be a fun and enjoyable expierence! I would also like there to be a workout facility free of extra charge. The community is great around the college . I love all the professors and family feel to the school. The christian aspect is absolutely amazing to live in. The amount of support from the friends I have made is amazing .
Sophomore,4,"Mississippi College feels like home to me! The campus has such a sweet southern charm to it. I always suggest that people come visit this campus before they completely rule it out because the students, staff, and faculty are so kind and welcoming. Of course not all schools are perfect, but I have found Mississippi College to be such an amazing home. I definitely recommend everyone come visit!!! Go Choctaws!"
Junior,4,"I've loved my experience at Mississippi College! The teachers, atmosphere, and student life is great. Location is nice and has a very ""small-town"" feel to it, however you can drive 30-40 mins any direction and find shopping, activities, etc. The experience here is really what you make of it... you can choose to get involved on campus and be very busy or you can sit back, focus on school and do your own thing. It is pricey, but financial aid is great about working with you and providing assistance. Campus is beautiful and you can always find something fun to do on or off campus at any time."
Senior,4,The atmosphere is so great. It's a wonderful place to learn and grow. I've made some of my very best friends at this school. The education I received was top-notch.
Sophomore,4,Mississippi College is a great college that is home to a variety of students. It is a smaller campus but it’s a great environment. The teachers really care about each student and how they learn.
Senior,4,"I've been attending MC for two years and am beginning my third. So far my experience has been great and I hope it continues. However, I would like to see more diversity on campus and that the campus and faculty would be more accepting to all types of people."
Senior,4,"I enjoyed the campus, the  class especially my criminal  justice  class especially  since the size was very  small  and  the  professor  was great ."
Sophomore,4,Mississippi College is truly my home away from home. Not only are the other students genuine and friendly with open arms but the staff is amazing. Not only are the professors always there if you need help with an assignment but they're also there if you're lost and just need someone to talk to. This school is just amazing.
Freshman,4,"Mississippi College is great!! Everyone on campus is genuinely nice and welcoming, and the professors are great about answering student questions. It's easy to get involved in multiple organizations on campus, but one has to be willing to step out of their comfort zone in order to do so. Despite the fun atmosphere, MC isn't very diverse when it comes to its students and campus culture."
Sophomore,4,"The school is pretty good, but not for all types of people. There is definitely a certain type of people that fit for the type of school that it is. MC is nice because all the teachers show a genuine interest in whether one succeeds or not. All the students at the school are also incredibly friendly with everyone. The campus is small enough for one to be able to walk to any part of campus in less than 10 minutes. The athletics at MC are pretty bad other than the ping-pong team and the softball team. To improve the school, the school should improve the cafeteria (caf) food and try to organize more things to do in the evenings other than just intramurals. Intramurals is a big part of the night life because there is so little to do outside of the school in the city. All in all, the school is alright but could definitely use improvements."
Freshman,4,"I like MC. The campus is beautiful and the classes aren't that far a walk from each other. I wasn't sure about how much I would like MC, but I consider it home."
Senior,4,MS College is a great school. Most of the people are so helpful and kind. It's nice to be in an environment where others are always more than willing to help you. The teaches challenge you and make you think.
College Freshman,4,since it's a D2 school there is a good balance b/t athletics & academics.  Not too overly focused on the athletics
College Freshman,4,"smaller in size, but growing"
College Sophomore,4,"The caf is a great place to eat if you are low on money but if you have points or some money, 1826 and pimentos are awesome options."
College Sophomore,4,We have many services that we can access on campus. We have a clinic that students get to use for free.  There are also therapists located on campus for stress.
College Sophomore,4,"We don't have Greek life at MC, but we do have our alternative to Greek life called clubs and tribes.  They aren't as big as fraternities or sororities.  The clubs and tribes (generally) focus on service.  Clubs and tribes are a great way to get involved on campus."
College Sophomore,4,My school is a homelike school that is a very comfortable fit to most people.  The teachers are always willing to help and they care very much about the well being of the students.  I am happy with my choice of college.
College Sophomore,4,I am not involved in athletics
Recent Alumnus,4,i have lot of opportunistic after completing  my degree
Recent Alumnus,4,Being an international student i loved the experience. very helpful teachers excellent quality education. i loved my time is MC
Recent Alumnus,4,rates are quite high but the facilities provided are good
Recent Alumnus,4,nice and small campus. good teachers.  easy going and lively people.  lot like home
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoy going to MC the size is perfect for me.
College Sophomore,4,I'm really not sure about this topic right now only being a junior.
College Sophomore,4,I am unaware of any assaults on campus. I fell safe on campus we have several security check points with lights and phone to access security..
College Sophomore,4,Its nice to be right on campus close to my classes.
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is a big part of the campus they are always having activities for everyone to go to.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone on campus is into the sports especially the intramurals we have a big student turn out for some.
College Sophomore,4,MC is a great school when I first came to MC I was nervous and scared of the unknown. I love the small school setting and the way everyone is welling to help each other with the transition to college life.
College Freshman,4,The school is completely safe. Campus security is top notch.
College Freshman,4,The professors are great. I love the small classroom environment.
College Freshman,4,The professors are great. I love the small classroom environment.
College Freshman,4,Everything is great about living on campus. The school prefers students to live on campus.
College Freshman,4,"The weight room is great for athletes. Also, the healthplex is great for students."
College Freshman,4,It is just a great environment to be around.
College Freshman,4,"The atmosphere on campus is widely known as friendly and jovial. The dorms, while typically filled to the brim, are always a nice place to be. However, Mississippi College has no form of married on campus housing, and if you move off campus, your scholarships are reduced by fifty percent. The cost sometimes seems ridiculous for the small room received, but no additional costs are charged to your student account for a meal plan. The amenities are not spectacular. Most dorms have small rooms, communal bathrooms, and old heating/air systems. However, the housing process is very easy to register for, and the RA's always act as mentors."
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience has been uniquely positive. As a Christian school, there are frequent opportunities to form bonds with fellow classmates and faculty members. My favorite experiences have revolved around getting connected with my professors and advisors. Mississippi College is unique in several aspects; not only do they have special programs for everything ranging from Premedical Biology to Spanish and business programs, but they also emphasize community, relationships with fellow students, and being engaged with the world. If I had to choose again, I strongly believe that I would make the same choice. Though I had to move hours away from my own home, I never regretted it. I have formed relationships, balanced school and work, built friendships that I hope will last a lifetime, and furthered my education in ways that I strongly believe I will be able to utilize in the future."
College Senior,4,"I love teachers in my department, they are so much fun!"
College Freshman,4,"I feel so safe on campus that I (an absolute worry wart) feel comfortable walking across campus (even in the parking garage) alone at night. Campus security is constantly driving around campus, and safety call boxes can be seen and quickly reached from any spot on campus."
College Freshman,4,"The only complaint I have about campus housing is opposite sex visitation hours. Boys can only be in girl's dorms (or vice versa) from 7PM-11PM, with the door cracked open. And there are no visitation hours whatsoever on Sunday or Wednesday or during finals week."
College Freshman,4,"We do not have official Greek life. We have our own system, called clubs (for guys) and tribes (for girls). There is not a bid system in place (yet, but this could change), but rather a ""pref"" system, where rushees get to choose in order, which club or tribe they would like to be in, and they get put in randomly, first come first served. Clubs and tribes provide many fun opportunities for parties and social events on and off campus. However, unlike most Greek life, drinking is never involved."
College Sophomore,4,Small campus; no alcohol; clinic on campus
College Sophomore,4,Professors CARE about you; great academics
College Sophomore,4,My favorite experiences are the formals/informals
College Senior,4,My favorite experiences are with MC Singers.
College Junior,4,"As far as academics go, you get the bang for your buck. Most of the professors are great and helpful, and MC is a fairly reputable school, at least in the South. The social scene is on the lacking side, but most of the students are more academic-focused instead of party-focused anyway. It is a ""christian"" college and has mandatory chapel, but a lot of the students aren't devout and are kind of phony."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school, it has a great reputation. The teachers are great, the food is good, and the dorms are nice."
College Junior,4,I don't know about the party scene.
College Junior,4,I do not live on campus but I heard a lot of great things.
College Sophomore,4,Administration is strict and fair about the important things. Those things that affect student learning.
College Sophomore,4,I am told many opportunities are offered graduates
Freshman,2,Only took a few classes online. Wasn’t too bad. Professors worked with you doing COVID-19 pretty well.
Junior,2,"I am a nursing major. I enjoyed the prerequisite classes I took prior to being accepted into nursing school. However, nursing school is a disappointment. It is very disorganized. Professors read straight out of the book or off of a powerpoint, and they just tell students what to know. You only get eight days of clinical experience during first semester, and all first semester classes are held off campus because the nursing building is too small. I have heard from graduates of MC's nursing school, and they say they are very unprepared for their first job as an RN."
Niche User,2,"I had to transfer from here because MC is just meh. Diversity is there, but inclusion isn't. Unless you're white or a conservative person of color, you're not heard. And where it is diverse, respectability politics will hold POC back. The Caf isn't that bad. ""Challenge"" is their favorite word; it's hilarious at some point. I was in the sunken place or something. It's for kids who were sheltered by their parents. And, the location sucks. You'd have to go to Jackson for your normal, college kid activities. This is proven in Welcome Week when they go to freakin' State St. for an event. The knockoff Greeks (tribes/clubs) is built for popular high school students who want the thrill of being in the ""it"" crowd. The regular organizations are cool. If you aren't in the tribes/clubs, you won't have that much of a social life. I remember having one black man preach at Chapel, so it's very white. The music is like hipster music for Christians which gets tired for those who don't know the songs."
Sophomore,2,"Equestrian Program is not at the level it should be. Coaching is terrible. Minimal support staff. Outdoor Program director knows nothing about horses. Coach is even worse. Not a competitive place to grow, learn, compete, and win."
College Senior,2,"Absolute disaster in case of student life and activities. There is no student life, no greek life. There are tribes, however, they are not even similar to greek life. Alcohol consumption is absolutely not allowed. Visitation hours (boys/girls in the room) are from 7pm-11 pm, and door must stay open. There are no visitation on Wednesdays/Sundays (church days). This college is very strict. 



The education can be considered good as long as you stay in Mississippi. Anywhere else no one ever heard of Mississippi College."
College Sophomore,2,"People pretend to care, but they don't really."
College Freshman,2,There are not a lot of houses around campus and the few there are is very expensive.
College Junior,2,Have to drive to other nearby towns frequently
College Freshman,2,It changes 50 degrees from morning to noon
Recent Alumnus,2,No one is openly homosexual even though they are there. No one is openly of any religion other than southern Baptist. Very few students are not white upper class kids from the surrounding towns. 
Recent Alumnus,2,No actual Greek organizations except a few specialized honor societies. They have tribes instead. Expensive and very exclusive. They even exclude their own paying members from participating in certain events. 
Recent Alumnus,2,"The teachers don't care. The lower classmen dorms are atrocious. There is very little parking. Everything is way too expensive and once they have your money, they ask for more. Do not take private loans from the school unless you plan to have them paid off before you leave the school. "
College Freshman,2,Bring your own laptop and printer. Its like going back to 1990 when you enter the library. 
College Freshman,2,There is a shuttle running pretty much all day for the students that live in off campus apartments and that is pretty much the only place the shuttle takes you as far as i know. It is completely free and really easy to access.
College Junior,2,"I went to a very large high school with a strong athletic program, and if we played MC we would beat them. That transition has been strange. MC was just accepted into NCAA DII, so they will be able to give scholarships and hopefully build up a stronger program."
College Senior,2,"In the beginning I came to Mississippi College, to further my understanding in faith as well receive a good education. Because MC definitely has the reputation of a good school. The campus is small which is good for beginning students and very welcoming to those that are not from Mississippi. The staff is very polite and professional. They also house some of the best professors, in the biology department and the labs are amazing. However as a person of color the atmosphere can be a little hard to get use to. And those with different religious backgrounds will find it difficult to fit in as everyone, or most have strong christian backgrounds so other's are not likely to be embraced fully, the same goes for politics. It also seems that the school pays more money on landscaping then actually helping the students pay for college in assistance. The tuition continues to increase and our bills go up to pay for services we don't need or want and this puts a lot of students in a bind causing them to leave and go elsewhere. I love the campus but I wish it wasn't so expensive and a lot of the services they provide are not worth the money they charge us. For a student who is serious about their major, I would recommend, but if that student has limited funds I'd say go else where, because this school will put you in debt."
College Senior,2,Greek life is not a big deal at MC.  There are some frats on campus but not many and I don't go to any parties because I don't have time because of my school schedule and baseball.
College Senior,2,"Greek life at MC is practically non-existent. If you want to be involved in the ""tribes"" as they are called, then you are more than welcome. As far as parties and such, there are none on campus because of the religious rules of the school. It is completely up to the student to choose to be in a tribe."
College Sophomore,2,"The Security at Mississippi College is very strict. If you park in the wrong parking lot, you will get a ticket.Security will go as far as looking at your tag and matching it to the registration of the car. You have to pay a decal for every car that you drive and park on campus. The fines are riduculous so, be careful."
College Freshman,2,"I have not recieved a scholarship for Mississippi College, at this moment i am stuggling trying to stay and continue my education here."
Freshman,1,"Mississippi college was not a good experience. If your looking to feel like your still in a small town high school then go here. The town has nothing to do and is even named a “retirement community”. If you want to do any sort of shopping, eating, etc. you have to drive at least 35 minutes. The food places are limited and close early on the weekends. My dorm had mold in it that made me sick. This truly was not a college experience and there was nothing to do at all."
Freshman,1,I literally cried everyday here. If you are not Baptist or from Mississippi don’t go here. Clinton is NOT a place for college students. Only good thing is professors. Food is horrible. This place shuts down at 9 PM Sunday-Saturday.
Senior,1,The college makes you stay in their old dilapidated dorms and do not allow you off campus housing. When you turn 21 you may leave but you lose a significant portion of all your scholarships. The dining plan is also required when living on campus and it is terrible. Really worse than terrible. We do freshman 15 in reverse here. Feathers in the chicken. Cheap cheap cheap food service providers but they charge you as the student a fortune.  Nursing program has a new dean and all the best teachers left.  Do not do nursing here.  Program in a shambles
Graduate Student,1,Worst Christian school ever! They do not try to help you! Worst experience ever! Very low down! I did everything they told me to do and just because the semester ended before o could get my official transcript to them! The unofficial wasn’t enough!
Freshman,1,"BEWARE!!! One of the most disappointing experiences I have had with a school that athletically recruited but did not follow through with any of their commitments. A total waste of time and money. Administration and coaches are only for the money and not the student. Cafeteria food is horrible, Dorms are horrible and the town is a ghost town. Don't do it folks! It's a joke."
College Senior,1,It is boring. You would have more fun living off campus. On campus living is too strict.
College Senior,1,There is no Greek life.
College Senior,1,"Football, men's and women's basketball absolutely suck. Football team won 3 games this season, each basketball team maybe 5...

Other than Delta State game, which is the rival, no one comes to the games. 

Even though other sports like soccer are pretty good, nobody comes to the games. There is no interest in athletics. MC is NCAA Division 2, the attitude towards athletics is still Division 3."
Recent Alumnus,1,All teams have losing records. They are a laughing stock.
College Freshman,1,Diversity? Progressive? Independent? Its a Baptist University. Fit the mold and you are good. Conform and you are set. 
College Freshman,1,Public Transportation in the South? I never knew it existed. Bring a car and you will be fine. 
Recent Alumnus,1,"In Clinton, there is pretty much only fast-food and a Kroger. Unfortunately there is not much variety and it is difficult to find healthy options on-the-go."
Recent Alumnus,1,"It is a Christian (Baptist) school with a large majority of the faculty and student body following this belief system. It is difficult to express another point of view of follow another belief system without being considered an ""outsider"" and it is a difficult place to have alternate beliefs respected. I find everyone at MC to be exceedingly welcoming and friendly, but on this point I am very disappointed with the MC community and I feel like I need to keep my beliefs to myself as a non-Baptist."
College Senior,1,"To be honest, there is no school spirit here. At least none I can see. The football team here is nothing to brag about or even mention, yet they get new uniforms and raise our bills. The basketball team here is decent. To me, and this is my opinion, our money is spent mostly on equipment for the teams and as a student here I don't think it's worth it. Especially when they are not winning anything to show for it. I didn't even know we had cheerleaders or a band because they didn't do anything like pep rallies or spirit clubs etc."
College Senior,1,"The freshman dorms are probably the best on campus, period. That is because they are newly done. The rest of them, well I can only speak for the women's dorm. They are small cramped, and out dated especially the wash and dryer room, and we pay so much money for this school you wonder where is your money going. Some of them have a bug problem and the cleaning crew can seem unprofessional. The selection of rooms can be hard because most of the tribes and social clubs try to take the rooms first. The quality of the rooms, are not even close to being worth what they charge us. The paint job of the rooms are sloppy, I can do a better job. They just paint over the everything, and patch up stuff in the walls. The beds are nice and the desk are good as well. But for 3k to 4k it is not worth it. The only thing I like about staying the dorms is that I'm a close to my classes."
College Senior,1,Clinton really doesn't have a night life.  Mississippi College is a small Baptist school and there is very few bars and nightclubs in and around campus
College Freshman,1,living on campus is annoying. the dorms are super strict.
College Freshman,1,"most girls and guys are not attractive; however, the athletes (guys) are usually good looking and most out of state guys are too. the is no hope for the ladies."
College Sophomore,1,The computers labs are located in each building on campus. The one that most students use are in the Self Hall and MCC. The computers in the library take so long to start. People would go to the bathroom and come back to wait for their desktop to load. The printing allowance they give each semester is too low. Colored prints are 50 cents per page. thats crazy.
College Freshman,1,"Mall 20 min away, nothing to do in surrounding city"

Sophomore,5,"I have been to 2 different colleges and by far Dixie state is the best. First of all, inexpensive, second of all, the teachers actually want you to suceed!"
Sophomore,5,Dixie state professors are always willing to help. You can be online or in class and the professors are always willing to help. Especially wit technical difficulties.
Freshman,5,many of the teachers seem to know what they are doing and are doing their best to make online learning the same as in person.
Freshman,5,I love it here. the college is big enough for a full college experience but small enough to get a lot of one on one attention. there are so many opportunities for the advancement of knowledge and understanding in the major of your choice.
Sophomore,5,I have taken 2 or 3 of my classes online.  I have been quite happy with my experience.  The professors are willing to be accommodating and the freedom was great!  I would be wary of taking online block summer courses unless you are very dedicated.
Sophomore,5,Dixie State has been a tremendous experience for me.  I was raised in Southern Utah so I have grown up around the University and know it quite well.  The smaller class sizes and personality that the university seems to embody are second to none.  The activities that go on each semester are great as well.  I can't speak highly enough of Dixie State.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy going to Dixie, it's an amazing school for the price of tuition. The students and staff here are also really great and the environment is amazing. The city itself is also really college-friendly and has a lot of things to do and explore. I always recommend Dixie to people I know are thinking about doing a 4-year institution."
Sophomore,5,I love Dixie! I am currently a sophomore but I am finishing up my application to their Nursing program and I am so excited! There teachers are outstanding! All of there facilities are so awesome! They have so many resources available for every student. They are always willing to help when you need it. I love the opportunity of getting to meet new people. They give you so many opportunities to step out of your comfort zone. Last year I stepped out of my comfort zone and participated in the Miss Dixie pageant and it was actually so much fun! I got to meet so many new people and I absolutely loved it and I would hands down do it again.
Sophomore,5,"I actually put all of my classes online this semester so that I didn't have to do any zoom meetings and let me tell you, hands down the best decision ever! My teachers are always willing to help me, they don't take forever to respond when I ask them questions. It is such a great experience and I would love to be able to do it again if I get the chance. If you ever get the opportunity to take online classes, do it!!"
Sophomore,5,Transitioning to online was a change but everyone handled it so well and kept up communication. Professors made sure to reach out to me to make sure I was understanding the course information and if I had any questions they made sure to answer them.
Alum,5,"It was great being a student from Dixie State university. There are great professors, advisors, and a lot of school engagement activities! The school spirit and support there is amazing."

Junior,5,"Dixie State University is the place to be to get the ultimate college experience. Not only are they located in the sunniest place on earth but their business courses are absolutely incredible. If you are looking for a place to network, this is the place to be. So many opportunities coming from DSU."
Sophomore,5,We use what’s called canvas and all assignments tests PowerPoints slides are on it most teaches don’t use live lectures like zoom or Skype they just film themself and send a link on YouTube I love all this makes it very streamlined and convenient. Also some tests maybe done at the testing center and you just use their  computer to login into canvas for test.
Freshman,5,"It is a super fun and open campus, classes are small and easy to get to know people so the social scene is really good. There are many hikes and outside classes so you get to take in the outdoors constantly."
Freshman,5,"Dixie is a great school. Dixie State offers a great education along with lots of fun. It's one of the safest universities to attend. Also it is really cheap. They have a good neighbor program which is probaly the best thing ever. Dixie is located at the southwest corner of Utah. I live in the northwest corner of Arizona. The Utah border is only 30 minutes away. Technically I should be charge out of state tutition, but the good neighbor program helps those of us in the area to not have to pay full out of state tution. We don't get in state but we also don't get out of state. THe good neighbor is in the middle and it's perfect."
Senior,5,Beautiful campus and area. Online courses and easy to follow and professors really care about students. Tuition is affordable and scholarships are available! Advisors are readily available and eager to help you succeed.
Freshman,5,I have had an amazing year at Dixie they are a very welcoming school who makes sure their students feel in a safe and comfortable environment. What I love about Dixie is that they have all kind of activities going on at the school and they are also very helpful academically. They have really helped me stay on track with everything.
Junior,5,"As a transfer to DSU, I could not imagine a better place for me to end up at. The diversity has been awesome compared to the private school that I transferred from and the extra-curricular activities are incredible."
Freshman,5,"This page is outdated, Dixie is rated 3rd safest university in America now. The dorms should be at an A, they just built more in 2017 that are completely modern and are building another set of modern dorms. They are going D1 starting 2020-21 school year. Many students here actually are getting paid to go to school because so much financial aid is offered. The growth here is at 11% while the nationally average is -3%. The value should be at an A+ because you can’t Beat this price for the value you get. Free tutoring for all subjects, specialized area for math tutoring and another for writing tutoring. The human performance center opened Nov. 2019 with indoor pools private trainers come in and most classes only have a handful of people. An indoor track, and a track on the roof with pickle ball and tennis courts on the roof as well.  and the biggest indoor rock climbing wall in all of Utah."
Sophomore,5,Dixie State University is a great college due to its size. Classes were more personal and the staff always was ready to help in anyway that they could. Enjoyed my experience while attending.
Sophomore,5,"I love the small class sizes! It ensures that you get personalized time with your professors. I never thought that my professors would know my name, but here they do! The tuition is very affordable as well as the nearby housing. I’m so glad that I decided to attend Dixie State University."
Senior,5,"Dixie State is a relatively small school. Once you get into the higher level classes, it becomes easy to have one on one relationships with the faculty."
Sophomore,5,I love Dixie State! The teachers here are all very knowledgeable and want to see you succeed. They treat you like adults but are still very respectful. I have so much fun here! The class sizes are small which allow you to get to know your teacher and the fellow students.
Senior,5,Dixie State University has helped me become more of myself by allowing me to grow and explore while still feeling at home. Dixie State is a small college and the small college feel has allowed me to feel comfortable and accepted. The professors have always been amazing and have helped me with my academics. The professors are very personable and easy to relate to and build a relationship with.
Freshman,5,"The faculty and staff at DSU is absolutely amazing. I have been able to speak face-to-face with many teachers, councilors, peer coaches, and representatives. I've received so much needed advice and guidance in my first semester here, and I've already come to love my new home here at Dixie."
Junior,5,Resources from registration to tutoring are easily accessible. The school is very affordable and flexible with tuition payment plans. The opportunities to get involved in extracurricular activities are endless.
Junior,5,This school tries very hard to get their students involved and is very diverse. I love that the campus isn’t crazy big but perfect for how many students they have.
Sophomore,5,"I have not yet attended Dixie State university. I have been accepted and will be transferring there in the Spring. So far, my experience with Dixie has been excellent and I look forward to attending."
Junior,5,"Safe campus, Great teachers, would love to see more online classes and summer classes! Most students work full time to get by, myself being one of them. But overall great school and affordable tuition."
Freshman,5,"I love how they have activities every Wednesday! The motto “Active Learning, Active Life”, is true. Never would I have thought I would be studying cadavers my freshman year of college. Everyone is friendly and willing to help in anyway they can!"
Niche User,5,"The campus is very clean, and has lots of recreational activities to take part in. The class sizes are roughly 20 students to one professor, which benefits the students with one on one assistance."
Junior,5,Dixie State University is a rapidly growing school in southern Utah. It's surrounded by beautiful red rock and is within 3 hours drive of many major National Parks. Soon to be a D1 level University this coming year it's a great time to be a member of Dixie State.
Freshman,5,"The campus is easy to navigate and they are constantly working to update existing buildings as well as add completely new ones! There is plenty of open grass for various intramural sports and easy year round access to baseball, softball, soccer and football fields as well as indoor courts and gyms. The university is constantly expanding the programs they offer and are about to start construction on a new science and engineering building to offer more degrees in those fields. While being affordable the benefits available on campus are stellar. There are lots of activities for students all throughout the year as well as tutors for any subject you might be taking."
Freshman,5,"I love that Dixie State University's motto is ""active learning, active life"". Even as a freshman who just started school here, I see this everyday on campus. Professors get students involved in their classes, and students get involved with each other as they join clubs, form study groups, and so much more. As I step on campus each day, I am grateful to go to school in such a beautiful place and with such inspiring people. Dixie is truly the place to be."
Sophomore,5,"Dixie State is a small, but mighty school! Coming from a very small town myself, it was a pretty smooth transition being that the school is the same as my old high school. The classes are fairly small, professors are able to effectively work with students to be great, the overall environment is so friendly, and I am so proud to be a Trailblazer!"
Senior,5,"Dixie University is an affordable university that helped me get the education that I needed. I originally was only going to finish my associates degree there then transfer to finish by bachelor's degree. The advisor that I met with for my degree was phenomenal and helped me get the classes, volunteer hours, and scholarships needed in order to succeed."
Sophomore,5,"DSU is a super amazing school, the teachers are willing to help you with anything to help you succeed. The class sizes aren’t huge and they are always having fun activities and events weekly."
Freshman,5,"DSU is great! They really care about you education and the staff really push you forward to not only reach your major but your dreams as well. They want the best for us, especially with their motto of, ""Active life. Active Learning."" They want to make learning more fun. The staff are also another great part of this great institution. They are ready to work with you and will make you a priority. The counselors are ready to help you, the professors will help you as fast as you can because there isn’t a bunch of students crammed into a class room. The area around is nice and has many attractions a few hours outside of school."
Sophomore,5,I love how my classes are small enough that I can get to know my professors. I also love how easy it is to find help when I need it.
Freshman,5,"My experience with Dixie State, although very short, has been nothing under great! I am an incoming freshman and I can't believe all of the love and support I have already received! Between their inspiring mascot, the trailblazers, and their amazing staff I really do feel welcomed into this huge family!"
Sophomore,5,Dixie State is a great college that helps student succeed in every possible way. There are many outdoor activities to partake in and the city Dixie State is located in is super fun and homey.
Freshman,5,"Some professors are good. Others are super interesting. There’s lots of construction going on right now, so it’s kinda messy. But as far as education it’s pretty okay. The campus and surrounding area is really pretty. There’s so much to do here in St. George it’s a fun nice place to stay. I recommend it to anyone who is thinking about coming to school here."
Sophomore,5,"Dixie has wonderful teachers that make you feel welcomed. There is so much to be involved like voulenteer work, clubs, student government and more! There are events put on every Wednesday that are fun, entertaining, and free for students. The events are a great way to make friends as well."
Freshman,5,"DSU is a wonderful establishment. Set up in the small town of St George, it is very affordable for anyone looking to further their education and is an awesome location for those looking to start being on their own. This past semester was my first and while it was challenging, it was very suitable. The professors are very reasonable and excellent in assisting each student to reach their full potential. I look forward to learning more from what DSU has to offer."
Freshman,5,My experience at DSU has been great. Dixie is the most affordable university in Utah which is great when it comes to saving money! I have just finished my freshman year of college. I moved to St. George not really knowing anyone and right from the back made a ton of friends. They school is really diverse and no one is judgemental. The university has just under 10 thousand students. This is gives you the chance to see all your friends and the cute ladies more than once. The school also has a student to teacher ratio of 21/1. I never was an ant in a big auditorium. I really got to know my classmates and my professors. Dixie is also the fastest growing university in Utah! This is super fun to be apart of. We will have D1 sports next year and a sweet new gym. If I could change anything it would have to be NOTHING. I love Dixie State and highly recommend it to everyone.
Freshman,5,I love that they are so engaged and help you get prepared and on the right track for your future. They take pride in each student and helping them succeed. The atmosphere is fun and exciting at the same time you are learning a lot. They offer a wide variety of classes for many subjects.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Dixie State University has been unique. I was able to see the campus grow from a 1,200 student body to 10,000. It's beautiful to witness the diverse student body it has achieved."
Junior,5,"I love Dixie! The instructors are friendly and easy to talk to for help. The campus is gorgeous and well-kept. The buildings are modern and user friendly. I highly recommend Dixie!!
The only complaint I have at Dixie is the parking. There have been times when I have to park off campus and walk to class because the parking lot is full."
Senior,5,the small school feels very caring teachers and small student to teacher ratios. there are abundant things to do outside including Zions national park 30 min away. I'm majoring in chemistry and most of my classes have 15 or fewer students. and I'm still on my 2000 level classes.
Sophomore,5,"Dixie State University is an amazing University. It has great professors that care, small class sizes so you are able to get to know each other and the professor knows you - very helpful as well. The campus is growing very quickly and getting more degrees every semester. Sports are decent - we are down a Division 2 school which is a big thing for Dixie. This will help it's growth. St George is an amazing location."
Niche User,5,"I really liked how open the campus is and the buildings are in walking distance to each other, especially close to housing.  The staff is really friendly and so willing to help you answer your questions"
Freshman,5,"The staff is always there when you need them, their website is easy to navigate through and they really make sure your education will help you with your future career. The programs that you study aren't just from reading books but they give you actual experience in your field of study. They have many housing options and no first year requirements. They have many options for food as well."
Freshman,5,"Dixie State University is a really great environment for learning. The classrooms are smaller than other Universities, typically holding around 20 students. The professors interact one on one with the students and want to see them progress in their education. The campus is beautiful and a friendly environment. The resources there are incredible and the professors are willing to help you find what those resources and use them to your advantage. I would like to see Dixie State University give more options for majors."
Freshman,5,"I am currently a Freshman at DSU and I love it!! All of the teachers are so helpful and fun, not to mention the rest of the staff. The school offers so many great resources to help you succeed AND enjoy your time attending this college! The parties and events are so much fun, especially the Foam Dance at the beginning of the school year! I highly recommend attending here"
Senior,5,"I have loved Dixie State.  The class sizes have been very small and I have been able to actually talk with my professors, and have actually built very good relationships with each one.  I would recomend Dixie State to everyone."
Freshman,5,"It is such a beautiful campus! You just feel right at home the moment you step foot on campus. I took a tour there a month ago and the people are so nice there. I even was able to meet one of the professors that will be teaching one of the classes in the area I am going into. I was able to ask questions and get a better understanding of the course I am planning on taking. I was also able to tour the Campus View Suites, where I am planning on staying. Such a wonderful community. I absolutely fell in love with the place!"
Freshman,5,"The classes are diverse. Everyone is kind, and willing to assist in any way they can. I would love to see more diversity but that may be due to where the school is located."
Freshman,5,It's my first university but I love it. The teachers I've had really cared about me passing and were very helpful. I like the classes because they are very small so you get a lot of one on one time with the professor.
Graduate Student,5,"Dixie State is a wonderful school! I love the teachers and the academics! I had a blast with all of my courses, teachers, fellow students, and other schools that visited our school. I know it's still has some improvements they are working on! I know those improvements are going to be so exciting to have! I love this school!"
Sophomore,4,Most of my classes this semester were online and a lot of them went really good. We did have some difficulties both with technology and internet services but those mainly got fixed. A lot of the teachers were also understanding if someone needed extra times with assignments or material because they understand that life gets in the way so I feel like that is also really helpful.
Freshman,4,"under the current circumstances of our pal covid, I think the school has really made its best efforts to keep things normal and fun"
Freshman,4,I think the professors are really trying hard to make this whole online thing work for everyone. And there are even activities still going on
Junior,4,DSU does offer online classes and the professors were very communicative and helpful when it came to teaching during COVID-19's circumstances!
Junior,4,"DSU has a beautiful and relatively small campus. It used to be a state college and recently became a University so it has a small-town feel which is welcoming to new students. However, I do think it's departments and faculty/staff are understaffed and underpaid due to the low tuition. It's a blessing and a curse to attend a University that's still growing. It's not the best education out there but it's not the worst either. Give it a chance!"
Sophomore,4,Class sizes aren’t big so the professors get to know you on a personal level if you desire. Easy to talk to them.
Senior,4,"I really enjoyed how Dixie State was very attentive to my needs as a student. when I switched Majors from Nursing to Respiratory Therapy, my counselors were able to help me get through the application process and go through graduation as smoothly as possible."
Sophomore,4,I have loved Dixie State University. Professors are caring and kind. Advisors spend the time to sit down and talk about your needs with you and give you options.
Sophomore,4,"It's a great school! There's always an activity happening on campus! Tailgate parties, carnivals, Miss Dixie Pageant, pool parties, ballroom dance competitions, the list goes on. There's many different resources available for the student. The faculty and staff is always welcome to help out a student."
Junior,4,"I am not an online learner, I prefer in person courses. However, I did take an online course that I did like. The professor had a zoom session that he would post on canvas after in case we missed it or wanted to go at our own pace which was really useful. The professor didn't bombard us with a bunch of work just because we weren't in class but made it interactive."
Sophomore,4,The campus is very modern and beautiful almost all the professors are great They will Make time to meet with you personally if just contact them even if they don’t have a physical office they will just find some place to meet on campus though there are a few bad apples but majority are great. Student life is poor most of the student govt are snobs and there’s a lot of cliches and few activities through the semester but there better luck in joining a club and make friends
Sophomore,4,"It has a good atmosphere, and they are always expanding to create a better campus and provide more opportunities."
Sophomore,4,"They did the best that they could! The professors need some practice in order to have a smooth class. Many just recorded short lectures, which made it hard to ask questions and understand the material."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at Dixie State University has been relatively good. I did have some instances with frustrating professors that wanted to see students fail, only to justify that they were a “hard teacher”. When mentioned to the professor or the dean of the department, nothing was done to fix the matter. Other than that, Dixie is a great place that works hard to help their students succeed by offering many different resources to help them on their journey."
Sophomore,4,"Great professors overall. Saint George is just a fantastic place to live, so being able to do school in a place like Saint George is really the biggest reason why I love Dixie State University,"
Freshman,4,"Dixie State University is awesome! If you like more of a community feel with small class sizes Dixie is the place for you. Professors are amazing and understanding, classes are all within walking distance and they have a good variety of subjects to study. There are weekly activities and tons of clubs to join. Through the school, there are many opportunities for service within the communities. The sporting events are fun and the student section is very involved. There are a lot of nice new buildings including a brand new gym with four floors and rooftop courts. It is one of the cheaper four-year colleges in the state of Utah and provides a great education.  I would highly recommend this school!"
Freshman,4,I have really enjoyed going to Dixie State.  The classes are small and intimate which makes leaning more interactive and personal.  The school is very nice and clean and the professors are very professional and care about their students.
Freshman,4,Great place and great people! The teachers and staff are all very helpful and make you feel welcome. It is easy to find good friends and there is a ton to do in St George with the weather always being great!
Freshman,4,"I enjoy it because I am so involved with everything. As a freshman I am president of my own club I started, i am an actor in student films, I do a lot of volunteer work and I maintained a 3.2 GPA so get involved!"
Freshman,4,excellent school with great staff and very friendly and helpful. there is something for everyone here for sure!
Freshman,4,"The University is very hands on. There is always something exciting happening, from academic events, campus parties, weekly activities, and tons of of campus opportunities."
Freshman,4,"My experience so far at this beautiful University is that of awe. The introduction to college life is truly amazing because they literally have a course that eases you into your role as a student there. I am enjoying my classes, and my teachers truly are excellent at doing their jobs. One, in particular, has shown time, and time again that he could care less about the money he makes, and more on how my life as his student is going. I've treated my professors with respect and dignity, and have been treated with respect and dignity in return. Overall, Dixie State University has shown its colors as an all-inclusive, accepting, and student-oriented learning environment for any and all who choose to attend this learning institution."
Freshman,4,"This has been my first semester at Dixie State University and so far, things have gone very well! All of my professors have been very kind and want their students to come visit them during their office hours. Because it is a smaller university, you get that more personalized feel and connection to those around you. I would give the university 4 stars because some of the buildings are a little outdated, but they are working on adding new and improved technology and buildings in the next few years."
Niche User,4,"I thought it was a pretty great place, there is a lot of social interactions and everyone is ready to mingle. The city Dixie is in is amazing! St. George is a beautiful place and has many fun things to do like hike, swim, and party."
Sophomore,4,"School was cool, but the town itself was weird. When I was a freshman, school was affordable, but now that I'm coming back for my second year things are starting to get pricier and it's really stressing me out. The teachers there are dope and students there are chill. The only thing that is not to my liking was when they raised the prices for everything. RIP to my bank account. I think Dixie is good for people who like small classrooms and like to be able to talk with their teachers when they feel the need to ask questions or get advice. The teachers and staff and students at Dixie are approachable and love to help people no matter what."
Sophomore,4,"So far I really enjoy this school. The teachers are nice and actually reach out to students who they feel could use a little extra motivation. There are a lot of activities that go on and great programs. 
The Financial Aid department is a little difficult to get around and understand. It can be very confusing but not impossible. I don't really see myself leaving Dixie State University despite anything."
Freshman,4,Dixie State’s professors and programs are overall amazing. Because it is a smaller college you can get more one on one help with classes.
Freshman,4,Being able to attend classes at the Hurricane Education Center has been very helpful in allowing me to earn credits while I am still in high school. I have only had good experiences with the professors on and off the main campus and would recommend DSU to anyone looking to stay in the So. Utah area for their schooling.
Niche User,4,Dixie State University is a really good University if you are an outdoorsy kinda person and is located in a really good area surrounded by many different things to do.
Senior,4,Great place to live and wonderful professors! There’s always a lot of fun events and great parties!  I like the smaller class size and the new degree options too.
Senior,4,"Science building is very old and the seats are terrible in the classroom, but professors are awesome and want students to succeed, and will help as much as possible if you communicate with them."
Senior,4,Dixie is a very good University. Every teacher I've had has really cared and was willing to take the time with all of their students to make sure they understood the concepts. There is always tons of events and activities for students to do around campus and Dixie is really good at making sure that everyone knows about all of the events. The scenery around Dixie is amazing! There is a lot of things to do around Dixie if you like to spend time outdoors.
Freshman,4,The teachers are very friendly and really want you to succeed. Dixie State is just such a great place financially and academically.
Sophomore,4,I love the campus and how everything is super close and you can walk easily to all of the buildings. The small class sizes are also super nice.
Niche User,4,Good school for getting your generals done.  Also its growing rapidly and has a lot more students from different backgrounds going there.  Its nice if you like a mid size school with a mid size town with enough to do to stay satisfied.
Junior,4,"I love attending dixie state university! Great student life and awesome location (St George, UT). Good education for tuition, and good professors."
Senior,4,"This is the fastest growing university and college in Utah for a reason.  The professors and resources are excellent and there is also a great school spirit and many fun activities. They continue to upgrade and build more resources for every area of the school including athletics, recreation, arts, and theater.  There is a home for everybody."
Sophomore,4,I love Dixie the weather is great and the classes are small and intimate. tuition is going up but the student life is great.
Senior,4,"Awesome Professors and great student activities each week. Parking is terrible whether you have a parking pass or not, or even if your a visitor."
Sophomore,4,"Dixie State University is a great school because it has enough students that there is always something happening, but it's also small enough that class sizes are great. You can always find time to talk to professors when needed. There are clubs on campus for everyone. I made two new friends in the first month of the semester, but by the end of that semester I had a huge group of friends because they all just invite you in."
Sophomore,4,Dixie State is small enough to have good class sizes and teacher-student interaction. Yet it is also constantly growing gaining many new programs. There are many activities on campus and fun outdoor activities 5 mins off campus.
Alum,4,"I loved the balance I had between school, work, and life at Dixie State University. There's just an unexplained feeling at Dixie that makes it so fun to be apart of. It's that Dixie SPIRIT! I treasure all my time at Dixie State University."
Sophomore,4,"Dixie State University is a great place to get your education. All the professors that I have dealt with have all tried their best to make sure you do well in their classes. One thing that I would like to see improved is more activities or events held by the University to bring the students together. It feels like there are often stretches of time where there isn't much to do, and this is coming from a student athlete who usually have time to do anything else besides soccer and homework. But otherwise Dixie is stellar institution."
Sophomore,4,"Dixie State has been the school to meet my needs. I love the atmosphere and the ability to walk outside on campus in the warm weather found year round.  Everyone is friendly and they always have activities going on. The sports are fun to watch and brings the school spirit to life with each win.

Another thing that is great about Dixie, is its cost.  We are one of the cheapest Universities in the state of Utah.  It gives me hope for receiving a good education with willing and loving professors to guide you into the future without having to break my bank in doing so.   

Overall college is not for everyone, and Dixie State is not for everyone, but it is the University for me and it could be the University for you!"
Freshman,4,"Dixie State University is a great college for students transitioning from high school. The small class sizes and light work load make it a perfect college to get your feet wet with the college experience. The campus is clean and friendly, and there are plenty of activities to do outside of school."
Junior,4,"Dixie State University is a student experience centered institution. They value their students, they provide amazing resources and experiences for them. It is a reasonably priced university with excellent programs. And it's in the fastest growing city in Utah."
Freshman,4,"The campus is extremely friendly and warm. The people are nice and genuine and seeing a frown is not a common thing. The staff is excellent and the people there simply wish to help and encourage you. I look forward to living out the ""college experience"" here and blazing a trail to my future."
Freshman,4,Dixie State University is a great place to go to school! I'm excited to see all of the upcoming improvements that are in-store for the campus.
Freshman,4,"So far, my experience with Dixie is tied closely to the amazing advisers and mentors on campus. Their diligence and care has made an everlasting impact on me and my fellow students. The only downfall of Dixie is their failure to properly address Title XI issues, and I hope that they take harassment issues seriously in the future."
Freshman,4,"If you want to experience the high-level training and education that comes from a University but not get lost in the crowd, DSU is exactly what you need. My professors are so personal, they don't just want to teach a class, they want to teach ME and every individual student. For an incoming freshman, this is also one of the best schools to get an idea of what college is all about--it's a great ""starter college"" you could say."
Junior,4,It’s very welcoming and the activities are awesome! Something I would like to see is more diversity amongst my peers
Sophomore,4,"I love being at Dixie state so much. It has such a beautiful campus and has all the resources you need to get a good grade. The teacher to student ratio is amazing, I’ve gotten to know many of my professors by going to them one on one for help."
Junior,4,"Alot of incoming Freshmen come to Dixie State looking for fun, parties, great outdoor activities, but Dixie has a low retention rate. They need to do something to keep students from leaving once they get there."
Freshman,4,"Not bad, close to home, close to work, just overall convenient. Not as many clubs as other universities I attended, but the people involved in these smaller clubs make free time enjoyable. Overall a decent school"
Sophomore,4,"i like that dixie state university is diverse in culture and the teachers have a good approach in teaching students. also, the on campus activities are great and it keeps you involved in every way. the tuition is also not too expensive compared to other."
Alum,4,Great school! The location is also really great and safe place for students. The weather here is also phenomenal plus student life is great!
Freshman,4,"I like that there is open areas on campus and there are little ""picnic"" tables out doors with shade, outlets, and wifi so that one can do their work on a beautiful day. DSU also has weekly Wednesday activities to keep the student life up beat and ready to have fun. One of the few things I wish they had was more parking spots for students and better food to choose from with faster food service."
Niche User,4,"It's an inexpensive college that provides a good diversity of courses. It's an amazing place to receive education without splurging all of your life savings.  
The student to teacher ratio is low. 

It's located in a very safe and quiet town, and the  student apartments are priced at an acceptable range even for low income families."
Freshman,4,I love the affordability and small campus! The class sizes are small and the professors make time for everyone and are very understanding. My only issue is with the required meal plan in certain dorms.
Freshman,4,"Dixie State is great! Smaller school, more personal attention, lots of involvement, and free food at any event! If you love warm weather and outdoor activities Dixie is for you!"
Alum,2,"I will say first of all that I did have some good professors, but the issues at Dixie being that the administration ruins the academics by meddling in department affairs.  There is little to do on campus or around campus other than hike and mountain bike so I was frequently bored.  The school has also gained a bit of a reputation for not preparing students for higher level classes and for their careers for that matter, in talking with friends and colleagues this has been quite evident.  I does have being cheap going for it though."
Junior,2,"I really have not enjoyed my time at Dixie State. They are behind the times in technology. I have felt that the professors are not on the same page, some use canvas, some require physical copies, and some do both. I have been to other colleges and they seemed more in-tune with the students needs. All students really remain separated by program or major even outside of class. Also being part of a program they have not held to their side of agreement that they verbally made when I came into. They enticed by saying the ensure certain things but they have not held themselves to those things."
Freshman,2,"Overall, this college is nice. I don't like that the approach to academics here. I prefer going to a college that stresses importance on the academic aspect of college. This university is centered around the athletics and some of that focus needs to be relayed to the academic parts of this school."
Sophomore,2,I do concurrent enrollment through one of the high schools. So I take the classes and that is all. I don't attend events and I live at home. The classes are challenging but fun.
College Sophomore,2,"Some information, very little counseling services"
College Freshman,2,I don't think my school has a post-grad service.
College Senior,2,"Since I'm going here for my associates degree alone, there is nothing to help support that. It is not worth going to school here unless you want to be a part of the medical programs which are very competitive."
College Freshman,2,"The course we were required to take was a waste of time in my point of view. It did teach MLA format, But i learned more from my teachers in high school than any of the online classes."
College Freshman,2,"The school is a commuter school and because of that, i feel there was less involvement from the school and less opportunities to display our career goals and talents."
College Junior,2,"It is a cheaper school, that's good. There are some really great professors. There are also some poor professors. What's more, the school administration seems very disorganized. I had several times I couldn't take a test at the professional testing center because of frequent tech issues, or because they told me I had to call to schedule and when I called they told me they only take walk-ins (like five different times). I lost $80 because they insisted I could take my CLEP on the expiration date. Last semester I couldn't ENROLL because I was locked out of my account and the help desk didn't respond to several phone calls and messages leaving my name, phone number, student number, and email. Emailing them just sends a message saying to call the help desk. The experience here is inconsistent, and some programs are much better than others. Tuition keeps going up more than we bargained for when we enrolled, and SUU is a better school and offers better scholarships with cheaper housing. They give up good opportunities for selfish reasons. Dixie State University would have more name recognition and a better reputation and quality of education if they had taken the chance to become University of Utah South, and in this job market and with the cost of education, there's no excuse for allowing conservative retirees to hurt our chances. There are racist ties to the name that I wasn't aware of when I enrolled, and the local community is in deep denial. It's relatively cheap. But I really don't want ""Dixie State University"" to be what's written on my transcript."
College Sophomore,2,When I took an online course all I remember was how annoying it was. The professor recorded herself speaking in a monotone voice about the course content and it was nearly unbearable to listen to. Didn't learn much or pay much attention for this reason.
College Freshman,2,no one is ever in there office ever!! the campus is nice for the area but doesn't compare to big name schools or even nice parks at all.
College Freshman,2,"its just BYU junior, no parties, no social things, they repeat the same school event every semester so no one goes, no programs so you have to transfer, great weather for Utah but not compared to California"
College Freshman,2,"no schools spirit at all!!! my friends and i are the only ones who tailgate football games as in the only car. the students are very sheltered Mormons. I once said ""let them eat cake"" in history and everyone looked at me like i was stupid no one knew who the Marie Antoinette was. no one parties except a small few who don't even attended school and are in there late late 20's like 28-34"
College Sophomore,2,Very limited course offerings. Little to no night classes-- a nightmare for nontraditional students.
College Sophomore,2,Very few online courses offered through this school.
College Student,2,I've never seen anything of that nature.
College Student,2,"I really don't care for online classes. If I have any questions, I can's simply just get them answered, I have to go to great lengths for an answer. There is hardly an interaction between the student and teacher. The programs always seem to have glitches on online classes too and that reflects on my grade for something that isn't my fault."
College Freshman,2,"I dont like online courses because they tend to be disorganized.  The professor cannot have a real connection with their students. Also, assignment instructions can be misinterpreted and unclear."
College Sophomore,2,Ive tried to contact student services for information about scholarships and have never heard a word back
Sophomore,1,"(Part 1) Dixie doesn't even deserve one star. I have spent countless hours and put in thousands of dollars to go to this school for the past 5 years and the counselors are honestly the worst I have ever encountered. First off, the counseling center never answers the phone and then when you leave a message they do not return your phone call. Second, I never get rescheduled with the same counselor so every time I have to re-explain my goals, concerns, etc. Third, whenever I actually need help applying for graduation (mind you I have applied for an associates degree 3 times) I get a different answer and absolutely nobody knows what they are doing. This past time I had a phone appointment (due to COVID) and the counselor had to hang up, go ask for help from another coworker, and didn't call me back for another hour. At this time I had to schedule work off to take this phone call which ended up taking three times the amount of time."
Sophomore,1,Online experience was also garbage. If you are going to do online school find another university or school due to the professors.
Sophomore,1,"Dixie State University has a beautiful campus, wonderful weather, and an admirable mission. The people you meet on campus are nice, but not interested in interacting with others of different backgrounds or mindsets. If you have trouble making friends or meeting new people, Dixie State University is not the school for you. It is very difficult to ingratiate yourself among groups at the university. If you're not a member of the student body or lds church, it will be very difficult for you to make friends. In terms of academics, Dixie State University is not a good choice. It is not a university, it is a community college disguised as a university. The classes are run like it's high school, the curriculum isn't challenging and it doesn't adhere to its ""active learning. active life."" motto."
Alum,1,Dixie gets a one star from me today. I absolutely loved it there when I went. But now the administration is firing tenured teachers without due cause. Don't go here unless something changes.
Alum,1,Don't go here the administration is awful and the religious good old boy system is very well in place and if you are not a member of their god squad they will destroy your reputation and career
Alum,1,"I have no confidence in the current administration.  The school used to have a lot of school spirit and very fine professors.  Now, several of the tenured music and drama, and other professors have been terminated, quietly without due process and explanations.  Students are in panic, and other professors are afraid to speak up with their opinions, or they may get fired as these recent ones were!  I'm giving my rating below because of the recent firing of TOP professors!"
Alum,1,The current administration at DSU has no integrity. No honor. They treat faculty and students with  extreme disrespect. I am now ashamed that I graduated from this school.
Senior,1,"Firing faculty without cause or justification halfway through a semester is not conducive to a safe learning environment. The administration doesn’t give us answers as to why and refuses to hear our concerns on the matter. I used to love this school and enjoyed coming to class everyday. Now I just hope to survive and graduate this semester (spring 2018). Honestly, if I wasn’t so close to graduation I would transfer out. If you or a your child is thinking about attending this University, trust me when I say there are far better options out there."
College Freshman,1,the online math 1000 class is horrible
College Sophomore,1,The IT team has no idea what they are doing and the computers always have problems
College Sophomore,1,Student housing always has problems with plumbing and is an old mess.
Recent Alumnus,1,Online courses were awful. The teachers were completely unwilling to help and most of them did not even have a degree in the subject they were teaching. I really felt like my time and money were wasted on those classes.
College Sophomore,1,It seems like the kids my school attracts are kids that want the college experience without the education. Most kids spend more time hanging out than studying. Although there are also a lot of kids who graduated from a high school in Saint George and go to Dixie so the can live at home and save money while getting their Associates Degree.
College Sophomore,1,"Not the Best Experience – I like having a traditional class, it helps me to focus better and manage my time and get the homework done when I know I'll be coming face to face with my teacher. With a traditional class I feel like I can get better help then I could with emailing my online professor."
College Freshman,1,"Not Happy at All – I've had a terrible experience so far.  The guidance counselors are terrible, I've written multiple emails to my counselor that have been ignored.  The financial aid office doesn't seem to want to help students at all with paying for college, you have to push them for any kind of information concerning how to pay for college.  Also, most of the students at Dixie are close minded individuals and there aren't a lot of differing opinions about the world."
College Senior,1,Career Center Was Not Helpful – In order to graduate I need to meet with a carrer advisor so I e-mailed him about 2 weeks ago and I never heard back from him.
College Freshman,1,"Library 1010 – LIB1010 is the only online course I have taken at Dixie. There is no peer-to-peer interaction, no interaction at all with the professor and the workload was one quiz a week on material that was basic. I would not recommend taking this class but to receive any degree at Dixie State College it is required."
College Sophomore,1,"Career Center – I would not be able to even tell you if Dixie has a support of any kind to help transfer you into the workforce, if it does it is not well known."

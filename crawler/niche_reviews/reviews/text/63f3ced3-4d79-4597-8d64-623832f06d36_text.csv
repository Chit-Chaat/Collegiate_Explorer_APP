Freshman,5,All of my courses are online. When classes first started I was very confused. I was confused on how to join my zoom lectures and recitations. I quickly adjusted by asking questions and trying things until I got results. My professors have been there for me since day one. They have been able to answer my questions and give me honest feedback. I am enjoying my online classes. Having more then one zoom in a day can take all my energy but being able to carry my laptop and have a zoom anywhere on campus makes me feel better. Turning in assignments seem easier to me. Office hours are still helpful. Wifi can be slow at some times but It's okay. My online experience at The Ohio State University is going very well.
Freshman,5,I was so excited when I got the acceptance letter to Ohio State University. It is my dream college and I knew getting accepted would make my family proud. When COVID hit  was scared that I wouldn't have a good college experience. Adjusting to living on campus has hard for me. Being away from my close friends and family hit me. Adjusting to having all my classes online was a challenge for me too. After a few mental breakdowns I pulled myself together and now I am enjoying my college experience to the fullest. I have made new friends and I have ahd some awesome college experiences. The staff at OSU has been a big help. I have adjusted to everything and I am proud of myself. I am working on joining organizations and I am liking the campus. Overall my college experience is going very well and I am grateful for that. I am excited for next semester.
Freshman,5,"It is really good school to attend especially with its competition around .
The city in general which it is located in is a great place for a good education .When it comes to getting involved in activities like club sports to community service, you can choose your own way to get involved from more than 650 student organizations."
Freshman,5,An applicant to the school who has done their research on almost everything about the school. The school offers so many things a student could ask for.
Senior,5,I like the location and the big city campus vibe also I love that the student population is diverse.
Senior,5,Online experience was relatively painless and smooth to transition to. Professors have been understanding and helpful.
Sophomore,5,"Do not take online science classes! they are just harder but good thing is that you have open notes. If you can’t sit 3 hours to watch lecture videos per week, do not take online science classes"
Freshman,5,"You can't find school spirit any better than at OSU. The campus scene is great, everyone who is there wants to and loves to be there. Great atmosphere."
Graduate Student,5,"The College of Food, Agriculture and Science at the Ohio State University is full of faculty with actual real life experience and work hard to help you complete your goals."
Graduate Student,5,I'm sure every college has had issues due to covid but I believe OSU has adapted well to the challenge.
Senior,5,"Ohio State has met and exceed all of my expectations. This school has allowed me to explore different career interests, and settle on the field that I am truly passionate about. Through the many student orgs on campus, I have been able to join organizations with missions that I am truly passionate about proliferating. The career services office at OSU not only allowed me to partake in several internship opportunities, but allowed me to define what it is that I am passionate about, and even helped me in securing a full-time job at a company that I am truly excited to work for. Lastly, and most importantly, Ohio State has given me life long memories and friends. Whether it be late night study sessions in the dorms or libraries, to wandering up and down high street late at night on the weekends, to exploring the AMAZING food in the Short North, or cheering on the Buckeye football every weekend, I can wholeheartedly say Ohio State will always be home."
Senior,5,"The Ohio State University exceeded my high expectations far beyond compare! Their focus on creating global citizens is rooted in creating a space for students to discover their passions while teaching them to take care of themselves and others. The faculty-student connection gives OSU a small-community feel, which undeniably aids student success. There is a seemingly endless array of involvements and opportunities on campus for students to try, and it is nearly impossible to ever be bored!"
Senior,5,"I have been so impressed with how seamless our transition to online class has been. OSU provided professors with ample training on how to use Zoom and other virtual modalities, and it showed! We have lots of resources and flexibility to help us."
Senior,5,"Overall, I've had a great experience as an Ohio State. The breadth of options when it comes to majors (we have over 200), student organizations (we have over 1400) and entertainment across the city of Columbus are incredible since there really is something for every student. I've gotten the chance to do undergraduate research, have a campus job and work as an intern at our medical center. All of these opportunities as well as my coursework have definitely set me up for success in looking for post-grad jobs. Game days, although we're missing them in 2020, are sooooo much fun and just one example of the wonderful Buckeye pride that our community has! In addition, it's a fairly affordable option for many students including myself since there are lots of great scholarship options. Like any large institution, Ohio State isn't perfect, however, it's generally a great school."
Junior,5,"Love the School, great campus and atmosphere. Football games are awesome and create an amazing feeling. Professors are all kind and helpful and have led to having great classes."
Senior,5,I love the distance learning courses offered through the university and try to take 1-3 each via this method each semester. It is user friendly and my preferred instruction method
Senior,5,What I like most is the varied teaching styles of the professors. They are trusted to deliver the material in a way that they think will be most beneficial to the student and I really like that they do not stick to a one size fits most approach.
Freshman,5,I am going to be a dance major and I love the dance program. Everyone is very nice and understanding. My parents both work there as well and the university has always been amazing to their employees. One thing I wish about OSU that was different is about how large it is. I knew what I was getting myself into and it is not that big of a deal to me. That is why I love the dance program because it is small and like a family. If I were any other major I would probably not be attending. I love the choice I have mind.  Overall I really enjoy OSU and am very excited to start in the fall.
Senior,5,"The Ohio State University is an institution that values its students and community. Despite the large student body, professors are caring and genuinely interested in the success of each student. The faculty's dedication to learning and excellence is clear."
Senior,5,"The Ohio State University offers many learning platforms. I have taken numerous courses online during my time here. The professors and teaching assistants are attentive and ensure that all students feel included. They go above and beyond when creating an environment conducive to learning, despite not physically meeting. In each online course that I have taken, the professors hold regular office hours to guarantee they are available to meet with students individually to facilitate learning. They communicate expectations, deadlines, and course content clearly."
Niche User,5,"Very nice location for a university. It is surrounded by shops, restaurants, banks, and local pubs.  It also has several stores in walking or easy to get to with a scooter."
Sophomore,5,"OSU made use of all the tools at their disposal to make sure the transition to online learning was seamless. All of my classes were online during the height of the pandemic, and my professors did a great job of keeping us updated on the changes happening to their classes and giving us leniency."
Sophomore,5,"The Ohio Sate University provides students with a tight-knit community of passionate and hardworking faculty. The classes are enjoyable and challenging, giving students the tools and knowledge they need to reach their academic goals, further propelling them into their dream career. The University is full of diversity and celebration of culture. Prospective students are sure to find a place on campus, whether it be a club or in a class, where they feel like they belong."
Alum,5,"Overall, I had a great experience at Ohio State. There are so many ways to get involved and meet new people. From the time I started until the time I finished my education the campus environment has steadily improved both physically and structurally. And the university is always working to continually improve student experiences and outcomes."
Senior,5,The Ohio State University is one of the best universities in Ohio. They have a wide range of majors to choose from and each program help make sure you’re successful.
Sophomore,5,Switching to online school wasn't ideal but the professors at Ohio State made the transition super easy.
Junior,5,"I have had pleasant experiences with online learning at Ohio State. All the professors were very helpful when technical issues would arise and had flexible hours we could meet with them in-person, on zoom, or contact them through email."
Sophomore,5,"As of March, our academics moved online due to COVID-19, and if I am being honest, learning online was equally excellent as learning in the classroom. The information given was understandable, we were still able to ask questions, have discussions, etc. Professors did an amazing job at figuring out how to use Zoom and keep students updated on what was going on. I continued to understand the content I was learning and apply it. The workload increased a little in my opinion, but nothing I couldn’t handle."
Junior,5,"Ohio State is the largest university in Ohio, which can seem daunting at first. What I've realized throughout my undergraduate experience is that Ohio State is actually the biggest FAMILY in Ohio. Between the connections I've made in my dorm, participation in clubs and organizations, my major, and even through simply walking on campus, I've grown to love my school and my fellow students and alumni. The advice that won me over in attending such a large school was this: it is easy to make a big school seem small, but it is hard to make a small school seem big. I have the opportunity to find the best of both worlds, as well as to receive an paralleled education that will prepare me for my career and the rest of my life. If I could restart and know that I had another four amazing years ahead of me, I would do it in a heartbeat."
Junior,5,"Typically I take one class a semester online. This gives me the opportunity of flexibility in my scheduling of both classes and my day-to-day life. In my experience, the classes are well-organized and the professors are easy to reach and want you to succeed."
Junior,5,"you want a school that is absolutely jaw dropping? ohio state is for you! you can’t get anything better than from THE ohio state university. if you love sports this is the place, if you love parties this is the place, if you love great academics this is the place for you!!"
Junior,5,online classes were not that hard for me. it was a very easy and simple context. tho ha were easy to find and honestly was a lot more easier than actually going to class because you can do things whenever you want you just have to get it done before the deadline
Junior,5,"Ohio state University is a great academic institution.  They offer great programs with extensive experience.  The professors are excellent and well experienced.  they are friendly and supportive.  The classes are great and provide effective communication and interactive environment.  The courses coupled with projects are a great combination of academic and hands on experience.
A lot of colleges at OSU have a great research funding that allows programs to further excel and provide the state up to date information."
Alum,5,"Playing football, competing ballroom dancing, learning ancient history, and going 5-0 against the school up north; I really enjoyed my time at THE Ohio State University."
Alum,5,"Academics were highly regarded, football games and social culture were very fun. Columbus is an amazing city."
Alum,5,I did a mixed online in person course and did better on it than most of my courses. Love the flexibility and structure of online courses I took.
Junior,5,"The Ohio State University has been an amazing experience.  I have learned so much, met so many people and made so many memories.  I am glad to call Ohio State my own."
Junior,5,My online experience has bee amazing as well.  Professors were readily available to help and online tutoring was incredible too.
Freshman,5,great place. great teachers. great classes. great students. great food. great location. great campus. it's great.
Sophomore,5,"At first, I was nervous about how large the student body is at OSU, but I quickly came to love the community on campus and how diverse you can make your experience at the university. I was also disappointed at first that I ended up at OSU because I had my sights set on MIT or Stanford when applying for colleges, but after my first year here, I love Ohio State and I'm proud to call it home. 

I was put in Lincoln Tower for my first year, and I hated it but if I could go back in time I would not change my dorm situation. Living in a 16-person suite was stressful at times, but the friends I made in Lincoln are forever and without them, I would not have had the amazing first year experience that I did.

For any prospective physics or engineering physics majors who took the AP Physics C tests, I would recommend taking Physics 1250H and 1251H your freshman year. I did and I learned so much and gained so many incredible friends from my physics class that will be with me for the next 4 years."
Junior,5,"Ohio State is amazing in every sense. The campus , education and social life caters to all sorts of students."
Junior,5,Online learning has not been too stressful because of how gracefully professors have adapted to the transition.
Sophomore,5,"The classes I had online were very good! The professors gave lots of information and answered emails, texts, and phone calls! I would suggest it taking an online class if you aren’t an organize individual or need to see a teacher face to face."
Junior,5,"OSU offers lots of opportunities for anyone. World class research, involved student body, professors who dedicate themselves to their students...the list doesn’t really end. Although the campus is large and may seem intimidating, the community is incredibly inviting; you will meet a new friend almost everyday."
Junior,5,"All my professors uploaded lecture videos online so students could use them anytime. Whenever a problem arose, all professors and TAs were quick to respond and help. Professors were also incredibly understanding of every situation and made it possible for every student to feel comfortable with the transition."
Junior,5,Professors adapted quickly to the online situation and made the transition as seamless as possible. It went really well.
Junior,5,It has been everything that I hoped college would be and more. The academics are challenging but the professors are very helpful. The student life is great as well.
Senior,5,"this school is great. I have learned so much the past 3 years, most classes i've taken have been very interesting and most professors have been great at their job. The campus is beautiful and there is always something to do."
Alum,5,It was the best choice I could have made for undergrad. I loved every minute at THE Ohio state University.
Senior,5,I had an absolutely wonderful experience at Ohio State that I wouldn’t trade for the world. I had excellent professors every semester which provided me with so many opportunities. The university provided me with funds to study abroad which was amazing not to mention Columbus and the social scene on campus is fantastic as well.
Sophomore,5,"I loved the atmosphere and the people. The staff is well taught and care a lot about the students success. The campus is beautiful and very big with lots of opportunities and places to enjoy. It is physically and mentally relaxing. I also love how it is very diverse. Every corner you turn your head to, you will 99.9% see diversity."
Junior,5,"Being a student at Ohio State has been nothing but amazing. Ohio State has every aspect of college that I want from great classes, opportunities outside of the classroom, and people. The professors I have had at this university have helped me to succeed, and the experiences I have had here have given me so much insight to different types of people and things."
Sophomore,5,Lots of great opportunities both in the classroom and outside of it. A lot of interesting people to meet.
Alum,5,"When I entered Ohio State, I was undecided about which major I wanted to pursue. The University Exploration program was incredible in teaching me about all of the different majors and opportunities that Ohio State has to offer. I eventually decided to major in psychology and minor in general business. Both programs provided me with unique opportunities to learn. I worked as a Teaching Assistant at the Fisher College of Business, and as a Research Assistant in the psychology department. My professors were outstanding and kind, especially in the psychology program. I highly recommend Ohio State to everyone!"
Niche User,5,"The Ohio State University has the best ""Home"" feeling. The sense of community at any event is unlike anything you have ever experienced. Ohio State offers so much opportunity for success, especially if you are interested in international/global affairs. The large campus should NOT scare you away, there is so much room for individualism and it is easy to connect with professors, advisers, etc. So you do NOT have to be just a face on a large campus, you are more than able to make something of yourself and have the best four years of your life!"
Senior,5,The staff of The Ohio State University have been very supportive throughout the years I have been there and want to see their students succeed. I have come across several great opportunities through the university and have guided me well in finding something that is suitable for me. I feel as though the professors try to give the students as much experience as they can to prepare them well for real world applications/situations they may find in their future careers.
Freshman,5,"There are so many opportunities at Ohio State. Whether you’re interested interested in sports, politics, theater, or really anything you will be able to find a club or organization. The classes may be a difficult, but every teacher I have had has been incredibly helpful and truly want their students to be successful. Dorm life is great! A bunch of events and activities are held in the dorms, so there is almost always something to do if you are bored. Campus is located right by High Street, which has so many food, shopping, and clubbing options!"
Sophomore,5,Ohio State includes one of the greatest college atmospheres and experiences. At OSU any person of any race or religion is welcomed and supported. There's so many people that you can find friends with similar interests. It is more challenging for transfers but I would still recommend doing so.
Freshman,5,Love it beautiful campus such helpful people and staff couldn't askfor a better school! The Student life here is amazing the people are so nice i just have the best time here. Anyone wondering if they should go DO IT! I promise you won't regret It I love tOSU
Niche User,5,"My trips to campus have been so easy. I have gone down numerous times throughout my junior and senior year of high school and every time I felt so safe and it was simple. If I didn't know where to go there were signs everywhere and even then if I was still lost no matter who I asked I was able to get help. All the students, staff and volunteers I have interacted with were nothing but great.  The made The Ohio State University feel like home!"
Alum,4,I am proud to be a student of Ohio State. Columbus was a great city to be in during college. Campus is beautiful and the large student body is great for networking.
Sophomore,4,"very nice lecture at branch campus. it will be great if you are learning in person but it sucks in online class because some professors are not able to use the zoom appropriately. But you can meet many people and there might be someone that you are  interested in. I actually meet one of the guy who works for a pharmacology company and I am currently thinking to change my major to pharmacology. I promise that you can find people who are doing one thing with the field that you are interested in. Also, there are many diversity in the OSU. Thus, you can make a friend that’s is not from America and you can teach English to them and they can teach their languages to you. In fact that I am fluent in Japanese and now I can teach both English and Japanese to my friend and you can help others. I strongly recommend finding your study people. Study group is great because you guys can help each other while studying exams and quizzes."
Freshman,4,"All of my classes were online this semester. My professors have made sure I'm doing well, outside of schoolwork included."
Sophomore,4,"It hasn’t been too bad, but I wish the university would actually take action in including and caring about their minority students. Actions speak louder than words."
Sophomore,4,"Last semester all of my classes were online and this semester half of them are online. It can be tough at times because we’ve been given a heavier work load, but most professors truly care about the well-being of their students and check in with us. Some aren’t too tech savvy, but they’re trying their best and are still just as passionate about teaching as they have been previously in person."
Freshman,4,My online courses have done a good job of organizing the coursework but still keeping in touch with the students and not making the workload too overwhelming.
Freshman,4,I love the campus and the atmosphere. The dorms are extremely nice as well. Academics are very good as well as the diversity of the students on campus.
Senior,4,"The online transition has been, overall, very good. Professors have been able to adapt their curriculum to convey the material in comprehensible ways. However, the quality of the instruction has taken a bit of a hit, but that was to be expected. My courses are very technical and delivering instruction online can be difficult at times.  I find myself spending a lot of time teaching myself concepts, and it is a lot harder to stay engaged and participate in the online classes."
Senior,4,"With most classes online during COVID-19, it's definitely been a transition but I think that Ohio State has generally done a pretty good job. Some professors are more organized than others so the experience varies a bit class-to-class. Class format also varies - some classes are synchronous via Zoom, some are asynchronous and others are hybrid."
Sophomore,4,The school is relatively well put together and cares for its students. There are many opportunities that they offer. Now if only Carmen was less of a headache then it would be amazing.
Sophomore,4,"I have not had many negative experiences with online learning. Taking exams and tests online are actually a bit on the difficult side, but the actual learning experience itself is fairly managable!"
Freshman,4,"While I have only been here for a few weeks, I enjoy the culture here, the dorms, their response to COVID, and their relationship to Columbus."
Freshman,4,"So far, professors mostly communicate over email. Is it 100% up to the student to make sure they complete the tasks. BUT OSU sets you up with a free iPad and plenty of resources for help."
Junior,4,"Only have taken some this year due to Covid, the transition of my architecture courses were smooth but lost the portfolio worthy material from studio."
Senior,4,Everyone is willing to help you achieve your goals. It's a great learning experience and you may discover things about yourself that you didn't know before.
Senior,4,"I thought the online learning experience to be very comparable to the in-person lectures. The information is the same and with lecture recordings, it can be easier to review information."
Senior,4,"Ohio State has a wide array of interests, you can find someone with something in common with you fairly easily. On the other hand, the campus is huge, so it can be overwhelming especially at first."
Sophomore,4,"I had to take classes online last semester due to the pandemic, and the site osu uses to disperse information is very streamlined. Older professors weren't the best at using it but they tried their best."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the campus and teacher, great food options and its super close to a lot of amazing places in the city."
Junior,4,I personally enjoyed online courses. I took some online courses and the Carmen platform that Ohio State uses is very well organized and professors utilize every aspect of it. Professors sent out weekly updates and reminders for upcoming assignments. What was expected of us was laid out for us in the syllabus. Quizzes and exams were easily accessible and professors put recorded lectures online and offered some review sessions.
Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful. It has some modernness and some dates looks which give you the best of both worlds. Personally, I always enjoy my walks to class because of the scenery. The Ohio State population is diverse and every person you pass or encounter is unique and different from the last. I love meeting new people and learning about other cultures so this was an aspect I valued. The professors are well prepared and it is evident that they love what they are doing everyday and want to help their students. There is a little bit of everything for everyone around the area. I have enjoyed every moment of being a buckeye."
Junior,4,"I love Ohio State. Everyone displays their pride for the school openly and even though it is a super big school, you can always find the place that you fit in. There are times that it feels like decisions are made by people who don't understand what it is like to actually go to school there, but overall things seem to work out well in the end. With access to the local bus lines, it's always fun to explore Columbus with your friends."
Junior,4,Almost every class uses the online system for assignment notifications and submissions. This platform is user friendly and makes managing your assignments pretty easy. I have taken multiple fully online classes at Ohio State and they are typically easy to follow with good pacing.
Sophomore,4,"During the pandemic, students were required to take online classes. Additionally, I also took an online class on my own over the summer. Some professors transitioned very well in my opinion, some were not as used to using much technology. I was still able to contact my professors/ask questions when I needed help."
Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere of the large college campus and the community of students within it. I found two dorms buildings, the two towers, to be quite uncomfortable to live in, not the best conditions for students."
Niche User,4,From what I heard and seen it is a great place to further your education to go right into a working environment
Alum,4,The online learning experience is fine. It is just important to remain motivated and to keep on top of your work. The professors for my online courses were always very understanding and quick to respond if I have a question. And in certain courses you connect with fellow classmates through class discussion forums.
Senior,4,"Online classes at Ohio State are usually very easy and informative. When we went online due to COVID-19, online classes were more difficult. The professors were trying to figure out what works and what doesn’t, so my learning experience was not the greatest."
Junior,4,"My experience at The Ohio State University has been full of curiosity, acceptance, and a sense of community. The students around me have a thirst for knowledge, and the professors seem truly interested in sharing what they know."
Senior,4,"Ohio State is great for people who take charge and are highly motivated in their own education and social lives; however, it can be daunting to be on a campus with 40,000 other undergraduates. I wish that Ohio State was better at communicating the resources open to it's undergraduates such as mental health services and cultural events."
Sophomore,4,"My first year at Ohio State was great! I met awesome people and attended many events. OSU has so many resources and activities to offer, it is truly amazing. The only thing that I would say about OSU is the dorms. I lived in Drackett Tower my freshman year and it was not the best kept place. Quarters are very, very tight and the ceiling tends to crumble on the top bunk. Besides the residence hall, everything on campus was great!"
Junior,4,Ohio State University provides many resources and activities for the student enrolled. It is easy to get help when needed. They are known for their great programs in the sciences. I would like to see in the future more funding and recognition be put into their humanities programs.
Sophomore,4,"Ohio State offers courses and opportunities that many other large universities do not. There are resources in place for almost every need, but these resources are not always the easiest to access. The technology is far beyond other universities and is accessible and easy to use."
Sophomore,4,"Professors worked to keep the level of education as high as possible despite the unusual circumstances. Help remained easily accessible if needed, and instructors were very understanding of the strain put on students."
Senior,4,My overall experience with Ohio State has been fairly good. They made my transition to their school very easy and are great to work with. Most of the professors are wonderful and truly care about their students.
Sophomore,4,"Very engaging and accepting community! Plenty of ways to get involved and maintain a presence on campus. Although classes can be fairly big, students are still able to create relationships with their professors."
Sophomore,4,Very adaptive to moving classes online. Classes maintained the same atmosphere that they had before while in person.
Sophomore,4,"I really loved the atmosphere of Ohio State. You can really tell the students love to be there. Not only are the students academically inclined, but they also love to be involved outside of classes. There are so many organizations and clubs to join which make the big campus feel a lot smaller. There is something for everybody here and the campus is diverse with students from so many countries. The students are welcoming and it is so easy to strike up a conversation with anyone anywhere. One thing I would like OSU to improve on is the fact that they do not reward hard working students. By this I mean, the money they give out for scholarships has nothing to do with their grades. I feel if a student works hard they should be rewarding them. This doesn’t mean take scholarships away from lesser performing students, but give back to successful ones."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Ohio State has been amazing but it definitely had its challenges. The courses are vigorous and the courses take a lot of effort and time on your part, and I had to learn that my first semester. During some points, I felt like I didn’t have any guidance in terms of going to an advisor for some questions because of conflicting schedules, which became frustrating at a point. Overall, the faculty and professors I have had have been amazing and helpful in terms of me succeeding in their course, and were open to always talking about work or test in the course during office hours. I feel like some issues that happen on campus are not payed attention to as much as they should, and that needs a change. Ohio State has given me the best freshman year of college! I’ve learned a lot in the classroom and outside the classroom, helping me with my personal life."
Junior,4,"Online was a new experience where it was more at ease and pushed me to be more disciplined, search for data, however it was stressful and new.  On line courses where little below satisfactory on courses with lab requirements.  This side should be developed further to allow engineering students receive satisfactory education and technical expertise in return for their investment."
Freshman,4,"fantastic! had a few troublesome classes, but we managed to get things worked out. the tech department was incredibly helpful"
Sophomore,4,"A very big, diverse campus. The professors are very helpful and if you put in the effort and ask for help when needed, you’ll succeed in you classes. Campus food is subpar. The gyms are fantastic and you will find a wide range of activities to do on campus. I would recommend this university to anyone. Go bucks!"
Freshman,4,"Ohio State is an overall great Univeristy with challenging academics. While some professors are incredibly passionate and knowledgeable, others seem to not care as much about their students. Food and dorms could be improved (especially for the cost). And of course with being a PWI, they could work on diversity"
Junior,4,"I really like how even a large campus such as OSU can feel cozy like that of a high school because of how inclusive and open minded the student body is. Additionally, there are always activities to be a part of that can result in the formation of life long friendships and creating good connections for help in your future professional life."
Freshman,4,"The best thing about the Ohio state is the resources it has to offer to its student in terms of involvement onto the campus, the staff is caring, the food is delicious, lots of extra-curricular activities like club and society. The dorms are pretty good. I loved the campus setting, especially the way the campus is set up in terms of building settings. Loved it!"
Senior,4,"I've enjoyed my past three years at Ohio State. It wasn't my first choice when coming to college, but as I started my college career here I really came to see that this school has a little bit of everything. There are so many resources, events, programs and more to take advantage of. OSU is a big place but it is possible to find small community to call your home in class, and in other organizations."
Sophomore,4,"THE Ohio State University has been an amazing experience for me, and I think it would be for you as well! The university has done an excellent job with the COVID-19 pandemic placing the health of the students as a #1 priority while also maintaining classes by switching them to fully online. While there was definitely a learning curve for some instructors, others took to it like a fish in water.

Food options around campus are fantastic, from dining halls to quick food options like Chipotle and Raising Canes you're sure to find something you like."
Niche User,4,"As an older non-traditional student, I've found OSU to be good in terms of its resources to students.  Professors are available and willing to work with you to reach your goals.  The campus has good libraries, labs and studios that allow students to complete their work.  So far my experience has been good in the teacher education program, that I'm a part of, and I would recommend it to other students or professionals seeking such a program."
Alum,4,"The number of students at OSU can introduce many different opportunities for career exploration, but can hinder your ability to stand out when networking with professionals. The campus has fun traditions, but the cost of attendance may not be worth it to someone who does not take advantage of the free student activities. Courses can be challenging, requiring retakes that unexpectedly add to the cost."
Freshman,4,I liked the diversity within the school and the spirit of most of the teachers.  The dorms were decent for me.
Freshman,4,"I love tOSU. I love the campus, the students, the sports, and the school spirit. Everyone loves being here and being a buckeye!"
Sophomore,4,Amazing school with so many opportunities to get involved within the community. Truly compelling to how many connections you will make and how much you will learn here. It is an exciting school with much to look forward to everyday.
Sophomore,4,So far coming to Ohio State has been the best choice of my life. OSU has so much to offer. They have almost everything you can think of. The people I have met to the faculty have been amazing.
Niche User,4,"The Ohio State UNiversity is one of the places to come to if you have an interest in reasearch, with many year long and summer programs like the Theodore Stone Laboratory classes. 

Located in the heart of the Columbus downtown area, the students at OSU have access to some of the best food in the city located in the neighborhood of Short North and surrounding areas."
Niche User,4,"While I'm not yet attending there, every experience I've had so far has been very good and I look forward to starting school there next year."
Freshman,4,"I have loved being a student at Ohio State because of the many opportunities the university provides to have a great academic career and meet new people. In the few months I have been a student I have already made some of my best and closest friends just by simply getting myself involved in the different communities. The school also offers many outside resources, such as free tutoring, to help you keep up with your classes."
Freshman,4,"OSU has a great atmosphere and is all around a great time. I live in one of the oldest dorms on campus which sucked at first but I met my best friends there so it was worth it. Plus, next year I'll be living in one of the newer dorms which is great. The football season and party scene keep things interesting here. It's an academically challenging university but I don't feel too far out of my comfort zone. My only complaint is about a few professors that I've had that I feel don't deserve to be professors because of their incompetence. My honors sociology professor didn't put any grades in until after finals and even then didn't end up putting in our attendance or participation points."
Freshman,4,"This school is full of spirit and energy. There is no “typical student” and each person can find their crowd. Some departments are particularly difficult, especially the chemistry department, which is unnecessarily harsh on students, bringing down my experience in particular. However, campus is a great atmosphere and this is a great school!"
Niche User,4,"I recently went on a campus visit to OSU, and it was wonderful! The campus is gorgeous, even if in the bleakness of winter. It's very lively and in a wonderful area. The dorms I visited were comfortable and beautiful as well, and the students were so diverse! Quite incredible compared to the majority-white town I come from, haha. I also met a couple professors who work there, and they were incredibly passionate about their fields of study! I can't wait to go there!"
Niche User,4,"I am currently enrolled in the Academy Program at OSU, and I attend classes on campus. Personally, the campus is too big for me, and the only viable transportation is bus or scooter. Absolute nightmare for commuters. No parking anywhere. Student body is alright, and the school itself has a lot of resources."
Sophomore,2,I’ve taken a semester online so far. It’s definitely a lot more difficult that in person; professors make up for lack of in person teaching by assigning extra work
Senior,2,"During my time at Ohio State my online learning experience hasn't been the best. Some of the professors are great and easy to work with, however a lot of them are very difficult to work with and take a very long time to get back with you if you need anything. There has even been a time where I had such a difficult time with a teacher that I had to switch to a different online professor at a different campus."
Junior,2,"Ohio State University is like the ultimate DIYs of institutions. They may give you the info you need, but they do not teach or show you how to utilize the information.  If, this is not a problem for you kudos, if it is choose another school or attend when you are prepared for such an institution."
Sophomore,2,"It's basically your average university. Like any other university or high school, kids party a lot, but brown-nose to their professors inside the classroom.Most professors here are inflexible and never follow their syllabus, but that is another common trait of most American universities. 
Move-in day at this university is horrible. Not as bad as it is at other universities, but most of the volunteers are OWLs(Ohio State Welcome Leaders). These are basically students wanting something more to put on their resume. They are very rude and never let you use the carts even when you want to bring more stuff up from your car. They make it hard for you to use the elevator also.
 If you're a vegan, it's very hard to eat here as the vegan station closes early. The gyms here are crowded and full of entitled brats so it's hard to use the treadmills and weight machines. Co-ed dorms are also the norm here."
Graduate Student,2,"I live 20 minutes off campus. To get to class on time I leave my house an hour before class to be on time. Where I park in relation to my class is a few miles away. The buses have too many stops to truly be helpful.
The teachers have so many students to teach that many students get left behind. The science section has an area where students can go if they need help. The area is small and overcrowded by students. Many students are talking about everyday things instead of science. This makes the area extremely loud. This area does not promote a healthy studying environment. The TAs have poor communication skills and tend to ignore students.
Exams are awful. The desk I used was tiny. The chairs were so close together that I would elbow my neighbor unintentionally during the test. It was the noisiest exam I have ever taken because of all the ruffling of papers, pencils writing, students re-situating, and buttons being pressed on calculators. The noise was distracting."
Alum,2,"My experience at The Ohio State University was, dry. My personality does not call for a huge campus, but I stuck it out. I felt like an empty number among many other numbers walking around campus. Also, I was a commuter my entire career and this school is not commuter friendly; that goes for parking, activities and so on. If you did not start out as a freshman on campus and live with dorm-mates, making friends is not as effortless and in my opinion it is harder to connect with the university otherwise."
Sophomore,2,"Housing is completely horrid, especially for the price. I have lived in many other university styled housing from suit/ apartment styled, greek housing, and now in a dorm and I must say that I DO NOT recommend living in a dorm at OSU. The conditions here are horrible I spend the equivalent of $1000 a month to live in a dorm that is 5x5 with absolutely NO A/C. I couldn't even be in my room during the beginning of the school year due to how hot it was. The winters are no more bearable though. During the winter they don't even have central heating, they have gas heaters from from 1945 that they just run an uncontrollable amount of heat through. Most days it's crazy cold during the day time (Because they don't really run the heat during the day) and a blazing inferno during the night because thats when they like to kick the heat up to 99 degrees. Now normally I wouldn't complain, but given the amount of money I spend to live here"
College Freshman,2,"Sexual assaults are a problem and so is crime and violence in general, especially if you are female."
College Senior,2,"In the business school, greek life is very big and if you aren't in a fraternity, it can be hard to network."
College Freshman,2,I have ultimately been very disappointed in my school experience so far.
College Junior,2,My freshman year I was in an old building that was very small. I was sick through out the entire year because of the poor air circulation.. sophomore year I moved to off campus housing.
College Freshman,2,"Never stayed in campus housing, cuz it's a ripoff."
College Sophomore,2,"My goal is to become a special education teacher, however getting into the program is much difficult. Since the program only accepts 35 students and it seems a bit unfair to restrict on a high demand work ethnic. I find programs are restricting the number of students or asking to much under a short period of time. It doesn't give the student a opportunity to explore and desire a career/degree they wanted when not many could get in."
College Freshman,2,"It is not easy to get financial aid because if you don't meet their specific requirement, it is almost impossible to earn any type of aid."
College Junior,2,"i dont party much, I work at a bar and im not into the house party scene"
College Junior,2,"high street is chain central, its nice to have familiarity but its boring"
College Junior,2,The meal plans are not catered to students appropriately
College Freshman,2,I have reapplied for financial aid because they did not take into account many things.
College Student,2,Financial aid has been a nightmare and is the reason I haven't started school sooner
College Junior,2,I transferred in and it was frustrating that I couldn't get the scholarships available to freshmen.
College Freshman,2,Didn't receive a scholarship I was qualified for.
College Freshman,2,I stay out of it!
College Freshman,2,Ohio State gives very very little to out of state students. Tuition is very high and some help to the out of staters would be nice.
College Freshman,2,Most professors are not strict at all with attendance. Alcohol and drug use is a little too lenient.
College Freshman,2,It's very difficult finding anything close to campus that is cheap or safe. You have to be willing to commute 20+ minutes a day and pay ridiculously high rent for something semi decent.
College Freshman,2,"Too many times I have smelled pot in my dorm hall and nothing has been done about it, even after I filed a complaint to my hall director. My friend had a horrendous experience with the administration about finding her a new room after her roommate was repeatedly abusing her. She almost left the university because of it. Every night there is some sort of room full of people in my dorm screaming and dancing until 3 am, but nothing ever gets done about the noise violations."
College Freshman,2,"Most dorms are pretty bad as far as not having air conditioning, having too cramped of living space, or just overall bad location in relation to classes. Most people live on campus second year for a very good reason."
College Sophomore,2,"Bold Heading says Review Off-Campus Dining, Description say Off-Campus Housing.

Dining I already answered.

Housing is good. Most options are townhouses that need updating. If you have a car you can look further and usually can find something nicer but comes with a higher cost, especially if you venture closer to downtown/High street."
College Sophomore,2,Campus Parc has high prices and many times the lots fill up requiring you to park in the west campus lots. You can buy the pass for only west campus but when I have to work the spots next to the Schott are for the more expensive pass. The buses don't go to the Schott either.
College Sophomore,2,Very monopolized campus when it comes to food. Some outside vendors on campus would be very welcome.
College Freshman,2,"Since the school is big, it's hard to administer the whole school. I can understand that. However, coordination between different offices is loose and non-effective."
College Freshman,2,"Compared to the money i got from the other schools i was accepted to but OSU gave only loans which covered about $7,000 of the cost of the $23,000 i have to pay."
College Freshman,2,I am a bio major and it sucks. The weed out classes really screw with your GPA. Everyone was valedictorian at their high school here. The classes are very competitive.
College Freshman,2,The food is WAY overpriced.
College Freshman,2,Ohio State does not give much financial aid at all.
College Freshman,2,I went to egineering but then quit because of programming.
College Sophomore,2,I received absolutely no financial aid despite my family having no savings for college for me.  I am hustling to find scholarships for next year just so I can attend school.
College Junior,2,So much competition in the country as well as from the school so you better have a strong profile.
College Junior,2,"Unfortunately a long and detailed review I wrote was deleted... So I'll summarize

- Overrated

- Stereotypes and tryhards everywhere

- Greek life in general here would like to be that of any other B1G university. The community is trying so hard to be more important than it is and takes what it sees on TFM to try and mimic it.

- Really not as big of a community as other schools. Only about 4% of the students here are in GLOs

- Issues with admin which lead to organizations being on probation all the time. Students think they can BS and outsmart everyone at the University and there is not much tolerance yet for that

- Rivalries aren't healthy and lead to physical altercations and property damage all the time

- Guys have been so cruel to girls that they've transferred, attempted suicide and dropped out.

- High turnover rate. A lot of members in fraternities or sororities drop after a year or deactivate before graduation because it's not worth the suspended social calendars, increasing chapter dues, lack of networking, and the list goes on.

- A lot of the fraternities and sororities were started when they didn't need to be. Half of the groups are clones and had no business being started other than to fill a resume.

- Unless it's athletic or academic, it's overrated here. The location is great but that's about it outside of those things mentioned. 

- There are no real ""frat parties"", there is no real ""Greek row"", it's all just thrown together because it's THE Ohio State University and we're expected to have everything a university should have. Some houses are nice, some suck but try not to judge a book by it's cover.

- If you're considering Greek life, just be sure you know what you're getting into so that you can get the most out of the experience."
College Freshman,2,"When I first moved in, my dorm was not even clean. The floor was dirty and we needed to clean it ourselves. We have a decent amount of space, and the bathrooms are ok except that the person who is supposed to clean them does not do a very good job cleaning it. Other floors of my residence hall have said the custodian who cleans their bathroom is great but that isn't the case on my floor. Furthermore in the beginning of the year the water fountain broke on our floor and they said it couldn't be fixed until after winter break. I'm not sure why at such a big university that something like this cannot be fixed right away when we pay thousands of dollars to live here."
College Senior,2,I've never experienced or know anyone who has ever experienced sexual assault on campus. I know it does occur though because we get text messages to our phone when an incidents is being investigated.
College Sophomore,2,Unless you want to join greek life or live in a house with six others it's tough to find something less than half a mile from campus.
College Sophomore,2,Mostly middle class white people
College Sophomore,2,"While there is a lot of help available, you really don't have any help searching for anything outside of Federal Student Aid.  No ideas or info on anything but departmental scholarships which are 1 in 50,000 chance at getting one."
College Sophomore,2,"OSU tried to implement a smoking ban across campus, but I honestly didn't think the issue was prevalent until the ""ban"" was implemented. They're pretty good about enforcing rules on illegal drugs, but not so much on tobacco."
College Senior,2,Housing is very sub-par. And prices are terribly high
College Sophomore,2,not enough scholarships are offered or even advertised.
College Junior,2,"I do not have a car on campus but from what I have heard from others it is terrible, hard to find parking and the cost is outrageous. I personally find it just as easy and convenient to walk everywhere on campus."
College Junior,2,"Too poor to afford college, too rich for financial aid"
College Junior,2,I did not apply but I heard that FAFSA has a lot of trouble getting the people their money in time so they could not schedule when they wanted to
College Freshman,2,"I commute and Ohio State is unwilling to make it easier for us commuters.  You can get a spot by parking at the stadium, but you must be there before 8:00 am to get a spot.  You can alternatively park on west campus which is a mile or two away from most classes.  They do offer a bus service which is free, but it would be nice if they would consider creating more parking spaces closer to campus."
College Senior,2,This winter was pretty hard to get through and make it to class/drive in traffic.
College Junior,2,Could be better. The campus busses are usually packed and are late very often.
College Freshman,2,"Generally, walk in groups. You'll always hear horror stories of mugging, rape, etc. around campus at night"
College Freshman,2,Columbus is a boring city with fairly little going on outside of a few decent restaurants. There's hardly ever a need or want to leave the general campus area unless you want to buy groceries or go to a bar downtown.
Recent Alumnus,2,Would not choose the same major again.  Too much focus on the same things in multiple classes (lots of cardio and public health stuff).  Very hard to find a job with just a undergrad degree in Exercise Science.  After talking to people who majored in the same thing at other schools they received a much better rounded education in Exercise Science and felt more prepared for the work force.
Recent Alumnus,2,"You really have to make an effort as the student to get the answers to the questions you need about specific topics.  There are a lot of resources online from the school about aid, but if your situation is outside the box or you don't have help from your parents it can get overwhelming.  Best to do your own research on aid and only talk to the school if you have to (because you'll have to wait in line for an hour)."
College Freshman,2,"Its up and down. Its ohio weather, in the morning it can be snowing, and by the afternoon/night it will be shorts weather."
College Sophomore,2,College is expensive and financial aid just accumulates great interest on top of the debt already accrued.
College Sophomore,2,They do not do a whole lot around campus. They live in huge houses while the Black Greek students don't even have houses on campus.
Alum,1,I only took one online course through OSU. I was not a fan and I never took another one. This was pre-pandemic though so maybe things have changed since then.
Niche User,1,The colleges officials don’t listen. I felt like I was at a clique rather than a professional institution.
Niche User,1,"I was initially excited to finish a bachelor’s degree at OSU but that changed. A class(Disability Studies which counts as an English credit) is the reason I am transferring from Ohio State University and I do not recommend this class or college for students pursuing the English major.
Starting with the professor, my problem started with a group project in early March. One of my group members complained about work load discrepancies. The professor responded by sending me a message(during spring break) asking about specifically my participation. To clarify, the message was not written in a manner that was open to the possibility that I, myself, may have found an issue with my group members. The professor did not approach the problem with any degree of neutrality and then closed the case of my grade the first day the school opened after spring break. The college officials were too busy defending and being buddies with the professor that they wouldn’t listen to anything."
Niche User,1,The student body is taught to be very intolerable of anybody who challenges the views the staff and professors are pushing down the students throats. They act in a disgusting manner to those opposing those views.
Niche User,1,Students portray a despicable portrait of themselves when put in the public's view. Very intolerable of views that disagree with their own. There's no way to dispute their behavior when it's recorded live.
Niche User,1,"Not supportive. Only care about $ and football. Shoulda got instate tuition. Some dorms w/no AC; building new ones? Baker has 2 toilets, 2 showers per bathroom per wing of 10 to 15 ppl. Not that diverse. Saw 2 homeless men at the UDF on High Street, at about 7:30 PM once. Bad roommate; tried to change 3 times before I got what I asked for.  Use political examples that don’t line up with everyone’s beliefs to illustrate things. REP for Psych is dumb-more time. They’re renovating Weigel and the SOM’ll use Hughes (no AC, cramped for band, dirty, bad elevator) for 2 yrs. The “THE.”  Just a name. Odd campus design. I left."
Niche User,1,"The school is just terrible. All they care about is athletics. The school is too big. The sports teams aren't good. Urban Meyer doesn't care about anything but being good at football. The classes are too big. The teachers really don't care about you. You're just a number. It also is in Ohio, which isn't much better than Indiana. It is always cold and windy. I don't recommend going here."
Alum,1,People are just mean. Administrators are unhelpful and obstruct students; domestic students are openly hostile to international students; faculty members are too busy to be civil.
Graduate Student,1,"OSU for undergraduate degrees is fantastic. My experience as a PhD candidate has been simply awful. Administrators just do not care about you. Everything, from online enrollment to waiver processing is severely broken. Everyone, including faculty members, are expected to do too much resulting in little PhD student mentorship or care. I think one of the most distressing aspects of Ohio State is that the Graduate School HATES students. They are just downright rude, incompetent and unhelpful."
Junior,1,"All this school cares about is its sports teams. If youre coming for academics look elsewhere. I know more people who have come here and now have mental issuse, enough to be sent to a psych ward for a week, than I do those without. Save yourself the pain and go to a dofferent school."
Freshman,1,"This school is terrible. I had to transfer midway through the year. The professors don't really care if you succeed. To them you are just a number. Also, research seems to be a priority for most of the professors at Ohio State University. The dorms are alright. The meal plans are a rip off."
College Junior,1,It is so big that I feel like I get lost in the processes
College Freshman,1,"I got stuck in one of the worst dorms on campus. My floor was not social, making it very hard to meet people. It was very dirty and old which was unpleasant to live in. Also, it was very far from a lot of things on campus."
College Junior,1,"they privatized parking, campusparc sucks and gives out unnecessary tickets"
College Junior,1,There are not enough financial aid officers who know what they are doing
College Freshman,1,"no healthy options, I'm very strict on how healthy i eat, and I'm also vegan."
College Freshman,1,"It's VERY difficult to eat healthy food here, plus everything is so expensive. I waste hundreds of dollars each MONTH because of the meal plan here."
College Junior,1,"Living on campus is nice, but you get the feeling that it is encouraged to move off campus after you 1st or 2nd year of school. Most if not all my friends life off campus and I am still in a dorm. The price of living in a dorm compared to living off campus is astonishing. I plan on living off campus next year."
College Sophomore,1,"While they do provide entertainment for the incoming students, they live in the worst squalor with the worst attitudes."
College Sophomore,1,I had a horrible freshman year experience living in Lincoln Tower.
College Junior,1,parking on or near campus sucks
College Senior,1,Haha it's Ohio come on the weather is always crazy.
College Sophomore,1,The school says they have money but I have not seen any of it.
College Sophomore,1,I am currently trying to get into Finance through Fisher and have already been turned down twice based solely on my GPA not be competitive enough.  It has not mattered how I do in finance courses or that I use finance applications in my job which is incredibly stressful and discouraging.
College Sophomore,1,IT SUCKS FROM NOVEMBER TO MARCH
College Sophomore,1,"If you don't receive the initial scholarships when you apply, there is like no opportunity to get them at any other time. I got nothing."
College Sophomore,1,It depends on which engineering major it is. The highly competitive majors turn away people that have applied over and over again. And then they have to waste money on retaking classes that they already passed just to keep their GPA up high enough to apply. While others let anybody who wants to join  in at whilm.
College Sophomore,1,Ohio has quite possibly the worst weather in the world.
College Junior,1,ALOT of discrimination/prejudice toward minorities especially Black Americans.
College Junior,1,Permits are really expensive and parking is overall the worst thing about my school
College Senior,1,"For as much as you pay for tuition, you'd think they'd have smaller classes, but almost all of your classes will be 100+ people, and some of the more popular classes will be 200+ people.  You will always have a TA, and it's pure chance if the TA is any good.  You will sit through a lecture from the teacher, and on another day have recitation with the TA.  The TA is where most of your contact for class is.  The TA's aren't actual teachers either, they're graduate students in the field of the course and are doing it as part of their graduate program.  I don't know how much they train the TA's but it seems like the ones that are good are just the people with a knack for teaching."
College Senior,1,"The Engineering majors have A HUGE workload.  As expected you have to take a lot of courses in math, chemistry and physics.  

For as much as you pay for tuition, you'd think they'd have smaller classes, but almost all of your classes will be 100+ people, and some of the more popular classes will be 200+ people.

I don't know how much they train the TA's but it seems like the ones that are good are just the people with a knack for teaching."
College Senior,1,"This school is HUGE.  Their idea of a small class room is 80 people, and average is 100+.  It is best if you are a freshman just out of high school, because they will mold you how they want you to experience OSU.  If you are a non-traditional or completed some courses at a community college, a lot of things will frustrate you.  

There is a general atmosphere that the college is more interested in you having a good social life than your academics.   In addition to all of the extra studying you  need to do because all of your classes are in huge lecture halls, if you commute, the parking lot is so far away from campus that you have to take a bus in (turning a 20 minute drive into a 1 hour commute).  This school will take over your life.  Which is fine for those who want ""The College Experience"", but if you don't, then you'll be miserable.  I have attended several different colleges and by far, this was the worst in terms of academics, convince, and cost (There isn't cheap food around except for McDonalds, and once you get there, it's not worth the extra time to drive somewhere for lunch)"
College Senior,1,"This college is designed around the Freshmen just out of high school that is living on campus.  Commuting is a pain.  Not only is the cost of permits expensive, but the standard lot students park in is several miles from the campus.  You have to take a bus from your car to get to campus.  Even if you live 20 minutes away from campus, it will still take you an hour to get to class.

And forget trying to do anything near or on campus during football Saturdays."
College Sophomore,1,It is very disappointing  in the parking here. I have to take a bus all the way to west campus to get my car so I can work. This is my third year in college and I need to work.
Recent Alumnus,1,I am still paying student loans and I will be for many years to come and I was a top student in my classes. 
Recent Alumnus,1,OSU has been outsourcing their parking and the rates have sky-rocketed. It is wayyyyyyyy overpriced and too expensive. 
Recent Alumnus,1,Off-campus housing is rather mundane and terrible. I was a commut. because there are way better options in nearby suburbs of Columbus. 
Recent Alumnus,1,There are several sororities and frats available on campus to join. 
College Sophomore,1,Campus parking cost so much. Its bad enough when you already commute and have to pay for gas there and back but also have to pay so much money to just pull into a parking spot is crazy! Also in order to get a spot you have to get there like an hour before if you want to get a spot and still try to make it class on time.
College Sophomore,1,"Did not receive any scholarships/grants, and barely received any loans at all because of parents income.  Paying for my education by myself, I do not know how I will pay for school when I am out of out-of-pocket money."
College Sophomore,1,"I have to leave my house 30 minutes early just to get to campus. Then I have to find parking in the West Lot. Then I have to take a bus to main campus, then get to class."
College Senior,1,"an absolute headache. all aid is given to everyone else- small towners and minorities, disabilities, out of state- most students who came from 2-4 times the money I did had all the aid and I didnt received any or barely any until I became independent. very unfair and kills the diversity of students from different areas of the state and background. i truly felt like the white, working class, city minority with no assistance. number one reason transfering OSU- they did not care about keeping me."
College Sophomore,1,"Very expensive. 1st and 2nd years must part on west campus. Unless you have class very early, finding a parking spot near the stadium is near impossible. Be prepared to stalk people to their parking spot."
College Student,1,"Parking is terrible. I live on-campus and you would think that I would at least have a better chance of finding a parking spot. Wrong answer. I did not buy a permit because the cost is insane and I can use that money to pay for my books and use towards gas. Even if you buy a permit, you're not guaranteed to get a decent parking spot because of the other 28 million students that attend OSU that also have a car to park. My advice would be to get a bike and hook it to a tree and go to class."
College Freshman,1,HORRIBLE! Parking is expensive and few and far between for actual spots. Plan at least 20 extra minutes in order to find parking.
College Sophomore,1,The parking passes are very expensive and students are not always guaranteed a spot close to where you live.  There are plenty of spots located on west campus and buses run at almost all times to get to classes and back to your car.  Tickets are common and people get caught easily if the meter runs out of time or if the car is parked in a wrong area.
College Freshman,1,One day at Ohio State you could have a chance of seeing all four seasons.
College Freshman,1,The dorm I live in is a quad on north campus that is getting torn down after I leave here in a week. I have met lots of good friends here and it is a great location but this building is 50 years old and disgusting. I have killed six cockroaches here and everything is dirty and bits of ceiling fall on stuff. There's pipes running through my room and the showers are small.
College Freshman,1,"The drug scene at OSUN is largely visible. The dorms often smell of marijuana, and it is nearly impossible to go a class without 1/4 under the influence of a drug. To much misfortune, there is little to no enforcement, either from the RAs nor the administration, despite their knowledge of the illicit activities."
College Freshman,1,The athletic centers at Ohio State are great as well as the libraries and research facilities.
College Junior,1,"For past 4 years, none of my classes got ever cancelled, even when there were snow storm and hurricane."
College Freshman,1,"Rooms are way too small, and old.  In many cases, the beds cannot be un-bunked.  Lighting isn't the best.  The air/heating isn't controlled by students, so you're either too hot or too cold."
College Junior,1,There was a spree of crimes during the beginning of the semester.
College Freshman,1,"As a freshman, I see a lot more of this than older students.  Living in a dorm, especially toward the beginning of the year, there was some wild behavior with drinking and smoking pot.  The cases that were caught were punished, and rules are enforced heavily in these cases.  However, there is not always a presence to catch this behavior, and often it goes unchecked."
College Freshman,1,"You cannot find parking on campus usually. If you do, it usually costs a significant amount to do so."
College Senior,1,"Parking is a nightmare, have to get onto campus early to find a parking spot. Parking stickers are expensive, and it is hard to find parking. Have to take transportation from west campus to central campus if that is where you parked. It is a process every day."
College Senior,1,"Mostly Ohio people. Some from Asia, but those are the only countries that are mostly here."
Recent Alumnus,1,my challenge was going to class because they all suck (horrible response to this question but whatever). To get in this school just walk in the door I got in with a 2.6 gpa mind you i had like 51 credit hours
Recent Alumnus,1,originally thought to major in political science but taking constant political courses is redundant and boring

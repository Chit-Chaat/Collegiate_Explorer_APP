Graduate Student,5,"Hilbert College is a small yet lovely campus. Despite the rules and regulations that often feel suffocating, the school itself reminds me of home. It makes me feel safe as it is so small and campus safety is a two minute walk from where I live. I live in an apartment where me and my best friends can have fun every night. Finally, the professors go out of their way to share their knowledge from within the field they work. They are willing to be involved in job pursuits and give you resources to help you succeed in the future."
Graduate Student,5,"Best college located in upstate New York! I am proud to be a graduate of the Forensic Science/Crime Scene Investigation Program at Hilbert. The program gave me an opportunity to study abroad at Bond University in Australia for a semester, created leadership opportunities, allowed me to be a student-athlete, prepared me for graduate school and most importantly opened doors for my future. The faculty at Hilbert is top notch with a world of hands-on experience in the forensic science work force. I discovered that if you put in the effort and work into the classroom, the faculty will bend over backwards to help you be successful. Hilbert College is the college for anyone looking to major in forensic science or criminal justice."
Freshman,5,"I love this school! All the professors care about the success of the students, class sizes are small, there are plenty of sports and clubs to involve yourself in. RAs at the college also have programs which can be just as fun as clubs. We have other cool events, too. The school is accepting of people of all backgrounds."
Works Here,5,"The relationship between the faculty, students and staff is second to none. Almost all of the professors in the Criminal Justice Division were practitioners before earning their advanced degrees so they speak from experience as well as from theory."
Junior,5,"Let me tell you a little bit about Hilbert. We are a four-year liberal arts college in the Catholic, Franciscan tradition.  We are located in Hamburg, NY, 10 minutes from downtown Buffalo, 5 minutes from the Buffalo Bills Stadium.

 

But, what makes us different is our size and style.  We have about 1,000 students on campus and have 13:1 student to faculty ratio.   We’re the right-sized environment for anyone looking to advance his or her career. Our campus has new apartment-style student residences, and modern academic, administrative, and athletic facilities.

 

The feel of Hilbert is warm, friendly, and supportive.  Our caring faculty, staff, and coaches will give you the individual attention you need to develop your unique skills and talents at your own pace."
College Senior,5,"I really enjoy all of the teachers at Hilbert, they really care about you as person and they try to get to know you. Their teaching styles are very diverse and they will conform to anything that will help us succeed."
College Sophomore,5,The professors are professionals in the field that they teach. There are many courses and extracurriculars to pick from. The registration process is simple.
College Sophomore,5,We are a very diverse school in all of these categories.
College Sophomore,5,"I love my school, I'm glad I decided to go where I am. My professors and everyone are so willing to help you and are so friendly!"
College Sophomore,5,"We are a Franciscan college, so it's basically against our college. It's not visible, sometimes I see some upperclassman drink, but not a lot. Campus safety is very good at checking the dorms and reporting to parties and such. I don't believe any one is pressured to do anything that they don't want to do."
College Sophomore,5,"I don't live on campus, but our facilities are one of the best in the country."
College Sophomore,5,I feel very safe on campus. I haven't heard about any sexual assault problems on campus.
College Freshman,5,"Almost every professor on campus is a retired officer/military, there is an alarm in between the two residential buildings that is easily accessible to all students and has never needed to be used. Public Safety is easy to talk to and are always willing to help, you can always see the around campus."
College Freshman,5,The professors are professionals in their field and know their stuff!
College Freshman,5,This school is unique in the sense that it is like a family.  We all know each other and everyone is here to help others.
College Freshman,5,Academics are great here. Professors care about students succeeding. Workload is not bad as long as students put in their time wisely. There are many study areas to have on campus.
College Freshman,5,"Nothing ever happens on campus as far as crimes, assaults etc. I feel safe and secured here."
College Freshman,5,"Class sizes are small, professors are excellent, and the courses are great too"
College Freshman,5,"In Human Services they give out many options for internships and job opportunities, the services here on campus are great, I don't feel like a number here, I actually feel welcomed here."
College Freshman,5,"The dorms are one of the best I've seen, especially Trinity Hall. Those dorms are huge, spacious, and brand new."
College Freshman,5,"Great school for students who want to succeed and graduate. Human Services professors are friendly, passionate, and hard working people. Not many students on campus, which I like. You get to know everyone on campus, you're not just a number here. If you work hard in your studies, then you get the grades, and the recognition you deserve at Hilbert. Extra help is always there as long as you contact the professors. I feel safe at the school because it's a tobacco free campus, and very secured. Trinity Hall are one of the best dorms I've ever seen! Great school overall!"
College Junior,5,My major offers outside of campus experiences
College Junior,5,Guys and girls dress appropriately and professionally
College Junior,5,I am planning an internship for the next semester
College Freshman,5,I do most of my wok at home. So Im not sure how the labs and computers are
College Freshman,5,"Many of the students are there to learn not party it up, which I find great."
College Freshman,5,I haven't enccountered anyone really doing drugs at all
College Freshman,5,"Downtown Buffalo is amazing - the clubs/bars are cool and underage nightlife is limited with only one club that allows people under 21. Transportation is accesible by bus or car, sometimes walking distance."
College Freshman,5,Student life on campus is great. All the buildings are modernized and campus events/traditions take place almost weekly. Majority of the students interact and get along - especially when it comes to sports. 
College Freshman,5,"Located in the Buffalo area, there are also three other schools besides my own. Therefore, there are very many communites dedicated to students for living. If a student cannot find off-campus housing on their own, their advisor or counselor's are very helpful in helping a student do so."
College Freshman,5,"Forensic science and criminal justice are the top majors at my school - the programs are great, with very many intern options that will help place you after graduation. The workload is balanced between the four years of program and the curriculum is not too challenging for any student. Professors and other staff make it a wodnerful experience to be apart of such programs."
College Freshman,5,"Living on campus is simple. The distance between the cafe, dorms, library, classes and gym is very convenient. It is very apparent that much work has been put into the school to satisfy the needs of its students."
College Freshman,5,"I love my school. It may be small, but the class sizes are perfect for me and the people are way more friendlier than I've ever experienced in High School. The staff (especially the Dean) often interacts with the students and I feel as if I have created my own family. I wouldn't ever change my mind about switching schools!"
College Freshman,5,"Being a Fransican school, there are very many policies to follow. Campus safety, as well as the Residence Life staff, help enforce these policies as much as possible."
College Freshman,5,"There are a number of restaurants, fast food and family owned, located almost right next to the school that make it convenient and affordable for students - especially for late night options."
College Freshman,5,"The list of majors our school has is almost the same as every other school, with the addition of criminal justice and forensic science that many schools in the upstate NY area do not have."
College Freshman,5,"Campus safety is always around, and just a phone call away if needed."
College Junior,5,I'm a CJ major... It's the best school in the region for my major
College Junior,5,Hilbert provides a lot for its students
College Sophomore,5,Hilbert College is known for the great professors and great academic opportunities. Hilbert College makes sure every student is able to continue his/her education and achieve their goals. Hilbert will also continue to stay in touch with alumni and help find alumni jobs in this economy.
Niche User,4,"Hilbert college makes it easy for every student who wants to make Hilbert college her/his dream college. The most amazing thing about Hilbert college is the diversity of different students from across the world, it makes learning easy since students get to share there experience from there respective counties and teachers are more helpful."
Niche User,4,I toured Hilbert College and I think that the campus is beautiful. It is a smaller private 4 year college. Food is wonderful and respectable dorms. Teachers seem very nice as well and understanding.
Sophomore,4,"Hilbert campus may be a very small campus, but it gives great opportunities to get out there in and outside of campus than you would at a bigger school. The professors are great, they put in the one-on-one time for office hours. Class sizes are small, so students aren't a number here. Clubs, jobs, and athletic opportunities are very high here."
Sophomore,4,"The education here is great! The professor are great with office hours and one-on-one time to make everyone at Hilbert College successful. Great way to make friends, and great opportunities on and off campus for jobs, and community services."
College Senior,4,I'm a student athlete there and they understand school comes first.
College Sophomore,4,"My degree is very valuable, even though there is so much competition. If you do extra that will set me apart from the others and I'll look more valuable. I could do so many things with my degree."
College Sophomore,4,"We're pretty good for a division three school. It's not about being the best, it's about having fun."
College Freshman,4,"Each student has to have an internship for atleast one semester. The career center is there for students looking for part time jobs to get them through college all the way until after they graduate and are looking for a job in their field. The career center gets every student started up on the purple briefed case, a website that you personalize and search for jobs on."
College Freshman,4,Relatively small class sizes so every professor you have knows everyone by name and will say hello to you if the see you outside of class. Every professor is very enthusiastic about the class they teach and they are always willing to help and cater to the students needs. They like to challenge the students but if they see a student is struggling then they are there to help. There is a large variety of class and the students are encouraged to build their own schedule and take classes that interest them. But the counsellors are there to help if need be.
College Freshman,4,"They only choose the most qualified and dedicated people for the RAs, the housing was close to classes and the dining room and it was always clean. The cleaning staff were very kind and helpful and if you had an issue they would see to it right away or that same day. Since the college is comprised of mostly commuters there was more to do during the week than on the weekend but it wasn't hard to find something to do with friends or work on some school work."
College Freshman,4,Alot of people participate in sports and many of the clubs are sport related.
College Freshman,4,"Every student is engaged in some sort of activity whether it be a sport, club, internship, or a combination of those. Every staff member wants to see each student reach their full potential and will do everything in their power to find the answer and or help a student."
College Sophomore,4,"Class sizes, and the variety of different courses in which are offered are great. The quality of most professors is great as to them being very involved and caring about how well the students do."
College Sophomore,4,The amount of internships available across all fields is a very large number. With the college having many employers recruiting on campus is a great way for prospects to get their names out there for their futures.
College Sophomore,4,Campus safety is always patrolling the campus and making sure of a safe and crime free atmosphere.
College Sophomore,4,Trinity dorms and apartments are great for housing! The small campus is also very convenient for a short timed walk to class and a great social atmosphere for group and friend meetings.
College Sophomore,4,The faculty to student ratio and great overall environment and feel when you arrive on campus make you feel like you're a part of something great!
College Freshman,4,There are a lot on internships and job prospects on campus.
College Freshman,4,The rooms are huge and spacious.
College Freshman,4,I think more students should attend the events for support of the teams.
College Freshman,4,"School is so fun and challenging. I am avidly involved in many clubs and activities on campus. I feel so welcome on campus and I am not just a number to my professors, they actually know my name and I am important to them. I've met so many new people and made new friends. It is close to home and I love the intamate atmosphere Hilbert conveys."
College Freshman,4,"Hilbert College is such an amazing school. With it being a small private school, you receive more one on one time with professors. You get to know who they are and they get to truly understand who you are. The professors work with you to help achieve your goals."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel that it is a great school, great teachers"
College Student,4,the mall is close by and other shopping centers
College Student,4,At thecollege there is an on campus chapel for worshiping
College Junior,4,There are lots of options around campus. The mall is only 5 minutes away
College Junior,4,Very small classes. Most professors come right from your field of study.
College Junior,4,Students are fairly healthy and campus is clean
College Junior,4,This area provides the best shopping attractions
College Sophomore,4,"There are many restaurants like Denny's, Pegasus, and the out back. Two of which are relatively close and cheap."
College Sophomore,4,"So far in computer security I have encountered areas that I have never learned yet, such as, the program Dos other than that it hasn't brought many challenges so far."
College Sophomore,4,I like my program because it does not have a lot of people in it and it is a growing job field so I will have plenty of opportunities when I get out of school.
College Sophomore,4,"I feel that we have a very good campus and sexual assault has yet to be a problem as far as I know. I feel very safe when I am on campus. The campus does have panic buttons for one to push if someone is being chased, also campus security are literally two minutes away from the dorm so being on a small campus in this situation has its advantages."
College Sophomore,4,The campus has two forces that keep the dorms and campus under control. First is the RA's who are assigned a hall to watch and make sure other students are following the rules. They are friendly and they are there for anyone who needs help. Then there is the campus security who enforce the rules and call the police if anything get out of hand. They are pretty nice if you treat them with respect.
College Sophomore,4,"Sports are one of the major activities that this campus has, even for being a Division 3 school. A lot of people attend the games home or away. I also see people who are not active or do not play sports attending the events. We have great school spirit cheering our team on, before and during games, as well as we do not harass opposing or rival teams."
College Sophomore,4,It's fun to get out
College Junior,4,Good control with illegal uses
College Junior,4,Good campus life small but fun
College Junior,4,"Awesome school nice and small, strong relationship with every professor due to small class size"
College Freshman,4,Got a good scholarship for my high school grades and a decent grant
College Freshman,4,"The sports teams are very popular and much of the students participate in a team or come to watch. Fan support for several teams is great, however, could be increased. The athletic facilities are acceptable, but could be better."
College Freshman,4,I'm from upstate NY so I'm used to the weather. It doesn't affect my opinon about campus experience at all because the dorms are located almost right next to the halls and are less than 5 mins walking distance.
College Freshman,4,I have never seen or heard of peerpressure on campus. If the use of drug or alcohol takes place it is one person own free will to do so.
College Freshman,4,"The meal plans are very convenient, especially for freshman like myself. However, I do wish there was more variety."
College Freshman,4,I thought the process went well because I paid attention to details at financial aid seminars.
College Freshman,4,"They are average people who for the most part are all very friendly, and do not discriminate."
College Junior,4,Staff is warm and helpful and people you don't even know smile and say hi to you
College Freshman,4,"There is really plenty of parking here. Even once the weekend is over and everyone comes back, there is still room, not too far away!"
College Sophomore,4,Parking is good its hard to find a parking spot on the weekdays when the lots are filled
College Freshman,4,"Campus Safety does an excellent job enforcing rules as well as helping out students. No matter what time you call them they are always quick to respond and help out students and RA's whether it be because students have locked them selves out of their room or if there is a more serious problem. They also help with crime in the dorms a lot, i had some stuff stolen and they were very quick about filing reports and charges as well as following through with them."
College Freshman,4,"The parking is rather good and close to each housing area. There is some bleachers in the way of some parking spots but otherwise there is tons of room for all students, both those who live on or off of campus, to be able to park easily at anytime."
College Sophomore,4,"Hilbert College is a very diverse school and it welcomes diverse individuals on campus as well. There are several clubs and assemblies about diversity and different races, backgrounds, sexualities, and religions."
College Sophomore,4,The drug safety is very well maintained at Hilbert College especially in the dorms and throughout campus. The reason I rate it an A- is because I really have not gotten the opportunity to see the drug safety in action.
College Sophomore,4,Hilbert College is very strict about what is used on campus such as drugs and alcohol use. Hilbert is also very strict with grades and sports. If a student is doing poorly in their classes they will be kicked off the sports team they are involved in.
College Sophomore,4,The professors at Hilbert College are very intelligent and usually work in the field they are teaching. For example professors who teach law classes and legal studies courses work as lawyers and legal assistants during the day or at night.
College Sophomore,4,The registration process is made easy because your set up with an acadeic advisor who tells you what they think is best for you so you don't have too much of a workload or anything.
College Sophomore,4,I dont think there is any type of specific ethnicity group at hilbert
College Sophomore,4,"It snows a lot in this area, but the college does a really good job of plowing and salting. When it is nice outside, the campus comes to life."
College Sophomore,4,There are an array of sports that people can join. There is a recreation center with a fitness center inside. It is easy to find sports activities all around campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Hilbert College has computers in many places from computer labs, to the library, the campus center, the dorms and even in the hallway. I've never had a problem with printing anything and the computers have microsoft programs that can get any project done. Wifi is available for people to use as well."
Sophomore,2,The main issue I have with Hilbert college is the cost of attending vs what you get. This mainly applies to athletics and student life. People pay on average 17k per yer to attend and the is no turf field or pool or any “nice” facilities that would be expected at a college. There is almost nothing to do on campus or in the surrounding area of Hamburg. The campus as a whole is more similar to a glorified high school rather than a college. If you are looking for a true college experience Hilbert is not for you.
College Sophomore,2,"The only off campus housing that I know of is the one house that is right outside of the campus, otherwise that is it for off campus housing unless one decides to rent a town house or an apartment."
College Sophomore,2,I gave the rating two out of five just because we had to keep filling out forms and writing letters to the government to receive more money. I only have one parent working so all I can do is keep my grades up and apply for as many scholarships as I can to help lower the the cost of tuition.
College Freshman,2,Theres pretty much just city busses that students from the city use to commute
College Freshman,2,"This is a very small commuter school, there isn't much diversity."
College Junior,2,"There are many apartment complexes aswell as single hme apartments, houses or rooms.  Rent prices are high, cheaper rates are  available, but usually poor quality housing.  There is usually off street parking, unless right on a main street perhaps."
College Junior,2,Teachers are more strict than my past school. Not enough computers on campus. I'm just not impressed with the school.
College Freshman,2,there is one down the street and you can get 15% discounts but you have to dress really nice to eat there. Many places you have to drive there so if you dont have a car your out of luck.
Recent Alumnus,2,Hilbert is very strict and have a lot of pride in their morals and values. They expect the students to have as much respect for the rules and regulations.
College Freshman,1,i dont recieve much help
College Freshman,1,There is nothing interesting here. It is basically a high school.
College Freshman,1,Professors are usually adjuncts who teach at multiple schools (sometimes even high schools). Education is at a community college level.
College Freshman,1,There are some rules here on campus. People do follow them to a point. But the campus doesn't really force it so there is still underage drinking in the dorms. One reason why they dont do anything is because they probably dont know about it.
College Sophomore,1,The College does not offer very many scholarships to the students. The main scholarship offered is a Diversity scholarship. In other words you will need a loan if you plan on attending college at hilbert.
College Sophomore,1,Not Many Different Races – There are plenty of Caucasian students and very few other ethnicities. I would say for every 10 Caucasian students there is an African American or Hispanic student. Approximately 1% of the school's population is made up of Asian's. The Caucasian students there also do appear to be racist to a certain extent.
Recent Alumnus,1,Finding a Place to Park – It is alright. Commuters should be prompt in trying to get a spot.

Freshman,5,MICA is a great campus that really focuses on individual growth and the personal creative process. I've loved my time here so far and really recommend it to other prospective art students.
Freshman,5,"As a freshman, I can definitely say that I'm being pushed not only by my peers by myself as well and that is such an amazing sensation. I can really feel myself growing as both a student and a person."
Sophomore,5,"As a current enrolled Sophomore, the Maryland Institute College of Art has yet to cease amazing me. I have never met a set of university faculty so invested in each individual's growth and development. They want us to succeed, to get careers, and to live happily and safely as artists who are self sufficient. The facilities are incredible, offering so many resources to us students, such as a game lab for the game design majors and cintiq tablets for illustration students. I could not see myself pursuing my undergrad education anywhere else."
Sophomore,5,"Academically, this school has an incredible art curriculum. If you want to study art, this school should definitely be on your list. Baltimore is a great city with a lot of heart. There is a burgeoning art community, making this a great place to get started as an artist. There are always opportunities to show your work. The community here is not what you would expect from an art school. People are generally very encouraging to one another and willing to work  together and bring each other up. 

People say that the campus is in a dangerous area but it absolutely is not. The area is as safe as any urban area. The people who complain are from small towns and lack basic street smarts. If you're smart, then you'll probably be safe. The area should not deter you from applying here. Bolton Hill and Station North are great neighborhoods."
Alum,5,"World-class art school. Facilities, dormitories, quality of faculty and staff are unmatched. Lectures and visits from the world's greatest artists."
Niche User,5,Maryland Institute College of Art is one of three colleges that my daughter applied to for her freshman year. The staff has been helpful and friendly with her scholarships and financial aid.
Sophomore,5,I like the diversity in MICA. You can meet people with many different backgrounds and cultures. All the staff members really try to help the students and are really understanding of our problems. Even the students are will to listen to other student issues and do their best to inform higher-ups. I think that more students should talk about their issues so that more people will know and fix them.
Senior,5,"Everyone is incredibly hard-working and passionate, it's nice to be surrounded by individuals who have the same level of passion. There is some of the cliche art-school angst in the undergrad.  However, regardless, my professors are incredible! They truly care and are incredibly passionate about what they are teaching! There is some of the cliche art-school angst in the undergrad. The party scene sucks, but that was expected considering MICA's reputation and rigorous world-class education."
Freshman,5,"I love everything about MICA....the only thing I wish could change is how Animation is taught and how much work you get piled on. Things happen and things go wrong, I don't think the teachers know this. I wish they would be a little more forgiving."
Niche User,5,"My high school photography teacher was mica alumni, ever since it has been my dream to attend. I love the campus tours they are very thorough and the tour guides are very friendly. The admissions office is very helpful and stay in contact and are very involved via mail and email. I wish the surrounding area of the school wasn't as bad, it is surrounded by poverty and is not the safest."
Senior,5,I love the campuses they have and I think that this is the college I feel that I need to go to after High School
Freshman,5,Very inclusive and supportive community. Students come from all over and have lots of different skill sets and opinions.
Graduate Student,5,"I don't think NICHE is as respected a rating/review site as U.S. News. Mica's programs are consistently one of the TOP 10 in the country amongst peer reviews. The education I got at MICA is highly respected everywhere I go and the faculty are among the best in the nation. The price is problematic, but comparable to other private schools like CalArts or Art Institute of Chicago, it's a deal. At least there are generous fellowship funds for graduates and post-grad networking opportunities...especially if you stay on the east coast."
Freshman,5,MICA is an amazing college with a great Freshman foundation program that allows students to expand their horizons into multiple fields of artistic study. The campus is relatively safe and close together. One critique is that MICA could benefit from a higher emphasis on diversity and education on such.
College Sophomore,5,I love this school I just wish it wasn't so expensive so I didn't have soapily to so many scholarships to stay there.
College Sophomore,5,People are very serious about everyones health and safety.
College Sophomore,5,This is literally the best education I've ever received.
College Sophomore,5,I have no regrets attending MICA! I'd do it all over again.
College Sophomore,5,The school actively tries to find jobs and internships for you.
College Sophomore,5,There are many resources to use for health and safety.
College Sophomore,5,Enough space for everyone. Close community that works together to improve.
College Sophomore,5,There are lots fun activities to take part in to improve our community.
College Sophomore,5,I have learned a lot and have grown because of it.
College Freshman,5,"I love my school. Going to an all-arts college means that I'm constantly surrounded by artists with similar goals to my own. The work is what you make of it -- if it's done poorly, it'll be easy, but not worth it; if it's done very well, it'll be difficult and time-consuming, but worth the final product in the end."
College Senior,5,The school has a lot to offer. The professors will challenge your preconceived notions of art. This can be emotional and laborious process. It can turn a lot of people away from art. Art school is a difficult journey that will require a lot of time and energy in order to succeed. Students need to be self motivated in order to get the most out of their classes.
College Senior,5,"The Career Development center is constantly creating more events to help connect students with Alumni and job opportunities. During my 4 years of college, the Career Development office had their first NYC Alumni meet up. It was very helpful to meet with MICA alumni that are living and working in NYC. Many of them were working as pattern designers, educators, or in the fashion industry."
College Senior,5,"MICA has a lot to offer. Every major is very specialized and different. As a sculpture major, I have access to successful artist that commute from NYC. The teachers will challenge your preconceived notions of art. This can be a laborious and emotional process, but it is necessary to understand the current art world. There is a great D-Fab lab that allows students to integrate 3-D printing and lazor cutting into their artistic practice. The only problem is that there is too much to explore in 4 years!

I would recommend new students to carefully pick their academic teachers. Some academic teachers are great and actively publish in their field, and other teachers are a bit boring. Make sure to talk to your advisor before signing up for academic classes to ensure that you avoid the less interesting classes.

Students can also take courses at John Hopkins if they want more rigorous academic courses."
College Freshman,5,"Being a MICA student opens up thousands of career opportunities that I never had access to otherwise, and upon graduation I can still go to the Career Center to get a iob."
College Sophomore,5,"I've had a really good experience with MICA. It's wildly expensive, but I do find that there are plenty of opportunities here if you know how to pursue them."
College Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at college so far has been fun, challenging and life changing. What I have taken most from my experience is the overwhelming support of the faculty and professors and the life challenges that my community has given me. I would like to elaborate more on the life challenges part of my time for its somthing I find most valueble. These challenges push me to question idenity of myself and understand others with their point of view. By talking to my piers I have come to understand a deeper feeling of life experience that is so different than my own. Lives that I knew existed but never been exposed to. By being open to these new experiences I feel I have grown as a person and am better suited for an outer community than my singular one."
College Junior,5,"MICA is an amazing community and is full of opportunities to grow personally, academically, and professionally. I have learned so much about myself, about art, and about the world by attending MICA."
College Sophomore,5,"A lot of people here who like to complain about this or that, but it is what you make of it. I have had a very successful time here, but I put in time and effort. Its hard to describe it all in a small frame of time, and yes its expensive, but in my opinion, it was worth the hours of scholarship applications."
College Freshman,5,One of the few schools to have apartment style housing. Spacious for artists.
College Junior,5,I was offered a merit scholarship upon acceptance to attend the school.
College Junior,5,This school is ranked in the top 10 Art schools of the United States.
College Freshman,5,"I personally think that our residence is the best. As an art school, we have plenty of space to live on and there are different buildings to live in with different needs."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm in a small major, so it's really nice. The professors are great. It's very competitive so the workload can get overwhelming."
College Sophomore,5,"I would choose MICA again. It has its problems but the administration is willing to listen and change. The student population is diverse and passionate. The amount of time and effort people put towards their passions here is staggering. It's competitive but nurturing, and the professors are amazing. It's a small school so you feel as though you have a presence and a personality-- you can contribute and grow here."
College Sophomore,5,I have learned so much at this school.
College Junior,5,No one pressures people into anything here if you don't want to do it you do not have to... alcohol is really easy to get your hands on but its a college town basically so what do you expect. MICA has a 3 strike policy on underage drinking and a 2 strike policy on stuff like Mary J (if its harder stuff  though they may call the actual cops on you).
College Senior,5,My school is extremely accepting of all differences.
College Senior,5,Off campus housing is very polish at MICA after freshman year. The housing costs are reasonable and vary so you can find one in your budget easily. The easiest way to find off campus housing since the school doesn't help is the MICA off campus housing Facebook group where people post about moving out or looking for roommates or subletters.
College Freshman,5,"MICA tries very hard to get students involved in the community.  We have shopping and social shuttle that run friday to sunday as well as Wednesday.  We have night shuttles that run every day from 5pm-2am and we are super close to the light rail and bus station for all day acsess.  We have zip cars you can check out with bikes.  We also are very close to the train and bolt bus stations if you want to go to NY, Phili, or DC."
College Freshman,5,There are many famous artists who come out of MICA however I wouldn't go off of how many become famous.  Our success rate of jobs that people LOVE are I think 97% which is crazy high.  Everyone here works really had and the staff are all WORKING ARTISTS.  That is so so so very important.  MICA makes teachers hold shows and portfolios every few years to show that are still working and growing as artists.  The school is second in the country for their academics.  We are a liberal school so you get both studio and academic classes.
College Freshman,5,"On campus housing is actually really nice.  We get apartments instead of small rooms.  We get a living room, bathroom, kitchen with oven, and it can have anywhere from 2-4 rooms.  We are allowed to draw/paint on certain walls since we do go to art school.  We have awesome maintenance which have fixed every issue i've had within two days of notifying.  The dorms are in walking distance to class and they also have studio and lounge spaces.  Two of our three dorms also contain the dinning so you can go downstair for food.  The only down side is that we do have to dorm as a freshman and sophomore but since you get an apartment its no so bad.  It can get costly but you can sometimes get out of the dorms if you really need to."
College Freshman,5,They're very convenient and run at night and also to target an shopping places. Sometimes they are very late though so somewhat unreliable.
College Freshman,5,Even though it's an art school we are allowed to enroll in other schools classes.
College Senior,5,As a painting major the curriculum is studio intensive which is great.  The teachers are available and approachable.  
College Senior,5,There are shuttles that can be called from any campus building.
College Senior,5,The campus prides itself on its open-ness and no judgement policies.
College Senior,5,A new health center was built a few years ago.  Its up to date and very well equipped inside.  
College Senior,5,"The location and the campus definitely made this school a great experience for me.  I loved living in the city, a bus away from NYC and DC.  "
College Senior,5,Everything is clean and up to date.  There is a new gym that was built last year with a yoga center.  Campus activites office is always hosting events.
College Senior,5,"I think our computer labs are the most up to date.  We have a 3-D printer, a fabric printer, and a foundry.  There is  access to a lot of high tech tools on campus."
College Sophomore,5,Food is great and accessible; we have a string of sushi restaurants and pizza places in walking distances. Everything is convenient and delcious!
College Sophomore,5,"Awesome. You are only a short bus ride from the Inner Harbor, right next to Penn Station, and the Mount Vernon Historical District is great to get some learning. Many museums, restaurants, clubs, and attractions around."
College Sophomore,5,"There are a few places you can print for free unlimited on campus (just not the library), and the school has a phenomenal (paid) print center for art projects. Mostly Macs on campus, but there are a few (older) Dells running Windows 7. Hard internet connections are reliable, wireless can be difficult depending on what room your in or in some of the dorms, but is usually okay for popping online during class breaks. Having a computer/printer isn't necessary but always helpful."
College Junior,5,There are campus shuttles available running late at night and campus security is always around. I have never felt UN-safe walking through the neighborhood to and from classes to my off-campus apartment
College Sophomore,5,"Public transportation is very good here. There are cabs, buses, the lightrail, the circulator and the collegetown shuttle. Cabs and buses are pretty much the same here as they are everywhere, average in price. The lightrail will take you to basically the outskirts of Baltimore. It costs 1.60. With the lightrail, I go to my photo supply store as well as various bookstores. You can also go to the inner harbor.
The circulator and collegetown shuttle are both free. The first will take you around the city of Baltimore. It travels past museums and other eateries, and also the inner harbor. 
The collegetown shuttle is designed specifically for college students. It goes to all the major campuses on campus as well as the Towsen shopping mall, and Towsen Town center. If you go to college in the area, it's free. 
Together, these modes of transportation make not having a vehicle unnoticeable."
College Sophomore,5,We don't have a Greek Life and I am really thankful for this.
Junior,4,"Academics are mostly great and there are very good professors, but some students had problems with campus housing."
Junior,4,"MICA is very highly ranked and the professors are super knowledgeable, and this helps a lot in terms of getting into grad school or if you are a design major and are looking for a job out of undergrad. However, it's super expensive and certain resources such as dining and student life are really lacking considering how much money we pay."
Niche User,4,"The Maryland Institute College of Art is a great Schoo. There are many great artists and teachers here that are extremely supportive and helpful in everything. MICA has been very helpful since I joined in my sophomore year of high school. Every step of the way, I have been guided in the write direction to better myself as a student and artist."
Freshman,4,"I am very happy attending! I understand that the school is rather pricey, but the class work is challenging with supportive staff and students that make it encouraging."
Senior,4,It's a large campus with multiple buildings. The professors and staff are friendly. Some are awesome enough to have long conversations with them. The school has a large diversity of students. The academic and art programs are available for everyone who needs them. I do wish there were more professors from different ethnic backgrounds. The food can also be improved too.
Senior,4,"It must be said: if you'll go into more than $10k in debt for the degree, don't. And honestly? The insane art school workload isn't worth the degree either. Anyway...

Academics: Some programs are strong, some are mediocre. Professors have been uniformly interested in my success as a student. 

Area: Baltimore sucks, with all the disadvantages of a city (crime, noise, filth) and almost none of the advantages (small for a city, everything closes early, nobody on streets [around MICA] after 9 PM, poor transit).

Dorms: Founder's: typical dorms, the green for frosh social interactions. Hoff: nicest dorms, lots of space. Gateway: looks nice, cramped/no privacy/HVAC issues.

Food: Hoff is OK. It's college food, don't expect much. Doris is good.

Social: Lots of weebs. Lots of stereotypical art students — ""eat the rich... but not my mom, because she pays my rent at the Copycat."" Once saw a callout post for a security guard that started with ""isn't nonbinary."" Parties uniformly suck."
Freshman,4,Mica has always been a dream school for artist and it is amazing the only thing is the price and their choice of payment plans.
Senior,4,"The area that MICA excels most in is the amount of choice you have in what you can study. You can take classes in any major (given that you are fulfilling the requirements for your own also) and a lot of the liberal arts classes focus on very niche and interesting topics. Your class experience is very much up to which professor you have, but there are a lot of very good faculty in every department, so you can ask around to figure out who they are. The school is generous with scholarships but the housing is expensive compared to what you can find off-campus. There's not a lot within walking distance of the campus besides some restaurants, and there's not many grocery options if you choose not to have a meal plan. However, you choose the right classes though it more than makes up for the downsides, and I would definitely recommend to it people who are interested in many different artistic disciplines, and want to be able to explore all of them at one place."
Freshman,4,"The professors are very qualified and knowledgeable. All of the professors I have had so far have been very experienced and care very much about the success of the students. The tuition, however, is very very expensive and I do not feel that the students get their money's worth. I feel that there is a lot of unnecessary spending, such as a magazine/book thing they send out on occasion that is very high quality and obviously very expensive to produce. This is just one example that came to mind about unnecessary spending. The area is a nice part of Baltimore, but yet it is still Baltimore, so it isn't very safe. There are, however, campus safety officers all around campus."
Junior,4,"The facilities at MICA are incredible and vast. They have selections from welding studios, fibers studios, painting, graphic design buildings, a building dedicated to print making studios, pretty much any kind of facility that any kind of artist might need. Even though there are international students from all over which is amazing, I do wish there was some more diversity on campus when it comes to students of color. I also wish more academic classes were available to undergrad students."
Junior,4,"The faculty and classes are on the whole great. The dorms are expensive but come with a lot - their own kitchen, bathroom, common area. MICA is in the beautiful Bolton Hill neighborhood and is relatively close to cool neighborhoods like Mt. Vernon, Station North, and Charles Village."
Sophomore,4,"MICA is an amazing school for the arts. The community is very inclusive and accepting, the professors are great and the staff loves to help. The only thing I would change is the dorm areas, its hard to get help when you need something fixed but other than that they are good. While the price for tuition is high the education you get from it makes it worth it, but only if you try."
Freshman,4,"For the first year, you will either hate it or love it depending on what you think you might be interested in. Every other year is supposed to be nice."
Sophomore,4,"MICA has competent teachers (for the most part), interesting classes, and exceptional art-making facilities and equipment. The foundational courses everyone is required to complete during Freshman year are less popular, but they are taught with the assumption that everyone has fairly good technical skills. In other words, the intro part of the intro classes is mainly getting you comfortable with new materials, equipment, and conceptual thinking. You won't be paying to relearn the basics. The food and dorms are nothing special, but they are overpriced. Students here are either reclusive or in tight nit groups that yammer on about inclusiveness but are totally hypocritical and judgemental. If you look hard enough, you'll be able to find nice people. But be warned, most people here are pretentious assholes who think they're saints, and if you're a member of any majority group (male, Caucasian, etc.) prepare to be aggressively shamed."
Sophomore,4,"A unique college experience for any aspiring artist. Professors are all friendly and insightful, inspiring their students to do their best and reach to their highest potential. Although classes are much longer than normal college classes it goes by fast as we learn something new every time. My only cons are food and location. Majority of the surrounding food joins are cafes and the closest fast food place is McDonalds. The meals MICA serves are generally okay but it is best to cook for yourself from time to time. It does get sketchy around MICA but on campus nothing is that serious. Just keep eyes open and be observant specially at night. In conclusion, MICA is one of the best art colleges in my opinion that offers tons for those with a creative mind and heart."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I love this school. The professors are all well trained, and I really like that MICA makes a point to employ professors that are still working artists, it keeps things from getting stale and overly traditional). There's a lot of room to tailor your degree plan to your interests, and to double major, or major and concentrate, in two entirely different fields. They're also committed to teaching students how to be marketable once they graduate (really good track record with interns– we've even got one at NASA right now!). Of course, some of the stereotypical flaws of art schools are present here as well; the humanities and art history departments are very strong but there's little to no math or traditional science classes. There's a class exchange program with 13 other schools in Baltimore that helps with that problem though."
Freshman,4,"Although not everyone's experiences may be positive, I have to say that as a first-year student at MICA, I am have found the college wonderful. The professors I have had have been wonderful to work with, although some assignments aren't as interesting as others. Overall, Maryland Institute college is a wonderful college in pursuing a degree in art, even though tho it isn't perfect. But honestly, what college is?"
Senior,4,"MICA is a great institute filled with committed staff and enthusiastic peers. At MICA they are dedicated to helping you achieve your goals and strive to push you in all endeavors. There are so many skills to learn and so much information offered to better your understanding of life and the world around you. The only real down side to MICA is the price at which it costs to attend. It is a private institution and thus more expensive so, simply be aware that attending for all four years is a costly investment that you will in all likelihood be paying off for many years to come."
Sophomore,4,"The MICA experience is one of hard work, several sleepless nights, and dedication towards your craft. You will have the opportunity to work alongside like-minded individuals and professionals who will push you to your limits and help you become a better artist. Your passions and ambitions will be tested but with the support of the MICA community, you can truly excel if you put in the effort required."
College Junior,4,"There are a lot of issues between administration, departments, professors and students when it comes to institutional communication (though that's true for every school). 

MICA offers unique placement in Baltimore's artistic hub, as well as central to the East Coast Art Belt. Diverse in students and voices- this school has connections to every corner of the world. The MICA network is really what you're paying to gain access. Play your cards right, you'll get a job on top of invaluable experience."
College Sophomore,4,Its hard to be an artist.
College Sophomore,4,Overall I've enjoyed a lot of my classes even if my foundation year forced me to take many classes I didn't want to take.
College Sophomore,4,People have a chance at actual jobs in the industry and branch out in many directions post-graduation.
College Sophomore,4,The school's been really great for my creative progress so far!
College Junior,4,"Campus housing is pretty good except for Founders Green, not including Leake."
College Freshman,4,"Baltimore is a dangerous city and MICA makes a big effort to ensure safety for students while they're on campus. I think Campus Safety should spend more time patrolling the areas surrounding academic buildings that are further away from the academic hub, because classes can go late into the night and it isn't safe to be out alone in areas just a few blocks from the MICA campus."
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of companies that give presentations at MICA looking for students for internship/employment opportunities. I haven't looked much into this because I've only just started at MICA, but from what I've seen there's a strong career development program."
College Freshman,4,"I've had great experiences with professors! Although I can get irritated with some of my professors, they're almost always really accommodating and approachable. Some professors are really, really tough, but it's never made them hard to approach."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are great and close to the academic buildings. The security is great, the buildings stay clean, and rules are upheld. Housing is really, really expensive though, and they make it super difficult to live off-campus as an underclassman."
Recent Alumnus,4,Courses and professors are great.
Recent Alumnus,4,"One of the best schools in the country, however the recent impulse to commercialize and homogenize the school into a corporate entity is impacting the quality of work produced by the student body."
College Freshman,4,Many upperclassmen get internships and jobs after college.
College Freshman,4,"This school has a very wide range of people, coming from all different backgrounds, countries, and hold different political and religious beliefs."
College Senior,4,"I lived off campus after my sophomore year. Rent in Baltimore is very cheap, so it save you a lot of $$ to move off campus. That said, campus is very convenient because they are close to campus."
College Freshman,4,"The MICA campus is entrenched in the heart of Baltimore, but while crime is a common thing in the area I have only heard of one or two actual assaults on students, neither of which were of a sexual nature. We are all advised to travel in groups and everyone is required to have the Race Guardian app and keep Campus Safety numbers in our phone contacts so that we can call for help easily."
College Freshman,4,"Some professors are good at their art, but not at teaching. Most professors are actually concerned with the betterment of their students, which is far more than I can say about half of my teachers in high school. I'm still just a freshman and I've already learned a lot."
College Freshman,4,"Every on-campus MiCA student gets an apartment style suite shared with two to four people, with multiple bedrooms, a bathroom and shower, a common room, and a kitchen. The Wi-Fi sucks, but the dorms themselves are fantastic sizes. I only wish my common room was as big as my friends' common rooms (but I guess I shouldn't expect every room to be exactly the same) and that I had signed up for a single bedroom rather than a double because I have no privacy and no space to work when I share the room with another person."
College Freshman,4,"Freshman year at MICA is all about gaining new experiences and learning just how many things the subject of ""Art"" encompases, which is fantastic if you enter the school without knowing what you want your major to be. The foundation program helped me to become more well-rounded despite only one or two of the required courses actually being in my intended major. MICA does have a bit of a problem with elitism, however; I know a handful of students who are outright disdainful of others in the community, and quite a few students - while not overtly rude - seem to take themselves far too seriously for college students studying art. For one to be serious about their studies is integral to graduation, but too much self-importance and hubris seems to be an issue among the school's population. I love my practice, my amazing classes, my friends (who are worlds beyond any I ever had before in terms of their personalities in general), and the inclusive community of MICA overall, but the only reason it won't get five stars from me is the subtle egotism some of the students display. 

The community is full of people who strive to be as inclusive as possible, which is a very refreshing change from High School. The classes give assignments that not only encourage you to learn more and strive for better work, but they also are prompts that any student would actually want to spend time on. I could never say the same about high school classes; not even the science courses I loved in high school had assignments that I connected to on such a personal level that I was excited to do them. The food and dorm options are fantastic, and the other students are easy to get along with. My only problem to date is the one I mentioned earlier, and I only ever see it manifest once in a while - I doubt MICA is the only college with a group of arrogant students."
College Sophomore,4,MICA seems to be expanding.
College Sophomore,4,MICA is a community of artists. The instructors are all working artists who are very talented and intuitive in their teaching. It would be a feat not to improve one's artistic skills at this school.
College Freshman,4,A degree from this school has a high value due to the reputation.
College Freshman,4,"So far, as per foundation year requirements, I've taken Drawing I, Painting I, Sculptural Forms, Art Matters (an intro to art history), and Elements of Visual Thinking.  I'd rate my experience so far as pretty great. I've liked all of my professors, and I thought all of them have been helpful in the area that they teach. For Art Matters, it seems like a hit or miss class after talking to a lot of my peers. Some people love it and their professor, and some people hate it and really don't like their professor. It really depends on which teacher you have and what kind of class environment/teaching style you like."
College Freshman,4,"I'm a foundation student, going into my second semester at MICA. So far, I like it a lot, mostly because I've never been in a place so concentrated in the arts before. The school seems to really emphasize diversity in what arts you learn and also collaboration. I like that MICA has a foundation year that makes you take core classes like drawing, painting, sculpture, etc. It gives you time to explore yourself as an artist and get used to being at an art school before getting into your major."
College Freshman,4,"Strong diversity in ethnicity, gender, etc."
College Sophomore,4,It's a load of work but well worth the efforts. The Networking and career advising they give are great.
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy my classes and they have very interesting and entertaining events on campus. I also like being able to experience the city life since my school is in downtown Baltimore.
College Sophomore,4,"I knew MICA was the school for me as soon as we finished the tour. Once I arrived at the school and began classes I was very satisfied and pleased with the abundance of resources and the friendly and helpful faculty and staff. I found all  my professors to show genuine interest in seeing me personally grow as an artist and always offered themselves as someone to talk to if we were in any need of help. MICA's powerful student voice is something I would consider unique to the school since the faculty and staff will often do what they can to let us have what we want as students. I would definitely choose MICA all over again if I could for the strong sense of community. It feels like we are all one big family that only want to inspire each other and help each other grow not only as artists, but as people."
College Freshman,4,"The closest off campus option is On The Hill. It's so good but so expensive, with healthy options as well and great coffee.

North Charles street is within walking distance but it also has more food options.

You can also take the weekend shuttle to Hampden and Towson to reach other food spots."
College Freshman,4,"Living in Founders is great for Freshman and it's like an enclosed playground for the Freshman, you get The Grill (a place to eat) from 5pm to 12am, Laundry, Vending Machines in Latrobe, personal studios in Glace and Leake, 3 lounges all with tv's and cable, and access to Leake (one of the biggest and newly built buildings on campus for freshman and upperclassman housing) which has nice little perks in it such as elevators, ABOX and the Leake Lecture Hall, personal studios, clean bathrooms and free filtered water. So basically living on Founders is pretty great for Freshman, you get a lot of things right in your own living space. You also have ""the green"" in the middle of Founders where you can play, lay on the grass, have special events and a basketball net right out front of Latrobe. Founders is quite nice as a whole, you gotta put yourself out there sometimes to gain friends and really enjoy it."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are decent quality, and what's very nice is that most dorms on campus are apartment style, so they include a living area & kitchen along with full bathroom and 3-4 bedrooms. Some furniture and appliances are out-of-date but generally work fine. Facilities Management is a little slow at responding to work orders, even if it's just a bulb that needs replacing. Cleanliness of the dorms relies on the current residents."
College Freshman,4,"A lot of people live off campus here. It's a great freedom, they have great parties and it's pretty close to campus. It maybe unsafe in certain areas of town but for the most part it's a popular choice of living here and it's pretty afforadable"
College Freshman,4,"A lot of mix between mainstream and ""you'll only find it in town"" type of restaurants. A lot of the places are pretty affordable and really good. A good change from the campus dining"
College Freshman,4,"I will say, this school is SUPER generous when it comes to giving scholarships. However, when you have financial struggles, they're not super helpful"
College Sophomore,4,"MICA has amazing classes, facilities, and staff. However, it works you really, really hard, to the point where it's not healthy. I strongly believe this will be worth it, but it's tough."
College Sophomore,4,"MICA prides itself on being able to get students internships and jobs, so I think I'll be ok."
College Sophomore,4,"There are some really great student-friendly places (the Bun Shop os definitely a favorite), and most are within walking distance."
College Sophomore,4,"While pricey, MICA has semi-furnished apartment-style suites that are close to campus and even offer studio spaces."
College Sophomore,4,"The scholarships given by MICA are generous and do require effort to get them, which makes them all the more worthwhile and fulfilling.  However, the cost of MICA means that scholarships still usually leaves you short."
College Sophomore,4,"Dorms are wonderful and convenient in terms of location.  Also, the amount of space given is very wonderful."
College Sophomore,4,"Parties do happen on the weekends, usually in off-campus houses.  Moreoften than not, they are very mellow and nothing too crazy.  They are very much a nice way for students to wind down after the week and to socialize."
Senior,2,"Most professors I've met in my graphic design program are very knowledgable and genuinely care about your success. However, sometimes I do feel the classes don't challenge students hard enough to go above and beyond. Usually, if you turn in your assignments, you'll get an A. That being said, over the 4 years here, I feel that I have learned way more about art and design than I ever would have expected.

People I've meet here genuinely care about art and design, and fosters a supportive circle for art practices. I don't think you'll be able to find that sort of community going to do art in a non-art.  

MICA raves about its diversity, but the truth is, most people here are just different in similar ways. Sometimes you can feel really trapped in this school. 

Baltimore is pretty bad. Pretty hard to get outside of campus unless if you have a car.  Not a very safe city either. Multiple people get robbed on campus every semester."
Freshman,2,"I was a freshman here last fall semester, I had to leave because the conditions of the school only made my mental health worse and started to make me hate making art. The classes are incredibly helpful, for your major, any other course you take is pretty much not helpful in the slightest. Professors are either really open minded or really close minded, but most are pretty understanding. Also some professors like to take spontaneous field trips, and only tell you the day of in class. The freshmen dorms are infested with mice during the colder months, I had to call in an exterminator 2-3 times within a month to set up traps. Students are really pretentious, some of them are chill but most of them have a superiority complex. Also safety is like a huge issue, if you go anywhere make sure you're with someone and always lock your doors. Break in's happen a fair bit and also sexual assault is fairly frequent on campus and not much is done about it."
Sophomore,2,"You will get a great education at MICA and learn a lot. The student life is not very good. There are not many activities to do or clubs to join. There surrounding area is nice, but lacks restaurants and has occasional crimes."
Junior,2,"Campus is in a charming, quiet, historic area but if you walk a couple blocks away, you'll start to see the true colors of Baltimore. The campus is open so anyone can walk on campus which has resulted in a lot of muggings and crime. The ""MICA Bubble"" is definitely real and getting off campus or going anywhere by yourself is a risky chore.  Unless you are comfortable being in a rough town and like going to underground warehouse parties, there are really no social events or fun places to be here. The academics at this school are a joke and you'll be paying for books you will barely touch. The clubs, work out facility, and apartment style dorms at MICA are a plus when comparing it to other art schools but Baltimore is pretty boring and depressing unless you want to be a DIY punk kid, or are comfortable sitting in your room and having little to no social life. Wanted to give it a chance but I really wished I had reconsidered my other options before committing to this school."
College Sophomore,2,I didn't realize how little variety there would be at this school. Almost no focus on academics were present at all. A lot of my classmates were also practically illiterate.
College Sophomore,2,People get mugged all the time on campus by outside people.
College Freshman,2,"Crime on campus is constantly occurring. Students would receive emails and alerts often because of an incident that happened on or near campus. While campus police officers are stationed around campus during the day, I wish that there were more at night, especially since students have to walk to their dorms or classes. The campus does a good job in alerting students of incidents rather quickly which helps all of us stay alert on campus."
College Freshman,2,"RAs establish drugs are bad and can get you kicked out at the beginning of the year, but they literally don't even care since everyone can get away with doing drugs and drinking"
College Freshman,2,"Students are obnoxious and loud, invite each other over without asking their roommates, drink, smoke, all that jazz...can't really go out anywhere past sundown without the chance of getting assaulted or robbed at gunpoint"
College Freshman,2,"Teachers either don't take things seriously or take things way too seriously, teachers grade based upon who kisses their ass in class on the first day"
College Freshman,2,"The area is BAD, crimes happening to students on campus about once per week (usually robberies and assaults) 

alcohol and substance abuse is equally bad, no one monitors this stuff"
College Freshman,2,Kids that copy from Adventure Time and Steven Universe usually get jobs faster than kids with actual talent :)
College Freshman,2,Don't have enough space to explain :)
College Freshman,2,"Horrible education, teachers are selective when grading, extremely expensive, crime is high on campus, teachers and students are immature, unfriendly atmosphere, I could go on all day..."
College Sophomore,2,Flex is probably the best part of the meal plan/student account plan since you can use it almost everywhere (even off-campus restaurants). However the dining hall and the cafes are largely filled with disappointment.
College Sophomore,2,"Coming from a moderate/normal party school, in my eyes, no one here actually parties. There isn't something going on every night of the week and its more of small social gatherings than big parties. Definitely no where close to half of a party school."
College Sophomore,2,"Slightly dangerous. However, campus safety is always alert and awesome!!"
College Freshman,2,"There's little to no variation, and the food at the Meyerhoff isn't the best. The payment options aren't bad though."
College Junior,2,City parking is hard to find and costly
College Freshman,2,There are not really famous alumni that I know of.
Junior,1,"There are so many rich brats who are pretentious at this school! The rich ones usually suck at art too. There is basically no party scene. Some of the students here are so cringe worthy it’s humiliating. Kids are rude and stuck up. The dorm rooms are disgusting. The school is completely overpriced. So many roaches all over campus. Roaches everywhere. Dorm roaches, classroom roaches, dining hall roaches, some of the roaches make better art than the students. Gross environment. Mica=Gentrification . Mica bad mica too much money mica infested mica roaches mica money hungry mica snobby mica harboring rich students who can’t do anything but be rich lazy complain and make a mess mica smelly, mica don’t care about u mica stinky mica bad mica bad mica bad mica bad mica bad mica bad Baltimore deserves better"
Junior,1,"Bad online class. Don’t waste money, bad bad bad bad bad bad classes are so bad online I cry over online bad online waste of money and time"
Freshman,1,"please please do not come here. the people here are so callous and inconsiderate here. i’ve tried to make friends, but everyone is so cliquey and will drop u after two weeks.  i really thought this was gonna be the place for me but i’m three months in and i’m in a living hell, lonelier and more depressed than i’ve ever been. also the academics are alright but nothing to write home about. only two of my five classes are really worth the money. the others just seem like jokes. also there is absolutely nothing in the surrounding area. the nearest grocery store is a savealot which is ten min walk through a lil sketchy neighborhood. there’s a new crime every week and i’m absolutely terrified walking by myself past 7 when it gets dark out. i’m a freshman so i can’t really say yet if this the best school for illustration, but even if it is i can’t stay here for my own personal well-being."
College Senior,1,"MICA does not care about students who are sexually assaulted, abused, or harassed—*especially* when the perpetrator is someone who is favored by Administrators, VPs and Provosts. Administration will ultimately do anything to protect the reputation of the college and those accused of such crimes in order to protect their ""pristine"" reputation and to keep the money flowing in. Students who press the college to take their complaints seriously will be retaliated against."
College Sophomore,1,"No one cares. Almost everyone parties every single night. They are loud, obnoxious, and they leave evidence everywhere. Still, no one gets into trouble."
College Freshman,1,We are an art school. We do not have sports.
College Freshman,1,"There are no organized sports which makes sense because this is an art school, however, there are some organized sports that are for fun. The gym also allows students to stay healthy and exercise."
College Freshman,1,MICA doesn't have any sort of Greek Life so it can't be commented on.
College Sophomore,1,There are none. I think. And the gym is quite small and insufficient.
College Sophomore,1,"There are no sports here! There is a nice fitness center for the size of our school and fitness classes, as well as some intramural and club sports. You can also play sports at Hopkins."
College Sophomore,1,"Although the administration takes drug and alcohol use much to seriously, they fail to respond appropriately to sexual assault."
College Sophomore,1,"This school does not take sexual assault seriously, and at times it seems that they favor the rapist over the survivor. Their sexual assault policies are so vague that they basically do not exist. Administrators deal with sexual assault on a case by case basis and at times seem totally unaware of survivors' concerns."
College Sophomore,1,"MICA does not take sexual assault seriously. In at least one instance, MICA has given  a rapist the same punishment as someone caught with marijuana. We also do not have emergency call boxes, which is a major issue, considering the school is located in inner city Baltimore."
College Freshman,1,Seriously the same party with the same people on the same night every week and if not that then a weird sketchy party that's better but still sketchy. You really have to know where to go to have normal college fun. Usually I just go visit my friends at Towson to go out.
College Senior,1,"As an art school, there are no varsity teams."
College Junior,1,"There are very few places that you can park on campus as it is a small campus. Move in days and school events are the absolute worst. Permits cost about $200 for parking in a secure parking lot by the freshman dorms, and $150 for parking in a less secure lot away from campus. Cars are not necessary unless you live off campus and have to commute."
College Sophomore,1,"There's so few of us its like high school all over again until you turn 21. Everyone is always the same at parties, and the lack of men is very discouraging."
College Sophomore,1,"We do not have athletics. However, I did not give it an F, because we do have an excellent fitness center."
College Junior,1,"MICA is completely focused on the arts, so there isn't much room for sports. We don't have varsity sports. We have some club sports, but I hardly hear about them. I know we have a soccer club and a running club, but I'm not sure if they actually compete with anyone. We just got a brand new gym which is great. We have yoga classes, karate classes, and other athletic classes which are fun."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I'm from the city, so I know how to parallel park, but like no one else does and they leave a bunch of space between cars.  Sometimes, you have to park in the 2 hour areas, but you have to make sure to move your car every two hours or you will get a ticket."

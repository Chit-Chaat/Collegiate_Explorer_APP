Freshman,5,What I like about Oakland City University in Indiana is that I felt at ease when I first walked in the door and for the most part everyone that I've met the students and the teachers are all really friendly and seem like decent good people. What I would change about my school is the building need some upgrades.
Graduate Student,5,"I love that Oakland City University is a Christian college, promoting Christian values through Christian instructors. It is very uplifting.  Oakland City University is also located very close to my home."
Graduate Student,5,"I am an online student.  I completed my Bachelors Degree in Criminal Justice in 2016.  In February 2018 I will complete my Masters Degree in Strategic Management.  The only change I would make, is allowing the students to pick the order of their classes."
Freshman,5,Everyone is very friendly and everyone will talk to you weather they know you or not. The professors are very nice and will help you whenever you need it.
Freshman,5,I love OCU! It has been a great experience so far attending this school. I have learned so much and have met some great people! 
College Sophomore,5,"One experience that sticks out the most is welcome week. Oakland  university was full of energy and excitement. Each day something new was going on, I looked forward to seeing the new attractions and guest that would appear around campus. It was nice getting free food and free swag. Considering i was a freeman and I had no idea what to expect for collage this made me feel welcomed. All the different groups, clubs and organisations were very welcoming. I was able to join and learn about the many different options I had."
College Freshman,5,Campus policy is enforced and monitored.
College Freshman,5,Closeness with community law enforcement exists with the campus.
College Freshman,5,I don't participate in a sport but they are good.
College Freshman,5,My experience has been great so far.
College Freshman,5,"I have had the best experiences at OCU so far.  The staff has been so helpful and my professors are awesome.  There has been tons of homework and many late nights, but I am on a mission to succeed!  I have meet many new people from across the world.  I am grateful for the decision I made!"
College Freshman,5,"I haven't used it yet, personally. But I've heard that it's good and there's a doctors clinic right by campus, which is nice and convienent."
College Freshman,5,I love it at my school.
College Freshman,5,The apartments are actually pretty nice. Just small!
College Freshman,5,"Our school has an extensive exchange student program, so there is a large diversity of culture, race, and religion. I do not know so much about sexual orientation. So much I think it is mostly heterosexuals, seeing as this is a Baptist college."
College Sophomore,5,The Psychology department at OCU is great. The professors are great and the work load is very challenging.
College Freshman,5,It's a Church School – It is a General Baptist University so the on campus rules are fairly strict as compared to state schools.  The athletes that do go out partying and stuff have to be extremely careful to not get caught.
Sophomore,4,I love attending this college. My professors go out of their way to make sure that I understand the material. They help me with anything that I would need help with. That sit down before or after classes to help students get a better understanding of the material. The best educational program that I have seen. I am truly grateful to be attending such an amazing program at Oakland City University!
Freshman,4,"Oakland city university so far has been a open eye experience. It has taught me many things, for example their are people always trying to help you succeed. It is a friendly school with many amazing staff. The campus is very eco friendly and very quite. This is a benefit because it allow you to focus on your studies. My favorite part is that you make friends along the way and met people who will always be their for you."
Junior,4,Most of my professors were very approachable and wanted to see their students excel. And I enjoy the smaller classrooms because it feels like you're getting more on-on-one assistance with the professors. The student life center goes above and beyond to make each student feel welcomed.
Junior,4,"The atmosphere is quite different here.  At OCU the Professors and Staff truly care, however there are vast room for improvements all throughout the campus"
Freshman,4,"It was very easy to apply and everyone that I have encountered so far has been really helpful.  I was worried about enrolling in college after being out of school so long, but the transition back into has been so easy."
College Freshman,4,I have only had a problem with one professor. Prefer more general art courses otherwise okay. Professors and staff are great helpful people. They present a positive attitude. I like the smallness of the school which allows you to meet people. The school sets up social functions to keep students in touch.
College Sophomore,4,"I love online classrooms, it give you a lot of hands on with the other students."
College Senior,4,"This University has a lot to offer, being as small as it is. With the teacher to student ratio being an average of 1:20 you can really get the help you need if needed. Everyone is really nice, and someone will always be more than willing to talk to you. The education offered is really professional, and Oakland City University is really preparing me for my future career in Psychology."
College Sophomore,4,is a Christian school that accepts everyone no matter your religion or beliefs.
College Sophomore,4,this a small school and everyone is accepted
College Sophomore,4,ra's very involved in dorm activity
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy my teachers the most. They make the experience that much better.
College Sophomore,4,"Certain programs are very challenging, it definitely isn't a walk in the park. it takes a lot of dedication and commitment."
College Sophomore,4,"Tutors are available to trio students. Depending on your major, the workload can be overwhelming, such as Biology."
College Freshman,4,We have plenty of diversity for a small campus and everyone is accepted here.
College Freshman,4,"We have excellent food in our cafeteria as well as a cafe that is open when the cafeteria is not. We have a regularly scheduled menu. The plan is expensive, however. There are many restaurants in town as well."
College Freshman,4,"Our school's professors are the best I have heard of. Why? Not becaue they are the highest rated or graduated from the best schools, but because they care about you and what happens to you. So many college professors do not care about what happens to the students or whether you show up at all. Here, professors are unhappy if you miss their classes, some even e-mail you to ask why and to make sure everything is okay. I believe that this encourages students to come and helps them succeed, knowing thaat they aren't just a number to our school."
College Junior,4,"I have not had an internship yet, but I do plan to have one soon. I haven't had time to fit it into my schedule with different other classes I have to get through before a certain time. I do not have concerns about an internship in particular. If I had to choose though, I would think it's going to be a lot of time spent with no real benefit, for example a paycheck. I do want the experience though."
College Senior,4,"We have a no drug, no smoking and no alcohol policy. Any one caught breaking this rule is kicked out of the dorms if they live on campus. We also have school meetings that are about not doing drugs and alcohol and the different ways they can negatively effect you,someone that may have been a drug or alcohol user also gives there testimony as to how they quit and changed their life."
College Senior,4,"Not Too Bad. The financial aid process for me was excellent. I am a veteran and the VA rep at Oakland City University is very good. She is very helpful, and usually she will see you without making an appointment."
Freshman,2,"I went to Oakland City on a golf scholarship. My main issue was with the athletic program. The coach was not dedicated; he obviously did not like his job. I liked the small classroom setting. The buildings were dated, and the teachers were not helpful. Only a few actually had a ""doctorate"" diploma."
Freshman,2,"What I like about Oakland City is that there is a welcoming environment and it is very religious based. There is plenty of ways to get involved whether it is attending chapel, going to open gym, or joining a club. Everyone knows everyone because it is such a small school. The things that I would like to see changed are the basketball program, dorms, and the cafe. I was about of the Women’s basketball team and we had some issues with the coach and many people left due to that. I plan on transferring next year due to coach issues. The dorms are just a little outdated and could use some replacement. The cafe isn’t the best. I think they could find a better catering service to serve the food."
College Sophomore,2,Many of the same meals are served every week and leftovers are served a lot too.
College Sophomore,2,"there are not many choices around, one has to travel 20-30 minutes for variety."
College Sophomore,2,you need a college education in order to help your child get enrolled and get the financial assistance you need
College Sophomore,2,"computers need to be updated. you can tell the software is outdated, but it gets the job done."
College Freshman,2,"I understand some of the rules, but we are adults!"
College Freshman,2,not much for students to do around here. You have to drive 20min away just to get to more restaurants and fun activities.
College Junior,2,"I gave my school a C in this because there is a great diversity among ethnic groups, but there isn't much diversity among religious belief or sexual orientation."
College Junior,2,"We have a very high rate of tornadoes here at Oakland City, Indiana. It also rains a lot."
College Sophomore,2,"There Is a Best and Worst Option – For girls, there is a great dorm and a not so great dorm. Brokaw Hall is where the freshmen stay and it is very cramped and small. Cox Hall is much nicer and more spacious."

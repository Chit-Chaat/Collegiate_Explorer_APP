Junior,5,"I have never taken an online class, but I have had online orientations and had to do a lot of my transfer process online, and emailing back and forth with the staff, and they are so nice and so willing to help!"
Junior,5,"Most amazing staff, who is always quick to help or answer any questions!! Everyone I have come in contact with has been so friendly and willing to help me figure out what I need to do to answer my question or get a problem resolved!!"
Sophomore,5,The student to teacher ratio is good. Wesleyan is a big college but with a suburban feel and it seems a friendly place to be.  The academic options are good and they have some of the best professors and support staff.
Junior,5,"Wesleyan is a small women's liberal arts college that offers intimate class settings, interesting disciplines of study, and a well-rounded curriculum.  The school supports and tight-knit bonds among students and hosts events throughout the week for students to relax and unwind.  I have loved my time at Wesleyan, as there are many opportunities to serve fellow students, gain internships on campus, and interactive with the Macon community.  The student body is diverse and accepting to all students who attend.  Overall, I would highly recommend Wesleyan to a prospective student as they will benefit greatly from their time at Wesleyan College."
Junior,5,"It is a beautiful campus, and everyone knows everyone. The teachers are there to help you. They have apartments on campus which is a great thing so you don’t have to waste gas on getting to school. Everyone is very friendly."
Freshman,5,"At Wesleyan College, everybody makes it a point to know your name! You will quickly fall in love with the campus and everyone on Campus. I was able to talk one on one with the college President more than once while I was on campus and she makes sure to make herself available to anyone who needs her. I got to ask many questions and got all the answers I needed! The staff made sure that if I wanted to see something while I was visiting, then I got to see it, no questions asked! I can't wait to start my journey here at Wesleyan!!"
Niche User,5,"I do not attend Wesleyan, however I plan on applying to it before I finish high school. I have heard good things about the school and enjoy the area, however the cost is inhibiting. Even should I be accepted, I would not be able to afford to go."
Niche User,5,"Visiting this lovely campus was great. Profs were passionate, students were engaged, campus was well maintained. Everyone is so kind and eager to say hello. The dorms are very nice and spacious while still allowing room for creativity."
Freshman,5,Wesleyan College has always been First for Women and they have stuck true to that saying. Wesleyan always makes sure to take care of each girls individual needs in order for us to strive for our best.
Freshman,5,I loved visiting this college and I am so excited about attending there this fall. Everyone is so nice and so caring it's almost unbelievable. There is  nothing I would change.
Freshman,5,"Wesleyan College is a small, private women's school. However, it has such detailed diversity with the students and the cultural backgrounds of the students. It is a wonderful place to attend school and grow as a person!"
Freshman,5,"I find Wesleyan to be a very inviting college, and I love the academic atmosphere. I enjoy living in the dorms here, although I dislike that you have to buy a meal plan when you live on campus."
College Sophomore,5,People work with you towards your goal
College Sophomore,5,"I feel safe in campus, there is survelliance 24/7"
College Sophomore,5,We have sisterhoods!!! I love it!!
College Sophomore,5,"Would love to continue my education, and an undergraduate degree from Wesleyan College will help me do so!"
College Sophomore,5,The first year seminar stresses health and safety very strongly.
College Sophomore,5,Wesleyan has sisterhood and it is very well liked by the student body!
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Wesleyan College! I have had a great time thus far and can't wait to continue my journey there!
College Junior,5,Most of my cources and professors are cool.
College Junior,5,"Acceptance of life goes throughout the school. There are lectures and events to better help understand about sexuality, religion, diversity, economic background, traditions. These make the school fun and informative."
College Sophomore,5,We do not have a problem with sexual assault's
College Sophomore,5,We have a very good rate of employment after graduation
College Sophomore,5,The professors are very nice and easy to talk too.
College Sophomore,5,Wesleyan has really good sports
College Sophomore,5,"There's always some opportunity around, it's great"
College Sophomore,5,I think the professors are the best part.
College Sophomore,5,"Campus is great, everything's close by."
College Freshman,5,"Wesleyan has a very completed safety system, and the campus police is very responsible."
College Freshman,5,"Professors are extremely helpful and easy-going. Wesleyan is a small college, therefore it is easy for you to make an appointment with your professor."
College Junior,5,"This school has provided me with an outstanding college experience.  I did not know what to expect, as I came here as an older non-traditional student attending college for the first time.  The professors have been excellent and easy to approach when needed.  The courses have been equally engaging and interesting.  No school is perfect, and I'm sure there are aspects that can be improved, but overall, this has been a wonderful life-enhancing expenditure of my time and efforts to better myself and seek a degree."
College Junior,5,"This campus is very diverse. There are people from all over the world with different religions, ethnicities, and sexual orientations. Everyone is pretty respectful of that."
College Sophomore,5,I love Wesleyan! The teachers are amazing and they understand everyone on campus and can give the attention that each student needs. Having one on one attention with a teacher is great because you are not just a number to them you have a name and they know it.
College Junior,5,"Wesleyan College is a wondetful school, that has very caring Professors and a great Educational Program.  They are all about getting a good education along with learning about culture and good moral values.  I would  not want to attend school anywhete else."
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Wesleyan.  The professors challenge me and mentor me academically and personally as I mature and learn what it means to be an independent woman in the 21st century.  The sisterhood of Wesleyan in invaluable and the experience simply cannot be found anywhere else.  This is a truly amazing campus and the faculty, staff and students play a major role in that superiority."
College Junior,5,"I am currently attending the liberal arts women's college, Wesleyan College. One of the many elements that makes my school unique involves its rich history. It is the first college in the world chartered to grant degrees to women. It also has the world's oldest alumnae association, and it is the birthplace of the first sororities: the Alpha Deta Phi and the Philomathean Society. Another characteristic that makes my school unique is that its graduates include Mary McKay, the first woman in Georgia to receive a doctor of medicine degree and Viola Ross, the first woman to argue a case before the Supreme Court of Georgia. Last but not least, my school has been widely accredited for its overall success. For example, Wesleyan College was ranked #15 by Forbes' list of best college buys. In terms of my overall experience, I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Wesleyan College. The campus is extremely beautiful, especially with the addition of our new Chapel. The campus also possesses a homely feel. The professor's are very encouraging and are always willing to put forth the extra effort to see their students succeed. Lastly, I enjoy the fact that the student population is very diverse. Meeting students from all over the world prepares me for my future career as I may be expected to work with individuals  from different backgrounds."
College Freshman,5,"The financial aid workers help so much when it came to my financial problem's. What mattered to me mattered to them and together, we worked it out to where my first year was paid for. I continually go back to their offices just to talk to them. Even outside of work they smile and wave at me. They even ask me how I am doing and pressure me to keep applying for scholarships."
College Freshman,5,I like that the school is like one little community among the professors and students
College Freshman,5,I think Wesleyan overall is a great school. It's just the right size so the professors are familiar with everyone and the courses are great
College Freshman,5,It's mostly fast food chains so nothing to talk about
College Sophomore,5,The majors that they have are all great and in-depth
College Sophomore,5,I love being able to be myself and see others of so many different backgrounds!
College Sophomore,5,Covers full tuition and room
College Sophomore,5,We need more money to fix the kitchens and stairs.
College Freshman,5,The atmosphere here in Georgia at Wesleyan College is very pretty.  I love the campus it makes you feel right at home.
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone accepts students as they are, and there are no incidents of mistreatment. It is a real diverse campus and it lets you experience different cultures and personalities. Overall this is what makes it a great school."
College Senior,5,"Everyone is very beautiful, I think; almost everyone is a part of something.  All the students are nice, fun, easy-to-talk-to people.  There are lots of people with the same interest as me so I'm sure I'll make lots of new friends."
College Sophomore,5,"Over and over, you will hear that Wesleyan provides an atmosphere that encourages diversity. This is true. Being in a diverse area opens up your perspective in many ways. It'll bring you to a realization that everybody literally inhabits a different lifestyle. With some people, you may share similar features such as living in a single household or being born in the same country. In your professional life, this environment prepares you to interact with people from various parts of the world in many different career areas."
College Freshman,5,We have many different shuttles that the school offers!
College Freshman,5,The students come together to support their classmates.
College Freshman,5,I have already declared my major as political science. My courses are very good and I enjoy them. The professors help you every step of the way.
College Freshman,5,"Wesleyan has many different academic options and amazing programs! It's a small college, so the professors actually help you more than if you went to a big university."
College Junior,5,"Fast, affordable. Clean area. friendly staff. Great seating arrangements"
College Junior,5,Posters are everywhere and we are remind by faculty that the school has a no drugs on campus policy.
College Sophomore,5,"Wesleyan is located is a great area of Macon, GA! Within five to ten minutes walking or driving, a person can get awesome cupcakes and delicious sushi, or go to downtown Macon for some quintessentially Macon cuisine. The area has pretty much any food to quell any hungry!"
College Freshman,5,I have been extremely pleased with the academics at Wesleyan College. They are very demanding yet very rewarding at the same time. I feel that I am pushed to try very hard yet encouraged by my professors.
College Freshman,5,At Wesleyan College everyone is welcome to talk to whom ever they want without any judgement. The school is very welcoming to everyone.
College Freshman,5,Wesleyan want everyone to feel safe and at home. The police is there 24/7 no matter what. The police are easy to contact and is available whenever you need them
College Freshman,5,"There is plenty of diversity regarding religion and ethnicity at Wesleyan College. You can simply walk down the dorm hall and smell different cuisines from various countries being made. There is a mixture of people from China, Kazakhstan, Germany, etc."
College Sophomore,5,"I love my Human Services major.  A large area of focus is in both business and psychology whereas most local schools focus more on criminal justice and government assistance.  The workload is rigorous, but the professors only expect your best efforts.  Tutoring is offered at no extra charge and the learning environment created by faculty and students is excellent.  Internship opportunities are abundant and faculty advisors are always ready to help make the process of obtaining your degree and meeting its requirements as stress-free as possible."
Sophomore,4,Online teaching is a bit more lenient and professors are very understanding of everyone's situation and will make adjustments if you reach out to them.
Sophomore,4,"I'm currently a Sophomore at Wesleyan and honestly you have to make the most of your experience with this school. At first glance you may not notice however, the dorms and campus are obviously outdated and need thorough cleaning. With that being said the campus is still beautiful with all of the surrounding nature. The education is wonderful and the teachers care about you succeeding. When I first graduated high-school I couldn't even write a paragraph properly, but now I can write essays with no issue thanks to Wesleyan's mandatory class for incoming students that helps to prepare them for higher level writing. Now when it comes to partying and having fun you just have to find the right people. There are plenty of students that love to get together and play games or go out to parties. As  someone who was an online student for 6 years the best part of Wesleyan is that it's a very open and accepting environment so you should have no issue finding good friends that become family."
Junior,4,"The online learning is pretty good at Wesleyan. Again, the professors do their very best to ensure the best possible learning environment and this also extends to online learning."
Junior,4,"Wesleyans is a great school if you like small communities. This is a school where people like to learn and study, and it shows in the social interactions between its students. The community is great with a large focus on sisterhood (although it does not have Greek life due to negative experiences with this - the college has maintained many of its traditions). The professors are dedicated and go above and beyond to ensure the best possible learning environment."
Freshman,4,"I think this is a great school! Most, if not all, of the professors are really cool, super helpful, and very willing to answer questions, whether in person or through email. There are also so many clubs, groups, and teams to be a part of, with everything from literature to sports teams to religious organizations. There is always something going on, whether it is CommUnity Tuesdays or just class organized events, like movie nights, or mental health fairs."
Sophomore,4,The college's teachers are very involved in student life and always make sure students are doing the best they can. They go beyond to ensure failing is impossible.
Senior,4,I enjoyed the diversity on the campus and the activities as a student on campus. I enjoyed the teachers and the individualized learning I was able to achieve with attending a smaller campus.
Sophomore,4,Wesleyan College is a great place to go if you are serious about your future. They take your academics very seriously and are always willing to help you with anything you need. The one thing that I'd like for them to do would be if they have a few more student-orientated events on campus.
Sophomore,4,"Wesleyan College is a women's college with about 500 students. It's small so the professors have a lot of one on one time with the students. The food is below average, and so are the residence halls, but purely education-wise, it's a great place."
Freshman,4,"I’m a freshman here and so far I think it’s a good college. The sisterhood here is strong and I love it. There’s diversity and inclusion here. There’s respect among us. The professors are good and they are well equipped. There are a lot of tutors around to help you at any time with any problem related to a course. The food here is great, there are different options to eat in a day.  The dorms are spacious too. The only thing the school should work on are scholarships for international students. They are kind of limited of the international students which makes it a bit difficult for funding."
Junior,4,"Professors are very helpful and genuinely want you to succeed. True academic rigor  while maintaining fair grading and access to 
resources."
Senior,4,I thoroughly enjoy the close knit community and the sisterhood that Wesleyan has to offer. The classroom sizes are small enough to build a relationship with your peers as well as your professors. The experience is empowering and Wesleyan definitely helps in turning young girls into young women.
Sophomore,4,Wesleyan college is a great school. The professors are the most dedicated of them all. The only thing I would change is not requiring the science majors to take humanities classes. Overall good and rigorous school.
Freshman,4,"Academics are absolutely amazing. Student life, however, needs some fixing. Everyone is very very friendly though."
Freshman,4,"The professors are very knowledgeable and always available during their office hours. The professors are always ready to help if you are not understanding the material. The students are very helpful if you need help from your fellow peers. 
The food is okay, it can be better but it is not horrible. The dorms are average dorm-room sized like in most colleges."
Sophomore,4,"Wesleyan provided me with much more than just education. It is my home, my family. Even though school is tough sometimes, I am blessed to be part of it's story."
Freshman,4,"All Women's very empowering beautiful campus, needs more beautification and clean up. I felt at home when I visited. My advisor provided so much useful information at orientation. There's a variety of classes offered. Needs better food."
Sophomore,4,"Faculty and staff are great. This school comes equipped with everything you need to succeed from tutors to teacher office hours, to weekly group study sessions. Meal times should be expanded and options in the café should also be increased. Doro rooms should are in need of renovations. Diversity is definitely a priority for Wesleyan."
Senior,4,This is my Senior year at Wesleyan and I couldn't have made a better choice of schools.  The fact that it is an all woman's college is definitely a plus for me.  I have made many friends here that I'm sure I will stay in touch with after graduation.  If you are looking for a small school with small classes and great academics then Wesleyan is for you.
Recent Alumnus,4,The education program is great. I know I will graduate with a great amount of quality knowledge. I also know having Wesleyan on my resume will be a good thing as well.
Recent Alumnus,4,This campus is safe. I don't feel any threats on campus. We have campus police walking around and if something does happe. The Macon police will come quickly.
Recent Alumnus,4,I am on the equestrian team and it is part of the athletics. Not many people appreciate us and I am not sure how supported the rest of the athletic department is supported. Our facilities are not up to date at all.
College Sophomore,4,I love this school and the vibe of it
College Sophomore,4,"As part of the soccer team, I love the program."
College Sophomore,4,"Great valus are learned here, great academics :)"
College Sophomore,4,We get emails about jobs/internships that fits our field of study.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are very helpful and always available when you need their help. Not to mention encourages us to ask many questions if we don't understand something.
College Sophomore,4,It is encouraged to walk with a group of friends when walking off campus to the store. I do feel safe on campus because we have several campus police officers patrolling the campus 24/7.
College Junior,4,I love Wesleyan and sisterhood. I truly believe that Wesleyan wants all women that enter their college to be successful!
College Sophomore,4,100% job rate when graduating from nursing program
College Sophomore,4,"It is awesome college for studying and research, and you can find intelligent, hardworking, friendly, and unique women"
College Sophomore,4,"Social Science, Business, Art, and Theater. Most students are likely to go to graduate school after."
College Sophomore,4,"Class are small and free. You can talk with your professors. Art and social science class are great, but science class are not enough."
College Sophomore,4,It is depend on where do you live. Apartment is awesome. Wortham and Person and good as well. Avoid Jones!
College Sophomore,4,It's awesome to study in Wesleyan. Professors are pretty nice and like to help students to solve the problem! Talking with your advisor! They are very important! The only bad things is the transportation. Having the driver license and car before you come here!
College Junior,4,Rigorous workouts depending on how a person learns a subject.
College Junior,4,There is not any pressure to take up drugs and visually you don't see who or when someone is taking any.
College Junior,4,"The alumni network might need some updating, but by talking to upperclassman one can find out about the newest alumni."
College Junior,4,The small class sizes and different courses to chose from makes things fun and close.
College Junior,4,Being at a all women college helps to feel safer from sexual predators.
College Junior,4,"All the diverse people and events coming, going, and staying around the campus is some of the funnest times on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I honestly do not participate in sports quite as much as I would like, but they are important to the campus. We even have an extra facility by the lake which both athletes and non-athletes can use for classes and work out equipment."
College Sophomore,4,"It's great, police are always checking in."
College Sophomore,4,"We have no Greek life, but we have sisterhood."
College Sophomore,4,"So far I love my school, and I'm glad I got accepted"
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of excellent women graduated from Wesleyan, and they are always willing to help Wesleyan sisters to attain their dreams."
College Freshman,4,"Wesleyan College is a women's college which has a long history. It is absolutely a small college, with approximately five hundred students and one hundred faculty members. There are various courses in different fields, and you can choose them from General Education, which greatly help you broaden your horizons. The professors here are fair, passionate and easy to reach. They are always willing to offer you help when you need."
College Junior,4,With the academics you get out what you put in.If you work hard you will make A's. The course material  itself is not particularly difficult but many professors assign A LOT of work. The stuffy library is really your only option for a quiet study space.
College Junior,4,The class sizes are small which allows for a closer connection among students and teachers. The professors are all well educated and nearly all have doctorates in their fields. They are accessible and friendly. Many provide extra credit opportunities.
College Junior,4,I love Wesleyan. The all pro-female environment can be very encouraging to young women. The classes are challenging because the professors expect a lot from students. Most every professor has a doctorate degree in the their field is knowledgeable and passionate.
College Freshman,4,"People glorify the school, saying that only smarter people are allowed, but of all the people I've talked to who are in my graduating class, I have the highest GPA (3.92)."
College Freshman,4,"Okay, so I technically haven't even started at Wesleyan yet--I just wanted to enter to win a scholarship. However, the school and all its inhabitants are super friendly and happy! It's a great atmosphere with a lot of wonderful perks; like, all the special attention they give with presents (flowers, thumb drive, buttons, book bag, christmas ornament), they have many days where the school provides motivating activities, and a lot of things are free (laundry, parking, printing). They gave me a full tuition scholarship, which was just really great because my parents are not rich in the least. Wesleyan is a small, cozy, inviting place that appears to be the perfect place to learn."
College Freshman,4,"I personally like to go to eat off campus only if the cafeteria is closed for I am on the college life kind of budget. However, when I do venture out my favorite place to go is a chinese restaurant not five minutes away. It is very delisious and very cheap. I have found more than enough places to eat at near the school and each one is at a decent price. Thankfully they are not mostly fastfood places."
College Freshman,4,I have not been in trouble for something yet so my experience so far with the campus police has been positive. One police officer in general is very humble and is a fan of the school and its athletics. They are very involved but still know how to take their jobs seriously.
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is great for the most part because one becomes more social with other students. It is easier for me to live on campus because I originally live so far away. At my college, I find it that the dorms are larger compared to other colleges which is a plus. The cost of this school is by far its worst characteristic. The campus is full of different plant species which I personally find to my interest. Since we are an all women's college it can be a little dull for most girls bit over all the classroom size is perfect, the community is amazing, and I think another good quality that my school has is the amount of international students who come from all over the world. Unlike others, I get a foot in the door on how different cultures live their everyday lives."
College Freshman,4,I received a $10000 scholarship and the department is very willing to work with you.
College Freshman,4,"The school is strict to some extent and the rules are very understandable. The visitation policy and the alcohol use in dorms really depends on where you live on campus.Being that it is an all girls school, the visitation policy is very lenient , however in regards to male visitation it becomes really strict. The attendance policy, you usually have like three free absences that do not affect your grade. All in all it is very easy to understand the rules."
College Freshman,4,"Wesleyan almost always give out merit-based scholarships. The merit-based scholarships just takes a little bit of the tuition. My GPA wasn't a really good(3.2) but I got a 8,000 a year scholarship. They also have other scholarships, I know a lot of people who have benefited from them. I did not qualify for them."
College Freshman,4,Wesleyan is a very sober school so there will not be parties on campus. You will really enjoy the nightlife if you have a source of transportation. They clubs downtown are really hyped. There are also always parties on Mercer.
College Sophomore,4,"It's a great art and music scene! If you're looking for a night out, down town is the way to go--especially for the coffee shops!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"My professors are great but everything else isn't. The school costs too much and makes you pay for things you may not want or need. I don't care for all of the activities there school puts on and charges us for. I also hate the convocations. Every student is required to attend eight convocations a semester or will be charged ten dollars for each one missed. This is an attempt to get students involved in the campus. Wesleyan is great for education, but if that is all you want then go somewhere else because there is too much forced involvement and charges."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't live on campus but the things I heard, the housing needs to be worked on more."
College Sophomore,2,"Most housing is very close to classes but are not very spacious. A very small amount of thing are actually allowed in your room (maybe a coffee maker, kettle, and some other stuff) and cleanliness is an issue mostly left for the students to deal with. For most dorms, there is only one kitchen with one fridge and stove for the whole building to share. You don't feel like you get the most out of your money especially since you have to stay on campus."
College Sophomore,2,We might have good teams but the student body doesn't care. It's hard to get any participation from the student body.
College Junior,2,"The common areas are horrible and need to be redone. I am sure they have not furnished since the 1940's! And to my surprise, there is not a student center!!!!!!"
College Junior,2,"I wish the athletic department offered more free classes such as zumba to students, I also wish they had a basketball court for public use."
College Junior,2,The campus police is a joke. Macon is a sketchy area but we have not had any on campus scares that I know of. Look out for yourself.
College Freshman,2,"Every week that I walk into the cafeteria I see a repetition of foods. Usually there are two sides in the cafeteria, one for fried foods and the other for ""hot and fresh."" As an athlete I try to eat healthy and remain towards the hot line. However the food, to me, is not overly great. The first week of school was amazing but as months pastor became dull to even look at. Recently, girls have been finding roaches in the cereal containers and others have complained about finding hairs and fly's in the food. I would rather go and eat at a nearby restaurant than spend my time there but for most, including me, it is my only option."
College Sophomore,2,If you don't live at home you live on campus
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms on our campus are really small. We have no space, and the buildings are old so it has a weird smell. The janitors are rude and it sometimes looks like they do not even clean. The public showers are gross and flood easily. The hot water takes a long time to come in the winter. There is no heating in the bathrooms during the winter, so you freeze. The cost of the dorms is way too high for the low quality we get. However, I had great people on my hall so I had a lot of fun,"
College Sophomore,2,"At Wesleyan College we have very little options, and we do not have a good health section. The cups and plates always have food or something unknown on them. The fountain drinks do not get refilled when suppose too, and you have to wait forever when the dining hall runs out of cups. The dining staff does not care, and it is not as sanitary as it should be."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are okay but extremely small especially considering if you have a roommate. Also, maintenance doesn't really clean the bathrooms that well(if you live in a residence hall with a community bathroom). I've seen all of the residence halls and there really is no difference in cleanliness between the apartments and regular residence halls."
College Freshman,2,All Girl School – This is an all girl school. We do not have curfew and visitation policies arent really bad so theres no problem because we can still see guys. I love the all girl thing because it keeps us focused and allows us to be comfortable with each other and learn more about who we are as women.
College Sophomore,2,No Chnace to Grow – Wesleyan College refuses to increase the scolarships for its students. The only option for students is to find out of college scolarships. But for international students it is pretty hard. Being an international student I'm facing difficulties with meeting the requirement of bein a citizen or resident. It is hard to pay the tuition because the cost is rising and the college doesn't give an opportunity to increase the scolarship.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The campus is old and needs to be updated or measures taken to decrease slips and falls. Many walk ways or stairs are marble so when it rains they are very slippery. Also, when it rains the sidewalks fill with water so it almost makes more sense to walk through the puddled grass unless you have rainboots. In other words, rain boots are a necessity on this campus. On the other hand there are plenty of lawns to lie on and relax on a sunny day with huge oak trees for shade."
College Junior,2,"Almost Nonexistent – Beyond the weekend shuttle and the bus lines, there are no real effective means of transportation. The bus routes are costly and not very comprehensive, and the shuttle is unreliable and inconvenient in the times that it runs."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Poor food – There is one dining hall, and it is only open for one hour during meal times. It has several options for meals, but they are not always of a high quality. More options are needed; however the cafeteria staff is very nice!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Find a Friend – Some weekends a shuttle is provided (for $1) that goes to the mall and maybe a few other places, but for the most part the easiest way to get about is find a friend with a car. It's not hard, lots of them do. You don't need a car for campus, so it's really just doing things off campus that would require a ride. You can walk to the grocery so that's not an issue."
College Junior,2,"A Small City – There are a lot of shopping centers around the mall, and little boutiques in downtown Macon. During Friday and Saturday nights there are a lot of clubs open. There is also Mercer down the street, which has different events to go to. Other than that, there are not many attractions in the city of Macon, besides the annual Cherry Blossom Festival."
College Freshman,2,Not Many Options – There are not many choices for off-campus housing. The school does not seem to support the idea of off-campus housing for its students and the places that are available are on the expensive side.
Niche User,1,Politically correct and a huge waste of money. The academics are not worth the net price of 12-20k a year. The campus is okay but mediocre and in the middle of nowhere with insufficient transportation. Save your money and go to a public college or trade school
Niche User,1,I have yet to take any online courses but this school is really a joke overall and I would not recommend. Especially for normal women who do not want to be indoctrinated .
Alum,1,"I did not take classes online. I know they are moving some classes online because of covid, but I would question their quality since the institution doesn’t value or substantially support its professors."
Alum,1,"Wesleyan, as an institution, has a foundation which is built on racism, gaslighting, favoritism, and lies which are desperately repeated as Wesleyan continues to lose both students and money.

I am embarrassed to have my degree from Wesleyan. It is a sinking ship that desperately tries to stay afloat by accepting mediocrity in order to find more money, more warm bodies. On my graduation day, I was not proud to walk across that stage, in spite of graduating at the top of my class. I looked out and saw students who barely made an effort but got the same piece of paper I did. I saw the students who had bullied me. I saw staff who had dismissed me. I saw the students of color whose experiences and pain I couldn’t even begin to imagine. I saw the alumni who would never understand.

I am tired of this institution’s lies and miscommunications. I would not wish these experiences on anyone. If you are considering Wesleyan, PLEASE look elsewhere. You deserve better."
Freshman,1,"Literally boarding school, sisterhood is just drama, and the school doesn't give you a real campus feel. Felt like prison tbh with rejects and no one is ever on your side so if you go don't trust anyone....but I don't recommend you go to this school, it can mess up your Gpa because the teachers suck and there's only one teacher for each subject. The macon area was the best part and I hated being on campus. Going here was the worst mistake of my life."
Junior,1,"The administration does not care about the students and act like witchy mean girls. The food is awful and often makes students sick. The buildings are all water damaged, leaky, and molded. It's dangerous and gross. The dorms constantly have problems like sewage overflow and broken appliances. If you do not hound staff they will forget to do things for you or will full-on ignore you. Most profs are rude and biased.  There's always someone stealing money and they try and scam you out of the scholarship money you earned.  The provost is actually there to cover stuff up and treat you like garbage instead of being on your side. All ""sisterhood"" died years ago. DO NOT COME HERE."
Freshman,1,"Well I came to Wesleyan right after high school from miles away and chose Wesleyan because I thought it would be a safe place to be away from home for my first time being away by myself. That was wrong, they act like the school has many accommodations but once schools starts the staff gets lazy and the head people like the provost and dean don’t do anything at all to help you. The person ahead of residency is only trying to get your money along with the RA’s who you think are trying to “help” you, there is no true sisterhood at Wesleyan...I believe that died a long time ago and I’m pretty sure the rooms are haunted because it’s not like they’re  truly updated. The professors suck and there’s only one per subject depending on the subject and they are cutting teachers due to budgeting so don’t let the little scholarship in the beginning suck you in. I wish I left the first semester or not even went at all."
Freshman,1,"I don’t like this school for two reasons . One of the reasons is that Wesleyan doesn’t have enough activities for students to get involved in. Also, the “sisterhood” among us is terrible because most of the time, people are in their own cliques and never help anybody when they need it. Finally, the school doesn’t want to change some of their traditions and gets stuck in their ways."
College Junior,1,Wesleyan doesnt have a greek life. One of the only cons about the school.
College Junior,1,"Unfortunately, Wesleyan does not allow Greek Life on campus."
College Junior,1,"Again, nothing fun to do."
College Junior,1,ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO. Not on campus or in Macon. There is very little nightlife to participate in. A lot of girls go to Mercer if they want to party.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have greek life but the sorority that comes to our campus are all clones.
College Sophomore,1,"Definitely not a lot to choose from. Wesleyan is located more in Forsyth than in Macon proper, so unless you feel like driving a ways off, the main things available are fast food and a couple of other chains. I gave it a D+ because the prices are affordable, and the froyo place gives a student discount."
College Freshman,1,Athletics at Wesleyan are not taken very seriously.
College Freshman,1,In the beginning the dining was good. I think it is because I came in as a Freshmen so they wanted the class to feel welcomed but late on the food became disgusting. There are times when I don not eat because the selections they have are not good at all. The food should have more variety and better selections.
College Junior,1,Greek at School – There is no Greek life here at Wesleyan. There is one frat which is treated more as a business club.
College Junior,1,"Not that many thunderstorms, but when there is one, it is severe."
College Sophomore,1,There is not really a nightlife at Wesleyan. The campus is one of the driest campuses in Georgia. There are no big parties or bars on campus. Because of a lack of public transportation in Macon students do not go to the clubs downtown often.
College Freshman,1,"Not Fair! The administration does not care if the atletics department ceases to exist. Although we are a division three school, the admnistration should still support and do anything and everything possible to make the program succeed. Very few within the atletics department actually due so."

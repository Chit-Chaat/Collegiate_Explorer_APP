Alum,5,"If you are disagreeable, depressive, unmotivated, like the big-city life, then you will rate your Bucknell experience badly through no fault of the school. Instead, focus on its unique charms: sports teams, clubs, guest speakers, events; great gyms and sports fields in a quiet town with fresh air, open spaces, farms, a golf course, a big river, woods, easy access to shopping at Giant, Weiss, Wal-Mart, and a 24-hr Dunkin' Donuts. Four Starbucks to study at. Also, small class sizes, smart professors, good library, interesting campus, open classrooms in Vaughn Lit to study in late in a safe, serene setting. So much to take advantage of. Try to get in the best shape of your life and get A's in your classes, and you will never be bored. And find the key books in the library to help take your own education to a higher level beyond what the class requires, to prepare you for life, work, law school, or grad school. Visit your prof's during their office hours to discuss things. Stay positive."
Junior,5,The atmosphere at this college is great and the professors are very passionate. Once in a lifetime education for sure.
Sophomore,5,Absolutely great school. Bucknell has a lot of outstanding programs and has a great student with professor relationship opportunity.
Sophomore,5,All professors were very helpful and really went out to help each and every student. Even though the learning was online the quality did not go down.
Sophomore,5,"The Bucknell online experience was amazing, especially when compared to my peers at other institutions and their experiences. All of my professors were incredibly lenient in regards to deadlines, and many altered their syllabi. Also, they gave out generous grades to students considering the issues ongoing in the world."
Sophomore,5,"Going into my freshman year, I was nervous to start a new phase in my life, but Bucknell's staff and student body made me feel so welcome. The campus is beautiful and there is a tight sense of community. There is always something to go do, so you're never bored, and all school-sponsored events are really fun! I have made life-long friends and know that I'll always have a place in the Bucknell community. The academics are so immersive. The professors are very helpful and kind, always making time for students in class and outside of class. They are really there to help you learn as best you can. The class sizes are typically small, so you can develop a good relationship with professors. I really love Bucknell. It's such a great school and is really preparing me to transition into the workforce or graduate school."
Freshman,5,"The campus at Bucknell is very beautiful, and being in a college town means everything is in close proximity and tailored in a manner that benefits the students."
Alum,5,Amazing school for engineers because it allows you to be social and have a liberal arts education as well as a rigorous engineering education.
Freshman,5,"School has great academics, beautiful campus, amazing professors, active social scene, excellent facilities and friendly students , Easier for  freshmen girls to get into parties than boys.   Alumni are very active and helpful. i have an assigned alumni mentor at JP Morgan who has helped in picking classes, advice on  how to get involved in campus and insight to internships and interviewing. food is ok. Town is small but has enough of attractions to provide occasional  campus alternative.  Love Bucknell"
Freshman,5,"Such an open community and everyone is extremely kind. Professors want to help you, and office hours are always open and should be taken advantage of. The people around are kind and helpful ."
Sophomore,5,"Bucknell is a very challenging but rewarding environment. How well you do in school and socially depends on your attitude towards life and your future. I would say that Bucknell has a good and overall friendly population of students. Sure there are some people who I would consider “jerks”, but if you think about it that is just more of an opportunity for you to make friends."
Junior,5,Bucknell is truly my home. I've met lifelong friends and made incredible connections while receiving an amazing education. I couldn't be happier.
Senior,5,Bucknell University is an amazing school that focuses on undergraduate success. Research opportunities are endless!
Alum,5,"I just graduated from Bucknell and I can only say great things. My time at Bucknell was absolutely incredibly– it was a great balance of academics and social life. I fell in love with Lewisburg (which I never thought would be possible), had incredible teachers who drove my intellectual curiosity, and made friendships that will last forever. Before I attended Bucknell, every alumni I met spoke about the University with a huge smile on their face. Bucknell is a community that lasts for a lifetime and I can't express how much this small school in Lewisburg means to me."
Junior,5,I love Bucknell! The people are so friendly and the teachers are passionate and excited about what they are teaching. The professors are great at working one on one with students and take a genuine interest in their students and their wellbeing. The school spirit is amazing and the campus is beautiful throughout all seasons.
Freshman,5,"As a guy who is finishing up my freshman year, I can say that coming to Bucknell was a great decision. At first I felt a little unsure about the school when I first got here, since it was a big shock coming from an urban area, but it definitely grew on me. Being stuck on a rural campus with 3,500 people is what leads to great bonding experiences. Everyone that I have met has been really friendly and overall cool people. You’ll see people you know pretty much everywhere you go. All of my professors have been really helpful and are passionate about what they teach. Many students here definitely have the work hard play hard attitude, but it really isn’t so hard to do when you get the hang of it. Partying is big here, but sometimes overhyped. There’s a lot of people here that don’t regularly go out. Sure it’s not the most diverse, but everyone finds their group, and most people are welcoming."
Alum,5,Students are on any campus for two 4 month blocks a year.  Bucknell is about building connections building your network while experiencing TOP shelf education.  Complainers simply do not understand the purpose of college beyond education.  Literally no student should be complaining about it being 3 hour drive from NYC else they didnt reflect about themselves properly.  The alumni network is outstanding and in a different category from 99% of colleges in US in this regard.  Do your research and understand your objective as a student.   Freshman year is difficult for most everyone; if you are one of the lucky to find it easy then good for you.
Alum,5,"I am an alumni of Bucknell.  (Electrical Engineering). Yes there was frat parties which wa basically the social life on Fri & Sat.  I got bored sometimes but in general had fun and like the fact that the school was small and I could get to know folks.
That said I made AMAZING friends at Bucknell.  We still get tough as a large group sometimes and if life is busy and I don’t see my friends for a time when I do it’s like no time passed.
The professors are wonderful and really care about the students.  Years later and I can still reach out to them and they know me.  I went to graduate school later and will say it was easier than Bucknell undergraduate engineering so it was challenging but the professors will help you.  (Has 1 bad professor and he did not last)"
Freshman,5,Bucknell is a wonderful community for students to learn and make life long friends.  The professors and the athletic department all genuinely care for the students and athletes.  The campus is beautiful and so is the surrounding area.
Alum,5,"As an alum I continue to be impressed by the career paths and life achievements of my peers. Bucknell afforded me the opportunity of a well rounded education leading me to an Ivy League business school and a high level career in finance. I had the opportunity to teach a group of students for a management class recently at Bucknell and was amazed by the intelligence, thoughtfulness and well roundedness of my students. The campus has expanded without losing its bucolic appeal and it remains a great place to strike a strong work play balance."
Freshman,5,"Bucknell University provides students with all of the necessary tools for an outstanding undergraduate experience with an amazing academic and social environment. If I could change one thing, it would be more diversity amongst the social norm. Everyone is typically pretty similar."
Sophomore,5,I have had a great experience at Bucknell so far. I have had amazing professors and everybody really wants you to succeed. The food can get old pretty quick. But Lewisburg is such a nice area and there are some good food options downtown.
Sophomore,5,"Bucknell University is honestly such a wonderful place to grow into a young adult. The classes are interesting, challenging, and rewarding. The professors are passionate about what they teach and really care if students understand the material. It's not just about the grades at this university, it truly is about learning information and expanding your knowledge. The location is great as well. A safe small town that still is full of fun activities to keep students occupied on the weekends. Another great part of Bucknell is that it is a liberal science university. I can major in biology, but also take art or dance classes if I want. It's overall a great place and I'm very happy with my choice to attend."
Sophomore,5,"What I like so much about Bucknell is the environment created by the staff, campus, and students that promotes not only success within the classroom but also outside of it.  Bucknell is welcoming to all students and provides ample opportunities to be involved in various activities throughout campus.  The class sizes are also small which allows students to become close with their professors and makes it easy to meet new students."
Alum,5,Bucknell certainly made college some of the best years of my life  by attracting students from across the country. The orientation program along with campus events and clubs brings the students together. You will not meet a student body more supportive of their school. Ray Bucknell!
Freshman,5,"I am currently attending Bucknell University as a freshman enrolled in the engineering program.  My experience so far has been great.  I am a member of the baseball team so my schedule is quite busy, but fulfilling.  My team mates are all very supportive and inclusive and have helped me make the transition from high school to college quite easy.  I am looking forward to my next 3 years here at Bucknell."
Senior,5,I have loved my time at Bucknell and am sad to be graduating in the spring. The professors really try to form relationships with the students and yearn to get to know you. The school spirit is great and everyone that goes there loves Bucknell.
Freshman,5,"I am freshman guy who just finished my first semester. I have enjoyed my time here. The classes have lots of work, but in my experience it is still possible to do well. The food is better than most colleges, but it can get repetitive if you are on the unlimited swipes. There is better food when you use dining dollars  instead of swipes. The party scene is very Greek life oriented. As a freshman guy, especially first semester, it will be very tough to get into parties. Girls will get into pretty much any party they wants. However, it will get easier for guys to get into parties as time goes on.  Bucknell has a work hard play hard mentality."
Freshman,5,"Love the people, great education. I'm very happy with my choice in college so far, and I am looking forward to another 3 and a half years on campus."
Freshman,5,"For anyone who is just looking at Bucknell or on the fence about going here, I strongly advise you to go here.  Bucknell academics are rigorous, but for anyone who can get in to Bucknell, they are easy to manage. The professors are absolutely amazing and really care about their students. The party scene is crazy as expected, but you also don't feel pressured if you need to stay in to study for a weekend. The friendships I have made already are so special, and as there is a decent amount of preppy stuck up kids (as any college has), there are so many incredible individuals from all over the US that I have met. People that don't go to Bucknell think Lewisburg is a boring secluded little town, but once you come to Bucknell you will realize like everyone else that this is a gorgeous place where you have your own little world, never feeling away from the world."
Alum,5,"An idyllic setting, close knit student body and small classes! I really enjoyed having attending the University."
Freshman,5,I love Bucknell. The professors are great. There is a wide variety of classes and majors to choose from. The facilities are up to date with the times. The party scene is wild!
Freshman,5,I absolutely love Bucknell! I love the sense of community and friendly students. The professors are great.
College Freshman,5,Bucknell alums truly care about each other. There are networking events in almost every major city.
College Freshman,5,"The best possible experience. Work hard and play hard. Professors truly care about you and the students are there for you as well. There is always something to go to! Parties are always fun, but there are other outlets for fun too."
College Freshman,5,PSafe is always there for you and they won't ruin the fun unless it gets out of hand.
College Freshman,5,I lived in Smith and its the best residence hall you can ever imagine! You can't hate it!
College Freshman,5,Greek life at Bucknell is huge! I am going to rush myself. It will not get in the way of academics if you don't let it! It is the only way to have a good network of people though.
College Freshman,5,The facilities are great. IM and club sports are plentiful. Nothing to hate
College Freshman,5,"I am a first year student at Bucknell and all my interactions with Bucknell have just been positive so far. Professors really care about you. The social scene is a lot of fun! It may be hard freshmen year, but it gets better. I think its the perfect school"
College Sophomore,5,"I enjoy the classes at Bucknell because they are typically very small. On average, there was about 20 students in each of my classes. Small class sizes like this give students the opportunity not only to engage with each other, but also the professor. I hear of many stories where students at large universities never even get to talk to their professors just because of how big the classes are. Also, a small class size forces a student to pay attention and not goof around because the professor will notice you. You cannot text the whole class or watch your favorite show on Netflix. You professor expects you to be engaged in their lecture."
College Sophomore,5,Bucknell maintains a strong connection with its alumni and provides the current students plenty of opportunities to network with these alumni and their affiliated businesses. Opportunities like these help ease the transition from graduating college to establishing a successful career.
College Sophomore,5,"I have never felt unsafe on Bucknell's campus. The campus is well-lit and also has the blue light system to help keep students safe. There are always Public Safety officers on duty, and they are never too far away if something goes wrong and you need to call them. Even at night, I feel no potential threat or harm while walking across campus. Bucknell does a great job making the students' safety a major priority."
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely loved living on campus my freshman year at Bucknell University. The dorms were clean and very spacious. I remember doing college tours as a freshman and can recall some of the cramped, dark dorms that I saw at other universities. The dorms at Bucknell were nothing like this. They were decent in size, had lots of natural light, and plenty of storage space."
College Sophomore,5,"At Bucknell University, you must be a sophomore or older to rush a sorority or fraternity. I believe this is a very good policy on Bucknell's behalf. It is pretty evident that Greek life plays a huge role on campus, however, Bucknell makes sure that participating in sororities and fraternities is not the only thing a Bucknell student must be concerned about. An incoming freshman has a lot of adjustments to make since this is probably the first time they are living on their own. Having to be focused on Greek life and rushing may take some time away from focusing on academics. Bucknell does a great job by balancing this focus and making your education the #1 priority."
College Sophomore,5,"Bucknell University does a tremendous job providing up-to-date, clean, and accessible athletic facilities. This applies to both the facilities for athletes and non-athletes. Non-athletes also get access to the facilities only college athletes would get to use like Bucknell's Olympic sized swimming pool.

Also, Bucknell students have a lot of school spirit when it comes to sporting events. We may not be a large state school with a nationals winning football team, but that doesn't stop us from supporting our teams and fellow students."
College Sophomore,5,"I attend Bucknell University. I am a rising sophomore, and I am majoring in the field of physics. One of the most rewarding experiences I have encountered at Bucknell so far is the incredible professors. They truly want to see you succeed and will do anything to help you achieve your goals. When I started my first semester, my physics class was very difficult for me. I did not perform well on the first test and was extremely disappointed. I was unsure of what to do next. Do I drop the class? Do I change my major? Is this school too difficult for me? I did really well in high school, but is collegiate level material too much for me? This is where Professor Ligare stepped in and (not to be cheesy) actually changed my life and mentality. 

Professor Ligare was one of my instructors for my first semester physics class. He emailed me and said we should meet to discuss my test as well as future actions we can take to help me learn the material better. He told me about his weekly office hours and help sessions. I decided to attend those twice a week. In those sessions, Professor Ligare taught me how to think like a physicist and break down a problem into something that I could understand. My professor did not only teach me those skills, but he gave me confidence within myself that I could do it. After I failed my first test, I thought I was not fit to study physics. However, Professor Ligare showed me that wasn't the case. He gave me the tools to feel confident. He also treated me as an adult, and it was up to my digression to continue to come to office hours when I needed help. My learning was my responsibility. If I was struggling to learn a concept, Professor Ligare was always there to help. Yet, I had to be the one to initiate that help. I could not expect the answers to be handed to me. I had to work for them. My experience at Bucknell so far has not only successfully taught me physics, but how to be confident and responsible for my learning."
College Sophomore,5,My favorite thing about the classes is the small size. This helps to make the learning process more engaging and lets the professor really get to know you.
College Sophomore,5,"All of my professors have been passionate, knowledgeable and dedicated."
College Sophomore,5,"Bucknell has a great reputation for graduating students who are competent, and employers know this."
College Sophomore,5,"Psafe is the best, they are efficent at what they do, and have a great attitude."
College Sophomore,5,"This school is perfect for those who want to be surrounded by people who are ambitious and hard working. It is located in a rural area, which is perfect for those who want to concentrate on the college  experience without distraction."
Recent Alumnus,5,There are plenty of opportunities to be involved and make meaningful connections to others.
College Freshman,5,I have found my niche of friends and the workload is manageable. I feel like I am learning a lot!
College Freshman,5,"watch out for psafe, good dudes, but they have a job so dont be belligerent in front of them"
College Freshman,5,"work hard, talk to your professors"
College Freshman,5,"lots of kids start early, seems pressured but it turns out to be a great influence"
College Freshman,5,Great team support and camaraderie among both varsity teams and club teams. There's a sport for everyone here.
College Freshman,5,"Great school, its much like what I read about it, but experiencing it first hand made me reassure myself I chose the right school."
College Freshman,5,Nice carpeting and a LOT of closet space.
Junior,4,"I took all of my courses online in the second half of the semester due to COVID. Since this college is not really known for online courses it was a learning experience for both staff and students. Overall, it was great"
Alum,4,The campus is absolutely beautiful. Professors know you by name and are always willing to foster meaningful relationships with their students. Greek life is VERY present on campus and affects a lot of the social scene.
Sophomore,4,"Bucknell is a great university with top of the line professors, majors, and class options. I enjoy the intimate class setting where students get a great opportunity to forge relationships with their professors and peers. The school is very greek-life concentrated, which can be a downside to some. Also, some of the dormitories are a bit outdated."
Sophomore,4,"Unfortunately, moving online for the remainder of the spring semester took away many on-campus opportunities us students were usually offered, but the Bucknell community made the most of the situation at hand. The professors were very understanding of how the change had affected students, and they took the time to rework their class structures to best accommodate the changes. I missed being on campus, but in light of the situation, I feel like Bucknell did the best it could to make the rest of the semester as normal as possible for students."
Sophomore,4,I like the student-faculty relationships because everyone working there really wants to see the students succeed. They want to get to know you and are welcome to the idea of students helping them with their research.
Sophomore,4,My online learning experience has been very solid. Bucknell was on top of things from the start and we really did not lose much time from the transition.
Freshman,4,"I am an enrolled student at Bucknell and I absolutely love it. If you are planning on being a STEM major, this is the place for you. You'll have access to the finest technology, education, and professors money can buy. Do not be discouraged from pursuing engineering if you think it is too difficult... it is not. You need only apply yourself, and you'll do fine. My good friend got a 1/60 on his calculus EXAM and still passed the class.

About the social aspect: you're gonna hate your freshman year if you're a boy. You can only party if you're an athlete, a frat member, or a girl. So, freshman boys are the absolute lowest of the low. Don't let that discourage you in your choice though because I promise you it will get better as you go on. You will be in the same boat as all the other freshy boys, so use this time to hang with the boys and expand your circle of friends."
Junior,4,"Overall, Bucknell is a pretty traditional school. The academics are good. The professors for the most part, are solid. If you put yourself out there, there is a lot to do on campus. However, it is easy to feel isolated since the location is in central PA. Work hard, play hard is a common and accurate statement. For negative aspects, the racial diversity is lacking and there is a pretty strong divide between the upper white class and the rest of the school. You have to know what to expect and be able to adapt. Like a lot of schools, it is what you make of it."
Freshman,4,"I like the small classes, the professors, and the beautiful campus. I think Bucknell can stand to be more diverse."
Alum,4,"Mostly rich upper class white students but there is some diversity. Bucknell is working on increasing diversity. Professors are great, and they want students to do well."
Sophomore,4,"Bucknell University is a small, rural, liberal arts college of almost 4,000 students. It’s three colleges: Arts and Sciences, Engineering, and Management. Education wise Bucknell is a great school with amazing and for the most part thoughtful professors. They know what they're teaching and have a noticeable passion for their work. The school itself is beautiful. However, the school is on a hill so it is troublesome for students in wheelchairs and crutches. Food is boring, tasteless, and bad quality of vegetables and fruits. The meal plans are expensive for this below average food. The campus atmosphere, the students are all clones of one another. In this prestigious, predominantly white school there are a lot of cliques based on financial status and greek life. There is alcoholism, drug abuse, and an above average rate of sexual assault and harassment at Bucknell. Location wise, students feel trapped in this ""Bucknell bubble"" since there is nowhere to go in the small area."
Junior,4,"It's great if you're not looking for an urban feel in a college, but there is a lack of diversity and not many things to do. Most professors are nice and academically challenging."
Alum,4,"I was a first generation college student woman of color when I attended Bucknell. There wasn't a lot of financial or racial diversity, but the campus was welcoming, professors were passionate in their subjects as well as good at teaching, and I met some lifelong friends there. The campus is beautiful. It's definitely expensive, but I don't regret attending."
Freshman,4,"I have had many positive experiences and a few negative ones. I feel a bit out of place sometimes because I come from a upper-middle class family and it feels like the majority of students here are from the top 1%. The party scene here is vibrant, which I personally like. However, if you don't like to go out and drink then you may not have much to do on the weekends. Nearly everyone goes out and if you don't you may have trouble making friends. With that being said, the academics are excellent. I love my professors and classes. Class is often times more of a discussion than a lecture. It is very involved and even classes I don't see myself enjoying I end up really liking! The professors and students alike are caring, kind, helpful, and intelligent. The Bucknell mentality is definitely work hard, play harder."
Sophomore,4,Bucknell is a lot of fun and has a very accepting community. I love my professors and I feel like I am learning applicable things.
Freshman,4,"Bucknell University is a great  school academic-wise. You can tell that the professors are very invested in each student's education and are so available outside of the class. Bucknell is also making an effort to improve the diversity on campus. I would say the food on campus  is a lot better then at other schools and is buffet-style. However, it is still cafeteria food... The basketball team at Bucknell is real good (both the men's and women's teams). There is always a party or some social event so in my opinion you never have to be bored."
College Freshman,4,"Overall I've really enjoyed my time so far at Bucknell. It fosters a real sense of community that is missing on other more urban campuses. The teachers are a bunch of wacky, intelligent, passionate weirdos that you'll cherish forever. You truly get the liberal arts degree at Bucknell with classes about portraiture and classics and humanities. On the other hand, the STEM facilities and options are poppin'. This is a great place to be an undergrad."
College Freshman,4,"Even as freshman, students get connected with future employers and job opportunities. The Bucknell network outside of 'the bubble' has always been strong, alumni are always very enthusiastic when it comes to hiring fellow bison."
College Freshman,4,"Bucknell has a big and bustling party scene. The same concerns of any college campus are here as well. While these threats are always present, I do not feel unsafe or unsupported by my school."
College Freshman,4,"At Bucknell you cannot rush until you're a sophomore. This is a rare but wonderful system. It allows you to find your ""people"" and pursue your interests without being overshadowed by forced friendships and obligations. Greek life is done really well, but girls should be aware that sororities only have halls not actual houses. Close to half of campus goes Greek so it's hardly selective. If you like to go out, like most Bucknellians do, consider going Greek just for the convenience."
College Freshman,4,"I was hesitant to chose Bucknell because it's so small and I thought that meant isolated. Really, you hardly leave campus because there's just so much to do. Bucknell offers tons of clubs and sports at all level in addition to near nightly campus events, not to mention parties. The people here are great, however the housing department finds some special way to match you up with your exact opposite. Residential colleges are generally great but the university makes it seem much better than it is in practice. Don't be afraid to talk to your professors, they all really care. BU could have more school spirit when it comes to sports, but overall you just get the sense everyone is happy and excited to be there."
College Sophomore,4,The alumni network is one of the best.
College Sophomore,4,"Classes, such as yoga, are very popular and accessible to everyone on campus. Non-athletes are welcomed to use athletic facilities."
College Sophomore,4,"My favorite thing about my school is the professors. They are passionate, intelligent, and care about their students. All the professors that I have had so far were very happy to help me. They care not only about my experiences in their class but also my overall experiences at Bucknell."
Recent Alumnus,4,I loved my dorms each year. Another building was added after I graduated
College Freshman,4,its pretty fun but the work is hard
College Freshman,4,All of the housing options are very good here.
College Freshman,4,I am not a part of it but I am going to rush. Everyone has friends in Greek life.
College Freshman,4,Games are very fun to go to and the gym is beautiful.
College Freshman,4,Too complicated for an honest explanation right now.
College Freshman,4,"Generally, if someone is too drunk to walk, they will be escorted by public safety and not taken advantage of."
College Freshman,4,Professors are generally understanding if you are sick.
College Freshman,4,"There aren't many careers available in Lewisburg due to its small size, but a Bucknell degree looks good."
College Freshman,4,"I live in McDonnell Hall, which is the best dorm that freshmen can get into."
College Freshman,4,"I'm not particularly athletic, but I think Bucknell offers a good variety of services for those who are just starting to regularly work-out, to athletes."
College Freshman,4,"Pretty dope. At first you have to learn to balance the ""work hard, play hard"" motto, but it's doable."
College Freshman,4,Lots and lots of parties
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus, and public safety is known to respond within 60 seconds to any call. I've heard however that student health isn't always helpful and sometimes dismissive."
College Freshman,4,"All of my classes had around 30 students or less, and the professors were clearly very passionate about what they were teaching and that the students were similarly engaged."
College Freshman,4,"I live in Vedder and love the unique shape of the rooms for privacy and storage reasons, but it's hard to have people over because it will feel cramped. I've heard that other buildings (esp those w/o AC) have it worse, but many of the dorm buildings are nice."
College Freshman,4,Housing at Bucknell is great. Living on a hall with others introduces you to so many people and you create long lasting friendships with your hall mates. The cleaning service does a good job at keeping the bathrooms clean and orderly. Most buildings are no more than a 10 minute walk to class.
College Freshman,4,"Greek life on campus is HUGE. 80% of the upperclass at Bucknell are a part of greek life. There is a fraternity or sorority for everyone. It is not overpowering, though. You can have a social life and do just fine at Bucknell without being a part of greek life."
College Freshman,4,"The pride that most students at Bucknell have in their school is evident, even when they don't always have the time to attend sporting events.  Basketball is the biggest sport, and it's really fun to go to a game and watch the team play."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Though Greek life dominates, it is possible to go through the four years not being a member of Greek life and yet having the best experience imaginable."
College Sophomore,4,"Coming from an under represented background, it has been a difficult transition, however, I have met the most amazing and genuine people in such a short time. Although I am not an international student, the international community is phenomenal! Bucknell has my heart because of them."
College Junior,4,The campus is very fair. As long as you arent stumbling around dangerously drunk you usually wont have an issue with P-Safe. Drug use is treated differently and is discouraged especially in the dorms.
College Junior,4,"The food itself is very good. I rarely, if ever, think something actually tastes bad. The only issue is that it gets repetitive."
College Junior,4,Living on campus is great freshman-junior years. The school offers a wide variety of accomidations that should be able to suit most anyone. You will always be close with your freshman hall mates and as you move past your freshman year you're allowed more freedom to live with who you want/where you want. Unfortunately the seniors are getting pushed back on campus but the new apartments are well done.
College Freshman,4,The food is great but can get old real fast.
College Freshman,4,We need more chain stores.
College Freshman,4,We are a very beautiful campus.
College Freshman,4,Health center is in a great location.
College Freshman,4,Basketball is the most attended sport.
College Senior,4,"No comments, everything above covered it."
College Senior,4,"Probably one of the colleges with the best food services that I've eaten at, but can definitely be ridiculously over-priced.  One example being a cup of grapes; about a dozen grapes for $3.99+."
College Freshman,4,"Great teams, okay enthusiasm, awesome facilities."
College Freshman,4,Very possible to engage in vices
College Freshman,4,Really good food; decent variety; a tad expensive.
College Freshman,4,"It will not be great for first-year guys, but after that it will be great."
College Freshman,4,First-years have to get the unlimited meal plan
Freshman,2,"Bucknell is a predominately white school in the middle of nowhere. I found myself bored of the social scene after my first semester of attending. There are three bars there, only two that people go to, and neither of which are fun. The social scene at Bucknell is my biggest problem with the school. Everything is dominated by the frats, which are not fun after your 3rd time attending, and they create a toxic culture. When I told my friends, who were freshmen-seniors, I was transferring Many replied with “I can’t blame you. You won’t get the college experience here” which speaks volumes about the school.  If you like small, isolated, where you will get a good education yes bucknell is for you, but by then end of your time there I bet you will be more than ready to leave. In Bucknell.‘s defense I didn’t meet a lot of good people there and make a lot of good friends and learn a lot but the school itself is not for me. I want more from college."
Senior,2,"As a current student, I can tell you that Bucknell is surrounded by enough things to probably do in one week... After that, there is nothing other than the same old frat parties which are just rich, upper class sheep following other rich, upper class sheep.  The Greek life hierarchy is definitely prevalent on campus as it pretty much runs the social scene (only 3 real bars in town). The groups are very much segregated on socioeconomic class.  Very cliquey and middle-class students are scalped with the high living costs and tuition even though the school is in the middle of nowhere. 

The very prominent issue is the class-based hierarchy that is represented in Greek life with the ""top"" fraternities and sororities and very little interaction between those who have a wealthy upbringing and even those that are middle-class.  Come here if you want to try and make it through that as if it is highschool 2.0."
Junior,2,"The campus is beautiful and I have been graced with wonderful professors and enlightening classes. However, that is about as much I can say about Bucknell with a positive tone as a Black person on the campus. The diversity is virtually nonexistent, with about 120 Black students on a campus with 3600 students. This disproportionality is exacerbated when the people that hold the majority in the school refuse to work with you in class, keep you from engaging in social events, and overall make Bucknell an unwelcoming and depressing environment. Bucknell can't be the worst, but it surely has a large amount of work to do if they want to continue to bring diverse students to campus, because they are not ensuring the health and happiness of the diverse students they currently possess."
Freshman,2,"I am from the west coast and came to Bucknell on an athletic scholarship. I knew it was a big party school and I was someone that was cool with partying. But let me assure you there is absolutely nothing else to do here. 

Professors and academics are great but it does not make up for the horrible social scene. Parties are in disgusting, sweaty frat houses and are no fun unless you like getting black-out drunk. The fact that it's DI doesn't make much sense considering my friends who played DIII sports got better uniforms and didn't have to fundraise. 

The university is merely concerned with getting more money from alumni despite the professors being quite good. I have good friends through athletics but unless you plan to join Greek Life you're pretty much screwed. You'll tell yourself you can sacrifice things just to get the name ""Bucknell"" on your diploma...but just know very few people outside of New York, PA, or New Jersey know what it is anyways."
College Freshman,2,"Joining a Residential College is a gamble. Additionally, the housing varies so much it is hard to qualify it. Some halls are notoriously dirty and unkempt while others are beautiful and spacious. Regardless, if you want to switch rooms, the housing office will screw you over. Bucknell is set up in an uphill-downhill structure so if you're downhill you'll get use to climbing lots of hills to get to class. If you're uphill, stock your dorm with food because you'll never want to make it all the way to the ELC for cheap food."
College Sophomore,2,"In retrospect, this was probably not the school for me. If you're not an upper middle class, caucasian and say ""like"" in every sentence, I suggest you look elsewhere unless you want to spend the next four years feeling as if you're in social Siberia. If you've lived in the sheltered bubble that is the suburbs your entire life, you will have no trouble fitting right in with the rest of the white mold. If you're a minority, there are some outside clubs that are a sad attempt considering the five people that are active members. No one really cares about those clubs though, in fact the rest of the study body barely knows it exists. 

That being said, if the social aspect doesn't scare you and you actually have some thick skin, you'll find the academics here outstanding and the professors extremely knowledgable and helpful. It's a shame."
College Sophomore,2,i would be happy if I could park a tent on the green common area
College Sophomore,2,"Cant wait to leave this place. Town doesnt accept the students. Heck, half the students dont accept the students."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is too obvious on campus. Parties are overrun and staffed with police at every game.
College Sophomore,2,The only thing Bucknell has going for it is the professors. The student body is non-diversified yuppies. Alcohol and drugs are rampant on campus. Athletic team coaches are substandard for a D1-AA school. Student body does not support the athletic teams. Considering transferring
College Freshman,2,Bucknell is in the middle of nowhere. There is nothing to do in Lewisburg.
College Senior,2,"Too Greek-centric.  Independents and freshmen who won't rush until the next year usually end up banding together because they can never get into frat parties. It's gotten to the point that I much prefer the bar. It's not worth it to go into a basement, grab a beer, then try to walk across the floor with it only to find that over half of it ends up on you instead of in your mouth."
College Freshman,2,Transferring into School of Management is a mess.
College Freshman,2,The school is trying to cut down on it.
College Freshman,2,There are only a few restaurants in walking distance.
College Freshman,2,It seams as if the administration is trying to bring the school to a place the students don't want to be. They're limiting downtown housing and cracking down on the fun.
College Freshman,2,Clubs and organizations don't do a good job of promoting their clubs. You must find clubs to join yourself. Its very hard to balance your workload and club schedule during the school year but it is manageable.
College Freshman,2,"Party scene is terrible at Bucknell. Unless you like being cramped in a frat house, shoes getting soaked with beer, not being able to move do parties being so crowded, then you will enjoy the party scene. However, being in such a small town with nothing to do, if you don't like to parties you will find yourself very bored on the weekends."
College Freshman,2,"There is not much to do in the town of Lewisburg, PA. There are a few good places to eat, however, the walk into town takes about 20 mins from the farthest point on campus. Students are generally nice, but their is a sense of fakeness on campus. Sports here are terrible. No one attends the football games which is a huge bummer."
College Freshman,2,"If your not a part of Greek life on campus, you will be missing out on a ton of college experiences and might find weekends boring. Greek life dominates the social scene on campus. If you don't want to be a part of Greek life you might want to considered other colleges."
College Freshman,2,Safety is an issue on campus. Bucknell has one of the highest percentage of sexually assaulted victims in comparison to other schools. I do not feel safe keeping my dorm room unlocked while I am in my room.
College Junior,2,It's a small town so you don't have many options unfortunately.
College Junior,2,"It's not worth your time, unless you'd like to party all the time where that can be your only place to do it because of public safety."
College Junior,2,A small minority of students live off campus (usually 20% of the senior class) because the school wants to keep students on campus and make money even though students would like more opportunities to live off campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Frats are crowded and dirty, you often wait outside for long periods of time. The music sucks for the most part. DONT go downtown in the winter, it's not worth it. Go for it in the summer though. Might find something worth while."
College Freshman,2,I am going to be terribly in debt when i graduate
College Freshman,2,There isn't much cultural or racial diversity
College Freshman,2,"Landlords do seem to allow pretty much whatever but with decisions from the Board of Trustees, downtown life will soon be a lot different and almost all students will be required to live on-campus. The houses most people know are dirty and run down, because people party in them. However, there are other nicer, cleaner options that are more expensive and farther from campus."
College Freshman,2,"I did not expect so many kids here to use drugs but it is a very prevalent atmosphere, even living in a residential college."
College Freshman,2,"If you're looking for diversity, Bucknell isn't your school. It's mostly preppy white people, and minorities are rare on campus, and even rarer in Greek life. However, there is a high level of tolerance on campus regardless of the lack of diversity."
College Freshman,2,"Lewisburg is literally in the middle of nowhere. But in a way, that's what makes it some homey. Lewisburg is a quaint little town with not much to offer, so that means the campus is where you spend most of your time."
Niche User,2,"Bucknell has a lot of international students, but ultimately campus seems to be filled with about two races of people. Diversity is pretty bad. "
Niche User,2,"The party scene at Bucknell dominates the nightlife. Since there's very little to do in Lewisburg besides go bar-hopping, most students tend to go to frat parties. However, the frat party scene can get stale fairly quickly. "
College Freshman,2,"Bucknell is a school where a majority of the community is white. As a student that is a minority on campus, it can sometimes be hard to integrate themselves into a community such as this. "
College Freshman,2,getting into the schools in not easy
College Freshman,2,stuck up and close minded
College Freshman,2,strict with getting into parties
College Freshman,2,no one goes to the football games
College Freshman,2,complicated process to get in
College Freshman,2,"While everything at Bucknell is relatively close, so it is easy to live off campus and still feel part of everything, housing options are terrible. All the houses look like they are ready to fall down with the next Hurricane Sandy, and after years of extreme house parties are equally as gross on the inside. Also, with the added efforts of Braveman to get everyone on campus (building new houses on campus), Psafe and the Lewisburg PD have been cracking down on parties."
Senior,1,"If you want to be a decent, educated person do NOT go to Bucknell. Professors are great, but the students and the admin do not make it worth it. Greek life and parties dominate the social scene and if you're not rich and white then you will absolutely hate it here. It's impossible to sustain a meaningful conversation with most kids here since they only care about partying and most likely got in bc of their parents. This school does not have its priorities right. My dorm had bats, floods, and a cockroach infestation, but they only show you the fancy dorms when you visit. Most frats are full of rapists but the school won't do anything about it because they just care about the money. The food is both expensive and disgusting. Besides the professors,  everyone else at this school does not want you to succeed."
Senior,1,Classes were online in spring 2020 and professors were understanding about late assignments and provided resources so you could join lessons a synchronously.
Alum,1,"Thought this school would set me up for an excellent career but I've yet to interview at a single company that's heard of this no-name, overpriced 60/K Private Liberal Arts School. Half my classmates were unemployed when I visited for my 5 year reunion. 

Lewisburg is IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. 2 bars in downtown Lewisburg. The most exciting thing to do is visit the local Walmart (I wish I were joking)

Gray, depressing weather during the entire academic year.

Social/party scene gets boring after 2 weeks. If you aren't in a frat/sports team you will hate it. I was in a fraternity and still hated it as their was no ""brotherhood"" whatsoever. Everyone constantly picked on each other. 

School is EXTREMELY strict. Feels like 4 more years of High School."
Alum,1,I actually didn't take any courses online and i don't know anybody who did either. Professors are great.
Niche User,1,"I chose Bucknell because I thought it was pretty and I thought I would fit in with the ""look"" of the school, not to mention it was in my range of average acceptance rate. I fell in love with the campus and thought it would be a great fit. I was so wrong. The problem with Bucknell is that there is absolutely nothing to do except party. From my experience, if I did not feel like going to a party for the fourth day in a row I would be shamed for it by the people on my hall. I joined some clubs like APB and was made for of for that as well. I only lasted a semester at this school which is really disappointing because the academics are great but the other aspects of the school make it not worth going to. I can say that I gave this school a great shot, joined about four clubs including club field hockey and it was still a miserable experience."
Alum,1,"The academics are excellent and I made a few good friends, but overall I had an absolutely MISERABLE experience.

They don’t care about your mental health at all. All they care about is your money.

This school sucked the life out of me and it still hurts to visit.

As an alumni I’m constantly bombarded with emails, letters, and phone calls asking for more money on top of an already ridiculously high tuition.

Don’t waste your money here. Go somewhere else, anywhere! Just not here."
Freshman,1,"The academics at Bucknell are great, but I personally have trouble with the social scene. There is barely any diversity amongst the students and most of the students are white, upper class, and conservative. I was shocked by the casual racist, homophobic, and sexist comments I heard on campus, as well as the lack of friendly, driven, open minded people. As for the party scene, there is nothing else to do but go to small, sweaty frat parties every night. You're completely isolated if you don't join Greek life, which has a very clear hierarchy.  This makes it very cliquey on campus, making it feel more like a high school than a university. There is also little else to do outside of campus, besides take a trip to Walmart or go to the one of the few mediocre restaurants in Lewisburg. 
If you are considering going to Bucknell, I strongly suggest you visit campus and talk to some students before you make any decisions. If you want a small, wealthy rural school, it may be for you."
Freshman,1,"Very wealthy environment, lots of rich/stuck up kids driving around $90k cars their Ivy league parents paid for.  Very expensive and little help from financial aid office."
College Sophomore,1,Football Coaches are ABUSIVE. Student Athlete selection each year is questionable. games are unattended. Attendance was higher at my HS games (for all sports)
Recent Alumnus,1,"I just graduated from Bucknell and I highly recommend that you do not attend this school. I picked Bucknell because it has a good reputation and the campus is beautiful but there are a lot of things I didn't take into account that I wish I had, and I think you should when looking for a college. 

Bucknell academics are highly regarded, and I agree there are some good programs and smart people here, but for the most part I did not find the students in this school to be very intelligent. Many of them only get accepted because they're legacy and trust me, it's obvious. 

The school is also in Lewisburg which gets old fast. When I came here I was excited to go to a small town because it was something totally different than I was used to. After about a year I was not happy to be in Lewisburg. Lewisburg is a nice little town in the middle of nowhere and there are a couple good restaurants, but they are scarce and there is absolutely nothing else to do here. The town is one street but it is very small and spending four years here is way too long. 

The administration is pretty crappy as well. To be frank, I wouldn't trust them to run a preschool. They got caught lying about their SAT scores two years ago and they only care about getting more money from alumni. They also treat the students like infants. They are no longer letting students live off campus, which used to be something all students looked forward to doing their upperclass years. They're trying to get rid of Greek life, which has always been a big part of the social scene here. They have also ended hundred year traditions, like the beloved House Party Weekend. 

This is just my opinion, but many of my friends at Bucknell agree with this. Of course I did have some good experiences here and I made some great friends but almost all of us agree that we wish we had went to a different school for undergrad. The school has a lot of faults and the administration is making it worse."
College Senior,1,Tiny and outdated rooms. They somehow manage to screw you over each and every year.
College Freshman,1,"The students are by no means bad people, I just wish the school was more diverse in terms of personality. I'm not into partying, I hate crowds, and I'm really shy and introverted. It seems like everyone here is the complete opposite."
College Freshman,1,Too much partying; this is not the school for me!!!
College Freshman,1,"Around 40% of the student body is involved in Greek Life, which is great if you're into that sort of thing, but not for people like me. BIG MISTAKE!"
College Freshman,1,I didn't get any scholarships.....................
College Junior,1,Many students come from privileged and sheltered backgrounds; their first priority certainly isn't school
College Junior,1,Very undiverse student population - 85% of students are white/Caucasian and there are very few minorities on campus. Most people (though not everyone) comes from affluent backgrounds. 40% of students went to a private high school. Most students are middle or upper class.
College Freshman,1,if your not a girl you are not getting in
College Freshman,1,"Alcohol is extremely present on campus. Other than drinking, there's not much else contributing to the social scene, which is a little disappointing since my parents are paying 50 grand to this school. I do wish all of my weekends here weren't focused on binge drinking. I came here because I was hoping for a bit of a deeper experience along with the occasional crazy night- not getting drunk in any of the spare time I have."
College Freshman,1,middle of nowhere. public transportation sucks

Freshman,5,"It is very good  we got time to study and organize things. I really interested this things it is very good college but,  unfortunately I dropped my classes because the FAFSA still need more documents"
Freshman,5,"At the first, I registered in college every one was helpful with me and they were so happy to meet us. I am so excited that I am going to be graduated student at Henry Ford Collage. They explained everything that the student want to know and how to register for classes and how to pay for classes.  I Heard a lot of good things about henry ford and that's why I registered for Henry Ford College ."
Freshman,5,"During this pandemic teachers have honestly been so amazing. They are helpful, openminded about everything that is going on and online classes have been great."
Graduate Student,5,I have not taken any classes yet but so far applying and taking all the required steps to getting into the PTA program has been easy.
Junior,5,"Due to Covid-19, I had to take some online classes this year such as Physics. Also, my face-to-face classes have turned online, so I have experienced online studying more than any time this year. My professors at Henry Ford College were very helpful and understandable. They helped us, as students, a lot to get through this hard time and new experience that many of us may be experiencing it for the first time. I took my lessons and lectures by Zoom and Webex meetings and others. My professors put all the effort to make us feel comfortable and understand the subject as well as they were available by email to provide us with any assistance or concerns we may have. So, with all that being stated, I became more comfortable with this new experience and decided to continue studying for the upcoming semesters. As a result, I have registered for two biology and one Chemistry course in order to complete my major requirements and continue my education. It was a nice experience and try."
Sophomore,5,I took a few classes online and it was easy to work on moodle. Assignments are posted on time and graded in a timely manner.  Email responses were very fast and I was always able to get in touch with my professor.
Sophomore,5,Very diverse with amazing professors! Campus is pretty small but that’s expected of a community college. I can’t stress enough how great the professors are that I have come in contact with.

Another great thing is that everyone there is willing to help you, they really want you to succeed."
Senior,5,"The nursing courses offered online at Henry Ford College have been a very pleasant experience. The instructors communicated the necessary information I needed to pass the course in a variety of methods to help guide my learning. I truly feel like I have learned a lot in this program. The teachers were knowledgeable and experienced in the subject and were able to provide valuable feedback via Big Blue Button, an online experience. Even during a pandemic the teachers were quick to respond to any questions I had during that time and significantly helped lower my anxiety about the change. Would highly recommend online courses here!"
Freshman,5,"Started going there fall 2019, and currently still enrolled. It's a great college to be honest. Like any college you attend do your classes earn you grade. Simple & easy. The professors are nice ( so far ) , I usually use Ratemyprofessors to see. Overall love it & wish they had my program for 4 years not just two. :)"
Alum,5,"I loved my experience at Henry Ford College. It was truly a great experience, the professors were helpful and I enjoyed being on campus. I learned so much from the professors and also my peers. The environment is conducive to learning and have a sense of community. This college is truly one of the best."
Graduate Student,5,i like henry ford because everything there is so hands on and its small and i feel like small schools are best for me.
Sophomore,5,Henry Ford is a great way to start pursuing a career to better your future. I love it wouldn’t change a thing about it.
Niche User,5,Henry Ford is a great environment for students like me who take dual enrollment courses because they are able to feel comfortable surrounded by an unfamiliar environment and still able to feel at home.
Freshman,5,"Henry Ford is a very welcoming, diverse college that provides students with all of the necessary resources to be successful and create a road map towards graduating and establishing a career."
Niche User,5,I never attended Henry Ford College but I will be attending this fall. My sister used to go there and she said the school is very good.

Senior,5,"Awesome school with many resources to help you succeed and many programs to choose from. Very diverse and although every school has those professors who expect you to understand things as easily as they do, most of the professors at Henry Ford college are patient with their students and there to help. They have office hours that you can schedule to have one on one time with them to get a better understanding of material you might be struggling with."
Freshman,5,This is a great college in my opinion. All the staff give great help and especially the staff in the library that will even help you create a great resume for any work your looking for. Our writing center in our library offers helps to student writing essays/papers for assignments given by the classes their in. Not ever have I seen so much help given to students.

Their number one goal and priority is the success of the student."
Freshman,5,I took a dual enrollment class at HFC and I am proud to say that it was a great experience for me. Everyone was extremely helpful and gave me a precollege amazing experience which is now the reason why I plan on attending Fall 2019.
Sophomore,5,Henry ford college is a great school if you are looking to get an associates or transfer after two years but if you are looking for a fun college experience it wouldn't be here by any means the professors are nice and usually give more care than I've heard about at other colleges. It is like a Toyota Camry its dependable and you know it'll always be there for you but it's just a little boring. What I would like to see changed is maybe having more things to do on campus and i would most definitely like to see and baseball/softball field on the campus itself. That is how Henry Ford could become better
Junior,5,"I absolutely love the diversity at Henry Ford College. Every time I take a new class, I get to meet so many new people, all from many different backgrounds. The professors are also very nice and considerate about everything."
Niche User,5,"I am a high school student attending dearborn high, however I have been in henry ford before whether its going  to my dual enrollment class or just going there to find a nice quiet place.

At Henry Ford College we do what we feel is helpful for us to achieve more towards our degree"
Freshman,5,I have had an overall good experience. I have only taken two classes so I do not have a lot of negative things to say about it. My professors have done everything to help be succeed.
Freshman,5,"I am happy  to be there staff ,teachers, friends and everything is good .we cooperate together,  study together, eat too. it's my second home"
Sophomore,5,"Henry Ford College is a great college to start with. The majority of the professors here have had previous experience in the subject that they are teaching. There are beautiful sitting areas all around the campus, if you prefer the outdoors more."

It has many programs that interest me.what I would like to see change is the way you can communicate with teachers.Also how they will be teaching in class."
Freshman,5,I love how Henry Ford is very diverse and how they have people that can assist you 24hrs.Everyone is very helpful and don't mind going out of they way to help others
Sophomore,5,I like how diverse it is. So many backgrounds. Also the campus is pretty nice to look at from a far. Plus the professors are very intelligent and helpful when comes to the teaching.
Freshman,5,"I would like to see a change in the environment because the hallways look sa dark, but for the rest of the colloge it's a wonderful experience and I'm happy that I went to Henry Ford ."

Freshman,5,Very nice and clean campus . Lots of programs to choose from. Small but not cramped. Sits. Next door to a unversity and down the street from the mall. Has a day care on campus and there is a child time across the street from the school.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love going here. I love the atmosphere, everyone that goes there makes it feel like home."
Graduate Student,5,"Henry ford college gave me the appertunety to go back to school after about 18 years of no school. The small classes encouraged me to feel confident to start my back to school experience. In deed I'm one semester away from an associates degree in liberal arts. I have been very happy with all the teachers I had and would recommend every student to start their collage education at Henry Ford collage. The best part is the tuition. It is affordable and is cheaper then half of other collages tuition. Henry Ford collage did give me what I was looking for on education, social atmosphere and confedence.
Thank you Hfcc"
Freshman,5,"Henry ford college is amazing, it's all I can say! I'm really thankful that I chose HFC to continue my education! Campus is really safe, I enjoy going with my friends around the campus. The only thing I'm a little concerned about is the food on campus, we need more food, bigger menu!!!! And maybe Starbucks ;) lol! But overall, love it !!! Graduated from high school and searching for a college to continue your education? Then definitely choose HFC! All the staff are really helpful! Thank you so much!"
Senior,5,"Henry Ford College has been an excellent experience for me. I learned and grown so much while attending school there. The school was close to home and work, with convenient hours to attend school. The teachers have actual work experience in their chosen fields and also provide information and guidance that is invaluable. Not only that, you get teachers for the most part that are fun, down to earth who truly love to teach and actually care about their students. Another thing that is great about Henry Ford is the cost to go to school there. You just can't lose by going there, and with the cost of school going higher and higher every year, its a smart choice."
College Junior,5,Affordable and opens many doors.
College Junior,5,"experience good so far, dedicated teachers"
College Sophomore,5,Same amount of work as regular classroom and same with interactions.
College Junior,5,"The career center is great, huge career fairs and networking preparation."
College Junior,5,There's a whole career building team to connect you with real jobs
College Junior,5,They now offer international business classes and the teacher gave us good candidates for transfers such as Eastern Michigan.
College Junior,5,Staff are easy to work with and are there to answer all questions. If they can't answer them themselves they'll find the answers for you somehow.
College Freshman,5,The best school to go to.
Sophomore,4,After Covid everything has become online and I'd say the professors adapted really well and have been in contact with all of us.
Freshman,4,"I work in the medical field, and recently got COVID-19. During recovery my professor were amazing to help me get work done, were understanding if i need a day. Also because I have a crazy sch. so doing classes online works amazing."
Junior,4,"Henry Ford College has helped me a lot with taking the basic courses of English to complete them before I get ahead in my educational path. I had the best opportunity and experience with many professors who have really helped me to improve my English, discover my passion and find myself. English courses also helped me to build friendship with amazing students who also were very nice and helpful with me. I decided to study in the medical field and work hard to reach my biggest dream I had, being a doctor, so I can help people in the future. Meanwhile, being a refugee was the first reason for me to work hard and do my best in my high school to get some opportunities and chances. Then, after achieving many accomplishments in high school, I have attended Henry Ford College and started my educational life in biology major. Eventually, I am in need to a lot of support and some scholarships to help me get through my career path and get into the best university to pursue my dream."
Junior,4,What I enjoyed about Henry Ford College was the Professors were all so kind and helpful and really wanted you to pass.
Freshman,4,I like how the professors at Henry Ford Community College put you before themselves they always make sure each student has mastered the concept of what is being taught. They take their time within everything they do also they treat all students equally regardless of who is smarter than the other .
Freshman,4,"i love the environment, i feel they should add more sports and activities. the curriculum is good and the professors really want to see you so good"
Graduate Student,4,Henry Ford College is a great college for students who are unsure as to what it is they want to do with their lives. Advisors here help you understand everything every step of the way.
Niche User,4,I like how diverse Henry Ford is. I think that there are some really good teachers and some that arent as good.
Freshman,4,"It is a cool school and it has been a blast, the campus is huge and the professors show so much about how our economy and state law is so much different when I was learning this stuff in high school, it really is different from what I had learned from all my years in high school."
Sophomore,4,"I have experienced Henry Ford college very well because it helped me to figure out what classes to take and start with. I also improved my language by taking English classes from different levels that the college offers. I see a lot of activities in the campus, and all students can join their activities. I also has special programs and great tutoring for students. Moreover, the staff are helpful as well as the professors."
Freshman,4,I'm still new to Henry Ford but so far so good. The professors are great and the campus is nice. Very excited!
Freshman,4,"I like the campus. The school communication should be better than what it is with the students. The school scenery is good. They have a beautiful campus. It’s never dirty or the grass is always cut. The vending machines and cafe has everything you need. The library has a study section and a quite section. It’s more than enough computers in the whole building. The security makes me feel safe always. It’s plenty of groups to join throughout the school. Being in college makes me look at a lot of things different now. I budget more,study more, and i pay attention to my surroundings"
Junior,4,"I loved this school because of its affordability and education program. It's an extremely diverse school, that is accepting of everyone. While I've struggled with their math classes, I loved their psychology and education program. When taking classes to become a high school teacher, I met the head of the program, who is my biggest inspiration. I've never had someone, let alone a professor, care about me and my success as much as she did. I hope to encourage my future students as much as she did me."
Sophomore,4,"Henry Ford college was definitely an amazing experience. In this ""small"" college,I had some downs, along with many ups. Henry Ford consists of a safe, and quiet environment. I've been there for almost three years and don't regret anything about it. Its teachers and students are mindful, considerate, and very helpful. I would definitely recommend going to it."
Freshman,4,"Henry Ford is a good community college. The professors teach well and truly care about the students. I have done three semesters and the atmosphere here is really relaxed. The facility is clean, and the library offers a good place for resources and to study. If you have any issues financially, the advisors and counselors are helpful and very caring. However, there aren't many clubs and social interaction for the students."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy that Henry Ford is like a very close community friendly environment. It’s a very diverse school, makes people feel wanted and important. Henry Ford offers great classes with really good instructors who actually care about the students. Their are many resources that henry ford offers the students such as free tutoring, free library use, free computer use."
Sophomore,4,"The problems with Henry Ford college is that the books are slightly expensive, the internet is very weak, parking lot is very small, and webadvisor (financial aid) service is horrible (slow in checking the documents and slow in returning to/ answering students . However, everything else is good: campus is safe, a clean environment, most of my instructors were very passionate about teaching and their food menu is very generic. Henry Ford College is very diverse: in terms of students and instructors. There have different/ variety of programs."
Freshman,4,"I like the diversity of Henry Ford College and all the opportunities provided to minors who otherwise would not find similar opportunities. I think the faculty is great, they have such helpful counselors, and all the teachers I've had have all been a huge impact to me in deciding on my major and career path. The campus is a very safe environment with many different clubs and outreach programs that every student can find themselves in."
Sophomore,4,So far I have had a good experience at Henry Ford Community College. All the teachers I have had has been very helpful and will answer any questions I have. The campus is always clean and the staff around the campus are also very friendly. I would recommend HFCC!
Sophomore,4,Henry Ford is a very good academic school with great programs to apply for. It is no longer a community college but professors do have tendencies of being late and being off track with grades.
Sophomore,4,"I am in my second year at Henry Ford College with a major in Biology. Henry Ford has a very diverse student body which allows for the opportunity to create new friendships and connections. The classrooms are average with about 25 students per class. Through each of my classes, i have made new friendships and many are within my major and have a similar goal. I have had a pretty good experience with Henry Ford College so far, hopefully my last year continues to stay true!"
Sophomore,4,"My experience at HFC has been great. I have learned a lot from my professors. They are professional, nice, and great instructors. The Financial Aid department can use some serious work as they are heavily disorganized. They are also rather rude and will waste your time while on the phone as they don't give you the information you need. It is best to deal with financial aid in person.  Other than that, I highly recommend this school for a proper education."
Sophomore,4,"A very friendly, welcoming, and diverse learning environment!  There are many different student leadership opportunities and community service outreach programs."
Sophomore,4,"The ASL department is great.  Very supportive instructors.  
HFC encourages participation in campus and community activities.  Each month they have a volunteer day with local organizations.

Like at most colleges, the adjunct instructor model affects quality of instruction and limits students' access to the instructors bc they do not have Office Hours.
The general ""advisor"" I saw before beginning classes did not have a background in Higher Ed, HR, or career/educational counseling.  Most of my questions were answered with, ""look on the website."""
Niche User,4,Henry Ford College is an amazing college that provides much more than it is let on. The professors are great at what they do and provide help to students to their utmosy academic ability.
Sophomore,4,What I liked about my college is that all professors care about their students and they are always willing to help.
Niche User,4,This college is a great start. For those who are looking for a back up plan. HFC offers great programs. You will be able to continue your education and have a good job at the same time.
Freshman,4,I like the fact that my teachers seem to have unique teaching styles.  I think that it’s also great that Henry Ford has different tutoring schedules and professor lab hours that can accomadate me.
Alum,4,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Henry Ford Community College. I love the small class sizes (under 25) and homely feel of the campus. The professors I had were easily accessible and were very kind. I felt very comfortable during my time there.
Niche User,4,I really love the atmosphere of the campus. The campus is diverse and there are many ways to receive help. The learning lab was very helpful for me in my bio 233 class. The tutors that were there were also very knowledgeable and helpful.
Freshman,4,"If you want a school with a lot of different programs, but not super expensive, this is the school for you. Tuition, on average, is about $3,400. Which, let me tell you, is a lot cheaper than major universities, and all of the programs, from cooking to nursing are all there. Campus is nice and beautiful and the professors are great. Check it out"
Sophomore,4,My experience has been overall pleasant. The nursing campus staff are wonderful and informative. Both nursing and main campuses are friendly and clean.
Sophomore,4,"Henry ford College is my first ever college experience. Although I have only taken four courses here thus far, I do have a few comments about it. Overall, it is a great college. Most of the staff are very helpful, and truly provide their students with the entire college experience. The only issue I would say with this college (and all of the others in Wayne county) is that most, if not all of the staff are highly uneducated on the matters of international/non-green card holding students. It would have been extremely helpful if there could be someone who can help and follow up with international students and students with unique cases to ensure that they are understanding their rights and opportunities as college students in a foreign country."
Sophomore,4,"I have a good experience with Henry Ford. The college offers free tutoring, free access to library and computers, free access to “bone room”. In my opinion there is plenty of help for students."
Sophomore,4,I would highly recommend Henry Ford if you’re looking to do something with music. The teachers in the music department are always ready to help you. The worst part is that the music department doesn’t get enough fining which is typical.
Sophomore,4,"This Community College Is a gem for the community. I started here because is one of the little group of colleges that offers ELI for international students. 
Teachers are really passionate and teach a lot."
Sophomore,4,"This is my first year at this college as I transferred from somewhere else. I can say that it is cheaper as far as schools I.D. and parking, which is free. So far my experience has been relatively better than my first year as academics go. I do platoon staying here for my associates and would recommend anyone for their prerequisites. I really just keep more to myself with school so I wouldn't know much about the campus life. Henry Ford does have a good tutoring system that is very accessible to students. As an overall experience would recommend this college to anyone."
Sophomore,4,Henry Ford College is a career oriented college located in Dearborn Michigan. The school's main focus is training and educating their students for success. There are several programs to chose from and easy to apply. They ofter financial aid and scholarships to help with tuition. I believe tuition could be less considering it is an associate degree. I am currently a sophomore in the nursing program.The teachers are great educators. They also strive  to be the best student advocates possible. They really want their students to be successful. Party life is not a priority at Henry Ford so parties do not exist. It is a challenging program that you must apply yourself and work hard if you want to graduate. The degrees at Henry Ford are earned not given. I would most definitely recommend this school to others if they are serious and determined to be successful.
Freshman,4,"I like how there're many resources and people that can help if you really need it . 
The campus is pretty clean and safe there's no bullying and hazing like other schools to join a group it's over all pretty chill."
Freshman,4,"It's a nice, safe campus. Repeated technical difficulties prevent some activities, but as far as I've seen the school is pretty good."
Freshman,4,"It is a very nice peaceful with amazing professors. I would like to other students getting a chance to be more interactive. Also adding new stuff to the library, more sleeping zones, and maybe even activities and help on finals day. The learning lab is really good and gives a lot of help."
Junior,4,"Henry Ford College is an outstanding school. It offers different programs for students. The professors are highly educated and they make sure the students understand the material, rather than just passing them. The school prepares their students for the programs they are about to enter. I've never had a problem with any of my instructors in this school, and I would highly recommend this school to anyone."
Sophomore,4,Being a Henry Ford College student has been a good experience so far. The staff is really helpful and are always looking to find ways to help you become your best self.
Niche User,4,I recently started at HFC last year and it overall is a great experience because most professors are really good because they come from other universities and you get a really good education. I would suggest to get this experience you should pick more of the harder teachers because they will challenge you the most.
Niche User,4,"I love the overall feel of the college. The teachers I had really cared about their job and educating students on the class there are in. For example, the psychology I took there the teacher really cared about that the students will learn the concepts. Overall, HFCC is a really good school to start off at when beginning your first years at college but after awhile the classes at HFCC will be too easy for the career you want to do."
Sophomore,4,"Henry ford is a good school with a lot to offer a student however their financial aid and records office is horrible because they are unorganized and somehow loses paper work . But its not really diverse because its in dearborn prodominatly black , caucasian , and Arabic or muslim students no other races but four. The parking and food is good sometimes but I would like to see the welcome center become more organized."
Junior,4,"I enjoy taking classes at henry ford, the professors are extremely reasonable and fair. I feel safe on campus and I haven’t had any issues regarding classes. They are very thorough regarding what programs they have. As for textbooks, they do make the cost more affordable as most professors give you a variety of options to choose from. They are organized, I feel as though each year they are improving more and more."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy HFC.  Many different programs to choose from.  Many teachers are very great and take the time necessary to help students.
Sophomore,4,"Henry Ford College is good 2-year institution to attend, it has great teachers who really care about there students and there list of programs you can choose from is great. When it's time for you to transfer they make the whole process easy for the student looking to transfer."
Sophomore,4,"I really like taking classes here because you feel so welcomed. The professors are super helpful, they really want you to succeed."
Freshman,4,"My experience was good, it was very close to home, i could go to work and go to class all in one day, i had free time, i excelled in all my studies. i was on the deans list twice, my first semester with a 3.5 gpa and my second with a 3.75 gpa."
Junior,4,"Some of the things that I like about Henry Ford Community College is that there is always something that a student can do on campus, the campus offers over 20 students clubs. The professor really care about their students and want to see them succeed. The college offers a immense amount of different majors for an individual to choose from. It is also right next door to the University of Michigan Dearborn which is awesome seeing as most students come to Henry Ford Community College to start out with general courses and then transfer to a University and what's better then having the option of choosing something that could be close to home and is right next door. I love HFC and all the wonderful people that I have met as well as all the things that I have learned throughout the years that I have been there."
Freshman,4,"Henry Ford is a nice small community college, with a few great teachers. The school offers a handful of things to each student including FREE tutoring. But at every college they have a bad side including the food, and people who do not come off as so friendly."
Graduate Student,4,"Overall, every encounter thus far with staff and students has been great. Nice, approachable and accommodating."
Freshman,4,The instructors there were very helpful. They made sure I understood the lesson before moving on. The campus is clean. There students there were extremely diverse. I got to know different cultural backgrounds from my classmates. There was mutual respect between the instructor and the students. The instructors try to teach the students real life lessons in real life situations. I felt cared for by my instructors in the sense that I felt they sincerely wanted me to succeed.
Sophomore,4,"I admire all the opportunities of getting help on any subject, fun activities, and the diversity at Henry Ford College. It is also surrounded by many delicious restaurants and shopping centers. This school is highly dedicated and supportive in all of our sports teams. GO HAWKS!!"
Freshman,4,"The school was great, even though I had one teacher I didn't particularly like. Everyone else was wonderful and helped me when I needed it. I felt like I was in a great learning and nurturing environment that made me feel very capable. All the classes that I have taken so far were very helpful and easy to understand. I do wish for some more challenging courses, but I am pretty sure the higher I go the more challenging it is going to be.  I am happy that they are bringing back the sports teams. At the same time I do wish they did not disband them when I had first arrived to the school; to be honest that is the main reason why I came to this school in the first place. Even so, I am still happy with my experience and the bonds I have made with my teachers. I can not wait to go back and continue my learning."
Niche User,4,"Henry Ford College has great experiences. For those that are still in high school, you can take classes for low prices, or if you are in the Dearborn Public Schools area, you can test into the Henry Ford Collegiate Academy and earn your associates degree with everything paid for; all for free! Wonderful opportunities for a low cost."
Freshman,4,"I started at HFC for the first time this Fall semester and so far, I love the school! All of my professors are wonderful and I have yet to have any bad expiriences with any students. The only thing that I can say is not that great is the way students drive around and to campus, but that is of no fault of the school itself. It's hard for me to really judge the school since I've only been attending for a few months, but as far as I can see, it is overall a great community college. "
Freshman,4,I like Henry ford community. The administration is very helpful if in need of assisting. I love the library it's a very nice place to study and is very quite. Tuition is the cheapest I've seen. 
Sophomore,2,The professors are not good they do not communicate well with students. The school is all about taking your money. 7000 students did not make SAP for financial aid that many people under a 2.0. that's a reflection of the the staff.
Freshman,2,"Very small. Seems a lot like an open campus high school. The buildings seemed to not have been maintenance in quite some time. The library is nice, but some of the other buildings need attention. The teachers are helpful but the atmosphere around the school was not good enough for me. Campus was extremely small. You will never walk further than 50 yards to go from one building to another. The parking was hectic as well as very loud obnoxious cars."
Freshman,2,Majority of instructors I had could come off as very nonchalant when it came down to teaching the class
Niche User,2,Overall I would not recommend Henry Ford Community College. It is filled largely with students who do not care about their education and professors who do not care about the students. Although there are plenty of students who excel and teachers that would bend over backwards for their students. My personal experience there was not very good.
College Junior,2,I haven't attended college yet
College Senior,2,HFC used to be a community college. It only just became a college and does not have that many options as career services.
College Senior,2,"The academics at HFC are pretty bad. There are some professors who are quite top notch, but then there are some counselors who are just the worst. They look at HFC as a part-time job and it's not very important."
College Freshman,2,I didnt recieve like anything kind of
College Senior,2,The college seem like its a big money bank. They find ways for student to  come out of pocket to pay for classes knowing that the student can't afford it.
College Junior,2,I had a lot of hoops to jump through to receive financial aid.  It seemed as if their was always one more paper to fill out.  In the end I did receive the aid that I needed.  I know now to start a lot earlier.
College Sophomore,2,The classes itself are ok. The financial aid administration is unorganized and act like they don't know whats going on.
College Senior,2,There is never a lot going on campus. There is the occasional play by the drama department and the Sisson Gallery is open for most of the year. The cafeteria is very limited and is expensive. There is a wide range of clubs to choose from but club activities are limited.
College Freshman,2,The computer network has had its problem. There is a bad signal within the school which is not a good thing
College Freshman,2,seems as though most student only come unroll their fatwa Pell grant refund check comes in. Then they disappears till the next semester. And the serious students don't get financial aid most of the time. Hurts to see the abuse.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There isn't much in the way of resources at Henry Ford compared to pricey four-year universities. But, for a thrifty student, there are usually underused course reserves to study from, a learning resource center for tutoring, and a small computer lab."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is a computer lab available for current students, but it is small and outdated. The computers are slow and printing costs 10c a page. Not terrible, as tuition is so cheap, but is nothing compared to the facilities at more pricey schools."
College Freshman,2,"It's not really all that great, it's a a very small campus. The material there is much easier than a University. The tution is great. But personally I like to participate in football games and normal college activities but this college doesn't have it. You just get an education."
College Junior,2,Parking Is Awful – they provide a shuttle bus from the mall nearby for overflow parking but the onsite parking is not good
College Junior,2,"My Experience at HFCC – My overall experience at school so far has been ok.  I really have enjoyed the classes I've taken, but there isn't a wide variety of choices.  I really enjoy the sciences, but when it comes to choosing a class like environmental science or maybe zoology they don't have them or its online which I don't care for. Even though the classes are listed in the book of classes they don't offer it.  Another thing they don't have are real sport classes like tennis, same thing it's in the book and they don't offer it. I would definately not choose this school again if I could do it all over again."
College Senior,2,"Saving Money – I am happy that I went here for my first years of college, but only because I am saving quite a bit of money compared to a University. If i had to go back and do it over though, I think I would rather go to a four year college instead, to gain a better college experience."
Sophomore,1,They advertise programs that they do not have. Advisors are clueless. Took 20 credits of classes I was assured would transfer and they do not. 2 years of college just to be a sophomore again. Mind you I took 59 credits here for barely 35 to transfer.  Teachers are mostly crap and do not care about students. Books are ridiculous - almost every class here had you buy a $300 book for online assignments that are glitchy and teachers are to lazy to care if there are any errors. Save yourself time and money and just go to a University.
Recent Alumnus,1,"FinAid has done nothing to help, tuition is high"
College Junior,1,"The financial aid department is the worst department.  They lose your information and ask you for it again.  They aren't very communicative as to what you need to send them.  So if you're missing something, they won't let you know about it, or even send you an e-mail, or regular mail.  You're on your own.  It almost turned me away from going there, but I stuck through it.  It was the worst experience I've ever had."
Recent Alumnus,1,The financial aide department at Henry Ford Community College is ridiculous in processing times even if you get months ahead of a jump. They make it a real headache. I have never had issues like this at any other school. 
College Senior,1,"The athletic choices are very limited, less than high school.  The new student center is nice, but not very organized and the faculty is very rude."
College Freshman,1,"The facilities on campus are horrible. All the counselors aren't helpful. The only plus side if the school is that it's cheap, and a lot of their credits transfer to other places."
College Student,1,"This Grade Is Not Exceptionable. A student does not want to waste time, or overload his/her school schedule. I    warn all students to not do this, because it is a waste of time and his/her financial aid. The government grant [(financial aid) also (a type of scholarship)] is now limited to a total of 12 full time semesters, so use it wisely. I'm in favor of the schools academic policy: learning environment, welcome center building which is in a separate building away from current students, the student shuttle bus. The only thing I would change at Henry Ford Community College is lower the cost to attend, otherwise I'm give it two thumbs up!"
College Junior,1,"Not Friendly – students at this school are not friendly at all. teachers don't care, and some don't have offices to help the students."
College Sophomore,1,"Long Lines – The financial add process is overwhelming. Being a new student i didn't know every thing that i need before i entered the line like many other students. But by the time i waited about 3 hours and it way my turn, i had to do it all over again after i got what i wasn't informed that i needed."
College Sophomore,1,"Poor Administrative Service – All of the schools that I am looking to transfer to will accept my credits from Henry Ford, the difficult part is getting in touch with records and registration to send the transcripts as well as seeing a counselor to offer any advice. I feel that I have been treated poorly multiple times by administrators (not including teachers), simply because I possibly asked a question that they deemed as dumb. Even though I am in my sophomore year now, there are always new things to learn about college such as filing for financial aid, transferring to other schools, and registering for classes, etc. I would appreciate it if these people took their jobs more seriously and offered the help and advice that they are being paid to offer. Otherwise they should replace them with one of the millions of Americans who are looking for jobs..."
College Freshman,1,The counselors at HFCC often mislead students in terms of transferring and proper class enrollment. Most students find themselves trying to meet with the department on campus in charge of their intended field. This is only to find out that the major the student wants to enter is ran by ONLY 1 person.
College Freshman,1,"Very Impersonal School – The counselors see you as a student number and not an actual person. It doesn't bother me much because I am independent anyway so I don't need much help planning my education, but if one did need help, this is not the place to go."

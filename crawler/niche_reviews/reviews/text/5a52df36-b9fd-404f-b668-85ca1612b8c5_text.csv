Alum,5,Online classes at Lackawanna College were very easy and the professors were very friendly. Highly recommended.
Sophomore,5,"From the moment I enrolled, all the people that I have connections with through the college and that I talked to from the time I first applied to now, a week after the end of my 2nd semester at school have kept in touch me with me and have been very supportive and helpful with making sure I am okay on both a personal and educational level. The classes have been easy up to this point and although I was lost at first, I now know my way around the buildings at the Scranton campus and I've even helped several people find their way. I have made several friends of different majors, ethnicities, religions, etc. and have even become great friends with several of my instructors or advisors. Overall, my experience at Lackawanna College has been the best experience of my life and I have made several connections and friendships that will last for the rest of my entire life."

All sports teams are phenomenal, especially football. There is a great diversity of people from all different races, religions and ethnicities. They have some of the best, if not the absolute BEST Academic programs in the entire NEPA."
Sophomore,5,"Lackawanna has small class sizes, and is in an easy location close to home. The library is right near the campus, and it offers a variety of on-line courses in addition to on campus. The staff in Financial Aid are great and easy to work with, as well as the other departments. And the teachers I've had so far have been great."

There are many activities for the students. Additionally, there are different free services that the school provides to help students with their career. The school is very clean and well maintained. There are different degrees offered and they are diverse, which is great for undeclared students. Overall, it is a great college!"
Sophomore,5,Lackawanna College is a great stepping stone for sure. The professors are all very hands on and really strive to see their students succeed in the classroom. Located conveniently in Downtown Scranton.
Freshman,5,I appreciate  the fact that teachers ensure you know and understand  the work. They also help you to finish a course if you feel like you don't have the ability  to. I like that they allow us to use the YMCA facilities.
Freshman,5,My experience at Lackawanna College has been amazing. I didn't think I would be as happy as I am once I started school there. The staff are really supporting and will help you with anything. You feel very comfortable there and it is an awesome school for great education.
Sophomore,5,"I was fortunate to do dual enrollment here during my high school years, and have a great start on getting my Associate degree by the time I graduate high school. It was a tremendous amount of work, but well worth my efforts! I am grateful to the administration at both my high school and Lackawanna College for supporting my unique and ambitious plan."
Freshman,5,"Great Staff , Very talented superiors . Great time of day and days are balance. Classes are wonderful to be in with such enthusiastic teachers."
Freshman,5,"As I just transferred from another school, I find Lackawanna very open and welcoming.  I find the environment and classrooms more comfortable for me.  I think the professors are more hands on and involved with each student."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Lackawanna College has been absolutely wonderful and, totally cliche, life changing, going to Lackawanna College has really changed me. The teachers are amazing, they are willing to help you one-on-one and they are one of a kind!! I have meet so many amazing people in my first year, I look forward to what the future holds there for me!!"
Freshman,5,First year is almost in the books and I have loved every minute of it. The professors go at an easy pace and all other students are very kind and courteous. Very polite. I canâ€™t wait until I come back in the fall!
Sophomore,5,I love the flexibility of mixing online and in class. This allows me to adjust my schooling to fit my family and work schedules each semester. The intersessions online allow me to get some extra credits in as well at a truly affordable price.
Alum,5,Lackawanna College has offered the best possible education that I feel I could ever get. Every experience I have with Lackawanna in the past years has left me nothing but satisfaction. I wish I could give Lackawanna college a 10 star rating!
Freshman,5,I look forward to going there. I start my freshman year this fall! I when for a visit I liked the environment it was quit and nice. I can't wait till I start going am so excited! I look forward to playing soccer for them!
College Senior,5,They are small so it's easier to learn
College Junior,5,"Lackawanna offer many times to take courses. Whether you like to get up early, sleep in late, or go at night, they have several times to choose from and building your schedule is easy. It is also good to schedule early because the favorite teachers tend to fill up fast."
College Junior,5,"Lackawanna College is a great school. It is located close to downtown Scranton which offers a lot to do. There are a large variety of majors and courses. The class styles are mainly lecture based but many teachers also mix in group conversation and projects. Class sizes are very small only 20-30 students per class. The teachers will get to know you or at least know who you are and your name. You are not just a number. There are a mixed variety of students from younger to older. The student body is very athletic based and there are many artsy and ""geeky"" as this survey words it, students as well. It is comparably a lower priced school for quality higher education. I love Lackawanna. I wish they had a Spanish Education program so I can stay longer and not have to transfer."
College Junior,5,"Lackawanna College is a great school and the reputation is only getting better. The teachers and study body are very friendly. The class sizes are small. You are not just a number, the teachers will get to know your name as well as who you are as a person. The staff has many little events especially during finals week, where they give away free food and drinks to show appreciation to their students. Many planned special events such as dances and karaoke are planned, but have little attendance. The staff is always trying to figure out what their students will be interested in planning. Lackawanna has many clubs that will get you involved in your community and will look good on your future college resumes. The school is also right in the middle of Scranton so you can walk with friends to the little shops, restaurants, and cafes on your breaks. I have done very well here academically and have made many friends. I think Lackawanna is a great choice for a lower priced school that has quality education. It is a good starter college  before you may transfer to a larger 4 year university."
College Freshman,5,my class schedule was the best.
College Freshman,5,"its so close to home its not a long commute, saves me a lot of money.  The teachers not only care about just your work but also you"
College Freshman,5,"the class sizes are small, the teachers are fantastic.  there is a great variety of courses"
College Freshman,5,"i love it, the teachers are great, and will help you as much as you need"
College Senior,5,"Andy & Emy are the best advisors anyone could ask for. They are extremely down to earth, helpful and respectful. I can't imagine having another set of advisors. They are simply the best. I would recommend them to any & everyone."
College Senior,5,"Although the school gets a bad reputation for its students, it actually has the best & most friendly student body."
College Senior,5,"A lot of papers, but teacher give plenty of time."
College Senior,5,The Comm. Arts major is the best part of the school
College Senior,5,The faculty is extremely kind and helpful.
College Junior,5,This is only a two year school so this school is known to be more of a stepping stone for students but it is awesome because they have setup programs with other schools around the country to guarantee success wherever your looking to advance to.
College Junior,5,I believe our Sonography program is one of the best in the entire state. Very good passing rate and excellent faculty.
College Senior,5,Huge variety of students from young to old.
College Senior,5,Computers work great and are easy to use.
Alum,4,"I went to Lackawanna College in 2006 and lived there. I had a good experience, the teachers were fantastic, athletics were endless, but the job opportunities were lacking. I am starting again this year in Nursing and I'm very excited."
Freshman,4,I love the small classes at Lackawanna College. The tuition is low which is great! No one has to worry about putting them self's into a lot of debt. Lackawanna is in a great location in downtown Scranton.
Niche User,4,"Love the atmosphere! So many great ways to get involved on campus. All the professors are there to see you succeed and will help you in anyway they can. Definitely recommend Lackawanna to anyone looking for a quality, inexpensive school."
Freshman,4,"I go to the Sunbury Center of Lackawanna College; it's affordable, the professors are kind and helpful. The director and enrollment specialist are extremely helpful! The learning environment is perfect for anyone who loves an almost one on one experience."
Freshman,4,"The staff at this school truly make you feel like they want you to be there. The supervisors make you feel like you're already family. The second I walked into the facility, I was greeted with nothing but smiles and friendly attitudes."
Freshman,4,The people at Lackawanna are very accepting and understanding. Everyone has great intentions and for the most part the campus life is something other freshmen can look forward to.
Freshman,4,I like that there are many satellite campuses to connect all prospective students to get an affordable education and further them selves in life!
Sophomore,4,Lackawanna College is a very good school in my opinion in both academics and athletics. Something that is not so great about Lackawanna College would be the food and the strictness of the school. It is honestly as if we are in a small prison. You can't do anything at Lackawanna without being in trouble for it.
Junior,4,"Love this school. Its small and you get to know your teachers, there is a culinary school so you always eat good. The architecture is really nice, its a very old building and its stunning. Easy to park and also easy to communicate with the staff. The only negative is I wish they offered more courses,"
Freshman,4,"Lackawanna college provides Good education for all students. It has very educated professors who are flexible at their works.
However the environment is very clean and"
Freshman,4,"great school to attend, great staff and excellent selection on courses. i would recommend lackawanna college to anyone!"
Niche User,4,"Lackawanna College is a small college witch works out great for students that would not like a big campus. Most classes have about ten students, you can feel comfortable to ask any questions and have one on one discussions with your professor. The professors are very committed to their jobs and have a lot to offer to students when it comes to expanding their learning."
College Junior,4,"I am not  an alumni of Lackawanna College, but I do know that they offer many local job and internship opportunities to their students."
College Junior,4,"Academics at Lackawanna are great. Some mandatory classes that are part of the Liberal Arts program can feel repetitive to high school, but it is only in some courses. Although from those courses, I have also learned many new things I never knew before. The classes are small and it is hard to fall behind as long as you attend class and complete your assignments."
College Sophomore,4,"I wish I could've been informed that my financial aid didn't cover all of my books, I caught by surprise on my first day of school that I didn't have the money."
College Freshman,4,"since i go to the towanda branch, it is very small, the classes are small. i like it that way"
College Senior,4,FASFA gave me just enough for books.
College Senior,4,"A teacher screwed up my final grade, still cool."
College Senior,4,Library is small but everyone is very helpful. Student center was still in the process of building when I attended. A few campus activities but not that many.
College Junior,4,"I start in the fall so I'm unsure if the tution is worth what they are selling for, the commutter student pays about $13,000 a year but a doorm student will pay $21,000 a year which I think is pretty high I think it should be around $18,000 or 19,000. The finanial aid office is what made my experience awesome because they sat down with me and gave me my estimated amount right there."
College Junior,4,I start in the fall but the classed are 15-30 so that student get one on one time with your professor.
College Junior,4,I got excepted that day because they worked with me to taking placement testing and financial aid in one day. Haven't transferred credits yet but they already have agreements set up colleges to transfer credits.
College Junior,4,People come from less forutant areas to get a education for a more affordable price.
College Junior,4,I have meet only two people there and they made me feel so welcomed that's when I knew I was making the right desion but I need and extra 3000 dollars to attend.
College Junior,4,"The only reason I say this is because I haven taken a course myself, I have spoke with a teacher that teaches online courses and was willing to give me right after I was excepted into the college."
College Senior,4,I love the Football programs and the professors are willing to work with you the whole way through
College Senior,4,A great college  where there arent any distractions and you focus on your work.
College Junior,4,The classes are challenging but not impossible and again very good faculty. 
College Junior,4,They were very helpful and guided me down the right path.
College Junior,4,They have some programs that are not offered anywhere else in the immediate area. They are one of the few that have Sonography and other ultrasound degrees.
College Junior,4,They stay devoted to making sure all the students get the information about continuing education.
College Junior,4,The program I am involved in and the teachers I have are very nice and show interest in the success of their students. Only thing I wish was that there were more scholarship opportunities to those students (Like myself) that achieved high GPA's and are involved in extracurricular activities.  
College Junior,4,The teacher I had for my computer class was very involved with the class and demanded the same from the students. This helped keep everyone focused and on track. I definitely learned a lot from the course.
College Senior,4,Tution is a little high but that's to be expected for a medical degree and the financial aid worker were a great help.
College Senior,4,Not very many choices since it's a 2 year school but they do offer great specialized programs like the police academy and paramedic program.
College Senior,4,For paramedic there is a lot of out of class work to do which becomes tough at times but professors will work with you if you need help.
College Senior,4,I love the college all the professors are great to be around and extremly friendly.
College Senior,4,For the size of the school they have a lot to offer.
College Junior,4,"The remodel student lounge is comfortable, you can hangout between classes, meet up with classmates or even just catch up on your work."
College Senior,4,"I cant compare lackawanna to another school being that i havent attended another college.  The school has many extra cir. activities as in sports, and other programs they hold for the students."
Freshman,2,"I went into the ultrasound program and they really remind you that you must attain an 82 exact or higher in each medical class or they kick you out of their program. I maintained an 3.8 GPA throughout the first year but when the finals came down, it counted as 50% of your grade. I had an 80% in one class because I did poor in one final and of course I was kicked out of the program. It really sucked because they make you purchase scrubs, a lab coat with their school name, and this background check things all costing around an additional $300 or so. I wish they would not make you waste your money, especially not being assured that you are going to make it in or not. As for living in the dorms, it doesn't matter if its weekdays or weekends, there would always be noise that wouldn't stop until 2-3 a.m."
College Senior,2,Didn't learn anything all they want is money
College Junior,2,"To be perfectly honest, the diversity at the school is opposite of what most schools have. At my school there are more student athletes than academically encouraged students besides my program."
College Senior,2,Not much to the facilities just a basic basketball court is all there is.
College Junior,2,"Wifi is all over the building but very slow, and the printers tend to jam."
College Sophomore,2,Few and Far in Between â€“ We do not have our own athletic facilities which makes getting to practice just another commute. We do have a library and a small student union.
College Sophomore,2,"""Lack"" of Knowledge â€“ This far I have not had a very good experience here. The sports programs are great, other than this there has been few pros. I have encountered two professors that really did a great job, most of the others were very sub par."
College Sophomore,2,"Life Science â€“ I started the life science degree at the lake region center, but come 2013, I have to finish it at the scranton branch. So far, there is no issue, the workload is not bad, the fact that I cannot finish my degree where I started it is highly annoying."
College Sophomore,2,I'm not really sure what to explain. I didn't transfer any credits.
Sophomore,1,"Lackawanna College is a very small school. The community of people are very close but everyone here is very obnoxious and loud and can care less about their academics. There's a large amount of ""jocks"" and stuck up poor kids."
College Senior,1,This school lacks SO much. ha Lack-awanna College
College Senior,1,"My major was the best. We learned so much from our teachers and they made sure we would excel at everything we would do. As far as the school as a whole, it's so bad. The SOME of the students are disgusting. They trash the men's bathroom and throw p*ss & sh*t around on the walls and toilets. The cafeteria's food is like generic McDonalds. It's dry and looks unappealing. The school organizes events like bowling, dances and games nights that NO ONE goes to. The events have gotten to the point where it makes the college look horrible. I don't understand why they would make an event and NEVER promote it. The school needs event coordinators who are young and know what a young student is into. I am embarrassed to be a student at this college."
College Senior,1,Online sucks. Students are stressed and over-worked
College Senior,1,satellite campuses not involved in main
College Freshman,1,"Wifi is a hassle, you have to sign on to the network very often"

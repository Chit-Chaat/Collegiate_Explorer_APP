Sophomore,5,"LEC is the best. I have been here for two semesters now, and I continue to stay because of the staff, the students, and of course the wide range of courses available. I am a psychology major and an equine studies major and I have been able to take courses in things like gender roles, communication and even accounting to really sharpen my skills and let me decide what I want to do. And I get to ride horses! How cool is that!"
Sophomore,5,"With the CoronaVirus, all courses were switched to online courses. So far I have done great with it. Some professors are better than others at communicating and helping us through the course. Last semester was the best semester I have had."
Senior,5,They have transitioned to an online environment without losing any of the value provided by in class meeting.
Niche User,5,I did my college visit in November during the first snow fall this school year and absolutely fell in love with the campus and the people. They are all so kind and I can't wait to play softball for them.
Graduate Student,5,The College was nice and small. The professors leave their doors open and are very helpful when needed. The students are very nice it is enjoyable meeting them at school everyday. The school is very dedicated to sports and almost everybody plays sports. If you are not going to college and playing sports I think it will be harder to go to Lake Erie College get the full college experience. I do not recommend Lake Erie College for people who are there just for an education.
Freshman,5,My peers at Lake Erie are very helpful and nice. They make you feel right at home. I  like the fact that this is a small college you are able to have more one on one time with your professors. The staff are helpful with me transitioning from high school to college and also being 12 hours away from home. I would recommend going to this college.
Alum,5,"I was well-prepared here,  supported by staff and faculty - whenever I needed detailed feedback or guidance, they were immediately available and eager to help. If you want to start a project, do research, get internships, or help out in the community, you have to have some initiative but it pays off. I got a really cool internship through the career services and completed a fulfilling work-study.

I took classes and electives in several departments outside my major, including education, communication and psychology, and I gained a lot of practical knowledge. Professors are intelligent, funny, and made learning feel less like work. Definitely recommend the senior capstone project required by several majors because it gives you the research and writing skills needed to do a master's thesis project closely supervised by faculty.

Student body is quiet but has a lot of neat interests and passions. The college could do more to bring that out, but there's a lot of potential."
Niche User,5,"I want on a visit with my school. The tour was nice! I oved how the tour guide actually explained everything on the visit. We saw almost everything. I fell in love with the café. The food was sooo GOOD. If I had to guess, I gained about 4 pounds that day. The dorms were a nice and were well spaced. I enjoy looking that gyms as well. Overall the visit was nice, I wouldn't mind visiting again."
Sophomore,5,I am very pleased with my experience at Lake Erie thus far. I find their Legal major and Criminal Justice major very fulfilling.
Junior,5,I like the size of the campus. Class sizes are small. Good interaction with professors  I feel comfortable. I wish the campus apartments had more parking spots for residents. There needs to be assigned spots so there's a spot for students.
Freshman,5,The campus is great and very clean. The teachers care about their students' success and are willing to take time to help the students that need help and will make sure that all of their students understand all of the information.
College Junior,5,"There are so many too choose, it just depends on what you like."
College Junior,5,There are great restraints near by. A mall close. Bowling and roller skating too.  Everyone is so friendly and always encourage and help others out. Like for example there was a bad snow storm and students were stuck in the parking lot and helped each other push them out of the snow to get home safe.
College Sophomore,5,There is a shuttle to and from the equestrian center which is awesome!
College Sophomore,5,Everyone here is basically on an athletic scholarship.
College Sophomore,5,"24 Hour Security, they are always around if needed and will help in any way. There is an on campus medical staff as well"
College Sophomore,5,"Great opportunities and advertising, however I prefer to live on campus"
College Sophomore,5,I hardley ever see people using drugs on campus
College Junior,5,I feel very safe on campus and campus police are there anytime if needed.
College Junior,5,Love all my classes and professors. Lots of major opportunities.
Senior,4,"The physical school is wonderful. College hall, the library and the novelty bunker are all wonderful historical sights that create an atmosphere of learning. There are a few educators on campus that show such prowess and understanding for their fields that can make the classes actually enjoyable. 
Where it falls short is the student culture on campus. The administration focuses on small tweaks to existing structures to claim repair to student issue. I don't feel that there is a genuine sense of community on campus anywhere outside of the sports teams, and those being subject to more forces than neat carpet splotches."
Senior,4,"I love the close-knit culture of Lake Erie College, and I think their education program is amazing in preparing students for the education field. I wish Lake Erie had more facilities/better facilities, such as the gym."
Freshman,4,"Lake Erie college is a small campus. Therefore, everyone pretty much knows each other. Also, the small campus means that you can walk everywhere without needing to take a car to the other side of campus."
Sophomore,4,I came to Lake Erie College for the equestrian program. Their program is incredible; it truly prepares you to go out and have a career in the equine industry.
Freshman,4,i love it it. I have been here for a week and it has by far been the best experience of my life. i am excited to start the work in my classes cause i know it will grove me into a better and well thought out person. the teachers here keep me interested in their lectures and even more intruded  in the work they give us. i can not wait to experience these next four years.
Freshman,4,My experience at Lake Erie College has been a good I have met some really good people who I have became friends with in my short 4 months here ... Also the classroom atmosphere here is very great because teachers know you personally with such small class sizes and another reason is that you get way more individual attention from the teachers.
College Senior,4,"security is always around, if you lose something, they will email all students instantly of lost items"
College Senior,4,football team could be better but lacrosse is the top sport
College Senior,4,lip sync battle is the best
College Senior,4,"The few amazing professors I have had at Lake Erie make up for the other less than friendly, cold professors."
College Senior,4,I wish Lake Erie gave scholarships for the athletes in the equine program instead of sports like football. The equine program has top athletes who actually have to pay to participate in their sport where the football team gets scholarships and great opportunities and has less than desired performance on the field.
College Freshman,4,i feel safe all the time
College Junior,4,Lake Erie is a great school with such a beautiful campus.
College Junior,4,"My experience as a transfer student was quick, easy and painless. The transfer advisor  was always available to answer questions and allay fears, and made sure that I knew at all times what was needed. My advisor for my major made sure to meet with me before I even registered. Professors keep in touch with students about opportunities and how they are doing in class. And you meet with your advisor before registering for classes each semester to make sure you're on the right track."
College Junior,4,We are typical and agree on most subjects. Lounge wear and also stylish for interviews or presentations.
College Junior,4,Our school is not too strict. More lenient.
College Junior,4,Lots of sports to choose from. Lots of school spirit! Go Storm!
College Sophomore,4,"I love my apartment, did not like the dorm rooms however."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is strict, but understandable for everyones safety"
College Sophomore,4,I love the city and everything in the city
College Junior,4,Everyone is friendly with others and everyone get along great.
College Freshman,4,"they give you a good work load, have great study sessions before tests and offer help at all times throughout the day."
College Freshman,4,The classes are great and challenging. The facilities are nice and they admins help a lot with internships.
College Freshman,4,The food is good. The dining hall is great when it comes to variety. Our flex dollars can be used in our bookstore in the café next to the dining hall.
College Freshman,4,Prices are good for the area they are located. Parking is not an issue and school owned apartments are within 5 minutes walking distance of campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Very social, could be cleaner, an overall positive environment though."
College Sophomore,4,Its a relatively small and newer program. I've learned a lot so far and I look forward to learning more.
College Sophomore,4,"I do like it, just not sure yet if its the right fit for me."
College Sophomore,4,I haven't had an internship yet but I hear they're great. I plan on having one eventually.
College Sophomore,4,There are many international students.
College Sophomore,4,"Good food, not too many healthy options though."
College Sophomore,4,I have never lived off campus so I wouldn't know.
College Sophomore,4,Just drive a few minutes down the road and you'll find every chain restaurant you can possibly think of.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus life is great but could be better. There are many events, some well attended, others not so much. "
College Sophomore,4,"The computer labs at Lake Erie College are open 24/7. Which during finial times everyone takes advantage of. We have four different labs on our little campus; one in the library, one in our student life building, one in the academic learning center, and then a Mac lab in the arts building. The computers are all up to date with the latest technology and are never slow.
Although if you want to keep the fast connection, it is recommended to not use the laptops in the dorm rooms because, the connection is awful. It's like they don't want me to do my research in my room so I can finish my papers."
College Sophomore,4,"At Lake Erie College the Boy to Girl Ratio is about 7:3. The amount of men at the school is so much larger compared to girls for the fact that we are a sports affiliated school. The men come in all shapes and sizes but all for the most part very attractive. When you only have 1,300 students at your school they all have to be attractive; White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, Farm boys, City boys, the Bro, and so much more. Now for the women, they are all polite, athletic, smart, and of curse good looking. The girls are also very sports related or equestrian affiliated, so many of the girls are tall, fit, and incredibly attractive."
College Sophomore,4,"The variety of meals served at school is great. There is rarely any meal where i can not find anything that I like, and i am a picky eater so that is saying a lot. And off campus there are many places to choose from for a variety of food."
College Freshman,4,There really isn't much crimes except virtual stalking
College Freshman,4,More mature than high school.. Everyone dresses the way they want without judgement
College Freshman,4,Parking does not cost anything and rarely are tickets given out. You really dont nee a car on campus unless you have a job off campus.
Freshman,2,"The teachers were very helpful and understanding, but the college life and the overall experience with my time there was not up to par with my expectations."
Freshman,2,"I liked the small classroom environment, but I would like to see the school more structured when it comes to the Academic Learning Center."
College Freshman,2,teams are not really good
College Freshman,2,"Most of the dorms are very old and unappealing. Last year, the heater in my room didn't work and i reported it, but no one ever came to fix it, so i froze all winter. Also, it's entirely too expensive to attend if your parents aren't ""made of money"" or you're an athlete. Food it terrible and makes everyone sick!"
College Freshman,2,I would not want to go back. I want to go to a bigger school that has a more known sports team that I could play baseball for.
College Freshman,2,Student centers and athletic centers aren't the best. Can use some more money towards them.
College Freshman,2,"It is a small town about 3o minutes from Cleveland, Ohio. Not too much to do off campus."
College Freshman,2,the school does not provide rides unless there is a school related function at the Presidents house.
College Junior,2,"the main computer labs are all very old and very slow. not a large variety of things you can do with the computers, and the network is often down or malfunctioning. the labs through campus usually very loud, and crowded, a lot of people use them as hangout and for social sites like Facebook. printers are plain black and white, and also commonly malfunctioning. campus does wireless for students with their own computers, but the network is slow. the computers in the fine arts dept, mainly digital media classes are good. one lab is specifically for digital media, all mac computers with dual monitors. these computers are however only available to students currently enrolled in a media class, photography, video ect. good computers, but still on the slow old network."
College Junior,2,"Not Very Big – only one sorority and one fraternity on campus. they aren't a huge part of lec, but still there. neither fraternity nor sorority have Greek housing. events are held often, but nothing spectacular. no one is judgmental towards those not in Greek life, and they are not very selective in who can join which makes that atmosphere friendly."
College Senior,2,"Not Enough for Academics – This current regime of administrators at Lake Erie are very sports-minded and have not funded much in the way of scholarships for some of their better students academically. This has led to a mass exodus of those looking to get a quality education for a reasonable price. There still is a great study abroad program, which gives money handily to any student who wishes to study in another country."
College Freshman,2,"Leave With Your Tummy Grumbling – The dining hall at Lake Erie is small, is rarely open, and serves not-so-appetizing meals. Whenever sports practices are out, the dining hall is filled almost to the max and it becomes a challenge to find a seat. In addition to this hassle, you then have to put on a pity face in order to be served more than four ravioli from the servers. When at last you are seated with you meal, however, it is most often to be less than satisfied: runny pasta, undercooked potatoes, and spicy mac-and-cheese are among the items on the menu. I would also add that if you have any dietary issue or are vegetarian or vegan, DO NOT COME TO LAKE ERIE unless you want to survive on the salad bar."
College Senior,2,"Mom, I'm Hungry – The cafeteria staff is wonderful and truly strives to get to know each student, but the food isn't exactly that appeasing. Seating at Lake Erie College is much like parking...no exsistent."
College Senior,2,"Hear the Thunder, Feel the Storm – The security department strives to maintain a safe overall campus. While the campus is small and structured, the surrounding city can be slighty unwelcoming in the early hours of the morning. There are accessible resources if a students needs a councelor or a teacher to speak with for aid. As far as staying healthy is concerned, this is NE Ohio, so a cold lasting for 2+ months is typical."
College Sophomore,2,The school food is alright . We are being fed but the quality of the food and the repetitiveness is what bothers me the most. We pay 40 grand a year to go to school there the least they can do is offer better dining services and the halls are not even open all day . As a student athlete I get hungry at 8pm and at that time the cafe is close so I am forced to eat the horrible fast food/
College Freshman,2,Cost is to high to go here considering our campus isn't really up to date and nice.Housing and parking is terrible the apartments are run down. although we don't have very many student it's great for one on one time with your professors
Recent Alumnus,2,"Small College Dining – For being a smaller college, the food is pretty tasty. However it is very expensive and slightly repetitive."
Recent Alumnus,2,Lec Library – The libraries/student study centers are pretty small and are usually crowded.
College Senior,1,"Being that there is only one sorority and one fraternity, Lake Erie's greek life leaves a lot to be desired."
College Freshman,1,"At the few parties I've been to, everyone just stands around and drinks, so they're not very fun. Staying in for a movie night is more entertaining."
College Freshman,1,Most of the workers are cranky all the time and complain when people ask for more food. I got food poisoning multiple times and had to go to the emergency room after eating food there.
College Junior,1,Do not think we have Greek Life.
College Sophomore,1,"Being right on the lake makes the winter season pretty crappy. Lake Erie College is located in the snow belt so we receive lots of snow! Which tends to make walking to class very cold and dangerous. Walking up the slippery slops of snow and ice and can hard with a heavy book bag on your back. If it's not snowing it's raining or some other means of precipitation. At the beginning and very end of the school year though, it is beautiful. So green and full of life outside, everyone is on the recreation field having fun and playing games, which gives it a welcoming and homey atmosphere."
College Sophomore,1,Its Awful. Its Rare To Get A Parking Spot Twice Unless You Only Move Your Car After 10:00 I Dislike It. Need More Parking.
College Junior,1,"professors nice, but show favoritism. curriculum in some areas out dated and needs re structuring. registration is not on the best system available, as class times very often conflict making it hard to take the courses you want and or need. class sizes are small which is nice but, also an issue because not a lot of sections are offered, making classes fill up and close quick. independent study's or independent investigations are almost impossible to get, so if you cant take a class due to a time conflict you most ties must wait another year and try again. some classes also only offered every other year, so if the class fills up and you cant get and independent study, but the class is a pre requisite for another class needed to graduate......what do you do? you get set back and graduating on time can be difficult. computer labs and library also not very good for learning, not very good technology or up to date resources, often crowded and loud, filled with people who are using the labs as hang outs and computers for social networking sites like Facebook."
College Junior,1,"Favoritism, and Focus Pointed in the Wrong Direction. i have found that every one there will give you the run around when you ask questions and need help. teachers and administrators show favoritism and are not very welcome to alternative lifestyles or appearances. if your not in the ""in crowd"" not only does it show with students, but with teachers and administrators also. lec is not very accommodating with schedules and classes needed for graduation, class times conflict a lot, and often only offered every other year, making staying on track difficult. there aren't really and online course options, and independent study's are almost impossible to get, unless you are a teacher or administrators ""favorite"" the class rooms are not equal in technology, some very old and plain...old desk, small chalk boards and projectors, while some are new and up to date with white boards tables projectors and computers. also very difficult to find internships. lately there it seems as everything has taken a back seat to sports programs and events, including financial aid. a lot of time and money has been spent on recruiting athletes and coaches and everything else set aside. student athletes are also noticeably favored."
College Sophomore,1,None Existant – there is really only one college frat on campus and one sorority.And they really don't host events. They are secretive and secluded and not very appealing.
College Senior,1,Not Worth the Money – A private 33k +  school that is no better than a community college

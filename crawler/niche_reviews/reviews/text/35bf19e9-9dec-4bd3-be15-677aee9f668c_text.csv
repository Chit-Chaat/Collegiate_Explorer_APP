Alum,5,I took a few online classes while at UNO. I would say that they were of the same quality as the classes I took in person. The teachers were very helpful.
Alum,5,"I truly enjoyed my experience at UNO. I majored in English. The classes were challenging, the professors were available for assistance, and my fellow students were a source of inspiration."
Freshman,5,Very helpful and accepting students from around the world. Financial aid office replies quick and they have been very helpful during COVID-19
Alum,5,"I did not take any online classes, however I did have online homework. I hate online homework through no fault of my professors. They were forced by the university to make us learn on these platforms."
Sophomore,5,My online experience was very smooth. Each professor tried their best in order for all students to be able to learn and pass the course.
Sophomore,5,I loved the teachers there. All the professors were really helpful. The administration made the college process easy.
Freshman,5,At UNO I like that the classes are grouped together in certain buildings so you aren’t running across campus for every single class. The grounds are spacious and clean. The school pride is addicting and the peers are helpful when needed. The cost of tuition is not as high as some community colleges. Being emerged in the college life is easy and stress free when going to UNO.
Freshman,5,It is a very beautiful school. The classrooms are very small and you can still function. its a very quiet school but when there are events the school comes out  and shows pride.
Junior,5,"The University of New Orleans is a great school! All of the faculty and staff are very helpful and lend a helping hand at any giving moment. The university's resources are extremely helpful and convenient. The library is open 24 hours for students, which is a huge help, especially during finals. The campus is always clean and the food there is great also. I love UNO & I would encourage anyone who ask me about college to go to UNO. I would recommend UNO to anyone and everyone, always! UNO PROUD! Go Privateers!"
Senior,5,This campus is great for students that wanted to be in a school in where the professors are really interested in your academics. Science majors have a lot of research opportunity. I’m a chemistry major and is being a great journey for me.
Junior,5,Professors are amazing! I haven’t had a professor who I couldn’t access to make the most out of my class and grade. Also gain a few references. School has some good events. Population is diverse and there’s a student org for almost every type of student. Student body could be more active.
Graduate Student,5,"Absolutely love it. They have the best environment and most diversity i’ve ever seen. No school i’ve visited compares to UNO. Every teacher, faculty, or staff you meet will be so kind and welcoming. Many of the people who work or attended uno became family over the 4 years."
Freshman,5,so far the experience has been really good. I love the campus and people around it. the professors are really good and helpful. Always be respectful to others and you'll do good.
Freshman,5,"I love it here at UNO! All of the students and faculty are nice, the food is good, and the classes are not too hard, but you still learn a lot."
Junior,5,"Very diverse community, helps make you feel welcomed no matter where you come from. Many different activities for many different students."
Freshman,5,Loved the atmosphere and felt very welcomed at the campus!! The campus is a comfortable place and the sports are good!
Junior,5,I like the size of the campus. The University of New Orleans makes me feel welcomed and has a wide range of students that you can learn from. The teachers are very helpful and want to help you succeed. The University could benefit from having the cafeteria opened longer and upgrading some of the buildings because some are outdated.
Sophomore,5,"UNO is progressively increasing in it's graduation rate. It's academics are challenging, yet do-able. The faculty and staff, as well as the students are very friendly and encouraging. At first, my initial plan was to achieve in getting my associates and transferring. But now, I will graduate with my Bachelor's here at UNO. 10/10 highly recommend attending."
Junior,5,The campus is amazing! It’s not too big and not too small. The professors are extremely helpful when you need it and provide that one on one time available when asked for it.
Junior,5,So far my experience at the University of New Orleans has been very insightful. I have gained a lot of experience working on campus and can't wait to graduate soon.
Senior,5,The university of new orleans is a great location by the lake in the best city of the U.S. The professors are all top quality and you will make valuable connections.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love the culture and feel of New Orleans- being an English major, this is hands down the best place to gather material for writing. I love this city and this college. The teachers care, and it has a small liberal arts college vibe without being a small liberal arts school."
Sophomore,5,"My freshman year was such a great year for myself. I was really nervous about starting college, but I found it so easy to make friends and create unforgettable experiences. I even made quite the name for myself there which I am really happy about. It's a great environment and so many great people there to help you."
Senior,5,UNO has done a complete 180 in the past 3 years and is now an amazing university in one of the best city’s in the world. All my friends from all over the country constantly come to visit and you can never run out of things to do. Medium size school in a big city is the best way to go.
Freshman,5,UNO is a university small enough to be personable with your professors and big enough to have the recourses of the bigger D1 colleges in the area.  Love it here
Junior,5,The University of New Orleans is a tremendous university to attend. As a Business Administration student and taking courses through the UNO College of Business Administration allows each student to take courses with a group of highly professional and intelligent staff of professors.
Junior,5,"What I like most about UNO is the extremely diverse group of people. I wouldn’t change anything about UNO, I’ve had a good experience so far."
Freshman,5,"My experience at University of New Orleans was amazing! The campus is very diverse and friendly. I made friends with 6 people in an instant at my first orientation. Walking around on the grounds of the university made me feel like I was in a better environment. Advisors stay on top of you so you can be successful and majority of the classrooms are small, which will help you focus and not get distracted. The only thing that I would change or add as I would say, is to include a football team at the university, because I love football."
Senior,5,"This is a great school! I am a 100% online student and the organization, school systems, and academic classroom functions are incredible!  I've had experience with other institutions and they could not compare.  I would like to see more scholarship opportunities within my particular degree program (Interdisciplinary) however, overall I totally recommend this university to anyone in the area or who would like to attend online."
Sophomore,5,The University of New Orleans is an excellent place to explore and learn. The professors and others that work there are always friendly and help you out with what they can!
Sophomore,5,The University of New Orleans is a very diverse college fit for any student from any background. The campus is beautiful as much as it is safe. There is so many different cultural organizations and activities that goes on year round. I love it!
Graduate Student,5,I transferred here from LSU and my experience has been nothing but amazing. Especially working on campus and getting involved has given me numerous opportunities I never thought I would have.
Freshman,5,"The school is very diverse in its culture, clubs, and food. The campus is huge and its full of fun and exciting things to do everyday. The professors are very well educated and are helpful. They are willing to give help and receive criticism."
Sophomore,5,"University of New Orleans is a welcoming and friendly place. You will be appreciated from the first day you walk in, to the last. I am so happy I chose this school. They give me the option to stay her for my masters in education and not have to transfer to the other school. The professors are amazing and truly care about each one of us. I am so glad University of New Orleans takes pride in their students and want all of them to succeed."
Senior,5,I love the University of New Orleans. I have received an amazing education and could not be more thankful. They have so many things to do inside and outside of the classroom. Affordable and cheap.
Sophomore,5,UNO is probably one of the best universities in USA. It's one of the most diverse universities in USA.
Alum,5,Great school and great value.  I spent 7 years at the school earning both undergraduate and graduate degrees.  Over the years I look back and realized while the school is not the most pedigreed institution the academic rigor and affordability helped make me who I am today.
Niche User,5,"My boyfriend goes to this school and when he brought me there a few times for his freshman orientation, it was very clean and the people there were very nice."
Freshman,5,I love UNO because it is not a huge university. The professors are able to get to know you and help you one on one. Everyone is really nice and accepting.
Freshman,5,"Studying at U.N.O has been a fun and eye opening experience so far. I made new friends on the first day, have two great roommates and even though I am more of an introvert, I find myself participating in tons of college events. The food is good and the recreation center is cool too. I am very pleased with my experience. My only beef is the laundry room. The washing machines take a very long time to complete a cycle and the dryers leave damp spots on clothes. Barring the occasional run-ins with the laundering machines, campus life is good."
Sophomore,5,"The university really care about their students. They have hired a few ""D-list"" teachers but for the most part they are great. The president of the school is VERY involved in the activities and the success of the students"
Alum,5,The professors take their time to explain in detail the lectures and many cases are shown on how to put the learnings into practice. Also group projects train you for future job positions.
Graduate Student,5,"Best Bang for your Buck! For the price of tuition compared to other state schools, UNO provides the best education for the least expense. We were rated high on some national list for least debt. A lot of my classmates graduate without taking any (required) loans. (Some take them so they can take advantage of the summer abroad programs.)

The student to faculty ratio is about 21:1 in my classes right now. The teachers do what they can to get you to your degree. And the campus is in that nice middle ground of not-too-small and not-too-big that you can walk to your classes easily.

UNO is not party school per se. Not a big name in athletics. But if that is your scene, the school is a bus stop away from a LOT of other schools that you can go to for those. And for the night life, I mean, this is New Orleans- there's some festival/event/concert every week it seems. 

I enjoyed/am enjoying my stay here at UNO. Definitely a great choice."
Sophomore,5,Overall I had a great experience my first year here. The campus is very diverse and you can meet many people from different places here.
Freshman,5,One major thing I loved about the university of New Orleans is how friendly the staff and teachers are! One thing I wish that could change is how friendly and caring the students are.
Junior,5,"I like how the professors are approachable. I haven't run into any professor that does not seem genuinely interested in helping a student. I transferred from a private university and I realized that it does not take $80,000 a year to get a really awesome degree."
Freshman,5,The school is very diverse and you could meet a lot of people. The campus is nice and all the building are close.
Senior,5,"Philosophy Department is small, but top notch.
The online classes are excellent. People are nice. Classes are small which gives you more attention from professors. Professors are very committed. The tuition is low. New Orleans is a great City to be in. I love this school."
Junior,5,The university is great. A commuter campus but people still get involved. Being in New Orleans there are plenty of activities to get into. The academics are great and anyone will tell you it is not easy.
College Freshman,5,Most of the classes are very small and personal. Questions are always welcomed by professors.
College Freshman,5,UNO provides many people in the New Orleans area with amazing degrees.
College Freshman,5,"There are light posts everywhere, all students are encouraged not to walk alone at night, and on the light posts are alarm buttons."
College Freshman,5,Both on campus options are close to classes and very nice.
College Freshman,5,There are many Greek sorority and fraternity options available.
College Freshman,5,"Very fun learning experience here, and it's diverse."
College Senior,5,I admire the integrity & challenge given to us!
College Freshman,5,Greek life at UNO is great. it's like no other club! One will forever have an away-from-home family. GEAUX GREEK LIFE!
College Freshman,5,I love this school. The teachers are great and everyone there is friendly
College Sophomore,5,Academics are perfect. Bottom line. If you want an education. UNO is the school for you.
College Sophomore,5,"Since diversity and race seem to be a big issue in this survey. There are plenty of different backgrounds. Everyone is trying to get an education. This makes every single race and diverse student at this university very smart.  Every single student at this university wants to better themselves and make a difference in the world no matter what race. Also from experience, there are no issues with diverse students on campus. Everyone works together to study and pass classes. Everyone looks past what color or background they are."
Alum,4,It was a great school located in a great city. The party life wasn't as great as other big name schools but that was made up for by the fact that it is located in New Orleans with endless bars and nightlife just a 15 minute drive away. Academics and gym was great.
Alum,4,There were plenty options for scheduling. My only dislike was the lack of communication about how some classes were supposed to count but suddenly didn't.
Freshman,4,"Easy to access, fun teachers. Easy to enroll in classes as well. My teachers are friendly, funny, helpful and extremely patient even when you don't understand something."
Alum,4,I really enjoyed having small class sizes as an undergraduate here. It allowed me to form close relationships with several of my professors. I also like the diverse campus. One important thing that needs change is updating the laboratories with modern technology. Many of the tools and  machines are very outdated due to a lack of state funding..
Alum,4,I only took one online class while attending UNO and it was very informative and easy to follow.  I enjoyed it.
Freshman,4,I loved attending UNO. It has a great environment and there are tons of people who are willing to help you if too need.
Freshman,4,"Taking classes online wasn't in my plan for my first college year, but it wasn't horrible. I wish a few of my professors could've given us better notes to learn from, but I made it work and passed, so I'm not upset with online classes. At times, I liked it."
Freshman,4,"The professors at this university make the experience worth attending. They are thoughtful, helpful, and easy to talk to for the most part. 
There is a lot to be desired as far as the social scene, it's hard to connect with other students, as most of the people who attend UNO already know each other from high school. A lot of the students are commuters, so there isn't a strong internal community. 
The campus resources are abundant and financial aid, tutoring groups, and career/internship opportunity information is easy to find."
Graduate Student,4,I am an incoming first year grad student at UNO. I fell in love with this school upon first look at the website. It fits all of my requirements in a grad school; one of them being out of state. THe film program there is all encompassing and I love how inclusive the whole school is. I cannot wait to spend the next 3 years there.
Freshman,4,"It’s a great place to attend school. It’s only my second semester but I already love it. The campus is beautiful, good food, and the professors aren’t all bad. A solid 10/10 in my book."
Senior,4,"The variety of science classes to choose from. The campus is accessible to downtown french quarters. Priveeter Place, campus housing is affordable and is right across from campus. The professor's at UNO cares alot about the student's learning. The campus gives you money every month to spend on campus (food and books)."
Junior,4,"The campus is very nice. They are constantly updating the campus, so students can experience more. A lot of options when it comes to eating. There are many clubs to join. They offer a lot of opportunities, so take advantage of them."
Sophomore,4,University of New Orleans has been a great and welcoming environment and has encouraging and involved Professors. What the campus lacks in size it makes up for in diversity. UNO has a huge international program with students from over 100 different countries. The only issue with UNO is their lack of parking spots.
Senior,4,"The faculty and staff are phenomenal at relating to the students and making the campus a community. However, tuition funds could be allocated more responsibly."
Senior,4,"Overall, my experience at the University of New Orleans has been a pretty positive one. Although this does not reply to every teacher/ staff member, the majority of professors that I have worked have been very helpful and understanding. College is stressful and during the times of uncertainty and doubt, it was reassuring to have professors that wanted to help and actually cared. I have had TA's that I did not find very helpful and others that were brilliant.  I like how the University of New Orleans is very culturally diverse and contains several groups/ choices to choose from. All in all, it is a great school that will hopefully thrive and grow in the years to come."
Sophomore,4,"The university is very open and inclusive, and there is a strong effort to provide a safe environment for all who attend. Also, the school takes the arts very seriously and provides an abundance of facilities and opportunities."
Senior,4,The focus of the university is more on academics and not sports.   the teachers actually care if you do well in their courses and want students to succeed.
Freshman,4,I have made a lot friends going to this college. Very diverse and I feel like I'm learning a lot and meeting many different people.
Niche User,4,"The University of New Orleans has a great atmosphere of diversity and different cultures coming together. There are many opportunities for ranges of people as this university has numerous majors. From business administration to the medical field, UNO will educate you in an amazing environment."
Senior,4,"I still currently attend University of New Orleans. Overall it is a good school but a few professors can use some work in the way they teach. Less requirements to join specific organizations would be ideal. More food options would be a great asset as well. In my eyes, UNO is not very diverse. The dorms are not really that nice and could use some remodeling."
Freshman,4,The school is really small which I like. The one thing I want to change is the scholarship they accept because everyone isn’t able to pay out of pocket.
Freshman,4,"The food in the Galley is trash. I eat the same things everyday (pizza, grilled cheese, pasta) because there are little to no vegetarian options.
The campus is a lot more empty and quiet than I thought and hoped it would be, but it’s not too bad because it’s calming sometimes.
Privateer place is the apartments on campus; I haven’t lived there but I heard it’s outdated and infested. Pontchartrain halls, specifically north hall, is perfect. The WiFi is bad and half the time the water isn’t hot, but we have a convenience store, a kitchen that’s always clean, free laundry, and no bugs at all.
There are lots of clubs but they’re not as active or progressive as high school clubs.
The sports suck. There’s no football team and the soccer team is out of control. I tried being on the soccer team but there were way too many people and no way to tell who was on what team. Not to mention only the guys compete against other colleges??"
Sophomore,4,The University of New Orleans offers a great academic environmwnt for both under grad and graduate students. My time here has shown me how effective the renowed business program here can be especially at such an affordable rate.
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at the University of New Orleans has been an amazing experience. Due to the small class sizes, the instructors make themselves available for help if you need it . The faculty and staff really do care about you succeeding in school and in the real world."
Sophomore,4,"I like the University of New Orleans diversity, but the lack of campus life is quite upsetting, especially with the University being in a city as lively as New Orleans. I would like to see the lake being used more for events and activities."
Junior,4,"I love that UNO is a very small and clean campus. It is a huge commuter school but the students who actually live on campus, like myself, have no issues with campus life or getting to know people. UNO offers so many things and the staff and student government are very much concerned with what is best for us."
Freshman,4,University of New Orleans is a good school with a diverse population and a welcoming community. I would like to see more focus on student safety with the recent occurrences of violence on campus.
Sophomore,4,"This university is really good and half the cost of other big university’s in Louisiana. You get a really good education and the environment makes it better to focus, being there’s not much distraction going on"
Sophomore,4,My experience at the University of New Olreans has been amazing so far. Most of my professors have been really informative as I learend so much from them from the classes I've taken as of right now. One thing I would like to see change is the way in which you could seek extra tutoring aside from what they already offer studetns to help out more with studying a certain material one might not understand.
Senior,4,"Great school, good teachers, the people here are down to earth and fun. The food options aren't very diverse and they definitely should work on their buildings, not to mention there isn't that much to do close by. But you still have fun."
Senior,4,"University of New Orleans is a great school for those who are commuter students or transfer students particularly. It is not a traditional university that has a large student life, but there are things to do and activities are planned. The University challenges you academically, and a lot of the professors are invested in your education."
Sophomore,4,"I really like the size of UNO, and the dedication that most of my teachers have to teaching the students."
Alum,4,"University of New Orleans is an excellent university, I feel it gave me a firm foundation for future success. You can always tell a UNO graduate, they are very independent and confident."
Freshman,4,"UNO is a great school. It is very academic and research based. Any science major would be more than satisfied going to the University of New Orleans. Liberal Arts are not forgotten though - the Performing Arts Center is immaculate and all LA departments are well-staffed and helpful.
One thing I would like to see UNO do more is reach out to its students. It attempts to, but the social functions don't appeal to the student body like larger schools. They also are not the best with advertisement. I searched out schools in New Orleans and discovered this campus. Few people I was friends with in high school had even heard of UNO before I went there."
Freshman,4,"Easy transition from high school to college. From the advisors and counselors all the way to most of the professors, everyone is pretty friendly. I learned my way around campus pretty quickly and whenever I need help with something, there's always someone that is willing to help. They helped me work through multiple programs to help me decide on a major and help me set up a four year plan. The tuition isn't bad at all so that's a real bonus. Classes aren't extra large so the student to teacher ratio is good. Basically everyone is nice and is willing to help someone out."
Freshman,4,"PROS
Campus is BEAUTIFUL!

Professors are very helpful.

Campus life is also very upbeat and helpful. 

Excellent high rankings nationwide on academic programs.

Wonderful diversity of student backgrounds - come from all over the world. Lots of opportunities to learn from them 1st hand.

CONS
Very few athletic programs. No football. No frisbee. Would really like to see a reversal in this.

Also, Financial Aid services, though knowledgeable and helpful, are extremely slow.

No real help given to ""what's the next step"".  A lot of assumptions made by the university that someone just automatically knows what to do next. Months wasted because of this."
Junior,4,The diversity in the college is great and the teachers are great. My student life experience was also awesome.
Freshman,4,I'll be a freshmen in Fall semester 2017. I had a chance to visit this school a few months ago. It's impressive me because the campus is so big and beautiful. I'm also prefer the school's library with a lot of conveniences for students. I believe I'll get a good experience at this school
Niche User,4,"The University of New Orleans is a place of acceptance. Most of the students are nice and non judgmental. If you don't feel like you fit in most places, UNO will change your mind. They make everyone feel like they have a place in society."
Freshman,4,"I liked the simplicity of admission, Liked the small campus where everything is nearby, liked the campus atmosphere and its friendliness. I like that is close to the lake and the view is great. I like the number of students per class where it is not big or small just the right number of students per class."
Freshman,4,"I love the P-Plunge events to get the freshmen involved in campus life. They offer many activities and clubs for all sorts of people to enjoy. I wish I lived on campus in order to go to all of these events, especially the first semester. The work load in classes has been easy enough to balance so far. "
College Freshman,4,I've never been scared to walk by myself and I'm a girl so.
College Freshman,4,I like everything about this school than my previous high school.
College Freshman,4,It seems really integrated into the school.
College Freshman,4,The athletic teams are very well supported.
College Freshman,4,I honestly love living o my own here and staying in the dorms.
College Junior,4,Most professors I met are great. They enjoy what they teach and care a lot about their student's success.
College Junior,4,We have a career center that helps students look for part time jobs and internships while they are studying.
College Junior,4,I do not live on campus but I do have couple friends who do and they told me it is great.
College Junior,4,"This campus has a good amount of Greek. However, I am not part of it."
College Junior,4,It is a great university. The thing I love most about it is that every person is unique in their own ways. It has a multicultural environment.
College Freshman,4,"The school is a fantastic mixing pot of people. There are diverse cultures, colors, sexual orientations and etc. All the people are friendly and the school provides a great college experience."
College Freshman,4,"Don't really have one, but it looks really cool overall."
College Freshman,4,"It's nice, but not leaned upon when it comes to entertainment."
College Senior,4,"Campus police is on campus 24/7 and work hard to pursue the safety of the students. They are friendly, but are also firm in their conduct. I feel safe with them. There is also emergency towers throughout campus that you could contact campus police with to escort you in case of emergency; they will arrive immediately to you in their squad car, willing to go off the road. Also, you can call them on their campus police number and they are willing to do the same thing."
College Senior,4,"The career services really do try their best to place their alumni into a career that they have worked hard for. There are always many employers hiring the students from UNO, you just need to be networked with the connections - one of them being the UNO career services. They provide helpful services and have helped many."
College Senior,4,"I have really enjoyed living in the dorms. I appreciated the privacy as well as the community. However, it costs way to much to live there, especially since we are mandated to buy a meal plan too - also expensive."
College Senior,4,"I learn a lot of new things in school. These knowledge will help me a lot in finding a job after graduating. Also, being sociable will help me understand people better such as communicating with new people."
College Freshman,4,I really like UNO. At orientation they were so friendly and it just felt like I would fit in easily and be just at home. I am comfortable with my peers and I am confident that I made the right decision in applying to UNO. I am UNO Proud! :)
College Senior,4,The admissions process is fairly easy and helpful.
Graduate Student,2,"Ive been at UNO since 2014. I can say it's a run down school with crappy dorms, food, classes, and administration. I only went here because I lacked any other options for what I needed. The University's bureaucracy will send you running in circles as different departments fail to communicate, lead, or work together. The pleasantries of this school are surface level. Film school and engineering are decent, but if you don't have those don't bother. They have night classes available which works because a lot of the students here are middle aged workers trying to get another degree. But if you're fresh out of high school, I'd only advise coming here if you lack other options. I say this because you'll be forced to deal with a school that drags its feet on things that matter and doesn't really care about its student's wants or needs."
Graduate Student,2,"The online classes in my experience were usually a joke. I blame that mostly on the teachers though. I had one that didn't care if the answers on the test were actually correct, leading to times in which the right answer was marked wrong. He would never fix it.

I had another class that was completely automated. The lectures were pre-recorded by a third party company, which made me wonder why I even signed up for a university's online class when I could've just found it somewhere on the internet for way cheaper."
College Senior,2,Not much school spirit; most students are commuters.
College Junior,2,I don't live on campus. The dorms do not seem appealing.
College Sophomore,2,All Greek life is at UNO is groups of people that help with school events. they're pretty much the school's lap dogs.
College Junior,2,There are little Greek life activities on campus.
College Junior,2,There honestly isn't much variety by the school. You have to drive out five-ten miles to start getting interesting choices. Most of the choices are run-down fast food restaurants.
College Sophomore,2,"The dorm rooms are small and cold. They are not very well ventilated. They feel and look like jail cells. I couldnt move out of mine fast enough, and never gave a second thought about going back."
College Freshman,2,Expensive and pretty shitty old buildings. Well thats New Orleans for ya.
College Freshman,2,They offer NO scholarships/grants.  UNO needs to get their finances in check...
College Sophomore,2,"Maybe I just don't know the area, but I only go to the same one or two restaurants around school."
College Senior,2,"More students could get involved in athletics at the University of New Orleans. However, the school needs to allocate a few more resources towards sports programs to get the attention of the students. "
College Senior,2,"I love the professors In the Art Program but the choices while I was just starting were very limited. They are getting more options again, but the style that is taught is very limited. "
College Senior,2,"There are quite a few options on campus but they get old fast. The buffet is kind of over priced and the food quality is poor. Plus they have way to many restrictions.
"
College Senior,2,The area is growing around the college but still is lacking. People tend to save up and visit the French quarter or head toward Metairie where all the malls and movie theaters are during the weekend.
College Senior,2,"Depending on the lab you visit, the computers tend to be slow and out of date. Art building lab is really nice tho. Printing allowance is 5$ a semester that is included in tuition. WiFi tends to go in during busy hours. Internet can be slow during busy hours. It's best to bring your own tablet or computer."
College Junior,2,"It's known, but not rampant."
College Junior,2,Most groups or cliques tend to themselves.
College Junior,2,They have a good gym. 
College Junior,2,Sometimes better to just stay on campus to eat. 
College Sophomore,2,There is not a lot of strictness here. It is just common sense things. If you do not have a parking permit they usually give you a warning and then write you a ticket. 
College Sophomore,2,The weather here is random. It will change from sunny to storming in a minute. Always carry an umbrella.
College Sophomore,2,"Not too bad, but often expensive. We have many chains on campus and a cafe. There is also the cafeteria which has a wide variety of foods to choose from."
College Sophomore,2,There is a lot of public transportation around New Orleans. You can always catch a bus to wherever you need to go. If you plan on seeing a bit of the culture around here you can also take a trolley. 
College Sophomore,2,"There is always something new to try off-campus. However, prices are not always reasonable. There are many foods to try including; Lebanese, Mediterranean, Spanish, Indian, Asian, etc."
College Sophomore,2,There are many apartments that are near the campus and well worth the search. They are cheaper than on campus apartments and living in general. The areas are varied with safety and parking.
College Junior,2,"I didn't have the best experience with the financial aid process.  The financial aid options are not well explained, and I had to unfortunately deal with the consequences because of it.  It was more of a headache than helpful."
College Senior,2,"All the computers for the most part are Dells.  You're also forced to use internet explorer most of the time. Aside from that the computer labs can get extremely crowded.  You used to be able to print as much as you needed for class purposes for free.  There is now a charge.  However, you get a $5 dollar allowance each semester.  That is kind of a joke considering how much you have to print sometimes.  It's well worth it to have your own computer and printer available to avoid all of this, but not a necessity if you can't afford it."
College Junior,2,"The parking lot is awful.  It gets full very quickly.  You either have to pay $100 for a decal or go to the ""paid"" parking lot and pay $3.00 every time you park.  It gets expensive.  I got to the point where I would park across the levee and walk for free."
College Senior,2,"There's hardly anywhere to park unless you pay the $80 permit, still parking is scarce."
College Senior,2,"New Orleans is not the most cost-efficient place to live.  However, it is a culturally-diverse and vibrant city to live near.  There are many apartment complexes surrounding campus on 3 sides, so their proximity is definitely a plus."
College Sophomore,2,"New Orleans is predominantly African-American, yet UNO's student body is more indicative of the private, Catholic, predominantly Caucasian schools within the Greater New Orleans (GNO) region."
College Freshman,2,"Not much goes on at night on campus. If there are any school-hosted activities at night, you won't find too many people there. Not much about clubs or bars since there aren't any around. Though I do hear about some house parties every now-and-then. Overall, I wouldn't say there's a lot of life going on at night."
College Freshman,2,My Earth and Environment major is ok at UNO. My instrutors were decent but did not provide a clear program. Some class only have two tests which consist of a mid-term and final. This makes it hard for those to pull up their grade and leaves with them a hard option. Most of the professors do not provide decent notes.
College Junior,2,Police are always more than willing to write parking tickets to parking violators. Speed and student crossings are always watched.
College Junior,2,The air conditioners seem to always be on and makes for a cold environment.
College Junior,2,"Financial aid was a nightmare! I had to wait forever to get my financial aid after they messed it up and made a mistake. No one would take blame for the situation nor tell me what was going on. I had to get several people and threaten legal actions before they would even talk to me. Finally got my aid though, should be this difficult!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Needs Improvement – The student union, library, and the food court were under construction 3 years ago when I arrived and were still not completed this semester, my last semester towards my degree. It has taken a ridiculously long time to do repairs/upgrades and has been quite inconvenient. The buildings are often not cleaned, and the bathrooms are particularly in bad shape."
College Sophomore,2,Gotta Make Your Own Fun – I realized being at University of New Orleans that its all about making your own fun. If you have a great circle of friends you can make studying fun. Hanging in the University Center is okay but the food sucks. You can go to the cove for jazz night
College Junior,2,"No Internships – Experience is key for getting a job in the health care field. UNO does a good job of telling people that, but they don't really offer any ways of getting that experience. If you want an internship, you must find it on your own. And don't even think about job placement after you graduate.....it doesn't exist."
College Sophomore,1,"UNO just has men and women's basketball, but no one really cares for it."
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid office is unorganized and gives false information out
College Senior,1,"They never had any scholarships available to me with a 3.5 overall gpa. The chair of the scholarship department laughed in my face when I asked how come they never have any scholarship money but they have money to build a new coffee shop and put a concrete sign on the back of the campus. She also said that they try to save their money to attract incoming to students and transfer students as well, but I was a transfer student 3 years ago and didn't receive any scholarship invited. As a result, I've had to finish my last 21 hours in one semester because of financial aid and work 2 jobs to support myself."
College Sophomore,1,There's not a whole lot of school support for varsity sports.
College Freshman,1,Rats and roaches coming out of the top of my stove... enough said.
College Senior,1,"Hot one day, cold another. Wet and rainy, dry and beautiful. If you want all 4 seasons in a week the New Orleans is the place to visit."
College Junior,1,"Never used, but know about."
College Junior,1,There are students who who use drugs and alcohol but you don't really notice it because they do it in the privacy of their residence.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no transportation provided for UNO, just the public transportation."
College Sophomore,1,The fact that students dread finding the financial aid office is a high detector of how much students try to avoid the service there.
College Freshman,1,The drug scene seems to be quite an issue at the University of New Orleans. There is a good amount of usage of smoking drugs. It's quite visible when students attend class after the usage of drugs
College Sophomore,1,"I am an adviser to a fraternity on campus, but I completed my undergraduate at a Big Ten school.  When I view the opportunities available for Greeks on UNO's campus in comparison to what I experienced, I see no fair comparison at all.  Simply put:  UNO is a relatively new school, and their Greek offerings are TOO new.  The culture is not there.  Chapter meetings occur in classrooms, and all events occur predominantly off-campus.  To put it mildly, Greek life at UNO is lame and not worth the time."
College Junior,1,"Greek life is not a big deal at UNO. They usually can be seen sitting at their regular tables in the UC, as they don't have any houses on campus. But it's not a big deal if you aren't Greek. Honestly, no one really cares one way or the other."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking is completely insufficient and often unusable. Hundreds of students have to park off campus in surrounding neighborhoods. The only area with good parking is in the overpriced apartments, where every room has a designated parking space."
College Freshman,1,Hectic and Busy – The computer labs are made available to students but you are lucky to find a computer in a sufficient amount of time.
College Sophomore,1,Food Outside Campus – Just BK and macho mamas in front of the university
College Junior,1,"It takes forever. Literally, they give you your money like when the semester is over. Totally not helpful at all."
College Junior,1,"The facilities on campus are out-of-date and dirty. The best thing on campus is the fitness center, but even the equipment is so old and half of them do not work.  There is a Chick-fil-A on campus, that's the best thing about UNO, probably. Which is sad."
College Senior,1,For Each His Own – The University of New Orleans is a true city college. International students mainly live on campus and everyone else attends class and then leaves. They try to have campus activities but always get a low attendance. We are a friendly city but the students keep to themself.
College Senior,1,Cultural City Comes With a High Price – It is not safe to live anywhere in the city of New Orleans. Rent has increased ever since Katrina 5 years ago. Flooding and hurricane evacuations  are a constant threat to your life and possesions.

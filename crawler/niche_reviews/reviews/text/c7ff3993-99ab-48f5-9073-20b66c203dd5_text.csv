Senior,5,"Baker was small which I really enjoyed because it was easy to meet new people, and the student to faculty ratio was great. It really allowed you to meet and interact with your professors, and it felt like a more genuine experience."
Senior,5,I did not take any classes online except during the pandemic.The transition was smooth. We switched to online zoom classes and I had more time to study than I did when classes were in person.
Alum,5,"I loved going to nursing school at Baker University. The professors were fantastic and the class sizes were small, which created a better learning environment for me. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great school that will prepare you so well for your future of nursing!"

I haven’t once met a mean or unwelcoming person on campus and would recommend this college to anyone. The small town feel is wonderful and it is a very safe campus from all the typical college safety risks. I truly do not ever want to leave there.
Senior,5,I did the graduate program at Baker. I loved it. I enjoyed being able to come for the once a week a night and get all my classes done at the same rate but being able to work at the same. I had a good experience with almost all my professors. Also with my counselor who always seemed to be invested in me.
Freshman,5,"Hidden Gem in Kansas.  A prestigious college known for academics and athletics.  They focus on the well rounded student providing a diverse student life with many opportunities for involvement.   Professors demand a lot of their students, but also provide the close working relationship and are there to help guide  you.  Teacher student ratio is outstanding.   Highly recommend."
Junior,5,"My experience with Baker has been amazing. I love the atmosphere, I love how much of a small campus it is and how close and easy the classes are and other destinations you need to get.

Freshman,5,"As  freshman this year, Baker University has been everything I could imagine. The professors, staff, and students have all been very kind and are willing to offer help if needed. Being at a small University has taught me how important academics are. The professors make it known that classes are hard and there will need to be effort put in. The professors are also understanding if any situations come up that may affect ones grades. I have been introduced to activities I though I would never be a part of. I joined a sorority and met some of my best friends and could not be happier anywhere else."
Alum,5,"I was enrolled in Baker - school of nursing, which is an off-site professional school.  So my experiences with Baker is not like the traditional Baker college student.   The School of Nursing was great, prepared me for my career well."

Freshman,5,I love Baker University! There are so many things to do on and off campus. The professors are absolutely amazing. They work with each individual student to help them succeed.
Senior,5,"If I had to describe Baker University in one word it would be family. Over my 3 years at this university, the students, professors, and faculty have become apart of my family. Baker is a small university so it holds more opportunities for its students making it an easy place to make connections for later in life. 
If I had to change one thing about Baker University it would be its housing options."
Freshman,5,"The smaller class sizes allow closer teacher/student interactions, great sports programs, diverse student cultures."

Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Baker. The smaller college environment isn't for everyone, but it's so nice to have professors who genuinely care about you. Not only that, but the school feels like a big family. It is very easy to get involved as there's multiple clubs and even Greek life. The connections you make here will help so much later on."

Everyone here is part of a family and the school and students will protect each other in that way.
Recent Alumnus,5,I don't regret a thing

College Freshman,5,I am so glad that I chose Baker University a place to call my home away from home.

The students themselves never have to pay for them, which is nice, and they are very reliable buses. The school does a very great job at providing everything a student might need."
College Sophomore,5,They all look like my computer screen.
College Freshman,5,Its nice to be able to walk to class no matter what!
College Junior,5,Baker School of Nursing is one of the best nursing programs around and they are said to be picked over most schools just because of how well they prepare their students.
College Junior,5,Their hasn't been any problems with crime or people feeling unsafe just because we are a very small school and the security at the hospital is very good.
College Junior,5,Baker School of Nursing has their own parking lot at the hospital that is right across the street from where our classes are held.
College Senior,5,"We are so busy studying most of the time, we don't have time to do anything else!"
College Senior,5,Parking is paid with tuition. There are always spots available.
Sophomore,4,I took some online classes the second semester when we got kicked out of school because of the pandemic. The professor and the staff at Baker made sure that our mental health was okay and made sure that our transition being home was smooth and didn't affect our school work.
Sophomore,4,I love a lot about Baker. I love that they care so much about their students and about the education of their students. I would like to see more diversity. I understand that it is a PWI but I would love to see more people like me.
Graduate Student,4,"Great staff, lots of class options, and various scholarships. Their advisors work with you personally so they can help to build a schedule that fits your schedule."
Freshman,4,Baker University is a small private school that is full of mostly athletes or students with an academic scholarship of some sort. Baker University has a beautiful campus with all of the buildings within walking distance. With such a tight knight community everyone has a place at Baker University. In addition to all of these great things the academics and academic outcome is amazing with great job turnover rates.
Freshman,4,Baker University is a post-secondary private college that strives to create the best environment for a student to be successful. The college strives to create an inclusive atmosphere that helps aid a student is not feeling alienated on campus and the like. What could be changed is a better focus on campus food choices and experiences more tailored toward student interests.
Junior,4,"Baker is an amazing college that offers very personal connections with your professors. The classes can be tough, but if you are really dedicated, it's very worth it. The best department by far is the psychology department!"
Alum,4,"The campus is small, but beautiful and peaceful. You can study anywhere , the professors show an interest in you and the connections all around the campus are endless. There are so many traveling opportunities , clubs, and the campus chapel is also where connections can happen. The school makes sure you have a job before you graduate and a home to come back to if you want to further your education."
Sophomore,4,Baker is an amazing school. I love the small community and getting to know a lot of people on campus. Most of the Professors really do care about you and your state of being. Overall it is a great school!
Senior,4,They are making changes to the campus every year so they are listening to the students concerns which is a plus. One negative is parking. There is no covered parking for people who would even pay for it also no security cameras on the parking lots.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at Baker University. I have had a great experience so far. I am originally from Tennessee , and living far away from home took some time to get used to. It is because of the family atmosphere of the students and faculty here. I have met people that I will call my friends for life. I have also had some of the best experiences ever with my Cross Country and Track teams. Coming to Baker was the best decision I ever made."
Junior,4,"Great administration people, very encouraging. Worked with me getting everything together and  making sure the degree I picked was to suit me. I am excited in beginning this adventure with Baker. Several of my friends have attended Baker and have had nothing but great things to say about this college"
Sophomore,4,"Baker University is a small school that exhibits a tremendous sense of community. Whenever you walk from class to class, you are sure to see a multitude of people that you know and that will smile, stop, and talk to you. The professors take a genuine interest in your individual education if you put forth the effort to make a relationship with them. The campus is kept maintained and looking wonderful. There are also several opportunities to get involved on and off campus. I would recommend the school over and over again."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm trans and I feel pretty safe and this is a small religious school. Plus all the security guards are pretty chill and if you don't wanna walk back to your dorm alone if you call them they'll walk back with you.

There is like 0 tolerance to mistreating of other students. Like to the point of like conduct probation for pranks if an administrator didn't see it that way."
College Junior,4,"I am not involved in any Greek life on campus; however, the atmosphere of sororities are quite enjoyable."
College Senior,4,reasonable cost and great staff!
College Senior,4,Not up to date on current athletic statistics.
College Sophomore,4,I truly enjoy my university. It is a great campus with great faculty and staff.
College Junior,4,I do not partake in the greek life at my school but them seem to get a lot done for the community.
College Junior,4,Our basketball team did really well this year in our conference.
College Junior,4,Not overloaded with pointless busy assignments.

College Junior,4,Frequent internship and job opportunities are sent out and networking opportunities.
College Junior,4,Greek is the way to go.
College Senior,4,I have had no issues finding career prospects.
College Senior,4,I do not live on campus but sports are great!
College Junior,4,As a nontraditional older student it has been difficult to relate to other students and courses offered but in general my experience has been great
College Junior,4,We have a 100% placement rate for students that complete our education track.  I feel confident about finding a job in music education when I am finished.
College Junior,4,Three more semesters to go!
College Junior,4,Several Fall Sports made it to the playoffs this year.
College Senior,4,"I am a junior now. I love the fact that I am at a small school where I can get to know a lot of the people. It is also nice when the professors know you rather than just being a number. For such a small school and community, we have build a strong atmosphere and support one another. I have created many great memories and can't wait for more."
College Freshman,4,I love all the choices of food that we can get and all the food that I have had taste great.
College Freshman,4,The food could be better but everything else is great.
College Junior,4,"We have a pretty laid back campus. Just as long as no one does anything illegal in public places, all is good!"
College Junior,4,"It was a pretty easy process when getting financial aid, but there is always demand for more help!"
College Junior,4,The administration definitely makes sure students are following dorm rules and that their academics are going well.
College Junior,4,Most of the buildings are for specific majors per building. Every building has a student lounge for studying and hanging out with friends. The majors programs are a lot of fun.
College Junior,4,The athletics are great! The facilities are great and the fan support is amazing.
College Junior,4,"Everything is clean, it's nicely built and close to not only the classroom buildings but places in town such as the grocery store."
Recent Alumnus,4,Athletics is hardworking and strive for the best
Recent Alumnus,4,There is a great variety to choose from!
Recent Alumnus,4,They bring about the best in the university!
College Junior,4,Everyone is very kind and generous toward one-another
College Junior,4,It's very easy to get into your desired program and taking all the right classes to graduate is simple to follow as well.
College Junior,4,It was very easy to receive the right amount of financial aid
College Junior,4,The dorms are relatively new so it makes for quality living areas.
College Junior,4,It's a small school so all the professors are personable. The classes are difficult but assistance is available everywhere.
College Freshman,4,"For whichever scholarship you are rewarded, they contact you and let you know.  The school is very good at mailing you the amounts owed and how scholarships are split throughout the entire year and what they cover and what you still owe.  When you apply for a loan from the bank,  they accept the loan extremely well with no problem.  They confirm with the student or guardians that the loan is for tuition and they work with you to make sure everything is paid off correctly."
College Freshman,4,"Sports are big part of the atmosphere here at Baker.  Our football team is nationally ranked every year and out performs many teams by winning our conference and attending playoffs.  Our basketball, cross country, volleyball, softball, and many other sports are recognized at every event.  The students are involved as much as possible.  Although we are not a big university with many students we still support out athletes with pride of where we go to school."
College Freshman,4,The option here at Baker is to live in the NLC.  It is a coed dorm where you can hang out with both males and females and you do not feel cut off from social events.  It is right across from the student union which is perfect because it is right across from the food!  The campus is pretty small so most classes are a short walk from the building and you are also close to the parking and apartments.
College Freshman,4,Everyone is very friendly with one another.  You cannot go walking but maybe a few feet and someone is there to greet you or simply smile.  We all accept everyone for who they are and no one is judged.  We are close knit community who love to attend sports events and cheer on our fellow students who participate as well as just gathering together for social events.
College Freshman,4,The administration puts in place what they think will protect us as students.  They do not put the rules in affect to just have them there.  The administration truly cares for each and every one of us students and they do not want anything bad to happen to anyone.
College Senior,4,"the teachers are really good at what they do. You will find the ones who are more strict than others, or some who are more fair than other teachers, but just go with it. Always do your best, be honest, and move forward. If you need help, they are all willing to help you help yourself."
College Freshman,4,Has been very easy with Advisors help.
College Freshman,4,Security is always available to walk you anywhere.
College Freshman,4,Alittle small but good quality
College Freshman,4,Best parties are in the greek houses
College Freshman,4,Our school really rallies around the different sports on campus.
Recent Alumnus,4,there are many diversity awareness programs and clubs
Recent Alumnus,4,Everyone is very spirited and lively
Recent Alumnus,4,they are very good at making sure you get exactly what you want
Sophomore,2,No diversity. No food.  It made me more depressed that I was in high school. I had to transfer after two years.
College Junior,2,There are limited options. It is very hard to get permission to live off campus.
College Junior,2,I am so happy that I no longer have to pay for a meal plan. I feel like I wasted so much money on food that wasn't very good.
Recent Alumnus,2,Our school is in a very small town with not much to offer
College Student,2,"it's here, but its at every school."
College Senior,2,Baker is in the middle of nowhere so you do not need a car in Baldwin but to get home if you do not live near campus you need a car to get home or to get to other cities.
College Senior,2,You have to apply to live off campus and it is really hard to get accepted and the only way to live off campus is to have an allergy or have a major financial need.
College Sophomore,2,"Baldwin City is a very small town. There are only a limited amount of eating places off-campus. Most people go into Lawrence if they have a car, to eat at an off-campus dining place."
College Senior,2,"The nursing campus is centrally located near the capital and surrounding hospitals. To get to any bar/club scene, you have to walk pretty far or drive."
College Sophomore,2,There isn't a significant amount of diversity; the student population is mostly caucasian
College Junior,2,"We have seasons in Kansas!  It is not fun running to your car after class when it's freezing and there is snow on the ground!  Currently, the first week of may is calling for 70 degrees one day and 40 degrees the next.  :("
College Sophomore,2,"You don't need it because the town and campus is so tiny, but if you want to get out of the farmland, you'll need a car, or a friend with a car.  There's no bus service out this way."
College Freshman,2,"Baker, academically, is very strict. However, your social live is left alone for the most part. Enforcement of social things (drinking) is very minimal."
College Sophomore,2,"There are some people who smoke a lot. I'm not into that, but there is a certain group who is."
College Sophomore,2,Very average. Options are very limited. Some choices in the cafeteria.
College Junior,2,"There is no diversity at Baker. Guys are usually conservative christian hicks and very closed minded. Everyone is pretty friendly, but it can be hard if you don't regard yourself as a christian republican."
College Junior,2,There Are Hardly Any Options! The town that the campus is located in has little to no options and they are rather expensive because the town is so small.
College Junior,2,"It's Alright – There aren't that many options on campus or near the school. The gym on campus is small but does have nice equipment. There's only one gym/athletic center in town. In my opinion, to go to a really great facility I have to travel 20 minutes to the next town."
College Freshman,2,"If you do not have a car or a ride, good luck with getting to school.  There are no public buses that pass through or even near the school and it is very far to try to walk there."
College Sophomore,1,"It's NAIA that's all you can really say.

I mean people love watching the teams since like half the school are athletes and they all have average student friends but it's like meh?"
College Freshman,1,They serve the same food everyday and it is nasty
College Junior,1,"the Baker School of Nursing doesn't have any sports on campus, a few people are still part of Baker University sports but do not receive any scholarship money because they are not on campus."
College Junior,1,"Their is no campus housing provided, we all have to find our own off campus housing and everything is very expensive and the neighborhood close to the school is very bad."
College Junior,1,I can't receive any financial aid because my parents make too much money. However just because they make good money doesn't mean that they are helping me out with paying for school.
College Junior,1,"Their is no campus housing at the Baker School of Nursing. All students have to either live in apartments that are close, but in a bad area or live across town in apartments that are farther away from the school."
College Junior,1,"Baker University is kind of a compilation of all the basic people you knew in high school. There isn't a lot of diversity or people who express differing opinions. Everyone is about the same, but it's a small school in a small town, so it's to be expected."
College Student,1,"I've slipped on ice twice, and my roommates are always sick, so I'm always sick too.  It's not a very healthy campus, perhaps because of the mold in buildings and dorms.  Many of my friends have allergies and sinus problems from the old buildings."
College Student,1,"I agree with another reviewer that a place to play pool, or dance would be nice.  Or a video game hall and coffee house."
College Student,1,"My first year courses have been okay.  Not very exciting, and not much to them.  Different than high school, I have more time because there are a lot of students who can't keep up so my classes have been slowed down for them."
College Sophomore,1,"SNORE

There are cows, and farmers, and some fields, unless you drive 30 minutes north to Lawrence."
College Sophomore,1,"It is kind of uptight, like a lot of the reviews say.  I often feel like I'm at my grandparents retirement home because of how boring the campus is, and how old the faculty are."
College Sophomore,1,I'm graduating and I can't believe that after all of these years of high tuition costs that baker won't pay for the meal for my family before the graduation ceremony. What a bunch of cheapies.
College Freshman,1,"The faculty seem nice, but they're very uptight and not very hip.  They're sort of nerdy. Even the young faculty who are hired have the personality of 60 year olds."
College Freshman,1,Very limited.  There are only a handful of apartments available for rent off campus.
College Freshman,1,HA! What nightlife?  You can go to taco bell or a greek house.  People say there are student clubs but who wants to do those dorky things?  What are we ten years old and in girl scouts? Wish there was a good bar with dancing.  Or a pool house.
College Freshman,1,The server is very slow.  It takes forever to get online.  The MacLab computers are always freezing up.  They need some new computers!
College Sophomore,1,"There is a great new science building, but unfortunately the other buildings are all run down, dirty, and falling apart.  I don't have nay science classes so I'm stuck in the crumbling rooms."
College Sophomore,1,"Nothing going on.  The university has a lot of clubs, but what college student wants to do things with faculty advisers around them?  When I attend the club activities I feel constantly under watch, and then I realize I used to go to clubs and activities like these in grammar school and middle school.  I feel like a little kid going to these things now as a college student."
College Sophomore,1,Would pick another school if I had to do it all over.
College Sophomore,1,"The food is always the same, and is served cold, especially the burgers.  They're soggy! The dressings seem watered down too."
College Sophomore,1,Not challenging. Classes are a bore.
College Sophomore,1,"There is nothing to do around town unless you are a frat guy or sorority girl and you have a party. No night clubs, shopping, movies, parties outside of greek life, or outings at all. It's very boring on this campus compared to other ones. You can drive to Lawrence if you have a car, and then you have to drive back.  There is nothing at all to walk to."
College Sophomore,1," The girls are mostly Big Girls, and the handful who aren't big have some ego problems. There are maybe ten to twenty very cool people on campus who don't have any issues. It's a slim percentage. There are a lot of Special Needs students like I've seen other people post about.  "
College Sophomore,1,"I liked taking a few courses at KU and at a community college because the professors seemed much more relaxed. They could were jeans and at Baker I feel like I'm always in a business meeting, which I'm not a business meeting.  It seems very strict, especially dress codes. I also can't get into buildings to do work after 5 or 6 at night because they're locked. After sports, it's hard to get work done unless it's research in the library because of building closures."
College Sophomore,1,"There is one good building that was just re-done. It's nice.  All of the other buildings are horrible.  Water damage, cracks, toilets that don't flush, running water, smelly, moldy, cold and poor lighting.  "
College Sophomore,1,"The campus has a lot of dells which seem very business orientated, like for secretaries and administration.  Not very hip or cool for our generation.  They're very old too.

"
College Sophomore,1,You get tired of the food very quickly. It's not American either.  They seem to try too hard and fail with making classic normal food.
College Sophomore,1,I believe the professors dumb the courses down to get high teaching scores.  Or they dumb it down because there are a lot of slow kids who won't pass unless they do.
College Freshman,1,NONE!  A few colored people who came here for sports. Lots of whites.  No colored faculty.
College Freshman,1,NONE! There is nothing to do at night. Not a real college experience here!
College Freshman,1,"There is none. Just frats and girl houses. No apartments at all, except dorms or through the college."
College Freshman,1,"The food is horrible. Greasy, or dry. Lots of asian food too. How about hot dog or beef hamburgers?  They give us bean or turkey burgers.  Blah!"
College Freshman,1,Old Dell computers suck. They should give all incoming students an ipad.
College Freshman,1,Bad classes with lots of busy work. Very average or below average students here. I'm dumb for attending this school!
College Freshman,1,"The food options are fairly limited and the quality is just a bit better than your average school food. The hours are also pretty limited (dinner is from 5-6:15) making it hard for athletes to find time for food. The Cafe is pretty good, but again the hours aren't ideal (they aren't even open on Saturday!)."
College Freshman,1,There is no parking. There is only one big lot and two little lots around the campus.
College Sophomore,1,Don't expect a good education if you attend this school.  
College Sophomore,1,Interterm is a complete joke!  What a waste of my money just to sit around and watch movies.  I bet the faculty that teach do that just so that they don't have to work and they can just get paid watching movies with us.  Is this really college?
College Junior,1,"I wish my parents would allow me to go to another school, but I'm stuck here.  I feel that they're wasting their money on this place."
College Junior,1,"Very limited nightlife, and any type of life!  A few little restaurants and that's about it.  You can go hang out in a field with the cows if you want."
College Junior,1,"Not much diversity.  Lots of small town white Kansans attend.  The faculty are also either alumni, or have some former connection with the campus, which limits my education and makes the university seem quite low on the diversity scale.  I guess the people who hire can't get anyone else to come here!"
College Junior,1,"I had to go here because one of my parents went here, and they are paying for my education, but I wish I was somewhere else.  It seems like the only students here have a connection with the campus, either their parents work here, or their parents went here, or they have a sport scholarship and couldn't get in anywhere else.  It seems like I'm in a dream with all the inbreeding!"
College Junior,1,"what to do, what to do - NOTHING in this town!"
College Freshman,1,I can't wait to leave!  
College Freshman,1,There is no transportation at all in this town.
College Freshman,1,extremely strict place to be!  Religious and unfriendly.
College Freshman,1,there is way too much greek life on campus!  every one is in one so that they don't have to live on campus.  
College Freshman,1,They have very old dells.  Who uses a dell these days except for 60 year old women?
College Freshman,1,"The facilities aren't very good at all, especially the library and union."
College Sophomore,1,Not the brightest kids go here!
College Sophomore,1,"They have one nice building, the rest are crumbling.  mold, water, and bugs everywhere."
College Sophomore,1,Very limited eating in town.
College Sophomore,1,there are some big porkers around! 
College Sophomore,1,Not diverse at all.  I think there's one black faculty member on the whole campus.  white inbred community.
College Sophomore,1,the IT people are ignorant and know nothing about macs.  get with it!
College Sophomore,1,There is absolutely nothing to do in this little town of 6000
College Sophomore,1,"haha, this place is a joke!"
College Junior,1,The buildings are falling apart.
College Junior,1,this food will make you fat!  white trash trailer park food

Sophomore,5,We take mostly hybrid courses during the pandemic. The professors are very understanding and approachable.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Loras. The moment that I first set foot on campus it felt like home. I would definitely highly recommend at least visiting our beautiful campus! #Duhawk4Life
Sophomore,5,"I love Loras. It is my home away from home and I have made the best of friends here. I love all of my professors and the class sizes are great. Even though it's a small school, it has a great social aspect. The bars in Dubuque are fun and the parties are great."
Freshman,5,"Great community, great academics, strong support. I am so happy that I made the decision to become a DuHawk!"
Sophomore,5,"Such a great place to go to school.  The professors really care about making sure you are a successful student.  You are a person and not a number at Loras College.  Also, there are so many extracurricular activities to be involved in and all their sports are really good for both men and women.  Wouldn't want to get my bachelors degree anywhere else."
Freshman,5,"Loras is a very exhilarating place that allows a student to experience and explore many of the  opportunities provided by the school. The school allows you to have close relationships with you're professors and the peers around you while a lot of academic assistance is included with these attributes. As a Loras student myself, i recommend everyone to take in consideration into coming to this very opportunistic private school."
Niche User,5,I love the campus. The dorms are very ncie. Everyone is always willing to help you in any way possible.
Sophomore,5,"Love the support and the opportunities Loras has provided me with. They have provided me with the opportunity to study abroad and discover new areas of interest in my education and in hobbies. Their Activities Board is fantastic to help students de-stress and get out of their rooms weekly, and give new chances to experience new things."
Freshman,5,Everyone walking around will talk to you even if they do not know who you are. The administration is extremely welcoming and will answer all of your questions to the best of their knowledge.
Sophomore,5,I love Loras college it is great to make connections with others and everyone is very friendly. The professors are there to help in most of the time if you have questions or clarify something.
Alum,5,Excellent school. Professors were engaging and actually care about students. All sorts of activities on campus to get involved in. The students are wonderful and easy to get along with.
Freshman,5,It has been a great experience! Loras is a very welcoming college and has lots of activities and opportunities to get involved.
Sophomore,5,The people here are very welcoming. There are a variety of resources to meet learning needs. Broad range of extracurricular activities. Teaching geared toward being both a good student and a good citizen.
Freshman,5,"I have been here for less than a year but I am already blown away by how much I love the school! The community is so tight-knit and welcoming, which is a big perk of a small school. The professors genuinely care about you and do whatever it takes for you to succeed, even answering homework questions via email in the middle of the night. I would highly recommend checking out the school."
Freshman,5,I love the class sizes and how the professors really want to get to know the students. The campus is beautiful and the student life is great!
Sophomore,5,"Loras College is a small, tight knit community. You see friendly faces everywhere you go and everyone is willing to lend a hand. There are many resources for students to reach out to when it comes to school work. There's people in the library to help you with writing a paper, there are student instructors to help you in challenging classes, and there are endless amounts of people to help you with everyday problems as well. Another plus is that the class sizes are small so you get a more personalized education and the opportunity for you to get to know your professor and vice versa."
Alum,5,"Loras College was the perfect fit for me. It was small enough that my professors knew me by first and last name, yet big enough that I wasn't seeing the same people on campus every day. I had so many obtainable opportunities at Loras that I wouldn't have gotten other places. The people at Loras genuinely care about every single student. I had an amazing experience here and would do it over again tomorrow."
Junior,5,I love Loras College. Everyone here is very close with each other and the environment is always really positive. My professors are very supportive and understanding. They have helped me through so much. The only thing I would like to see change is the food program at Loras.
Sophomore,5,I love being a Loras College Duhawk.  The campus is beautiful and the people are very friendly.  The professors are very knowledgeable and always happy to help you with any problems or questions you may have.  It's located in a very scenic area along the Mississippi river with a lot of opportunity for internships and employment.
College Freshman,5,"Very safe... I've never felt unsafe, nor have I heard of anything too serious around campus."
College Sophomore,5,I love school here because of the community and relationships formed.
College Junior,5,My experience has been remarkable! The teachers are very accommodating with me and my permanent post concussion symptoms.  I have had a great experience with the community here as well and everything they have to offer on campus.
College Freshman,5,I would definitely choose Loras if I had the opportunity to do it all over again. Everyone on campus is so welcoming and makes Loras feel like a second home. I actually miss school when I'm gone on breaks. We have an awesome Launch into Loras Program that happens a few days before school starts which really helps the new students get involved and meeting new people right away.
College Junior,5,There is a 97% rate of either getting into grad school or getting a job in your field. That leaves me feeling pretty comfortable.
College Freshman,5,I'm so glad to be at Loras. It is a great school with great people everywhere. The thing that sticks out is how much people care about each other. It's like it's a big family.
College Sophomore,5,"I think that the student involvement with sports is amazing. There are so many students that involved in some sort of a sport. I believe that team performances do vary based on the sport, but no matter what, the fan support is unbelievable. There are people going to absolutely everything ranging from cross country meets to football games. The school spirit is so bright and you can tell that people are very happy to be at Loras College. The athletic facilities are very good as well. Those who are not involved in sports can still go to the weight room or to the gym and still have a friendly atmosphere."
College Freshman,5,"I generally feel very safe here on campus; the only time when I am not one-hundred percent comfortable is when I have to walk all the way across campus by myself at night. However, with the campus security that we have, I know I am able to call a number and either get a ride to wherever I am going on campus or simply talk with someone on the phone until I get to where I am going. Therefore, I always feel safe and secure on campus."
College Freshman,5,"My overall experience here at Loras has been amazing. Everyone is so helpful and kind and it is very easy to be social with anyone you encounter on campus. The professors make learning fun and interesting as well as do a good job with applying how what we are leaning will help us in our future jobs and classes. There is a wide variety of classes offered, which allows everyone to take the maximum amount of classes each semester and be able to graduate within four years. The class styles are traditional and the class sizes are smaller, so it makes learning easier than if there were a hundred students in the same classroom at one time."
College Freshman,5,"Loras College is an amazing school, it was one of my top choices when I was trying to decide which college to attend. Not only is it close to home, it also feels like home when I am here. The community aspect of the school is really amazing and all of the faculty and staff are so welcoming and helpful. The professors and professor's assistant or (TA's) are also very helpful. All of the help which i provided in order for student's to succeed here at Loras is quite amazing and proves that Loras should be a top choice for anyone to attend. If I were to do it all over again, I would one-hundred percent decide to come to Loras."
College Junior,5,The majors provided by Loras College are fantastic! They all can be credited when going to apply for jobs.
College Junior,5,"I absolutely love Loras College! It has been a great experience and I couldn't have asked for a better place to attend school!  The one downfall would be the WIFI, but the social aspect, the classes, everything has helped making the experience better.  Once a Duhawk, always a Duhawk!"
College Junior,5,My overall experience at Loras College has been one that is amazing!! I have had a fantastic time. I have become part of many groups and have become a leader in the groups and in the classroom. The teachers are amazing to work with and are very willing to work with students one on one.
College Freshman,5,"Loras College has a wonderful security service. Each night, we have someone from security in our residence halls. They overlook what is going on each night, especially over the weekends. The safety of Loras' students is very important. If there is ever a serious issue, it will be addressed immediately. If you are feeling unsafe walking back to your residence hall late at night, then the security guard can escort you back home. Safety is taken very seriously here."
College Freshman,5,"Loras does a phenomenal job working with each student. At our school, we have an office that is there to guide students through the internship process. The center for experiential learning is there for students at all times. CEL wants our students to have a chance at success. Loras is very invested in helping their students with succeeding in the workforce. In order to ensure success, they allow their students to shadow many people on their jobs."
College Freshman,5,"Honestly, I have had a great experience thus far. The professors at Loras are very accommodating. At much bigger institutions, I noticed that most professors don't care about the success of each individual student. It is important to remember that each student is more than just a number. The professors at Loras take that into account. They make sure that they know each student on a first name basis. If you're struggling in a class, they will do whatever they can with their will power. College is challenging after all and Loras wants their students to get their moneys worth. Our classes can be very difficult, but it is only to make us better students in the long run. When searching for a job, employers want to find the most well-rounded individuals and Loras is sure to do that."
College Freshman,5,"The housing of Loras College is excellent. The area coordinators do an incredible job of overlooking all of the resident assistants. Our RAs plan different activities each day that we can get involved in, such as, Club Beckman. Club Beckman was a dance party for all to join. There, they played the most up-to-date music, had an awesome DJ, and fun non alcoholic beverages. Loras College wants their students to engage in events that will help them build friendships with their fellow classmates."
College Freshman,5,"Our Greek Life is very favored at our school. It may not be the most talked about group, but it does play a key role at the institution. Our sororities and fraternities are actively involved in the community. We thrive in giving back to our society. Helping those in need is what Loras College is all about."
College Freshman,5,"What do you think of when you hear purple and gold? That's right DUHAWKS! Our student body bleeds purple and gold. No one holds more school spirit than the students of Loras College. Although Loras may not be a division one athletic school, you can always catch our students supporting one another. Our schools motto is ""Duhawks support Duhawks"". This year, our men's soccer team was in the NCAA championship. Despite Kansas City may be six hours away, that did not stop our fans from attending the game. Loras' student unity truly sticks out, which makes it such a desirable institution."
College Freshman,5,"Overall, the experience has been extraordinary. Everyday, I go to bed knowing that I made the right decision. Loras provides me with so much happiness. One thing that really sticks out about Loras is the environment. I attended several different visits. As I walked through the campus' at other schools I never felt welcome. The second I stepped onto Loras, I knew it was the school that I belonged at. I was welcomed immediately by some of the most friendly human beings I have ever met. If I was given the opportunity to choose another school, I wouldn't. There is no other school out there that offers quite the opportunities like Loras. Loras owns a place in my heart. I absolutely love being a Duhawk!"
College Junior,5,"Loras College is a great school, but they could provide more money for their students. College is expensive and making us pay for laundry, especially in campus housing is ridiculous. Also, the school wastes so much food it is sad. We pride ourselves so much on community service, I wish they would donate any leftover food instead of trashing it."
College Senior,5,The small classes are the best part about Loras. My professors genuinely care about me and want me to succeed. They are willing to do whatever it takes to help students even if it means staying after their set office hours or responding to emails/calls late at night. The school is small but it's exactly what I wanted because you can never walk across campus without saying hi to at least a couple people you know. I would choose Loras all over again in a heartbeat.
College Freshman,5,There are many delicious places off campus to eat.
College Freshman,5,"I think Loras has great programs for all of the majors. Class is not easy. You are constantly challenged and up late working hard or studying for a class. The teachers are always willing to help and meet with you. If you put the work in, you will receive great results."
College Freshman,5,Loras really works with you to get you the amount of money you need to go there. They really make you feel important and wanted at the school.
College Freshman,5,We get a laptop as freshman and then another one our Junior year to help establish us in our career choice.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Loras College prepares its graduates to enter the real world, not the world of text books and multiple choice tests. Graduates earn meaningful degrees and find work or continue their education at a high percentage."
Recent Alumnus,5,Street parking and Free Student Lots result in an abundance of easily accessible parking.
Recent Alumnus,5,"A mall, the Mississippi River and all of its attractions on the port, chain and local eateries = lots to do"
Recent Alumnus,5,Loras College owns and rents local off campus housing. The college is easier to deal with as compared to a landlord.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Loras College provided a great degree, friends and athletic experience. I am successful due to my efforts, but alos the guidance and preparation provided by Loras College."
Recent Alumnus,5,Flip top laptops for every student
Recent Alumnus,5,Dubuque is a great city with many attractions.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Duhawks support Duhawks. M/W SOC, M/W BB, WR are fantastic programs. FB is on the rise with a great new HC. Former athletes are very successful and provide a strong network for future graduates. Loras College is defined by successful student-athletes."
Recent Alumnus,5,We are ranked 13th by US News and World Report for Regional Colleges
College Freshman,5,I love the major I am in. I am in small class sizes which means I have more contact with teachers and am not just a number. The workload is not what most would think and Loras is the best!
College Junior,5,I personally love the professors. They are very helpful. Each student receives a laptop to use during their years at Loras and so that helps tremendously. 
College Junior,5,Loras is a wonderful school. I love the small class sizes because it means that the professors get to know their students on a personal level and will be willing to help whenever it is needed.
College Freshman,5,You are expected to use common sense and abide by the rules since we are a community.  We are the citizens of Loras.  Tolerance of violations is reviewed on a casr-by-case basis and corrective action is provided on a justified basis for violators.  
College Freshman,5,The teach cause they Love.  They realize today's teaching and lessons will be our history tomorrow that we build our future on!!!
College Freshman,5,The BEST!!!   I have had a minor problem that was related to the computer itself.  The Tech staff had it repaired in a very short period as I waited.  No problems since.  I don't hear of any problems from fellow students either.
Junior,4,I love the smaller classroom sizes and smaller campus sizes. I am able to connect better with students in my major and have relations with them as well as my teachers as they are willing to get to know me as a person. I love walking around campus knowing I live in this community as people are always nice and welcoming.
Junior,4,Online learning is very good and teachers make sure to stay connected with students wether it’s through zoom or email.
Freshman,4,I like that it is a small college so you get to know everyone on a more personal bases. I would like there to be frat houses.
Freshman,4,I have not yet taken an online class but it they do provide you with a laptop which is really nice. I love how the president tries to have lunch with everyone on campus.
Junior,4,"The professor connections that you make both in and out of the classroom, as well as the community you experience everyday here on campus. Something that could change would be during inclement weather we could close down campus like the surrounding schools and campuses do."
Sophomore,4,"It's like a close knit family at Loras.  All the professors and students all work together to help one another.  The people there really care about you.  The food in the Cafe has a little to be desired and the dorms could use some updating, but that is minor in the big picture.  There are so many sports and social activities to get involved with.  I love my Loras family."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the academic side very much and I feel like I am learning skills that will help me in the future. The professors are very helpful and they treat every student with respect. You can tell that they really want you to learn and they are committed to helping students who may have trouble.
Junior,4,Small college with big results.  Students taught in small classes by full professors.  Great business and pre-health (pre-med) programs.  Challenging academic environment.   Active student body.  Well funded college.  Great experience.
Freshman,4,"I currently attend Loras College. Loras is one of the oldest places in Dubuque and is a beautiful college. Loras has its pro's and con's, just like every other college. A lot of other students really enjoying attending Loras, for many reasons. I would recommend Loras to anyone who is looking for a small school and is wanting to join athletics as it is a big part of the school."
Sophomore,4,"A pretty good small college with great academics and nice people. The party scene is ok, but not bad. People mainly go to bars in the dubuque area, house parties (which aren't really fun), or even travel to the university of Iowa to party."
Sophomore,4,"I love Loras College! The education and environment is absolutely incredible. The professors are deeply invested in their students and the environment is filled with Duhawk pride! Although the food and housing could be updated/altered, everything else makes up for it. I am more than happy with my choice to attend Loras!"
Freshman,4,My first year is going great! Love the classes and love the professors. The only problem is the hills but other than that it is perfect.
Junior,4,Loras College is a great College. The teachers here really care about the students. They are here to help at all costs. The school is also ran by great administration and it keeps getting better each year. The Athletics are also great and the coaches do a great job with all of student athletes.
Sophomore,4,"Loras College offers students a chance to obtain a liberal arts education in classrooms full of diversity. The classes can be challenging but do not make you feel too overwhelmed. With many students coming to Loras from around the country, you are able to interact with many different cultures and backgrounds. With the smaller class sizes, you are able to create better relationships with your professors which helps quite a bit if you are struggling in a class. They always have their doors open and having a chance for a one-on-one interaction helps you fully understand the information being taught."
Junior,4,The Community is amazing. Everyone is super nice and welcoming. There is always an activity going on on campus or in the community that you can participate in.
College Freshman,4,"The professors are friendly and easy-to-access; in just about one year (and 10 classes), I've had 9 excellent teachers, with one poor teacher. The courses are taught to the student - not just to the elite."
College Freshman,4,"The men's soccer team is amongst the best NCAA Division 3 programs in the country, while other sports - like basketball, football and volleyball - are improving."
College Sophomore,4,"I do feel safe on campus, but sometimes the surrounding areas aren't the best and I would never walk around by myself."
College Sophomore,4,We have companies table outside to the cafeteria to get recruits.  Alumni play a huge role in connecting students to jobs after graduation.
College Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed all of my classes in college.  The small size is very convenient and I feel like I create a relationship with my professor just by being in class.
College Sophomore,4,Campus housing is decent on campus.  I have enjoyed every place I have lived so far.  The dorms are in decent shape and do a good job of bringing together community.
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics play a big part on campus and many people support the different sports.  As we say here, ""Duhawks supporting Duhawks."""
College Junior,4,"The student involvement with varsity sports is very high. Almost 50% of the school are student athletes or are part of an athletic team as a student-coach, manager, etc.  For a lot of games we get a wide base of students to com and support their friends on the team."
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus. Dubuque is not the safest town by any means, but I feel comfortable walking on campus at any time."
College Freshman,4,"There are many options for classes to take, sometimes it is difficult to get in the class you want, but if it is required, it is assured you will get into the classes you need. The classes are all very good and informative. As expected, some are less interesting than others, but the professors usually go above and beyond and out of their way to make class engaging to the students. The professors really care about their students are easily accessible be it by office hours or by email. They try to learn everyone's names, and even after completing the course, if they see you around campus, they make an effort to say hello. The student to faculty ratio is 12 to 1 here on campus, which makes class sizes fairly small. Personally, I enjoy the small class sizes because it allows the professors the opportunity to individualize their teaching and really get to know the students."
College Freshman,4,"In a survey put out by the school in 2014, 100% of the class responded, and something like 95% or more of them had jobs within a year related to their degree or were enrolled in graduate school. The Center for Experiential Learning does an excellent job of helping students get internships, and if those internships are unpaid, getting scholarships so the students receive some compensation other than just credit or experience."
College Freshman,4,"I live in Beckman, which is traditionally the first year residence hall of choice. We leave our doors open a lot so that we can socialize with other people on our floor. I have a roommate and I have heard very few complaints about the random assigning of roommates (which we did). Having a community bathroom is not the worst, although the showers are a little small. I can't complain though, because the bathrooms get cleaned for us, and I don't mind that at all. Housing is a bit expensive, but I think that's been on the rise for awhile now."
College Freshman,4,"I'm not a part of intermurals or sports in general. However, I do think that the facilities are very up to date and easily accessible to those that want to use them. Many students support our teams, both varsity and intermurals."
College Junior,4,"They do a pretty good job. We're constantly being reminded of the rules and guidelines of campus, and lots of tips for staying safe."
College Junior,4,I really love being at Loras. I have enjoyed every minute here.
College Junior,4,"The reason I say this, even though our football team is pretty terrible, and almost every team is mediocre, but our soccer team is one the best in the entire country. Its always great watching them play."
College Junior,4,The greatest thing I think about Loras is the community that we find ourselves in. It is nearly impossible to go a day and not talk to someone on campus. The classroom environment is just as welcoming and diverse as the extracurricular events. It truly has been a great experience.
College Freshman,4,"There is a very strong alumni network, especially in Iowa and in Chicago."
College Freshman,4,"I'm not an athlete, but our soccer programs are both great. The workout facilities are fantastic, and the school has an indoor track and an indoor pool."
College Freshman,4,"Loras is a great school. I'm glad that I'm here because everyone there is friendly and wants you to succeed, from admissions to the professors to Campus Dining, even. Great environment."
College Sophomore,4,"The safety on campus is very great. You never hear about any campus crimes. I always feel comfortable if I have to walk across campus, even if it is later in the night. There are security throughout campus and that also brings a good amount of safety."
College Sophomore,4,"The way that Loras has their classes is amazing. What is nice is that the class sizes are small, so the professor knows you by name and they know how to help you learn and what your struggles can be. The quality of courses and classes are so nice because they are always high quality."
College Sophomore,4,The student career prospects is huge in this school. They have an organization just to help people get jobs and internships through their major or around their major. What I find that is really nice is that you are so big into networking with the alum and that they have people coming all around to bring careers and internships.
College Sophomore,4,"I like to live on campus it is very nice. Last year, I lived in a quad and this year I live in a single room and both are spacious. I like living by myself, the room is well put together and big enough for me. I love being in the freshman dorms because the social atmosphere is amazing. Although, the sophomore dorms are not as social, there is still a good amount of a social atmosphere."
College Sophomore,4,"The Greek life at Loras isn't very big, but it is known. The people that are in Greek life are extremely nice. I was involved in Greek life for a while before money became an issue, but it was an amazing time. Many people are very social and it is very nice to be a part of campus that everyone likes."
College Sophomore,4,I love this school. I have been able to meet so many people that I have made so many friends. My favorite times of the year are homecoming because it really brings people together and our J-term. It is something that everyone finds interesting and so fun.
College Sophomore,4,"I love this school. I'm a transfer student and it didn't take me long to find my community here. Everyone on campus is so friendly, and the classes are intellectually satisfying and challenging. Most of the professors have been very good. They assign work, but not too much, and it is more or less relevant to the class. I have learned not only about my major, but about life in general, and becoming a more well rounded thinker."
College Freshman,4,The career center at Loras is amazing; it has a very high percentage rate of students whom either move on to graduate school after graduation or find a job within the first year after graduation. Which speaks bounds for how great Loras is and all of the possibilities students have after graduation. Many employers respect students who have graduated from Loras.
College Freshman,4,"The housing options here at Loras are pretty good, the social aspect of my dorm especially is amazing. While the dorm rooms may not be the biggest by any means, there is enough room for each roommate to have their privacy and their own area just for themselves. Depending on where the classes are, none of the housing options can be considered awful, anyone can make it across campus in under ten minutes and be on time for all of their classes with no problems. The social atmosphere would probably be the best part about living in the resident hall. A lot of people keep their doors open throughout the day, so socialization is frequent. Everyone talks to everyone and is friendly and helpful when needed. The resident advisors are also great, very social and very helpful whenever anyone has a question."
College Freshman,4,"Duhawks supporting Duhawks is a great aspect of Loras's sport's reputation. At almost every home and away sporting event, Loras provides a sizable crowd of support. Many students attend the games and support the teams no matter the score. There a lot of athletes involved in sports on campus as well as many students who do not play varsity, but play on the intramural teams and still get the enjoyment of playing the game. All sports on campus are treated the same, no one really is treated as if they are better. While the teams may not always be the greatest or have the best winning records, anyone can see the spirit which each player and fan brings to each and every game. Also each student and athlete respects the athletic facilities to keep them looking nice for every performance and all of the players."
College Junior,4,"We have a great health center on campus that has a lot of remedies for sick people so they don't have to go to doctors! But along with that our counselors are great to help with the mental health of students who need it. Our Campus Security can be uptight sometimes, but they do a great job of providing a safe environment for the students."
College Junior,4,The amount of alumni network is amazing.  Being from Colorado there is still an insane amount of network here! I have met an insane amount of Alumni that I am family friends with who are Duhawks.
College Junior,4,"The quality is not the best of living, but it is easily to be overcome by the social atmosphere.  For Freshman year I would highly recommend Beckman Hall.  That hall is a great atmosphere for meeting other first years.  The Visitation Complex is very laid back and has a great community! The RAs there are fantastic and usually always are. I highly recommend it, except that it is a decent walk to classes."
College Junior,4,The amount of students who play varsity sports are 50% of the school! It is very easy then to get involved with intramurals. The amount of students who come to games depends on the opponent and time of the game. So at football games we can get quite a few fans out there.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Although its small, and there for lacks the freedom of a state school, I feel that my learning experience is much more thorough. In addition our school is great at getting you the experience necessary for  a good resume. I feel at home here."
College Junior,4,they're all pretty helpful and nice
College Junior,4,I got the help i needed
College Junior,4,"A lot of people live on or near campus, so there's always someone around!"
College Freshman,4,Everyone gets some sort of financial aid when they apply for it
College Freshman,4,The whole process of getting the financial aid and loans I needed was not a difficult task.
College Freshman,4,"The dorm rooms are sized well, and my residence hall has carpet in the bedrooms. The lobby is very clean and quiet, and has very comfortable furniture. The RAs are kind, understanding, and helpful. The bathroom on the first floor is small, but the floor only homes thirteen girls so the size is not an issue at all. The only thing that could stand to change would be the basement lounge/rec room.t A new couch or two to replace the torn ones would be nice, and the chipped ping-pong table and the pool tables are not in great shape."
College Freshman,4,We have super good safety on campus. Sometimes they can go overboard but at least we are safe.
College Freshman,4,Loras really works with you to find jobs and figure out what you want to do with your life after college.
College Freshman,4,My bathrooms are always cleaned and our rooms are always warm (year round). I wish we had AC. The atmosphere is exciting and fun. The rooms are a little small but you make do.
College Freshman,4,The majority of the people at my school are in sports.
Freshman,2,"Loras College is not a widely recognized college in terms of academics, and i dont expect it to be, but if you are an international student, this is not the college for you. Xenophobia has some underlying permanence in this college and it is hard for you to connect with others that arent outsiders like you. Day after day i question my decision and think of transferring, but i lack the resources. Dont make the same mistake i have made. If you are an american student you will have the time of your life however. I hope this helps because i wish someone had told me this before coming..."
College Junior,2,"Pretty sad. The Fraternity here is pretty minuscule, and the sorority does alrght, but they aren't super active on campus."
College Freshman,2,We have 1 sorority and 1 fraternity. It is a joke.
College Freshman,2,Not much diversity on the campus amongst the students or faculty.
College Freshman,2,"The college says they are strict with things like alcohol, drugs, noise levels, but no one ever does anything about it. Attendance policies are decided by each individual teacher."
College Freshman,2,"Near a small city, some things to do in the city during the warm months, but not much to do in the winter if you don't have a car. Not much going on campus during the winter if you don't like to watch basketball or wrestling. The only thing fun to do in the winter are the hockey games in the city, but you have to pay for those and you need a car or someone with a car."
College Junior,2,The school is mostly middle-upper class white students. There are a small handful of Colombian students and very few black students.
College Freshman,2,"Loras gives every student a laptop, but the technology outside of the computers is BAD. The internet access is TERRIBLE and ungodly slow if it even works."
College Freshman,2,"It's gotten better, but it's still not good. The menus are pretty repetitive."
College Freshman,2,"The residence halls are BAD. Loras requires all freshmen to live in the halls, which I will admit, helps you meet a lot of new people. The physical condition is terrible and I do not feel like I am getting my money's worth living on campus. "
College Freshman,2,"Almost all of the buildings on campus are old and outdated. The dorms are TERRIBLE. The rooms are all beat up and a lot of things don't work in them. For example, I deal with power outages on a weekly basis in my room.

Most of the academic facilities need some work too, as many of them feel like they are stuck in the 50s.

The exception to the these generalizations are the Alumni Campus Center (where the cafe and student services are located), the Academic Resource Center (the library), and the Athletic Wellness Center (the gym/athletic courts)."
College Sophomore,2,"Loras is a very strict school at times. I do not like that they are constantly monitoring facebook, twitter and various other social media sites in order to keep us from doing the ""wrong"" thing. If they assume that you are doing something..then they punish you right away without even discussing it i feel like. It is my facebook page.. therefore i have freedom to say whatever it is that i want to say."
College Junior,2,There needs to be more spots in the parking lot by BO. And different hours for when people can park different spots overall.
College Senior,2,Really don't know of any programs for drug resistance.  Plus someone tried to make meth here last semester.
College Senior,2,"I understand Loras is a liberal arts college, but there are classes called ""Go Dog Go"", ""Child and Young Adult Literature"", and many other classes that  really do not provide and knowledge to help us in the work place."
College Junior,2,Not Very Diverse – Since Loras is a private Catholic school there are many many student who fit into the White Catholic middle to upper class profile. Other than some foreign exchange students there is not much diversity at all.
College Freshman,2,"Not Many Greeks – Loras Does have one sorority, but it is not huge. There is no fraternity, and Greeek Life definately does not dominate the school."
College Junior,2,"Parking at Loras is cheap- about $70 for a year-long pass. However, finding a place to park might be difficult. We don't have enough space for all the studnes who want passes to park close to their dorms or apartments. Students can now get an even cheaper pass to park in the farthest lot- mostly just for studnets who need a car to get to school but don't use it often, hopefully this will free up parking in the next year."
Niche User,1,"I loved Loras so much, it was my home. However, when it comes to student conduct, they are absolutely terrible. One student can act aggressive and violent towards another student without getting in trouble. This is all because the student who posed a threat to their peers is a legacy, and have parents who are generous donors. The school talks about fairness and equality when in reality, they just do what they have to do to keep the money coming in."
College Freshman,1,There is not any drug use that I have seen on campus
College Freshman,1,"Health services offered here are pretty good, but the safety sucks. Campus security does not do anything, there are no cameras anywhere on campus except by the food places, most walkways are unlit at night, and there have been multiple rapes of students by other students on campus."
College Freshman,1,"Parking permits are cheap; however, Loras doesn't have NEARLY enough space for everyone with a car. You almost have to fight for a parking spot."
College Junior,1,"The parking at Loras is pretty bad. There are certain lots that are worse than others. For instance, in the Lynch-McArthy apartments, the parking lot is always full. If you come back to campus late it is very hard to find a parking spot. Also, the security officers give out tickets for parking violations regularly."
College Junior,1,"The nightlife at Loras is not very fun. Loras is a very small school so it's easy for parties to get busted. Also, with two other colleges in Dubuque, the cops keep a pretty good eye on things. The nightlife dowtown is really fun, though. The bars are always packed after about 10pm, especially Gin's. Dubuque isn't a great town for underage nightlife."
College Senior,1,"Loras College is located in Dubuque, IA which isn't a big city; therefore, the buses runs every hour. Buses come within the vicinity of Loras, but not within the campus. However, such a inconvenience, only affect a small number of students because most stay on campus; therefore, they can walk to their classes."
College Sophomore,1,"We finally got a public bus to stop right outside of campus. I have never used it so I dont know where it takes you but I know it's free. We also have a program to rent a car. But, it is $25 to join the program and then an additional fee each time you use it. I dont know anyone who has used this program. The cars for it never move."
College Sophomore,1,"Have Rental Cars – There are two rental cars that students can take out that Loras owns. However, the cost isn't very reasonable, so one would be better off car-pooling. Also, there isn't a reasonable amount of buses or taxis, so don't rely on public transportation too much."
College Sophomore,1,"Very Expensive – I revive a decent amount of financial aid, bit after the first year they messed with my financial aid and i almost had to transfer. After I stated that I was going to transfer and stated how much it was going to hurt them if i left, they magically found more money for me."
College Freshman,1,"Drugs... Here? I think that we fail at controlling drugs from getting on campus. There have been several people already that have been kicked out of the college or off of some athletic team. I knew a lot personally, there are probably more out there."
College Junior,1,"Non Existent – Aside from bringing your own car or walking, there is really no transportation to speak of. The city of Dubuque has buses, but no stops are close to campus and they stop running early in the evening. It is very inconvenient if you do not have a car or are in walking distance of where you want to go."
College Sophomore,1,we have one girls greek house and no male greek house. And no one really knows about the greek house.

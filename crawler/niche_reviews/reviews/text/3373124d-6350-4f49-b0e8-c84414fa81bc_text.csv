Sophomore,5,"I   love the environment of Keene, It feels like a small city on campus with lots to do daily it really feels like home, Keene has the best staff who helped me through whatever I  needed throughout each year to their very best effort."
Sophomore,5,I   had to take three online classes with keene state and even though remote learning is hard for both the professor and student professors at Keene went above and beyond to give students the extra help they needed.
Sophomore,5,"i just finished my first year of college at keene state college! i love it so much and i wouldn’t change anything. everyone was so kind and i had one of the best times of my life with the people, and with all the events and parties! i genuinely found my favorite place in the world. definitely consider coming to keene because it’s made me so happy. the parties are an A in my opinion and are very fun! the food is about an A-! i think the safety is definitely not a C+. i think it is more of a B+! and for professors, i think it’s an A- and classes, an A-! overall an amazing place and you’ll fit right in!"
Alum,5,Graduated through their Exercise Science Program in 2018. Professors were amazing and after graduation when I started working on certifications it was obvious that my degree had prepared me well.
Sophomore,5,The extracuricular experiences are great and good academic research opportunities. Professors really know how to teach and being in smaller classes you begin to build connections with them to help in life after college.
Alum,5,"KSC has incredible opportunities if you put out the effort to find them (and its not hard to find them, they are everywhere. GET INVOLVED!) I am forever grateful for the professional development that I've learned here I especially  love the close knit community. KSC has a great party life if that's you're thing, but if not you also don't have to party. College is seriously what you make of it."
Senior,5,"Inclusive, diverse, and extremely welcoming. The faculty is great and presents you with every opportunity available to you. The food is good and people are great. Plenty of social opportunities too."
Sophomore,5,"I love KSC, small,tight community, great place for people who want their voice heard, lovely campus all year. class sizes are small-average and teachers are eccentric and lively."
Sophomore,5,Everyone on campus is a friendly face and it immediately makes you feel at home! the campus is beautiful all times of the year.
Sophomore,5,I toured a couple other schools before looking at Keene. I didn’t want to go to Keene because my older sister was currently a sophomore at Keene at the time. I went to an open house at KSC and all my worries went away when one of the students mentioned that he had an older brother at the school and was never known as so-and-so’s younger brother. My first year at KSC was super fun and educational. I made so many friends and would recommend Keene to anyone looking for a school on the smaller side.
Sophomore,5,This college is absolutely amazing. The students all make you feel welcome and the teachers are always there to help guide you. The town has a very fun and welcoming feel. Overall excellent.
Sophomore,5,"I LOVE Keene State college! At Keene, the atmosphere and the community is so happy and welcoming. There are so many opportunities that are given to us from clubs, organizations, sports, and programs. The school is made for pretty much any and everyone.

Freshman,5,Keene State is a great college! All the professors want to see you succeed and support you anyway possible.  The local area has so much to do and there is always something to check out. The academics are interesting and make you think.  Keene State has become my home away from home.
Graduate Student,5,"Keene State is a great college for graduate students. Very flexible schedule and professors. The area is beautiful and has great eating areas and areas to relax and get together with friends. The students are willing to collaborate and assist each other, along with the professors. Each of the graduate professors are experts in their fields and are up to date on the methods and practices in the area they teach."
Junior,5,"I like the atmosphere of the classrooms, they are the perfect size because it was easy to adjust from high school to college. I love how connected the professors are with the students."
Junior,5,My experience at Keene State College is wonderful. I am a transfer student and the environment and community is exactly what I was looking for. I am an athletic training student and I have had so much exposure to what it would be life when I get to practice on my own. The professors always try to communicate and help you in anyway that they can. I would like to see the costs of food at keene state go down a little bit.
Niche User,5,I loved the campus housing and campus life most at keene state college. They have an integrated housing system for freshman that makes the transition easier.

Sophomore,5,Keene State College is a community with great professors. Everyone here is willing to help and you have a good amount of support . I have met some of my best friends here. I have lived in campus for 2 years and have loved both dorms I had. While the food could be better the Dining Commons is always open to suggestions and is willing to make changes the students want. This is a community that cherishes student involvement and students opinions.
Freshman,5,Dorms were amazing and food was the best I've ever had. I learned so much there and the teachers are very attentive to each and every one of the students' needs. It was affordable and I will be recommending this school to everyone I know.
Niche User,5,I have throughly enjoyed all the time I'vev spent at Keene and I would reccomend it to anyone who is interested in a 4 year degree with a liberal arts college!
Niche User,5,"I had a very good experience exploring the school before I actually attend Keene state college. The staff was very helpful with my situation on payment with the military gi bill being unable to pay for the fee until I am in 3 years in. I am truly excited to be able to attend Keene state college for psychology. I wish I didn't need to wait so long but unfortunately I need to. I want to get started and move on with my life and Keene state college is going to help me do exactly that. For the past few years since I've been in the military, I feel like my life has been put on hold. Unable to do much to progress my future. That's what college is for  in my opinion."
Alum,5,"Keene State College is accepting of students from all walks of life. There is something for everyone at Keene State College from majors to clubs and organizations. It is the only college in the country that offers a degree program in Holocaust and Genocide Studies. 
If you're an eco-freako the Keene State is for you! They divest in companies that do not pollute the environment, practice sustainable living in dorms and class buildings. 
Keene State College is a small college. Teachers here want to build individualized relationships with their students so students will get the most out of their college experience. Students also have the opportunity to get involved in community work through their classes."

Freshman,5,I love the beautiful scenery at Keene State College. The campus is beautiful and the people are very welcoming. All my professors know me personally because of the small class sizes.
Sophomore,5,"Keene is a great small town college, resided in a typical New England setting. The academics at keene are up to standard and have great selection of electives for a liberal arts school. If you attend keene you will definitely find your people and learn a lot."
Senior,5,"I transferred here after a dismal freshman year at a smaller college, and I found my place at KSC. The students were more than welcoming and the whole campus has a homey feel. I have had excellent professors in the Psychology department in particular, and everything about
Keene State has changed my life direction around for the best."
Freshman,5,"I liked the campus, and it was affordable. Keene is a really great college, and it is a very welcoming place everyone is so friendly, and I felt like home when i went over for my orientation week. I suggest everyone to take a look at this college it is a very pretty campus, and the classes as well."
Junior,5,"Keene State College, like many colleges, is what YOU make of it. Most of the professors that I have encountered have been dedicated to their students and love their jobs. If you want to party, you can party. If you want to be involved on campus in clubs or Greek life, you can be. If you want to study your butt of and be given opportunities from your professors, you can do that too. Keene State has been a great experience for me thus far and I would recommend this school to anyone."
Niche User,5,"I traveled to Keene State College for a visit, and I really like the environment of the campus. It was easy for me to walk around and find all the buildings for my classes. I really like how the dorms are close to the academic buildings."
Freshman,5,Keene State College is a great place to find passions and life long friends. There are plenty of things to get involved in and classes that are very unique and interesting.
Sophomore,5,"What I like about Keene State is how small it is. The student to teacher ratio is small so students can connect or get 1-on-1 attention that they might need. It also has a lot of clubs and organizations. There are sports teams, classes in the gym, student organizations, Greek life, etc. All of the academic buildings have been renovated and are well maintained as well. The library hours are very flexible and printing is FREE."
College Senior,5,Campus safety takes all cases very seriously and they are always helpful with any concerns
College Senior,5,The housing is always clean and welcoming. The cleaning staff is always very kind. Residential life is very helpful with the housing process.

College Freshman,5,You never feel out of place
College Freshman,5,Parties are always the best thing looking forward to the weekend
College Freshman,5,"I just love a lot about this campus, mainly my department and the opportunities it gives me."
College Freshman,5,"I love attending Keene State College.  As a theatre major, the first day of orientation is when you go visit your department.  The first thing the professors said was that they work on a first name bases.  This made the environment and the rest of the orientation process so much easier knowing how accepting my department was.  We're a small department, but this gives you the opportunity to learn about everything and anything that you would want to know about theatre. We have the capacity to do everything from huge main-stage musicals, to small black box comedies.  It's a great environment, and within the first two months here, I was offered a job within the department, which just expanded the number of opportunities I would have access to to learn more about theatre.  The campus as a whole has a lot of great programs.  we're the only campus in the country with a Holocaust and Genocides major, and I was fortunate enough to be able to take one of their classes this semester.  All the professors I've interacted with on campus are helpful and passionate about what they do.  We have musicians in the BSO who teach here, and other professors that work for the U.N.  If there's something you want to learn here, there are the resources and dedicated professors available to help you.  If I had to do this all over again,  I would pick Keene in a heartbeat."
College Sophomore,5,I feel very interested in almost all of the courses I have taken. I feel that every one of my professors go out of their way to help me succeed.
College Sophomore,5,I have loved living on campus this year. I live in Pondside 3 and it is very nice and comfortable.
College Sophomore,5,"I love my school, and I honestly couldn't see myself anywhere else."
College Sophomore,5,"At Keene they have emergency buttons located all over campus, very easy to find, once pressed campus safety officers are not far and will be there very quickly. I've personally never used one or even felt the need to."
College Sophomore,5,"The Residential Life at Keene works really well with students if they are having problems with their roommates, they will get you out of the situation as soon as possible!"
College Sophomore,5,I play a varsity sport at Keene and it has been some of the best experiences I've had at school. The athletes are very down to earth and fun to hang out with. The intramural sports are so fun and easy to be a part of too!
College Sophomore,5,"I love Keene so much! It has the typical college movie look and feel. It is very cozy and super fun, always things to do. Students are really friendly. The sporting events are wicked fun to attend as well!"
College Junior,5,"I would not trade Keene State for any other school! I have met so many great people and made so many great friends! The program I am in is difficult, but should prepare me for the real world. There are also plenty of things to do in the area and in Keene! I also strongly encourage participation in sports and clubs!"
College Sophomore,5,I love Keene State. I am starting on a second degree in music performance and I thought about transferring but here the faculty really get to know you as a person which is so great. Also everyone here is always so supportive of everything you do. Keene is a great community. It's one of my favorite places.
College Sophomore,5,"I love how easily it is to get involved, how tight-knit the community is, and how friendly all the staff and faculty are. I'm never bored!"

College Freshman,5,I think th efood is great
College Freshman,5,I love everything about my school.
College Freshman,5,Campus safety is amazing. They are always there to take you where you need to go.
Sophomore,4,"Keene State College is a great campus and has a lot to offer their students. The campus is small which makes the community tight-knit and personable. Everyone is friendly, the dorms for first year students are great, most are quite spacious and have great views of campus. Very easy to walk around and located in a safe, beautiful town. I will say they have done what they can to make campus exciting and fun during the Corona virus. Great opportunities lie at Keene State."
Works Here,4,"I teach at Keene State College, we make the effort to get to know students, and many professors are research-driven. The way to combine those is to involve students in the research. The campus is beautiful, and there's an easy walk downtown."
Works Here,4,"I'm a professor and I'm learning to teach online. I want to meet the students, so this is synchronous on-line. We have good conversations and get into serious material.  I'm sure there is a learning curve, so I'll give us 4 starts for now."
Sophomore,4,Keene is a great college with an amazing sense of community and is a very accepting place. It has small class sizes and great professors who care about not only your grades but about your wellbeing too. The staff is excellent and the food is great too.
Sophomore,4,"Due to covid-19, I did have to take some online classes, and Keene was very strong and fast in the transition to online, making every student feel heard. Most professors did really well with the switch and were very understanding of the circumstances."
Sophomore,4,"I love going to school at Keene State. The teachers are beyond amazing, all of the staff are incredible and I love everything about it. They do their best to make sure every student is in good shape and feels safe. It is a somewhat small campus that is very welcoming and pretty."
Junior,4,"I have taken several classes online at KSC and although i much prefer the in-class experience and believe there is much more you can get out of it, The professors at the collage do an excellent job at preparing online classes going into a lot of depth and offering plenty of support and feedback via optional zoom meetings or by email."
Junior,4,"I love the community of KSC, everyone is very friendly, helpful and committed (students and faculty). There are some very wise professors I've met here that go far out of their way to help students reach their goals. I hope to see some changes in housing situations such as forced triples and unnecessary building-wide fines."
Sophomore,4,"Most of my online experience was very good with Keene. Many of my professors were very understanding and helpful when it came to the learning curve of remote learning. Any of the issues that I had were not at the fault of the professor of college, it was just an adjustment for us all quite honestly. The college's president was constantly emailing us students updated information on the situation, which was extremely appreciated."
Sophomore,4,"This past school year was my first year at KSC, and despite having to unfortunately be sent home for remote learning in March, I had a great time at Keene. I am looking forward to being back on campus in the fall!"
Junior,4,Keene State has felt like home from the beginning. The faculty really care about how you succeed and will help you no matter what. The size of the campus is perfect and the city of Keene has everything a college student needs!
Graduate Student,4,I found my teachers to be engaging and was able to find lifelong friends through the extra circular activities available through the campus.
Sophomore,4,"I am double majoring in Anthropology/Sociology and Holocaust and Genocide studies. Majoring in anthropology and taking classes in sociology has and will help me further learn how to understand the many different aspects of the human experience. My HGS major will prepare me to think critically, analyze political situations and respond actively to injustice.  Keene lets me voice my ideas and encourages me to become a better student and person."
Freshman,4,"I’m a freshman at Keene and have enjoyed being at the school. The campus is really nice, its clean and well kept. It’s a short walk to all the buildings as well as the surrounding area. Access to town is walking distance with plenty of places to pick up anything you might need. Academically all my professors for the first semester were great. They made adjusting to college curriculum a very easy transition. Campus life is great with plenty of clubs and activities to keep you from getting home sick. I would recommend Keene state college to anyone especially in the New England area. It’s a few hours from my hometown and even closer to many ski resorts."
Sophomore,4,"My experience so far at Keene State has honestly been amazing. I love this school. Every teacher I have had is passionate about teaching, and even more passionate about what they teach. I have countless experiences where teachers have gone out of their way to help me with my studies. The students here at Keene State are also mostly good people who are easy to get along with. The classes here are also fun and always keep me intrigued, the lessons I have learned also have impacted me to be better worker, student and overall person. Keene State has also offered a multitude of opportunities for scholarships, internships, and work.
The Campus itself is very clean and most of the dorms/housing is in good shape and well maintenance. The local area of Keene is also a very fun. The night life of Keene State is great, and always makes for a fun weekend.. Overall I rate Keene State 9/10. The school food isn't great and could be worked on, and some of the dorms/housing are outdated."
Junior,4,I am a junior and overall love the school and campus. I cheered for my first two years but had to stop because I am looking for a job for my housing.
Niche User,4,"I loved the academics at Keene State College. The classes were small and the professors were very excited to helpand work with the students to help them learn and pass their classes. The environment was friendly, since it was a small school people knew a lot of other people on campus."
Sophomore,4,"I started at Keene during the second semester this past Spring and it was a very interesting and challenging experience because I had to grow a new sense of independence and I had 2 professors that  I could genuinely speak to about my academic and situational concerns. They were warm and welcomed my curiosity and helped me to navigate what I could do to help myself, moving forward. I do love Keene State though, it feels like home."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about about Keene is that when I enter on campus, it suddenly feels like home. The student environment is very open and the staff are so welcoming. Keene does plenty of events to make the students comfortable and fit for the college. I have never visited a college that puts into so much effort of keeping their students by doing as many activities."
Freshman,4,Keene State College is a small college. Teachers here want to build individualized relationships with their students so students will get the most out of their college experience. Students also have the opportunity to get involved in community work through their classes.
Freshman,4,"so far I really enjoy my time here. Classes are tougher than I expected ,but the resources to help are top notch. I'm a freshman and a physical education major. I will be back next year , I do love the atmosphere and the layout of the classrooms and dorms, easy to get to."
Sophomore,4,I think the academics are very good here and I enjoy my classes and professors. I would maybe try improving the parking spaces for commuters like me because the main parking lot for us is quite small and when it's full we have to park kind of far away.
Niche User,4,"I have visited Keene State College several times so far in my career of music. I am a resident of Keene, NH, and I have always really enjoyed getting to know the professors there, especially in the music department, and I love getting to know all of the students as well."
Junior,4,"the campus is gorgeous and I love the atmosphere the professors give and people will randomly say high if you are just walking down the main walk way, it always makes me smile."
Junior,4,"I have been a student here for three years, I love Keene I couldn't imagine going to school any where else. However Keene doesn't offer as many classes as other schools do so class options so class registration time is very stressful."
Freshman,4,"From what I have experienced so far from orientation and living very close to, or in Keene for the past 10 or so years now, I love it. The town is great, many things to see and places to eat. The college feels like a completely different place with so many kind and welcoming people. As far as academics go I am not sure yet, but from people I know who have gone here, including my father, it is a great school."
Junior,4,"KSC is a wonderful, tightly-knit campus. As a theatre major you have a very tight knit family, and get to know all of your professors very well. I've loved my time there so far, and appreciate the colleges acceptance of anyone who steps on campus."
Graduate Student,4,Proud Greek life alum! If there was one thing that positively changed my college experience that would be it; highly encourage joining!
Freshman,4,"Keene state college is a very close knit community. The Classes present challenge, however, the majority of professors are encouraging and very open to assisting students whenever help is needed. At keene, you're not just a number, you're a student with a name and you're able to make connections with professors and build professional relationships along the way."
Niche User,4,Very well and pretty location. Has a lot of good students and professors who are willing to help with any situation. Overall it is a great school that has very well kept campus and buildings.
Sophomore,4,this school has become a second home to me. I would have never pictured myself going here but i am so happy that i choose to come here.
Freshman,4,"Keene State College has become my new home, I feel so welcome here! There are so many things to get involved in on campus, and plenty of things to do off campus!"
Junior,4,"I transferred to Keene State College last year to continue my education as a dual major in Graphic Design and Photography. So far the professors have challenged me in creating works of art of would of not done other wise. With hard work I have managed to find a place on the Dean's List for both semesters. The campus is like it's own community, with multiple places to eat, study, and chat besides just your dorm room."
Senior,4,As a commuter student the professors work well with me in trying to find the best possible plan for when to take classes. They are supportive and informative. The campus is very cultured for a smaller school.
Freshman,4,"Keene State college is a wonderful college. I have had a great experience here at Keene state meeting new people, attending athletic events, enjoying class etc!!"
Niche User,4,"KSC is a wonderful, supporting community.  The only trouble is the bees.  There are bees everywhere.  You can't escape the bees."
Junior,4,"Beautiful southwestern NH College.  There are numerous programs and classes to suit your interests, as well as on-campus organizations and activities.  If you are interested in study-abroad programs those are offered as well."
Junior,4,"I love Keene State College. I'm the current president of my co-ed fraternity, and I am working on getting my degree in management. I love the people, the helpful staff, and the scenery is beyond amazing because Keene is tucked deep into the valley of New Hampshire. The dorms are mostly old, but they still have charm despite being visibly worn down."
Sophomore,4,"Keene State College is a scenic school located in Keene Valley, in southern New Hampshire. The leaves are always golden in the fall and the regular breeze that brushes through campus is refreshing, even on winter days. The professors here are dedicated to the success of their students, and they frequently make themselves available to any and all who need extra help. The food here at Keene is superior to most other campus' in New Hampshire. The dining staff are always looking for suggestions to improve the overall experience of those who come to eat here. The town of Keene is a safe atmosphere that is welcoming to travelers, residents, and students. All in all, Keene is not just a college, it's home. "
College Senior,4,There are many majors to choose from and a wide variety of classes.
College Senior,4,We have many organizations that are supportive of diverse students.
College Senior,4,"I don't really go to any athletic events, however the gym is a very nice facility."
College Junior,4,"Professors are easy to access, and ready to become available to my needs if I need to have a private conversation, or request time away from class."
College Junior,4,"Housing could be a bit better, but overall adequate for the students. (and parties)"
College Junior,4,"big fan support, great facilities and high participation."
College Junior,4,"starting as a business major, i was unhappy with the classes offered - they just didn't ""fit"" me, so in taking an environmental course and really loving it, i decided to change my major to environmental studies. I am very happy now majoring in this field, and will graduate on time even though i didn't realy start taking my major courses until the second half of my second year."
College Student,4,you can always work out and the equipment is beautiful and its free for all students!
College Student,4,"At this schools, you always feel like you can talk to someone. No one is ever left out. The teachers are amazing here."
College Freshman,4,The campus is very diverse
College Freshman,4,There's a place you can go to if you were sexually assaulted or if you feel like you need to talk about things that really help you. They have a tremendous amount of supportive people
College Freshman,4,"I absolutely love living on campus, you get to know everyone especially in my residence hall"
College Freshman,4,I love the environment and the people here.
College Freshman,4,I know that almost everyone who leaves this department does so with a job.
College Freshman,4,"I'm not a part of a sports team here on campus, but I do use the gym quite a bit, and all the machines are clean and in well working order.  The people on staff are kind, and the sports teams here take their jobs very seriously."
College Freshman,4,"I think the quality of the student center and the anemities in it are great and very useful to students. I always see lots of students getting food or going in the bookstore, even just eating or sitting to study or talk."
College Freshman,4,I can connect with professors pretty easily. I am not one to seek help in front of my class so I usually do so on the side which allows for more one on one time with the professor which helps with getting extra help if I am struggling.
College Freshman,4,"I live in Holloway and I really enjoy it. I have been to friends rooms in other dorms and they seem a lot less nicer and seem sort of trashy, due to students living there."
College Freshman,4,The only sporting event here on campus I have been to is a soccer game. Other than that i have not been to anything but I have heard the games are really good and exciting to go too!
College Sophomore,4,"I have not really looked into any internships or careers yet through Keene, but I have heard great things about the career centers on campus."
College Sophomore,4,I am not apart of any athletics at school but I love attending the sporting events. The fans a school spirit is incredible here at Keene State.
Niche User,2,This school is pretty bad definitely grind and try and transfer out. Won’t get anywhere with a degree from here. Party school. If u want to party than come here because Keene and Plymouth state are the top two party schools I can think of. Which is the only legitimate top 5 classification this school has. Which for some will be for it but is definitely a bad school.
Senior,2,"I am new here, so I freely admit that I don't know everything yet, and that my experiences are very limited. I am not overly impressed, but now totally disappointed, either. Because I came in the Spring (most people already know each other) and I have a single dorm, I basically don't know anyone or have any friends at all. That would probably not be the case had I done a double, and I realize that. But the RA's in this dorm seem like they could care less about making anyone new feel at home. I realize that this is a party school, but because I don't know anyone, I don't know where the parties are at. That's not to say that I'm into partying all the time- if I was I wouldn't have gotten a single- but I do get bored. Academics seem, overall, not that hard. 
On the plus side, the gym/weight room is very satisfactory and I enjoy using it."
College Freshman,2,Police and campus safety are constantly around campus because some one passed out from drinking or from drugs
College Freshman,2,"I know that networking is decent around here, but there isn't much attention behind it, so no one really hears about it."
College Freshman,2,"No one really seems to care much about the sports on campus, so you don't hear too much about them"
College Freshman,2,"I have heard many stories of people getting kicked out, taken to the hospital and just putting themselves in a lot of danger."
College Junior,2,Being an RA I hate seeing the effects that Greek Life has on some of our resident's.
College Sophomore,2,I just have not had the best experience. I wish things went differently.
College Sophomore,2,"I am transferring out of Keene State. The people here are very cliquey, it's like being in highschool all over again. The parties are disgusting. I can't even transfer into my major. The department told me to major in something else and ""shoot"" them an email junior year to try and transfer in. That's not promising. It really is all what you make it and your attitude however, this school is just not for me so I am transferring out."
College Junior,2,"You'll like Keene State if you like heavy drinking, zero diversity, and being surrounded by offensive privileged white kids from New Hampshire. But like any school there are some really cool professors and classes, but it's what you make it."
College Sophomore,2,During the day it is all right with some nice stores and restaurants but they get old quick. The night life does not offer much other than bars.  Due to recent events the towns people are incredibly angry with the students and I am not sure when or if the opinions will change.
College Freshman,2,Not much racial/ethnic diversity here.
College Junior,2,"We are a small white school so while there are a number of openly lgbt students there really are very few students and even fewer faculty of color.  I do not think I've seen a single head-scarf or yarmulke but that is not to say we are not accepting, just not terribly diverse.  It's Northern New England, after all and the college population is fairly well representative of the community population in this town of < 27,000 2 hours from the nearest metropolitan city."
College Junior,2,"I am a long time resident so I see what these crooks charge and I'm appalled.  If the apartments were nice that's one thing but the only places in walking distance that accept students are generally slum-lords and they ask $550 to $700 per month per student  in a small converted place with 4 or 5 students sharing one bathroom and one kitchen.  If you have really good references and a sizable surety there is plenty of clean, reasonably priced housing in the town but not for students who, let's face it, haven't the most glowing record."
College Sophomore,2,"I have received a few scholarships and financial aid, I just wish this world wasn't so occupied with giving financial aid to black, latin, and other people of race other than white. Why do we have to place our ethnic background on financial aid information? We are all people, we breath the same way, eat the same way, and go to the bathroom the same way, so why can't we be treated the same way? This is discriminating against people by selecting people who are not white to receive the scholarship. While the white females who have excellent GPA's will receive nothing. So if you ask me about scholarships and financial aid, I will tell you, this entire United States education is warped and we should start looking at other countries whose education by the way is completely free."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life at Keene is a joke, they aren't even real Greek names and there is one Fraternity that will be found located on other campuses, that is the only legit one. Other than that they are all fake orange people who only care about themselves and pay for people to be their friends. Don't go Greek."
College Senior,2,Usually plenty of spots overall but the good/convenient spots tend to fill up quickly. Many people with commuter passes end up not being able to find spots except for in Winch Lot which is relatively speaking rather far.
College Freshman,2,"With just being a freshman I don't know much about the Biology program, which I just transfered into. From what I have heard though it is not the best, science is not the schools first priority and there is not a lot of choices or special things with the Biology program."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is not big at Keene State College. I support members of a fraternity or sorority's decision to participate in Greek life. However, it is something I will never understand for multiple people."
College Freshman,2,I feel as though I haven't learned much from my teachers at Keene State College. Some of the courses I was put in have not helped me at all. I am undecided about my major and it is very important for me to be enrolled in classes that steer me in the right direction major wise.
College Freshman,2,"As far as parties go, when they get busted you're free to go. Even if you're underage, the police are only breaking up the party for safety reasons. Unless you go waltzing out of a party holding a can of beer, you won't get any trouble. Otherwise, I have seen plenty of instances where these stupid kids get arrested or whatever. RA's frequently write out noise complaints in the dorm room. You WILL get written up if they see bongs, weed, alcohol, etc. in your dorm room. BUT it's easy to get away with as long as you're not stupid."
College Freshman,2,"I was in the biology program and it was okay. I didn't really feel challenged. I had an awful experience with my math professor and the math tutoring center is slow and not very helpful. I will transfer out of Keene because I do not feel like it will prepare me well enough for my future and where I want to end up. Keene is good for elementary ed majors (babysitting majors) who are content partying their lives away at college, but I'm not paying 20,000$ a year to go to crappy parties with rude people."
College Sophomore,2,Computers in library are hard to get online.
College Freshman,2,Keene is not known for their sororities or fraternities. There are few and they are located in bad areas. 
College Freshman,2,I really wish this school was more school-spirited.
College Freshman,2,"I personally do not take part in the party scene, but I do know that a majority of people that I know or are friends with go out and party almost every weekend. It is awkward being one of the only people on my floor that does not drink, but I have my reasons why I don't and people respect it."
College Freshman,2,the food gets old fast and the hours are poor
College Freshman,2,The food gets old quickly
College Freshman,2,The campus staff is not the worst part but the campus safety and keene police. They are very strict and enjoy giving out fines
College Freshman,2,The weather is crazy its either really hot or really cold
College Freshman,2,"Keene is a party school, you really have to try to fail out. Professors are really laid back and as long as you do your work you're fine. "
College Freshman,2,Keene says they're a wireless campus but the wifi is awful sometimes.
College Freshman,2,"I am a biology major, focussing in pre-med. I haven't received any guidance as to what course load to take and feel like I'm entirely on my own in the process. While the science professors I've had have been great, the math ones have been less than helpful. Keene is definitely not cut out with the best biology programs, especially if you plan on going to medical school."
College Junior,2,It seems that the school sells more passes then there are spots. spots are limited and the overflow lot is at the furthest point on campus. Most lots are no more than 5 feet above the river level. It's not strange for campus safety to email the entire campus a hand full of times a year that anyone with a car must move it or it will be flooded. If you have to move your car there's no place for you to park it because of how few spaces there are.
College Sophomore,2,Keene State College is known as a party school and for good reason. Everyone goes out and gets crazy. Peoples parties are constantly shut down and if you go out after 11 be prepared to run into a few drunk people.
College Sophomore,2,"The quality of the dorms vary greatly. If you can afford to buy an expensive nice dorm, you'll love it. But if you can afford it or get one before they run out you will be happy. Also they require you to live on campus but don't have enough rooms. If you are unlucky then the rooms are really old and gross. Some have mold in the walls and permeant dirt into the walls and floors."
College Sophomore,2,Parking availability is good but the upkeep by the school is awful. They don't plow in the winter so if it snows be ready to dig yourself out. Also students that attend the school damage cars and the school does not enforce punishment.
College Senior,2,Parking is not unreasonable. The cost for a permit is expensive for me and sometimes it is hard to find places to park. Violating parking rules is outrageous! a first offense results in a $50 parking ticket.
College Sophomore,2,"We live in a valley so when the weather changes it lasts for a bit longer. The summers can reach over 100 degrees F and the winters can go -20 with wind chill and 4 feet of snow, so we have a very bipolar climate."
College Sophomore,2,"Keene is a great location to go to school. The teachers are nice but the academics are not too challenging. For film production the technology we use is all out of date. The editing programs we learn on are a few years old and the classes do not teach you too much. I learned most my knowledge from my own. Also one of the classes you use old 16mm Bolex cameras which you will not use in the field today. They just recently got new cameras to rent out of the film equipment rental but they are still not the best. The teachers are very nice but if you are not into experimental filmmaking or want to challenge what ""hollywood"" is your films will be looked down upon."
College Sophomore,2,"Quite honestly, there is only one or two departments worth anything. Most of the professors don't have Ph.D's. Many were adjunct. "
College Sophomore,2,"You see Greek groups during Rush week and the Student Involvement fair, but other than that they kind of fade to the background. Definitely not a big deal at KSC. The way I see it they are mostly there for the parties, which most people can get in to."
College Junior,2,Campus safety is a joke. But the Keene police regularly watch the college and use the internet to find the places and things that are illegal and going on. They recently dropped in on a pub crawl because of online postings so you just need to be careful who youre friends with and who youre inviting.
College Senior,2,There isn't much in the way of public transportation. There are shuttles from campus that run almost 24/7 but their hours and days of service are confusing because they change a lot.
College Junior,2,"I have been at a  party where there was cocaine. And I hear alot about people doing drugs like that. However,  I never really see it so it isn't that bad. There is ALOT of marijuana though. Almost at every party."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Worth the Money – The off-campus housing options are very dirty. I have only lived on-campus and have not spent much time in the off-campus options, I also have not seen that many. However, the few that I have seen and just from the outside appearance I would not invest money into them. People destroy them while living in them. The low quality of the off-campus housing leads me to Keene's on-campus options."
College Sophomore,2,"Low Quality and Poor Choices – Keene State Dinning offers a low quality menu with poor choices. While dinning at Keene I feel as though I am not eating a well balanced meal because of the added oils and fats. Most nights my dinners consist of sandwiches and cereal. Along with the poor choices, the food makes me sick. When I come back to the dinning hall after a period of being away I have to take time transiting to what the food does to my body. Which consists of bad stomach pains and low energy."
College Junior,2,"Hit, Miss – The school is a little slow getting things together and the financial aid statements don't usually come out until about two weeks before the bill, so it's a bit of a hassle. My first two years I was rewarded with a substantial financial aid package. Due to my family's income, I qualified for a bunch of federal and state assistance programs. However, this past year, the state legislature decided to reduce the university system of New Hampshire's budget by fifty percent (the largest cut in state history). As a result, my tuition has skyrocketed and I am struggling to pay for just my tuition alone, never mind room, board, and books. If you're a student living in NH, looking to save money on a state school, you might want to look elsewhere."
College Junior,2,"Alcohol Use Rampant; Marijuana a Close Second – Keene State College is a ""party school"". Expect to see a lot of alcohol use most nights of the week, barring Mondays, Tuesdays and finals. For freshman, the party scene is rampant; for example, a student in my dorm freshman year had been drinking from the moment his folks left for home. The fraternities have been known to be sketchy, as well, and a few have been shut down recently due to excessive partying and reported rapes. Marijuana use is also rampant and highly accepted. Students often smoke right outside of their dorms with little fear of reprisal. As for harder drugs, stories go around about seniors using stimulants to get through challenging finals, but nothing concrete."
College Junior,2,"Gives You a Chance. Typically the campus officers only get involved if they're called. First offense, depending on who's involved (merely campus vs town police) can be lenient and take you stuff, maybe a fine. Though court is sometimes involved. Arrests and expulsion are typically based on violence: physical or otherwise. Discrimination is not tolerated."
College Senior,2,Tuition Assistance Hassel – I am still working on getting my National Guard Tuition Assistance that's owed... 8 months later.
College Senior,2,Keene state does nothing to deter reported bullies.
College Senior,2,Lacking of direction and ability to help those in need. Maybe New Hampshire schools just get less financial aid or something.
College Junior,2,If you can nap a parking spot then you are lucky! It is also pretty expensive.
College Freshman,2,"There are a few computer labs on campus, which is convenient, but only one of them has a scanner that can be used for getting accurate scans of things such as legal documents, artwork, etc. This results in a lot of traffic in that particular lab. Furthermore, the internet speed in the dorms is incredibly unreliable, as it ranges from average to abysmal. However, it's tolerable and motivated students can still get their work done."
College Junior,2,I am now a junior in college almost into my senior year. This past semester my friend's and I were looking to buy a house or apartment to live in for our senior year. We had difficulty with a particular landlord who tried to get us to buy every house we saw without explaining all of the details. The houses were expensive and did not include utilities for the most part. The houses that we saw were no where near worth the amount of money that was being asked of each month.
College Senior,2,Not Too Great – I have lived at 3 different off-campus places throughout college. Many of the landlords around here are not very good. An average room costs $500 - $600 a month. Much of the off-campus housing is located in family neighborhoods which can lead to problems.
College Freshman,2,Students here do not take their work seriously. No one seems to be thinking about their future or finding a job. The only thing kids here worry about is if they have enough alcohol to last the weekend...
College Freshman,2,"Nothing to do but go to Main Street which gets old very fast, or go to wal-mart. New Hampshire is the most boring, and culturally deprived state I have ever been in."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Much Here – Keene is your smaller than average town with not much off campus. In the school we have plenty of clubs and events to keep you occupied but outside we've got a few god stores and resteurants on Main st. and that's about it. Besides that we've got wally world, target and a movie theater with crappy service and prices that'll make you take out a second student loan."
Alum,1,"A sad college experience for me. A waste of time and money. The student body is trashy and cliquish. There is no diversity of thought. To be honest, even on my first day there, I felt as though I did not fit. My orientation group leader--who was supposed to make us feel welcome--told me when we got into the cafeteria ""you can sit anywhere you want"", when I clearly knew nobody and was going to sit with them, as I knew NOBODY. This girl that was deemed to be mature (otherwise she wouldn't have been entrusted with the responsibility) was totally unqualified to do what she as doing. I obviously knew nobody and she didn't care, and likely didn't want me to sit with the orientation group. I came as a transfer student (the school seriously SUCKS for transfer students, ask anybody). 

Head of my major acted like NHTI is some foreign school when my credits didn't perfectly transfer. Supposedly, transferring credits from the CC system of NH into a state university is supposed to be easy."
Alum,1,"A sad college experience for me. A waste of time, money, and youth. The student body is trashy and cliquish. There is no diversity of thought. To be honest, even on my first day there, I felt as though I did not fit.

Sophomore,1,I do not live on campus and all of the clubs I signed up for are taking place during my classes or when I am working so I haven't been able to meet anyone
Niche User,1,"You should avoid this college (Keene State) like the plague unless your
primary goal for going to college is to have fun.  My nephew graduated with $110K in student loads and is working retail for minimum wage."
Sophomore,1,"absolutely robs you with tuition, fines, parking tickets, fees and gives you nothing in return. do not recommend unless you are majoring in drinking."
College Freshman,1,"Classes are either too easy, or way too overwhelming to get by"
College Freshman,1,"The dorms were the part that I probably hated the most here. Everyone is my building drinks excessively, and if you don't drink like they do, then your'e considered an outcast. The dorms are also constantly messy, because all of the residents have no care for how clean it is, and the RA's don't seem to care much either."
College Freshman,1,"This school makes me feel like I am wasting my time. The food is very consistent, making for a boring meal a lot of the time. The dorms are very dirty, even though they are cleaned almost daily. This is because the students in these dorms go crazy, and there isn't much done by the RA's to solve this. The campus is very small, and a lot of the time I find myself very bored, because I don't like to go out and drink and do drugs, as the rest of the campus does."
College Senior,1,Greek life seems so pointless. You have to pay to be a part of something and feel accepted? It's exclusionary and propels its own stereotypes by not changing for the better.
College Senior,1,The financial aid office is extremely rude and unhelpful. They rarely know the answers to questions that you may have and they often try to dissuade people from applying for grants because it means more work for them.
College Freshman,1,"Everyone drinks and everyone smokes. It's as simple as that. You will definitely feel left out if you're not into that stuff. Also, good luck sleeping on weekends and getting anything done (especially if you're in a freshman dorm)."
College Freshman,1,"When you're a freshman, prepare to lower your expectations. Lots of time spent walking around aimlessly looking for parties that don't exist or get busted within half an hour. The parties suck. If they don't get busted almost immediately, you end up standing in a packed house where you can barely move. Also, bring your own alcohol because I was never once provided alcohol at a party. You need connections to go the good parties here, trust me.

Supposedly there's more options when you turn 21 and can go to bars and stuff downtown if you're into that."
College Junior,1,There is a lot of visibility of drugs on campus.  Most people are using some sort of drug.  The weekends are abundant with parties and the smell of pot.  Keene is pretty much a party school.  You feel extremely uncomfortable and left out if you don't take part.  The enforcement is terrible.  Not only are drugs easy to get your hands on but easy to slip by the authorities.
College Sophomore,1,"There's hardly any parking at any time of the day except the late evening. The Winchester Lot is quite out of the way, and the walk to campus from there is a little crude, including a rusty bridge, unplowed parking lot, and little lighting at night time. The nearby lot is good location wise, but it's always filled way too quickly. Always get there at least 20-30 minutes ahead of time to give yourself walk time. Also, the Winchester lot requires the driver to drive down the road one way specifically. If you come from the opposite direction, you have to turn around."
College Junior,1,"There isn't much diversity, although they are working on it. It is mostly white, a few blacks, a few asians, a few spanish and others."
College Sophomore,1,There is little to no diversity. Mostly everyone is white.
College Sophomore,1,"The food is ok, but everything closes early. If you like to eat real food past 7pm, (not just burgers and fries) don't go here."
College Sophomore,1,"I transferred out. I'm a serious student, not a spoiled child who parties every weekend and gets drunk in their dorm. This isn't a college it's high school part 2. "
College Sophomore,1,"Really, there is no college worse with parking. You will get towed or ticketed every time. I feel like campus safety needs something to do in the tiny town so they go around and ticket people."
College Junior,1,The only good thing about the transportation at keene state is that you can take a shuttle bus to specific places but if you are going to Keene State from off campus then its very possible that you will not get parking. and parking passes cost a lot and there is no guarantee that you will get a place to park. Plus the on campus tickets are at minimum $60 so you know where they are trying to get their money from.

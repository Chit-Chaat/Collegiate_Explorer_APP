Junior,5,"Had a great experience on Online classes at UWF. Professors always helped a lot, and the classes were usually recorded, so I could watch it whenever I felt like doing it."
Junior,5,"Besides being part of the soccer team, UWF gave me so many great experiences. I believe that the professors are great (besides one or two that I had), and that the people are very welcoming. I had a great time in Pensacola"
Alum,5,"I've attended several universities - Florida State University, Virginia Tech, George Washington University - and yet the best value by far is that of UWF.

Many of the poor reviews I see are for majors such as Art History, Literature, or Music. This is not a surprise as UWF, while located in historic Pensacola, is actually sandwiched between several of the largest Air Force and Naval air bases on the planet. The focus of the faculty and staff is to support the military community and their families/dependents, whose focus in turn is far more often on the hard sciences, engineering, and mathematics. In this regard, the school excels. They offer many undergraduate and graduate STEM degrees that are appropriately accredited and can lead to excellent employment opportunities, the same as any of the big name schools in the state - I'm living proof.

TL;DR - You don't choose UWF if you want to live in a ""cultural"" hub or a party school. You choose UWF for the knowledge per unit dollar value."
Alum,5,"I've only taken 1 online class with UWF, a Java programming course, which was executed satisfactorily."
Senior,5,"So far, I enjoy the online experience with UWF more than the in person experience. I do not have a complaint for it honestly. I feel as though the teachers are more attentive and help the students more than in in person classes. I have received more help this semester than in any of my previous ones."
Alum,5,I took several classes online and I felt like the teachers were very attentive to the student's needs.
Sophomore,5,"I have not taken any courses online yet, but I feel as though if I were to have to go online, everything would go smoothly"
Sophomore,5,"The campus is beautiful and everyone I have met has been so nice. I transferred down here from Missouri to be close to the beach and I absolutely love it. I have been to visit campus a couple times and even though school hasnâ€™t started yet, all of my advisors have been so supportive during these crazy times with the corona virus, me recently changing my major, and also moving!"
Senior,5,Amenities at UWF are amazing. The staff is very supportive and cares about the success of the students. The campus is beautiful and has nature trails to decompress from stressful days. It is within walking distance of stores and many food places.
Senior,5,Due to COVID academics were forced to go online. It was a rough transition but professors adjusted quickly and were always welcoming feedback.
Sophomore,5,"I've so far enjoyed UWF, I chose it because it is a smaller university but still a university experience and close to home for me. It has a very welcoming feel, the campus doesn't seem overwhelming, the classes weren't too easy or too challenging. My experience with professors has always been positive as well as students."
Graduate Student,5,University of West Florida online campus has great resources for students taking classes remotely. Their integrated online experience allows students in other locations to log in to classes while professors lecture to both students in class and in real time online. Students online can ask questions via the chat feature and interact with other students as well as the professor.

Sophomore,5,"Honestly, going here I wasn't sure how I was going to like it since it was 6 hours away from home and I knew no one. However 2 years later I have fallen in love with UWF and the campus. I joined greek life to make more friends since again I didnt know anyone from my hometown there. I meet so many people and am truly glad I took the leap and decided to go here after only visiting Pensacola the month before decision day. The best decision I ever made the university has helped me build friendships and relationships with people in and out of my program. I got a job on campus this past year relating to my major and was also one of the best decisions I have had. UWF has really made me step out of my comfort zone completely from the courses I am taking to getting an internship right when I started college. The campus is also super beautiful with a nature trail as well as just feeling surrounded by nature walking from class to class. It's also only about 30 minutes from the beach!"
Junior,5,I absolutely love this school. I attended a different college before transferring here and the differences are extensive. UWF provides a much better environment for me as a student and makes a genuine effort to care for me as an individual.
Graduate Student,5,"Currently, I am a graduate student taking all my classes virtually. Despite not being able to attend UWF physically I am familiar with the area. It is a safe and fun environment for students to continue their education. So far, the professors have been nothing short of great. I recommend UWF to all aspiring undergraduate as well as graduate students."
Sophomore,5,"Faculty and Staff and Administration are very understanding. They're people too, after all, and completely care for your safety and education!"
Junior,5,"I love attending the University of West Florida! I think it is a great choice, especially for in-state students who also enjoy the cozy community atmosphere."
Niche User,5,I am an incoming freshman at UWF and can not wait to start! The people and atmosphere are hard workers to make sure everyone's needs are met. The university is extremely welcoming in every aspect.
Niche User,5,All of my siblings really enjoyed their time at UWF. The campus is gorgeous and it was the perfect distance from home.
Freshman,5,"When I visited the campus, it was truly beautiful.  The students showing me around were so friendly and answered any questions I had.  The dorms are well secured and are great living spaces. The overall campus was very safe and the location is great! Close to the beach and to the downtown area so it is not a long drive. A great campus and university and I can not wait to be an Argo in the fall of this year!"
Freshman,5,"Great environment, great city, great university! The athletic department here is pretty good, the campus is beautiful and the library is everything a student need to strive!"
Freshman,5,Every time I have had an issue with my online account or a question of the college itself the help desk was very quick and informative!
Junior,5,The University of West Florida is an incredible college that is dedicated to the well-being and growth of their students. The faculty is amazing and genuinely cares for every student. Pensacola is a calm town that has a lot to do.
Freshman,5,"The University of West Florida provided me with the opportunity to have many great opportunities to explore different revenues for my future through the different clubs and activities within the University and in the city of Pensacola, Florida as well. At the University of West Florida there are so many tutoring and student services available with the tuition! While, like any other University, parking is an issue, it is a wonderful thing because it shows how much UWF has grown! Not only have they grown in the size of student occupancy, their four-year football team just won the Division Two NCAA Football National Championship! There are many ways to get involved through the hundreds of extracurricular activities on campus, greek life, and the different organizations formed within Pensacola, Florida."
Freshman,5,UWF has an amazing cybersecurity program! I really encourage anyone who enjoys computer to attend UWF. Our program is constantly improving and soon to become the best in the nation!
Freshman,5,"The University of West Florida is an amazing school. It has offered me ample opportunities, connections, and a great education. The teachers have always been incredibly kind and helpful. They are masters in their areas and have many things to teach students. They provided me with an immense amount of resources and made sure I was receiving a quality education. However, while academics is very important to the University of West Florida and a huge priority there, they offer much more. It was through playing intermural sports, joining Greek life, and interacting with other students where I made many connections. UWF is an amazing school with many opportunities for those who attend it."
Niche User,5,the university staff is very knowledgeable. Classes are well planned. The online program is very convenient.
Freshman,5,"I am an upcoming freshman at the University of West Florida. Just from walking around the campus to visit, it is clear to see the vision that the faculty and staff have for the students as well as the overall program. I believe that this college is, if you will, a ""top-notch"" school with academics, sports, and overall student life."
Sophomore,5,My experience at UWF has been the best time of my life so far. The atmosphere and the friendly people are so welcoming and humble.
Sophomore,5,"The full college experience tucked away in a cozy forest, this college does a great job at making everyone feel like they belong, and they do!"
Sophomore,5,I've only been in the University this semester and I proudly can say that I love it because the teachers and advisors are very great. The school programs and resources are very helpful.
Freshman,5,"I am a student at the Univesity of West Florida, and the university itself has it all together. They have many opportunities to meet new people and be more connected with the school community. They also have resources for tutoring and they make sure their students are doing well and that they know the material that they are learning. The university also has lots of counseling options to make sure that the students feel safe and know that they have someone to talk to. Overall the school itself is very inclusive and I personally know someone everywhere I go on campus, because of events and meeting new people throughout the beginning of the year. the schooling itself is very inclusive, all of the teachers want you to succeed and they want the students to understand the material and if you are having trouble you can talk to them and they will try and figure out a way to compromise with the situation that you are in."
Niche User,5,"The professors are excellent and super friendly when it comes to succeeding in the class.  They will gladly work out a schedule for you when you need a little extra help.  The campus is always clean, and the staff is very friendly.  Free tutor sessions are available for many classes, and you can always stay up late at the library to cram an essay in."
Freshman,5,beautiful campus and friendly students! staff is also very nice! the food is enjoyable as well! there are plenty of events and activities for you to be involved in thereâ€™s never a dull moment at university of west florida!

Senior,5,"I have loved my experience at the University of West Florida, the campus is lovely, the people are kind and helpful, and the courses offered are interesting and enjoyable."
Freshman,5,"There are a lot of student resources to utilize at UWF, everyone is extremely helpful and the campus is clean, easy to navigate, and well kept. So far I haven't encountered any issues with my scheduling, living on campus, or managing a part time job as everyone is very supportive in the community and living on campus is like being part of a family."
Senior,5,"It is a beautiful campus! Every person I have had the pleasure of meeting has been friendly and helpful. The professors here are some of the best I have ever had. The only thing I would change if I could would be the times between classes. Some start within ten minutes of each other and your building could be across campus! With such a large campus, things like that cannot be avoided sadly."
Senior,5,I am a senior and the program's instructors make it possible for people to learn fast. This University is filled with opportunities to excel in you major so long as your willing to look and willing to work!
Senior,5,Small class sizes mean more individualized attention from professors. Professors really care about students. Challenging yet doable academics.
Freshman,5,The small campus allows students to connect and still be comfortable with those around them.  The campus is surrounded by beautiful scenery and lots of historical areas.
Freshman,5,"Overall I have enjoyed UWF, they have a smaller campus that makes it easy to get around to classed. They also make sure to keep class sizes small in order to maximize student and teacher relationships."
Senior,5,It was a great school for academic and athletics is alright. but the area is great and the campus is beautiful!
Senior,5,The University of West Florida is a growing DII school. The facilities are all new with top of the line accessories. There is a short 15-20 minute drive to downtown Pensacola where the night life is great for younger and even older adults. A 20-25 minute drive will take you to our white sandy beaches and emerald green water. Our athletic programs have been high caliber for years now along with our new football team that made it to the DII National Championship in their first two seasons. UWF is a great place to meet life long friends and receive a fantastic education.
Senior,5,The University of West Florida provides excellent assistance in attaining a credible degree in the field of engineering. One huge positive factor that stands out to me for this university is its priority and focus towards acquiring a well-paid job after attaining a degree.
Sophomore,5,I love that the campus is so close to the beach and that the people are so friendly! Everything that you need is close by and the school offers a trolley service that transports you on and off campus!
Senior,5,I love this university. The small classroom sizes make for a personal and integrated learning style. The professors always go out of there way to ensure you are understanding the content and even help you get internships outside of school.
Junior,5,I like the location. It's close to home. The professors are all very helpful and actually want to see their students succeed in life. The connections with everyone is so great. Close together but still has that college feel
Junior,5,"UWF has a beautiful campus and it has an engaging college community. Especially if you live on campus, it is tailored to make sure that you have all the resources you need to succeed as a student. There are plenty of campus events hosted that showcases different job opportunities, professional schooling opportunities (like law school), and just generally other events for the pleasure of the students here!"
Sophomore,5,I love West Florida. It was an easy campus to navigate with great professors. They are willing to help outside of class and help with intern and career opportunities.
Sophomore,5,"I love that University of West Florida is such a positive community. I feel very at ease during my journey here because of my amazing peers, teachers, and advisors. The campus is gorgeous and easy to navigate."
Freshman,5,The campus is very nice. I love that it's a small campus but still has sorority options. Their gym is state of the art with a lot of activities to choose from. The class sizes are small and the professors have more office time with you. The admissions staff is so nice and were extremely helpful.
Senior,5,"The University of West Florida is a great university with a wonderful staff who is dedicated to preparing students for the future. The only thing I wish would change is the parking. There are an increasing number of students; however, an unchanging number of parking spots. Other than that, I really enjoy going to this University and am thankful to attend this school."
Senior,5,"University of West Florida is a beautiful school, and is growing rapidly since the time I have been here. The students are very nice, and the professors wants to see you succeed. The class sizes are ideal, and its a very open community. There is plenty for you to do to get involved, with many clubs, organizations, and even greek life. There is also the beautiful Pensacola beach, and downtown Pensacola which is a sight to see."
Junior,5,"I like UWF because I have had a very personal experience with my classmates and professors. Professors actually make an effort to know students by their names and it is easy to make friends with classmates. I have lived in the town next to Pensacola my whole life, so I pretty much grew up in Pensacola. I never thought I would enjoy going to UWF as much as I do. It gives me that ""homey"" feeling, has a beautiful campus, and gives me a great education."
Sophomore,5,"I am a transfer student from Ivy Tech Community College in Indiana. I am currently in my second semester as an online student at UWF and have loved every minute of it. I have never liked school, but they have made it so efficient and feasible, especially as a full time employee as well. UWF is the only school that I was able to find that had an ""all online"" program for healthcare administration. If it weren't for UWF online, I would not be able to work and go to school. Financially, I would not be able to afford it. Attending UWF has, by far, been the best decision I've ever made!"
Sophomore,5,"They have a program for almost anything, with teachers that are passionate about their subjects. The campus is beautiful, and nature is visible everywhere you look. The food and activities are exquisite, and our sports teams are always determined to win."
Junior,5,"I have really loved going to UWF. I lived in a dorm for a year, and I have had an on-campus job my entire time going here. I love this school and everything I have learned here, and I am excited to continue learning here over the next two years. I couldn't imagine going to a different university."
Senior,5,"My experience at the University of West Florida is excellent. The university provides a very student-friendly as well as environmental-friendly campus. The professors, advisors and other faculty members are truly helpful in acing your educational goals. As a transfer student from the Philippines, I admire how every classroom has these technologies that serve as easy and better educational tools for the students."
Senior,4,"My experience at the University of West Florida was an emotional rollercoaster. My grades have always been slightly above average. I think the landscape of the school is very beautiful, including the big U-W-F letter bushes at the front entrance to the school. However, I believe a small portion of professors lacked the desire to help students succeed. Freely giving an ""A"" in a class is wrong, but the professor should do everything in their power to make sure that the final grades are the highest that every student could have rightfully earned."
Alum,4,I enjoyed the small class sizes because I was able to get to know my teachers. The professors genuinely care about their students.
Sophomore,4,I have taken multiple online classes through UWF and also plan on returning fully online so that's to support I enjoy and do well with online classes. They are well paced and I don't feel overwhelmed at all.
Sophomore,4,"I've taken a total of 6 classes online throughout the last few semesters. As well as 2 more because of COVID-19 as we had to switch to online learning. I have never had any issues with online classes or even with the in person classes transitioning to online as my professors have always been super understanding. The two professors I had in person did an outstanding job transitioning to online learning in a matter of days so props to them. Overall, I would recommend."
Senior,4,"they were okay. I had some classes that were easy online and others that should not be taken online. Overall, it was great going on my own pace with online classes and often times, they ended early in the semester so I was able to focus on my other classes once the online ones were over."
Senior,4,"Great college. Wonderful professors (especially the psychology department) and truly care about teaching their students. The financial aid and housing department can sometimes be a pain, but it wasn't too bad. The library is great to meet with friends, study in your own little room you can reserve,  and an excellent place to use advanced and new technology available for the students. The only ""bad"" thing about UWF was parking. You would have to get on campus about 30 minutes before your class to get a spot. There were multiple times i would arrive to campus on time but would be late to my class because I could not find a parking spot. Also, make sure to have a parking pass! Parking services WILL give you a ticket if you do not have a parking pass, your parking pass is expired, and even if you do not have a parking pass in the GUEST parking spot. Still, I have enjoyed my time at UWF and the memories can never be replaced with something greater."
Freshman,4,Application process was simple. Lots of majors to choose from. Campus is small but big at the same time.
Alum,4,This university was amazing. The science department was incredible with so many amazing opportunities to work hands on in the field. I got this amazing chance to assist grad students with shark DNA research. The parking is rough and as well as I didn't see the passion in the English department like I did with the science department. Overall great undergrad school!
Alum,4,"I enjoyed that UWF has an open and easily accessible campus. The professors were easy to communicate with, cared about the student's grades and helped them (me) be successful in my degree field. I enjoyed that as an alumni of UWF, I have access to their gym any time I would like. UWF is diverse and offers many on campus and off campus study and focus groups. I would like to see more diversity and more degree programs that center around social work and psychology."
Senior,4,I love how seamless it is to pick classes and get in touch with my advisor. The campus is very big but you get used to locating where all the classes are located very quickly. Professor's will go out of their way to assist you as long as you give them proper time to do so.
Sophomore,4,"UWF is an excellent school with a beautiful campus. However, itâ€™s quality of programs vary depending on the field. While their nursing and biomedical programs are top-notch others, such as their political science department, are lacking."
Niche User,4,"UWF is a wonderful school. I am a dual enrollment student pursuing an AA there and plan to finish my Bachelor's there as well. I have had only had two truly bad professors and I was given the opportunity to rate their performance at the end of the semester. If you check out the profs beforehand on rate my professor, you can usually determine who is good to take. Most of the teachers are excellent. 

The campus is beautiful but I live off-campus and love the local area as well."
Sophomore,4,"University of West Florida has brought me an abundance of opportunities that I never would have thought possible. From life-long friendships, to amazing professors, to career connections, the incredible argonaut community has blessed me on countless occasions. There is constant support throughout the entire campus and an administrative board that knows you by name and cares about your individual success."
Sophomore,4,"The University of West Florida is a wonderful medium sized university with a beautiful campus. The university has a high acceptance rate and a variety of great professors. My biggest problem with the campus would be the difficulty to find parking spaces, but the campus still handles parking better than many other universities."
Freshman,4,"My experience at UWF has been amazing. Transitioning from Jax to Pensacola has not been easy, but the resources and people at this campus has made it worth wile."
Junior,4,This university gave me a sense of self. It is filled with a diverse population and professors who actually care about your success.
Junior,4,I love West Florida! The professors are very professional yet personal. They are extremely easy to contact and they will work with you. The only thing I would change is the parking. There is such a lack of parking for the number of commuters. And the parking passes cost an arm and a leg.
Junior,4,"It's a beautiful campus; however, I would love to see a larger attendance of students at campus events."
Junior,4,Currently a junior in Cybersecurity. This is a great school with ample opportunities to flourish. The campus is beautiful.
Niche User,4,"I loved the campus and the surroundings like the beach and the area looks very clean. Location, is really second to none just minutes from great beaches and after school activities. Value, for a state school that has a lot to offer in course programs it is affordable. smaller class size, professors are always attending the needs of their students during office hours, even when extended during final exam week, and last plenty of opportunities in research outside of classroom activities"
Sophomore,4,"The staff at UWF has been quite helpful to me throughout my educational journey, but the student offices are not always the most helpful or clear with their communication. The campus is gorgeous and there is abundant signage around campus to help students find their way."
Sophomore,4,"Good majority of the professors seem pretty chill. Also lots of clubs and partying.  Though some of the facilities do need improving, and they're currently renevating some of the areas."
Freshman,4,"I am starting in the fall and they have been like a second family to me! Very helpful and great to work with.
We live in Germany and so it is not the easiest of moves but they have made it accommodating and painless."
Sophomore,4,I love the campus vibe and its scenery. Everyone is so nice and inclusive and there is always something to do on campus.
Sophomore,4,Great college to attend. I've only attended classes for one semester so far but I cannot complain. The teachers I've had were amazing and willing to help when you need them. Great atmosphere when walking on campus. Everyone seems safe and on a mission to learn. My biology advisor is amazing. Sheâ€™s willing to meet with me in person or on the phone when needed and usually responds to emails within 24 hours. Overall my experience has been great with the University of West Florida. I canâ€™t wait to continue my education and graduate with a Bachelorâ€™s degree. Very exciting times!
Junior,4,"I moved from South Florida and have felt at home in Pensacola, and even more so at UWF! Small class sizes and very caring instructors. Easy to build a personal relationship with other students and staff, and very helpful in building a network to use for post-graduation."
Junior,4,"What I liked about The University of West Florida was that it was local to me, so not a far drive. The campus itself was laid out nicely, and easy to find buildings. Some professors were incredible, others not so much. I would like to see change in parking, seeing that there is never enough for students."
Graduate Student,4,"I take all my classes online, and I like the online setup. People from the college call me way too often, and it bugs the hell out of me. I'm already paying for school - leave me alone!"
Freshman,4,"The University of West Florida was one of the best decisions of my life! This school allowed me to continue my swimming passion while opening opportunities for my career. Not only does the school offer great programs and class sizes, but it also offers many on campus events that are free to students. Iâ€™ll have to say, that the Cab events offered by UWF have been some of my best memories. Overall, I highly recommend checking it out and beginning your journey as an Argo."
Freshman,4,"UWF has a phenomenal talent for dealing with students who have special needs, as far as I know they are one of the best schools in the nation for helping handicapped students, although I am not a member of that community specifically, I am glad to know I am a part of a school who takes care of individuals in such a caring, and understanding way.  Continually, the STEM program here is amazing!  My one gripe to keep it from getting 5 stars, is the myuwf homepage, as it is poorly designed and non-intuitive in most ways, however seeing as I use that page nearly every day, it is somewhat of a large problem.  Overall though, in terms of learning, and campus enjoyment, absolutely lovely college!"
Niche User,4,"University of West Florida is truly a great place. It is a small enough school that you're able to have a good connection with teachers, but it also has a good amount of students to where you still feel like you're in college. Beautiful place too!"
Freshman,4,"Itâ€™s a great experience, everyone is nice and willing to learn with each other and become better students and I just love the scenery. The diversity is good and I would recommend it to a lot of people if they want to get their education around great people."
Junior,4,"The professors are very welcoming and understanding including the administration and workers on campus. The busses are available for transportation to classes on campus and stores off campus. I love the various halls and the friendly RAs. The campus is constantly making improvements so it's hard to think of what the University could do to make it better. The diversity of the school, however, could be improved to help other students feel safe or more welcomed."
Sophomore,4,"I really like UWF they have many research opportunities and most professors are very helpful whenever you have a question. I would like UWF to improve their food and some of their buildings which are old, but everything else is great!"
Sophomore,4,"UWF is surrounded by woods and has plenty of trees and lawns in-between buildings, with a nature trail going over a pond, its a perfect place for biology and environmental majors. I've personally had fun attending the research symposiums and getting to know other students and their ambitions there. The University could use more security though, we need to have a couple more emergency contact phones out on the trails, since cell service is unreliable out there and sexual assault does happen on campus. Also, there are a variety of places to get food, not just at the Nautilus market and Galley, such as a hidden restaurant in building 86 that makes great sandwiches (Gusto's), a smoothie shop right before the stairs to the gym, a pizza place connected to President's Hall, events hosted by the mathematics and science departments, and a food truck at the wooden platform hangout area."
Junior,4,Student life is pretty average.  Sport events are fun to attend though.  Decent food selection.  College town is alright but there are limited things to do during the weekend.
Niche User,4,"The campus is beautiful, I have a couple of friends who are currently going to school at West Florida and they love it. I have heard nothing but good things about the school and the area surrounding it. I get pictures all of the time of the campus from them. I have always wanted to visit West Florida and see it in person, but I have not been able to get around to it yet. Hopefully one day soon I can take a tour!"
Junior,4,It is a beautiful campus filled with a large diversity of students.  The only negative thing that I experienced was how difficult it was to get in contact with my advisors.
Sophomore,4,"UWF is my home away from home. The classes are not too large, and the professors are approachable and knowledgeable. I made many friends within my first week, and the campus life is pretty alive with something happening all the time. Itâ€™s got amazing nature trails thatâ€™s free to the public to walk, run, or bike around. Itâ€™s not all too expensive compared to other Florida colleges."
Junior,4,I really enjoy the environment. It's very positive and the professors make time for their students when they need help.
Senior,4,"Even though UWF is located in a small town and has a small enrollment number, the classes offered are hard and they make you work for your grades. There are not a lot of classes offered all year long unless you are in a large program."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at The University of West Florida. The professors were always available to help students. The university is located in a small town, which means there are not that many distractions."
Junior,4,"Uwf is a great school! However it could definitely use some more parking spaces for student, especially considering the crazy high price of a parking permit. I've never paid more than $20 for one before so being charged an extra $100 on top of that is a little ridiculous"
Junior,4,"The University of West Florida is a great school to attend. The one thing that attracted me to this school is the small class sizes, and their study abroad programs. The teachers for the most part are awesome, and they are always willing to help. The one thing that I would want my university to improve on is being more diverse and recruiting more students of color, so that the school can represents all walks of life. Overall, my experience at UWF as been great and I hope that other can see the value of this school as well."
Sophomore,4,The campus is very pretty. love the student life. The professors are average but there are the ones that understand and actually cares about the well being of their students.
Freshman,4,"I am an international student so for me it was a big change of life style. However, the staff welcomed me very well and accompanied me in all my semester."
Senior,4,"It has a good design program, but some things make you feel they are just trying to get as much money from you as they can"
Sophomore,4,"I love the canpus. Instead of building huge unnatural buildings, UWF opted to build their campus alongside trees, hills, and nature. The school is located in Pensacola, which is a bit of a boring city with no nightlife, but that only strengthens the academics."
Sophomore,4,"The professors have a close relationship with their students and I feel are more involved in trying to reach out and help because not every class is so big. I love how quiet it can be during the weeks, there's not a party going on every night to distract you. They're starting to build more things around the campus to eat and other resources."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore at UWF majoring in Marine Biology and would say my experience so far has been good. I do not live on campus but have friends that do and they love the dorms. I will say that science department is very large for the size of the school so class availability is limited. However, there are a lot of resources provided to students."
Junior,4,The Campus community is outstanding. The organizations try their best to reach out to everyone and have a niche available for all students. The food service is my only big concern - wait time is unrealistic and so are the new proportions.
Freshman,4,"They offer many options to help you succeed whether it be the free book rentals in the library, the on campus psychologists, or even just the caring staff.  A lot of the staff try to accommodate with your learning methods, but some are stuck in their old ways which may make the class seem difficult."
Junior,4,"I'm currently a Junior at West Florida, and my experience has been very good so far, there are small class sizes and involved instructors that are always open to assist their students."
Alum,4,"I received a good education at a fairly low price compared to other universities. Because it is a small school, the professors are generally willing to help at any time and are quick to respond to emails. Most professors are there in order to see the students succeed, and the university puts a lot of emphasis on undergraduate and graduate research."
Sophomore,4,"I like how diverse the campus is and how well they want to interact with people. Because they are doing a good job interacting with students on campus I do not think there is any they need to work on, at the moment however, Iâ€™m excited about future plans/ events that may come in the future school years."
Graduate Student,4,"UWF is great, the professors are knowledgeable. The social scene isn't great, but it does exist. The area is alright, there isn't much to do around Pensacola except the beaches and clubs at night."
Junior,4,"Still going great school, but it's a location where racism is real. So if your professor or TA doesn't like the color of your skin you not getting a grade like you should and compared to other student of the majority color you won't.  Sad but true. 
My living opinion."
Graduate Student,4,Over all this university has a lot to offer like different types of programs and online. I graduated with my BS in public health. The college is not to big or small.
Senior,4,"I would like to see more diversity and community involvement. UWF cultural differentiation is poor, as well as the fact that the location is not good for growth. People typically use UWF as a step stool into greater things."
Sophomore,4,Getting into classes you need is somewhat of a pain because there's SO many people trying to get in at the same time. Instructors are easy to reach and make the classes worthwhile. I'm happy with my experience so far!
Junior,2,"I started in fall 2019 that can only be described with the word cluster****. Their entrance staff in admissions failed to correctly apply the transfer credits, as I started the process at another local college to get the ""required"" amount of credits, I discovered while getting paperwork that would guarantee that these classes would transfer in, that they had not counted my credits from a state college. By the time I discovered this, I had less than 3 hours to get admitted, schedule an advisement session, schedule the classes, meet with the VA rep, change the VA paperwork, get my books and the other time consuming  tasks while they sat on this information for over 2+ months while not having the common courtesy to let me know. In addition they failed to tell me about the second or third sessions that I could have taken to get a start in college. To this day over a year later, they still have not bothered to let me know what steps are in place to prevent this from happening."
Sophomore,2,"UWF online is a hot mess. On one hand I understand a lot of professors struggle with the online portion however, I feel there should be a training for these professors to help them. Not a single one of my professors who went online (in the Art Department) adapted well and it left my classes feeling chaotic."
Sophomore,2,"The campus is beautiful but it is very spread out which makes living off campus a little difficult because there isn't much parking on campus. Luckily there are busses that come around to even the remote parts of campus if you have to park far. The professors aren't the best and on several occasions I had professors who didn't seem qualified to teach what they were but they were selected because UWF was short on staff. I have also had a few very good professors, unfortunately the bad outnumbered the good. They are a growing campus and just got a football team so the social life on campus has begun to expand past Greek life."
Senior,2,Uwf is a beach school . Retired town and a lot of things to do on the beach . Small city and school as well
College Sophomore,2,I am a history major so there are not many students jobs in my field available.
College Sophomore,2,The student housing is nothing special. They are cold and cramped and not very homey.
College Sophomore,2,I am not a fan of the Greek Life. They take over everything. They are everywhere.
College Sophomore,2,I have had bad experiences with my roommates and so has my girlfriend. It seems most of the students here are not clean people. The dorms look nice though. The best dorm to me is village east because they have an oven inside of the units.
College Sophomore,2,"Well, most people that don't care about Greek life, are not socially impacted by them. they have little impact on the campus. They have their own housing available on campus."
College Freshman,2,I honestly did not like living on campus besides the fact it was kinda close to classes.
College Junior,2,The problem with campus housing is that it's so far away from the classrooms.
College Freshman,2,Go to office hours and they will bump your grade up
College Freshman,2,The parties are small and always the same people. The greek parties are the only parties and their so small and stuck up. Theres a few bars and clubs downtown that are good but its far from campus and if you're under 21 you can't get into most of them on the weekend.
College Freshman,2,Theres usually only greek parties and theyre so small and stuck up. Its always the same people and it feels really cliquey
College Freshman,2,Teachers don't teach too well but still want to assign plenty of work.
College Freshman,2,"There has been multiple criminal situations that could've resulted in death if it wasn't for god. The campus sends out emails when something bad happens but the emails are so broad we only know ""there was a rape"" etc. A description saying ""the suspect was a black male"" is NOT helpful."
College Freshman,2,"The campus doesn't really make events for older students or commuters. If they do, they don't let us know about it. My high school had more events to keep people involved than this college. This campus is boring. Visually its a pretty campus but I'm worried I'm not getting the education that I will need to get into medical school. 90% of professors need to be re-evaluated on how they teach, assign things, and how to prepare students for exams."
College Freshman,2,"Out of 10 professors I've had these past 2 semesters, only 2 professors ACTUALLY knew what they were doing. Everyone else had to be constantly corrected by students, or didn't know how to teach the material and was proud that their class exam averages were D's or F's."
College Freshman,2,"Not happy with classes, location, and people"
College Senior,2,"I was an RA and lived on campus for two years, the housing and resident life department has a lot of work to do to become competent."
College Freshman,2,I personally don't like greek life
College Sophomore,2,I receive several emails about sexusl assault on the campus. I believe security at night needs to increase.
College Sophomore,2,"Maybe I'm just out of the loop, but it seems like most students don't really care about UWF athletics unless they're actually and athlete. The only thing that's getting attention is that we're getting a football team in 2016. Woohoo."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm pretty sure the only place anyone ever goes to party is Seville Quarter. I've never been because I'm not into partying very much, but I've heard it's pretty trashy."
College Sophomore,2,Parking services are honestly one of the worst things about having a car on campus. They are out to get you.
College Sophomore,2,I was given a scholarship and was told I could use it towards university costs other than tuition. Come the first week of the semester it wasn't working the way I was told it would and as soon as I starting asking questions one lady straight up told me I was lied to. Not cool.
College Freshman,2,"Not great, and not a lot of variety."
College Sophomore,2,"The food here at the University of West Florida could definitely be better. For now, I only eat it because I don't want to waste the meal plan I bought, which was very expensive for what it gets you. There is no variety whatsoever and the food has a tendency to make the students here sick. Also, the time everything closes is not convenient at all. On weekends the market closes at 7:00pm and everything else is either closed or closes extremely early."
College Junior,2,I have never heard of such
College Freshman,2,I only received one small scholarship that barely covers a quarter of my tuition and i have had trouble getting scholarships to help pay for the rest.
College Freshman,2,"I dont want to pay for friends, but greeks are very cliquey"
College Senior,2,They make things difficult for you and applying for Summer financial aid cannot be done online.
College Sophomore,2,It's cold almost everyday of the year except for the first and last month of school. Sometimes it rains pretty heavy.
College Student,2,"A lot of water and rain/flooding on campus, rains out of no where!!"
College Student,2,Nice to have rent-able equipment but connectivity needs to improve!
College Freshman,2,I am always going to be dealing with it.
College Junior,2,It's over $100 for a resident spot and where you can and can't park is SO confusing. I hate it!
College Freshman,2,You literally have to beg for additional state grants
College Sophomore,2,"Financial Aid is first come, first serve, but they don't even stick to that well. They like to offer out loans much more than anything else, so if you don't want those start applying for scholarships."
College Junior,2,"There are drinkers everywhere. The school provides on campus alcohol in order to somewhat limit the bar time. The think if legal adults can get in there then they won't go off-campus and have to deal with drinking in excess and driving, etc."
College Junior,2,"you have to have your own car because the campus is buried in the woods, which is pretty, but too hard to walk to. Can't depend on public transportation because it's not reliable."
College Junior,2,it is a must to bring your own technology
College Sophomore,2,"There is absolutely nothing to do here. The things you can do you have to be 21 to go to, and even that limits you to people who like to drink, which isn't everyone, including myself."
College Freshman,2,"If you aren't a part of Greek life, you will be bored."
College Freshman,2,I can never get a connection
College Sophomore,2,"University of West Florida is not a party school, per say, but many freshman tell divulge their real reason for picking UWF. ""It's the farthest I could away from my parents without going out of state."" Naturally, most of this type of students leave once their partying has affected their grades enough.

HOWEVER, once you're a sophomore or junior, it's hardly a problem at all."
College Freshman,2,"I'm so done with the campus dining hall, it gives me no benefits and eating the same thing day by day just gets old. "
College Freshman,2,"I don't yet have a car, but from secondhand experience with my friends who drive they have complained to no end about the availability of parking on campus."
College Junior,2,"Permit costs have sky-rocketed and so have the ticketing and fines. A car isn't really necessary since the main way to get to your classes is by walking. There's not much parking space available, and the parking lots are usually small."
College Junior,2,"Campus police are ignorant, rent-a-cops. Beware of their stupidity. "
College Junior,2,All kinds of people from all over.
College Junior,2,The school shuttle goes to one shopping complex and back. No bars or any other stops along the way. 
College Freshman,2,I dont like it at all.
College Senior,2,The school is growing and the parking availability is not. There is virtually no parking off-campus and the on-campus parking fills up quickly these days.
College Senior,2,Greek life is not worth the money here. I have joined and dropped after a year. 
College Senior,2,"There is not much around campus, especially for underage. Transportation is impossible, a cab is very rare to find. Prices are low for drinks and a cover charge is almost nonexistent."
College Senior,2,"It was a nightmare. I received barely anything for financial assistance and my mother is the only one able to work in my family. 

I would advise that the application is done plenty of time before, just incase there are any mistakes are things that need to be changed."
College Senior,2,Parking is horrendous. I always find myself having to get to class an hour early just to find a parking spot. I would rather take really early morning classes or night classes just to dodge the struggle in finding a parking spot. 
College Junior,2,"Most professors are very good at UWF, unlike Pensacola State College. Registration is pretty easy and can do online for the most part."
College Junior,2,"I hear about internships every now and then, but there definitely could be more...especially for less experienced students...most expect a huge portfolio"
Junior,1,"Due to Covid, the professors were expecting the same level of excellence as the in person classes, there was no leniency or understanding.  Being a working college student who had a state mandate to work overtime  usually 96+ hours a week."
Alum,1,"I went into the school with credits in Differential Equations only to be told my CAL 2 requirement hadn't been met (it was). When I showed them my transcripts as evidence, they said their school was just better and they don't transfer credits from other schools. Honestly, I just left after that, with just an AA Computer Science, but I was able to start the career I wanted (Computer Engineering) without the BS in Computer Engineering they said I'd need.

I can honestly say that I didn't learn anything new and I hadn't developed any new skills during my time there. It was my first step in realizing the lack of value a college degree is in the IT world. Tech advancement is years ahead of what colleges are able to keep pace with. For example, UWF failed to teach me about Docker, Linux, Python, and AWS while putting an arbitrary emphasis on math. Yes math is important, but learning how to navigate Stack Overflow is a vastly more useful skill than solving integrals."
Alum,1,"UWF was the biggest waste of time and money in my life. I sunk tens of thousands of dollars into it before I realized what was happening. They nickel & dime you for everything.

It's not a welcoming environment, the faculty couldn't care less about your career opportunities or advancement. I was insulted on multiple occasions & at every turn they asked for more money.

Parking was a nightmare with restricted lots and horrendous fees/fines. I did a lot of walking in my time there. It's like they pretend the campus is a privately owned city. They even have their own fake police force that is hyper vigilant about arbitrary parking violations so they can take even more money from you for parking you're already paying too much for.

Horror Story:

My car was totalled in a flood & I attempted to w/draw from a class due to financial hardships and inaccessible transportation, they didn't do it correctly & I was charged twice for the class with no refunds.

Don't waste your money at UWF."
Niche User,1,Grounds keeper or assistant womenâ€™s soccer coach is a total jerk. Drove up in his white jeep and made overally aggressive remarks to my wife and I about where to run with our dog. (An 8 pound puppy). As a die hard argonauts supporter this was surprising. As a D1 sports family we thought it to be pretty comical.
Niche User,1,"My experience with UWF was not a good one. I could not seem to do good in my courses even though I study. Some professors are good but they can't seem to give tests that were at least similar to what it was tough. The process for applying for special accommodations was almost impossible, lots of hurdles before it was finally approve and it was a temporary approval. They do have excellent counselors and the in-state tuition is reasonable."
College Sophomore,1,Registration is unorganized if you even know when it is.
College Junior,1,We get an email almost at least 1-3 times a month about sexual assaults occurring.
College Freshman,1,"Like I said, from SOME (not all) of the professors I've had, are not the best teachers. I worry about my education."
College Senior,1,I believe Greek Life should be banned in all schools. They act like they are philanthropic but they use this to cover up their alcoholic and sexist nature. Many of their parties always ends up with a girl getting sexually assaulted or raped. I don't understand why any parent would want their daughter to join a sorority.
College Sophomore,1,We are incredibly boring people
College Freshman,1,The school did not help me with any financial aid.
Recent Alumnus,1,When it's warm out things are great but it rains A LOT In pensacola and it can get pretty bad sometimes. There's trolley that can pick/drop you off but they're often over full on rainy days.....you're still expected to go to class though !
College Sophomore,1,I only can receive loans
College Freshman,1,WHites outnumber everyone and its somewhat of segregation between all of the races
College Freshman,1,"I have had the worst college experience ever. I lived with a roommate that I did not get along with the whole semester, I was told to pay for things I still have not used, and the housing is terrible."
College Freshman,1,THe dorms dont have wifi
College Freshman,1,It's not even something you hear about its so small
College Freshman,1,They told me they accepted some of the scholarships I had but once I started my classes they told me they did not accept them anymore.
College Freshman,1,"The off campus dining is horrible, unless you want to drive all the way to Pensacola Beach for a meal."
College Junior,1,"The Parking on campus sucks, so many students are late to class daily due to this issue. The parking enforcers ticket your car for having to make parking spaces due to insufficient parking for students."
College Junior,1,the student population has increased dramatically over the last few years and parking is terrible. make sure you are parked in the right decal parking and are able to search for at least 15 minutes for a spot
College Sophomore,1,The University of West Florida is not really diverse. I was really disappointed.
College Freshman,1,"There is very limited parking during the day.  The parking spaces are not well marked and I got a ticket.  Sometimes, the parking patrol is rude and unhelpful.  I wish they would expand parking as they have greatly increased enrollment."
College Student,1,"Parking can be ridiculous, especially if you are a commuter. I would arrive on campus at least 30 minutes to an hour early just to get a parking spot. Since commuters are only allowed to park in designated areas, those areas were usually very far away from my classes, once again making me get up earlier than I have to."
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is pretty bad, you've got to drive to class about half an hour early to be able to find a spot, and even then it can be difficult to find any spots. Especially if you want to park near the commons. It's better in the late afternoon or at night, but morning classes are the absolute worst to try to find parking."
College Sophomore,1,Parking in the summer is the best as many students to not attend summer terms. Fall and spring can be a nightmare as UWF desperately needs more parking. You have to pay what I feel is a bit too much for parking only to not be able to find an adequate location close to your class buildings is bothersome. If you park in the wrong area or on the road side you will get a ticket yet others without parking permits seem to never get tickets and can park using student parking. You do not need a car if living on campus as everything is walkable and the university has its own trolleys. The campus without a doubt needs to add a couple parking garages.
College Freshman,1,"I see drugs mostly everyday, if that's including smoking cigaretts, then yeah everyday."
College Junior,1,"Have some decent dining places on campus but you can only use the meal plan for the commons, which has to be one of the worst university commons around. If you're paying with cash or card, there's good places like Quizno's, Papa John's, and Argo Galley which includes a bar."
College Junior,1,Ick. I always have to park way far out and walk all the way across campus because I can never find good parking close to my classes
College Freshman,1,"The school is growing every year, but the parking is barely growing with it. This could be a problem in a year"
College Junior,1,Parking on campus is terrible! The campus is working on getting a parking garage in the next few years. It'll help with the crazy parking. Students spend 30 minutes to an hour driving around the parking lots trying to find parking prior to class. A lot of students are late due to trying to find a spot.
College Freshman,1,Run Away! The food here is terrible! Same mush everyday! Everything is just bland and old is seems like. For as much as they charge for the meal plan you would think the food quality would be better.
College Junior,1,"If You Have a Car or Commute Regularly, I Feel Sorry for You. Parking is a nightmare. You MUST buy a parking decal at this school that costs quite a pretty penny YET, there is no parking available after 8 am in the morning. If you park where your decal is not permitted if there is NO other parking available you get an obnoxiously priced ticket by the campus police and their little student workers. Good luck, buy a bike."
College Sophomore,1,Not very much parking. BE CAREFUL where you park because they will give you tickets!
College Senior,1,Parking Is Terrible. The costs of parking passes and parking tickets have almost doubled but the parking space has actually been reduced by building construction.  There aren't enough buses or trolleys to alleviate the need to drive to campus and therefore alleviate the parking problem.
College Senior,1,"Printing System â€“ The new WEPA printing system is not advantageous to students, it is simply a savings for the University and in the end it costs the students far more in both money and time.  It is frustrating to use."
College Sophomore,1,"The school only pulls for scholarships once a year for new students or transfers, if you happen to enroll in the college after they have done their selections, then the student is out of luck."
College Senior,1,Parking on campus can be a nightmare. Be sure to get to campus at least 30 minutes before your class to ensure you'll get a space and make it to class on time. Also make sure you buy a decal as quickly as you can at the beginning of the year so you won't get a parking ticket which could cost you up to $50 dollars depending on where you park.
College Sophomore,1,"Awful. Horrible. Everything in between. The parking options are terrible and the fact that the police department here is extremely strict on it doesn't help. It's extremely rare that your appeal can get approved. $25 a ticket, and they can ADD UP!"
College Senior,1,"Good Luck Finding It â€“ Consistently, students who drive to campus have difficulty finding parking close to their classes in under 30min. of circling the parking lots. I say this having heard the complaint from other students. I don't ever worry about parking since I am carfree and either ride a bike or walk to campus. Bicycle parking in the last three semesters has been unusually crowded due to people realizing that trying to find a parking spot is a waste of time."

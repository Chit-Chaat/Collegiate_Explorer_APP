Freshman,5,I think the online experience is done here the best that they can. Labs allow you to take home equipment so you can get similar experiences at home as in class.
Sophomore,5,I have thoroughly enjoyed attending UAA online. I like being in the comfort of my own home and still having full access to professors and timeliness on answers to questions. Most of my professor have offered recorded or even live lectures to simulate an in class experience.
Senior,5,"I applied for 1 course online this semester and 3 in person; obviously, they're all online this semester. The 3 in person are now Zoom classes. I'm still able to listen, ask questions, and interact with other students. The online course is incredibly easy to work around. I know on Sunday what my expectations for the week are and have 7 days to accomplish them. It turns out to be more than enough time."
Senior,5,"Beautiful campus, incredibly helpful, knowledgeable and friendly professors. Interesting courses to take in pursuing degree goals. This university is also willing to work with other universities to help students combine credits for graduation achievement purposes."
Freshman,5,"The inclusion and diversity, plus the beautiful natural surrounding landscapes enriched my experience."
Freshman,5,"So far, my experience at UAA has been great! All of the professors I've had are nice and very helpful. They want their students to succeed."
Freshman,5,My online learning experience at The University of Alaska Anchorage has been excellent. The courses are very easy to navigate on Blackboard.
Sophomore,5,Great experience with most of my instructors. Most are worried about their students passing their classes. They take the time to check on you and make sure you dont fall behind.
Sophomore,5,I am currently doing online prereqs to pursue my RN degree. So far I have really had a great experience except for ONE teacher. I guess thats everywhere though!
Freshman,5,"I love the diversity and openness that UAA has to offer. They have provided me with many opportunities to explore and really find what I want to do with my life. Even before I was at the age to be in college they provided opportunities for me to take college classes, as a  high schooler. Because of this I was able expand my education and knowledge in ways I never would have without it. This way I was able to apply the credits that I earned for both college and high school."
Junior,5,I like the availability of classes offered. One think that was a hindrance would definitely be the availability of parking.
Freshman,5,"The professors are very personable and as a result, understanding that life happens and will work with you if anything happens. The dorms are very minimal l, but are furnished with a desk, bed, dresser, and closets. Like most things in life, everything is first come, first serve, but they provide a lot of GER classes, so those aren't too hard to get into."
Graduate Student,5,"I had a great experience at UAA. The instructors were available, attentive to the student needs, and willing to make time for students if need additional assistance."
Alum,5,Overall good experience. The engineering program is very prominent. There is a subway on campus what accepts meal plan money.
Graduate Student,5,A big education with a small college feel. Classroom sizes make it easy to make friends and get one on one help from the professors. Dorm life is great and there are tons of social activities. Always feel safe on campus. Really looking forward to the next 3 years. The student body is very diverse.
Senior,5,"I am a senior in a science major and I am able to take all of my classes online.  UAA offers a diverse and active online curriculum because the population of Alaska is so spread out and many people don't live near Anchorage.  I have been able to take science labs online, with great results.  The cost is economical and I have found my learning experience to be challenging and enjoyable.  Highly recommended!"
Freshman,5,My experience with UAA was very good so far. The professors are top notch and willing to help when you need it. It is a large campus but does not have the large University feel so there are more one on one relationships between students and faculty. I would recommend it to anyone.
Freshman,5,"I've only been going to UAA for the past two semesters, however, I have had nothing but good experiences. The professors are all very knowledgable, and the campus is bright and friendly. There are a lot of opportunities for transportation, and if you choose to walk, the Alaskan nature and natural beauty are unignorable."
Freshman,5,"I love UAA because it is a smaller University so the class sizes are more manageable with professors. It's easier to make personal relationships with both professors and peers. There is also a wide range of clubs, sports, and class options. The campus is relatively small so it's harder to get lost and everything is within walking distance. To top it off, it's absolutely beautiful. The morning classes get to watch the sunrise every morning as class starts, and there is almost always a beautiful view of the mountains."
Freshman,5,"I haven't actually attended yet, as I am a freshmen going into college, however, from what I've heard it is amazing. I honestly can't wait to go there and start working towards the career I want to work in! The campus seems beautiful, and the fact that it is in Anchorage, Alaska, makes me even more excited."
Alum,5,"I love the University of Alaska Anchorage. They have helped me build a future for myself. The faculty members are wonderful as well. It would open many more opportunities for UAA if they added a supervised area for children so that parents also could go to their classes with peace of mind. Also It would really help the community if they had SAT prepping classes or study groups offered to better help those transitioning from high school to college. Lastly, More classes offered in rural areas."
Freshman,5,"I am in my first year, and so far everybody I have encountered has been pretty friendly. I have taken away a lot from each of the classes I have taken so far."
Senior,5,You get a great sense of community with UAA. This college looks out for their students and provides help and assistance whenever needed. All staff is friendly and ready to provide the best experience possible.
Niche User,5,"Currently I am in high school, I am going to be attending UAA. My siblings have gone there and I have went to look at UAA and I think its a great school to go to. They offer programs such as WWAMI. They have many more to offer and they really help you finish your goals and your dreams."
Niche User,5,"My current experience with UAA has been very good, However, I have only been to the Mat-Su campus. and am starting there this January. I recommend meeting with your Academic advisor before choosing your college, and talking one on one with students at the campus you plan on attending."
Niche User,5,There is many engaging opportunities at UAA. The classes are very interactive. The university is filled with immense diversity and support. There are opportunities you'll be able to see here that aren't offered in much bigger schools.
Niche User,5,my experience was amazing and I definitely wouldn't change a thing. this school fits every person in Alaska and helps in anyway they can.
Junior,5,"UAA has been a great place to continue my academic career. Coming from a small island in the Pacific Ocean, culture shock was not a big problem for me transferring to UAA. The friendly environment and laid back personality of UAA made my transition more easier. So far, I am glad I chose UAA."
Graduate Student,5,"It allowed me to obtain a degree for pretty cheap. But if I had the option, I would go out of state for college."
Freshman,5,I love how my university has caring faculty members whom I can reach out for help when I needed. It is a diverse university and very kind students everywhere you go. The professors are genuinely wonderful because they will always remind you about upcoming deadlines and I believe that they try to help student as much as they possibly can.
Senior,5,I like the college. I attend many of theirs courses online as well at satellite locations such as their classes on the local military installation and in Eagle River.
Junior,5,I honestly love my school. The professors are all super nice. Classes are offered at times that allow for my work schedule and the campus area is beautiful!
Junior,5,"The school is fairly up to date for Alaska, the teachers are great and the student population is very diverse."
Freshman,5,It was an amazing school with amazing people. I loved the teachers and the academics. I felt valued.
Junior,5,"So far I have had a good experience. The area is very pretty, and the school seems to want to help in any area they can. My professors have all been knowledgeable in the area they teach and are willing to go out of their way to help you. I have also never had any safety concerns which I am grateful for!"
Junior,5,I absolutely love the teachers they are very caring. They have a great nursing program. I would definitely recommend this school because it has a lot of degrees available. It also has technical programs that are very broad.
Sophomore,5,Uaa is a great place to go to for college different things to see and if you’ve never been to Alaska it’s a good chance to come.
Sophomore,5,The University of Alaska Anchorage have great Professor that cares for their student. They are willing to help their students pass their classes.
Junior,5,I like how friendly and helpful everyone is. I have liked all the teachers that I have had so far. The campus is easy to get around.
Freshman,5,"My experience at this University thus far was great. Professors are very helpful about everything. They helped you on the things you need, especially when your struggling throughout the course. They go above and beyond, in order for the students success in the class. Overall, i highly recommend this University to someone."
Freshman,5,This year is my freshmen year and I love all the help I can get. There are so many programs that benefit the students at UAA. My experience has been great and the orientations that I went through in high school really helped me have a sneak peak before I started college at UAA.
Sophomore,5,"The University of Alaska at Anchorage is an amazing college where bright people pair with bright teachers to collaborate and solve our communities problems. Alaska's largest university is here so that we can develop a stronger, smarter community for our generations. And they succeed in doing that."
Sophomore,5,"University of Alaska is a great school for international students, out of state students, and in state students. They have many resouces and opportunities. The nursing and dental programs are one of the top programs in the US and we get many students that come here for them."
Freshman,5,I have just recently started going to uaa it has been a positive experience in so many ways but then it has its ups and downs finding classes are difficult thus being that all the buildings are spread out
Freshman,5,"The way the Professor's  challenge you to reach your highest potential.  Not only in academics but also in training their students and preparing them to excel beyond academia. The inviting and safe feeling the staff provides.  Generous in giving of their time to assist individuals in reaching their goal.  The professionalism and patience was genuine. The quality of education I've received thus far has exceeded my expectations and has helpeed me to grow in ways I did not think possible. The campus itself felt like home, it provided me with resources and the technology to perform tasks needed to meet the requirements for my classes. The work load for each class was appropriate.  It is a very high functioning institution, very well kept.  Overall, I've had an amazing experience and there isn't any thing I would change."
Junior,5,"I'm an older student, and I have had such a wonderful experience going back to school after so many years."
Sophomore,5,The University of Alaska Anchorage is a fantastic college. They have a wide variety of degree programs ranging from OECs to Masters Degrees. The housing options are comfortable and make you feel right at home. Teachers are always available for conference and assistance if need be and are generally quick to reply with e-communications.
Niche User,5,"friendly people and great environment. Great volleyball too,  safe, happy environment. Love watching they're volleyball games"
Freshman,5,"Very nice campus, I the dorms are pretty nice except for the beds. My bed was very uncomfortable. The meal plan is not very good. The food is not the best, they do not have variety of food every day. They serve different meals every day and most of it is food I do not want, so I normally get to eat food I want three times a week."
Junior,5,I have been a student at University of Alaska Anchorage for a few years now. It is one of the best colleges I have attended (I have attended a few due to my husband being in the US ARMY). I am finally persuing my dream in becoming a RN and start the School of Nursing this fall.
Freshman,5,Such a great University. I'm so happy I chose this school in order to acquire and further my education.
Sophomore,5,"It's a great campus. You get the classes and all the perks of a big university (ie quality) but the size of a smaller university which is nice. The only complaint is not enough parking, but that seems to be the case at any university."
Junior,5,"I like the University of Anchorage because all the staff and teachers care about their students, and they are really comprehensive. I also like the University system."
Sophomore,5,"I go to MatSu College, which is a branch of of UAA. Though I do not take any classes at the University of Alaska Anchorage campus, I have been there. The facility is nice and well kept, but its too cold and you have to take a bus or drive if you don't want to freeze during the winter to get to building to building. As for my review on MatSu, it is wonderful. I take classes here and a few online from another branch of UAA. The teachers at MatSu are nice, and the facility has options to help you learn."
Junior,5,I love University of Alaska Anchorage. It's conveniently located and easy to get around on campus. It has a great gym that I love going to. Counselors are extremely helpful when it comes to picking courses. I'm glad I didn't have to go out of state.
Sophomore,5,I enjoy attending the University of Alaska Anchorage because there is an active student body who support one another in athletics and in the classroom. The facilities are clean and conveniently located as well. I feel safe on campus and there are plenty of activities to get involved with. Go Seawolves!
Sophomore,5,"I feel that uaa is a very welcoming university, and has traditional and older students. It's diverse and a great place to get an education."
Senior,5,"So far, I'm enjoying beeing a UAA student. People are very nice here and it's easy to focus on school when everybody nice around you. UAA has a standard education system and I can't say that they created something new. Honestly, I would not change anything in UAA because it's already a decent University even though it located in Alaska."
Freshman,5,"Great campus awesome athletic lots of wildlife and resources to help students
Uaa awesome i can't wait to another year there"
Freshman,5,The university is largely spread out. Professors are generous and very helpful. The overall quality of UAA is oustanding.
Freshman,4,The University of Alaska Anchorage has made the college decision process fairly easy. The website is easily accessible and there are a lot of helpful resources and navigational tools that can be used to help find what you're looking for. With COVID-19 still around the University offers many different ways you can explore the campus through virtual college visits.
Freshman,4,"Although I did not take any classes, the University has made it easy to explore their school through their website. It was easy to navigate and had a lot of important information."
Freshman,4,"I like the SkyBridge. It allows me to move across campus in the winter comfortably. The shuttles are really useful, too. The professors are all really helpful and seem to enjoy teaching and office hours."
Junior,4,"It really depends on the teacher.  A good teacher does an excellent job, a teacher who is not invested makes learning on-line harder for students."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy this university because it is close to home, and it also participates in programs with colleges from Washington and Oregon for in state tuition. This university also has expanded their medical programs and started offering a PA program within the last 10 years. I would like UAA to expand their capacity for nursing and continue to develop the medical degrees it offers. Students are often leaving state to attend nursing programs due to the wait list at UAA. If they had more teachers they would push more nurses through."
Sophomore,4,"I have enjoyed my time at the University of Alaska. I am currently enrolled through the Matsu Bourgh chapter and have good experiences with most of the professors and other staff members. There have been a few professors that are very hard to understand and learn from, but most of the time the professors have been very helpful and understanding."
Sophomore,4,While the school has an abundance of user-friendly online platforms from the library to science classes. A lot of professors have a hard time teaching over the computer. I have had a few pretty good experiences but have also had some poor experiences as well.
Sophomore,4,"I'm a sophomore here at UAA. So far I've had no complaints about the university at all. They have a lot of programs, mostly in the health field, but still offer a wide variety. The teachers I have taken so far are awesome, but might have been because I used RateMyProfessor. The campus is kinda spread out, which is kinda a hassle to get to classes sometimes. Overall it's a great campus and pretty affordable for in-state residents."
Sophomore,4,"I've taken a couple of online classes here and I would say the teachers that are prepared for them. The ones who have had their class set up like that from the beginning are awesome. When the classes transited to zoom due to covid, some teachers weren't the best. However that makes sense because they are not used to the teaching style."
Freshman,4,"I did take all of my classes online. I did mention before that I started in the middle of the pandemic so campus was closed off. The classes I took were mainly psychology, writing, and art. Overall, the professors did an amazing job despite a semi last minute notice on how classes would be delivered. I had some trouble navigating Blackboard since it was my first time using it, but there were a couple of links that helped me out. I also found it helpful that some of my professors included the textbook material in the course so I didn't have to purchase a physical copy. Overall, my experience was smooth but I would find it more engaging if they included some of their own lectures."
Freshman,4,"I started college during the middle of the pandemic so I was unable to fully experience the on-campus lifestyle, but I did I like how my professors were constantly reaching out through blackboard and email to make sure we understood the material. I wish the University would be able to make the classes that are required for each major more clear. I did have to dig around and ask my advisor for a list of classes in order to make sure that I was on track. It would be helpful if they had some sort of link to this information."
Senior,4,"UAA is often times the only choice for post secondary education for Alaska's young adults due many not being prepared for other colleges. But just because it's the only choice, that doesn't make it a poor one. UAA has amazing staff and faculty that really care about student success and are always willing to put in extra time and effort for students that reach out.

I am almost done with two BAs in Langauges and English and am very glad to have choosen UAA. My German professor helped secure me a national scholarship to teach in Germany this winter after my degrees are complete. I also got the opportunity to get involved with school and local politics here while doing student government."
Freshman,4,The online platform was well designed and the academic staff was great in the delivery of materials.
Sophomore,4,"I've so far loved most of my online courses through UAA, but some classes had their ups and downs, but more downs than ups. But, it is usually just the professor and their communication with the class/one-on-one with their students."
Sophomore,4,UAA is a great school to take nursing courses in. I give it a 4/5 because I have only done a few in-person classes and can't say much about in-person stuff but the online courses are always pretty well laid out
Freshman,4,"Beautiful campus and beautiful buildings. Although the dorms are not close to the classes, it is a beautiful walk and the shuttles (for the most part) are a reliable source of transportation. The campus has a laid-back vibe and is very easy to navigate. The food was delicious. It was nice not having communial bathrooms and the bedrooms were nice. There is a lack of college spirit, partially because of the lack of sports and how few people live in the dorms. If you don’t have a car, it is hard to get to off-campus locations or other fun activities."
Freshman,4,"I took two online classes my first semester, had to convert all of my classes online due to the pandemic, and am now taking an online class over the summer. The professors do their best and do a good job."
Niche User,4,"They are very quick to respond and are very good at simplifying things, but the website is slightly hard to use."
Sophomore,4,"The professors are extremely helpful and encouraging. The campus is gorgeous with the mountains to one side and ocean to the other. They offer a wide range of classes. A negative would have to be the budget cuts. Over the next couple years the University is going to be cutting a huge portion of money which will cut a lot of professors and classes. Some programs will entirely be cut, so make sure you check about yours!"
Sophomore,4,"The University of Alaska Anchorage is an outstanding School. Almost all of the Professors are truly understanding and try to work with each student so that we all pass, and with the small class sizes it is easy to learn and easy to truly get to know you classmates."
Niche User,4,"There are a lot of opportunities for virtual learning and long-distance classes. I received high-quality instruction from my English professor and the class sizes are small, which gives more opportunity for individualized learning and teacher attention."
Junior,4,"So far, my experience with this university has been good. The professors are helpful, and the students are engaged and love to learn. My only critique is how the arts programs are treated, but they aren't too bad."
Freshman,4,"I went to one of the colleges that branch off of the main campus, Mat-Su College. It's definitely smaller than most colleges but larger than others in the state of Alaska. I enjoyed that factor of the Mat-Su Campus, with less people there are less cliches and no bullying present. The teachers I had knew what they were teaching and knew how to represent it so that their students could understand it. One bummer thing about the school was the lack of entertaining college activities but I understand that for those thing they are more at the main campus where there are a sufficient amount of students to attend those activities."
Freshman,4,"The advisors are on top of their game. I’ve had advising for two different programs (I was considering another field) and UAA has a welcoming and caring atmosphere towards their students. They do their best to support their students, and it shows wherever you are on campus."
Sophomore,4,All the living halls have been redone within the past three years and the Macs within the past six years. The university even has a student-run place for students to get free food. There are shuttles that run from housing all over campus and the University has a deal with the city where all you do is show your school id and you can use the city buses when and where ever you please. As far as safety there is an app for a virtual walk home and if you go past the amount of time it should take the campus police will follow the signal to make sure you are ok. The night before classes Fred Meyers is shut down for the university students to get market down school supplies and the shuttle provides transportation to and from the event.  As far as classes typically there are no classes on Friday and you have two weeks once classes start to drop or add any without having to pay.
Niche User,4,haven't started yet but evry excited to see what uaa has in store for me. the area around uaa seems nice and a very quite campus.
Freshman,4,"it’s alright, pretty simple school. they do have events but you won’t always hear about them. the sports are pretty fun to go to. they do have a monthly event where our student fees come into"
Sophomore,4,"I've had a good experience with UAA, with excellent professors that are knowledgeable and help make the information interesting. The university website could be improved, as some of the UAOnline features seem a bit archaic in how they function and display information. All in all, I am very happy with UAA."
Alum,4,"The University of Alaska Anchorage is a good, affordable, Division II university. There is decent and reliable public transportation to and from the University which makes commuting easy. The Consortium Library is huge and has a lot of space to study. Parking can be confusing and difficult as more and more students attend UAA, but there are other options for students who find this strenuous."
Sophomore,4,"I started college after I graduated from high school in the year 2016. I come from a rural village in Alaska, so it was quite interesting being on a huge campus with many cultures. For me, it took a while to adjust being away from home, but I had high hopes to being apart of campus and it's life. My first semester, I joined as many Alaskan Native programs that have a community sense to it, and it really helped me being away from family.

The programs I joined had mentors that went though the same situation I had, so I got a lot of advice on how to handle study sessions and how to be interactive in my classes. I, also, found a niche on campus and made some really good friends. Overall, even though being in the engineering program with all the stresses of rigorous courses, it made my first year feel like a breeze. I love my campus, and the family I made here, and it's made me believe that I can accomplish my lifelong goal of being an engineer."
Sophomore,4,"Staff and professors alike are committed to students' success as they go into the workforce or go on to study for another degree. The only issue is that there have been numerous budget cuts to the university. While it is not the institution's fault, it is more related to the state budget, it creates stress among the student body."
Junior,4,for the most part I haven't really had any problems with UAA. the parking can be a bit much. if I could say one thing I would say is that they need to focus more money on faculty and staff instead of buying new buildings.
Junior,4,"University of Alaska Anchorage is the largest state campus in Alaska. It is great for those working while trying to complete a degree and offers a plethora of online classes to accommodate a full time work schedule. My only personal complaint is the rising costs of tuition which seem to increase every year. Additionally, I believe the school can invest in more money for parking rather than aesthetic features to the campus like new statues."
Senior,4,"I love that campus is so close to my house and that I wasn't required to live in the dorms for any period of my education. A lot of people don't like UAA because they want to get out of Anchorage, but I think your college experience is what you make it! If you're determined to have fun, you will have fun. If you're determined that your life will suck, then your life will suck... I personally enjoy UAA and can't wait to graduate in less than a year."
Freshman,4,"My first day in the university was excited. I back out in one class because there were more than hundred of student in the class. During the semester, I realized I will have to attend more class with that much of students because that's how college life are. I know most professor requirement expected student to do stuff out of class, but not all student have the same scheduled on their calendar. Some may have busier schedule than other, but they just have to meet the requirement to pass the class. I hope all professor understand that concepts and will do what's best for themselves and the student for their future career."
Niche User,4,"I personally haven't started classes, but based on what friends and family have told me I've heard its not perfect but it is a very good college, and above the top when compared to Alaska."
Junior,4,"Overall I’ve had a good experience at UAA. They have the major I need, it took a while to get into their competitive nursing program but I eventually got in. I believe it’s a very accesible campus where I find what I need when I need it."
Senior,4,"I chose this school because it was the most affordable to me, and had the degree I wanted, however (at least in my degree) the professors were very helpful and made learning fun. It’s definitely a commuter campus, so I didn’t do many activities, but it got the job done as a college."
Graduate Student,4,UAA is a great campus with a ton of local beauty.  The library is very good and the librarians extremely helpful.  I am taking online classes.  And the attention from the professors is excellent.  I feel like I am a valued member in class and the expectations to contribute are high.  Which leads to a dynamic and positive learning environment.
Freshman,4,"Overall, the school is amazing. You get the ‘real’ college life experience here and have quality professors that are exceptional in their field. The only con to this university is how spread out the offices are. Different departments have offices distributed throughout town, and this can be bothersome for students without cars or reliable means of transportation."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the student dynamic here. People are friendly, and I enjoy the environment. I am able to connect with many people, and my professors have all been kind, but wonderful at teaching. There are many student events, so you feel involved."
Freshman,4,The campus is easy to get around using the shuttles and there are many places to get help on homework and other things like that. There are a lot of people that you can meet and become friends with. There are a lot of staff who are happy to help with your needs.
Junior,4,"So far my experience at this university has been great. There is still a slight problem of discrimination with some of the teachers in this university that I had to deal with. Maybe some teacher don't know they are being discriminatory against somebody until they are told of it. But over all, the teachers are great."
Freshman,4,"I always was wondering when I stepped through those doors. What my life would be like on the other side. Where people were busy and understanding the transition from high school and college I thought would be difficult. But in reality, I had always dreamed of going to college. Breakfast with desserts in the morning? Why not? Lunch in when I call for it? Why not? Dinner at any time as long as it wasn't 1AM? Why not? Studying all those hours, and the friends I made as just a stepping stone to be a better person in the future. Thanks UAA."
Senior,4,"Good College, Good value for education. Some professors are great while others not so much. Small community college feel at an actual university"
Freshman,4,The distance online courses are well laid out and I've always enjoyed them. I prefer to do all of my courses online because of my busy lifestyle. UAA has many options that accommodate my schedule which is nice. All of the professors I've had so far are very knowledgable.
Niche User,4,"I think the campus looks cool, but its really spread out. They have a really good cafeteria, they have hundreds of opportunities like internship and job interviews. People I have talked to say they love UAA. I went the college fair and the people seem really nice and generous.  UAA also, have a lot of scholarships you can aptly for every year."
Sophomore,4,"UAA has very good academics and honestly care about student success. However, their support for distant students is limited and the recent restructuring of their system has often left the help lacking."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Alaska - Anchorage is a good school for fast paced learning. Most of the teachers make you feel like you they want to be there teaching you. Most of them invest time and interest in each of their student. Class sized are reasonable which allows for this one on one time. The only thing I wished to be changed regarding UAA is the parking, it is almost always difficult to find parking."
Sophomore,4,I love the diversity of the University. There are so many students of different ethnicities that attend this college. I also love the professor support. They really want to make sure you succeed. This isnt just another job to them. I also really love the library. It is a great place to study and is open late during finals weeks. I feel very safe at the University. There are always campus police around and you can even have them escort you to your vehicle if you feel unsafe. The only thing we have to worry about it the wildlife. Overall I would say this is a very good University.
Junior,4,"University of Alaska Anchorage is a good school to learn and get your footing - once you are connected with clubs and other students on campus, you start to feel a bit more at home. It being a commuter campus affects it somewhat, and it can be challenging to navigate in the weather. The recreational facility is fantastic and you will find students of all races, ages, and occupations here."
Alum,4,"At UAA, I had a pretty good experience and a great education, but I feel there needs to be more events to get students involved within the school. There should be more social events and make it feel more like a college rather than a place of business. Most people commute so there’s no sense of a traditional college atmosphere."
Sophomore,4,"Expanded shuttle routes, more connection between on-campus housing and the actual campus, more food choices at commons, more on-campus programs, better health services, better choices of money spent,"
Freshman,4,"The small class size encourages extra help from professors to everyone who needs it. The campus also encourages students to use the tutor program, which is helpful to people who need a more one on one time. However, the office staff can come off as a little off put to some students."
Senior,4,Experience is so far good. Amazing faculty member and professors. Everyone is so helpful. The only change i would like to see is more club and their activities and as a winter state we need more indoor stuff.
Alum,4,"The University of Alaska was my first college experience, and I was unsure of exactly what to expect. I enjoyed attending this university. It offered all the amenities one would expect. There are places for students to eat, hang out and study. I would say the two prominent points I was dissatisfied with, and would like to see change, is that the university had inadequate parking space. Secondly, I'd like the university's board stop increasing tuition and keeping it at an affordable rate; ideally reducing the rate, but I have serious doubts that that will ever happen."
Freshman,4,The University of Alaska Anchorage are coming up with new programs to help Native American Students with financial help and academic resources. One thing I would change is free washer and dryers for the dorms.
Freshman,4,The school is great and my fellow peers are extremely helpful! I enjoyed being able to connect with professor as much as I have with my fellow classmates. One thing I would like to see is maybe not sending out the same email five different times.
Niche User,4,"I like the professors at this college because they seem to care about the success of their students. I also  like the location that the college is in, because it is a short distance from where i live."
Freshman,4,It is very easy to make close friends and the small class sizes allow you to have a lot of one on one time with your teachers.
Sophomore,2,This school is a bad joke. Teachers don't know what they're teaching and are no help what so ever. There is a fee for everything and it's not getting any cheaper. I paid $315 for a parking pass for the year we get 3/4 of the way through the COVID-19 breaks out and this school offers $30 back for the pass rather than 1/4 of the $315 that was paid. Very few scholarships are offered and budget cuts arent helping.
Niche User,2,"More funding and better class quality needed; student life and safety are concerning since city can be fairly dangerous; campus food is terrible; student life is fairly nonexistent but not a ""study school""; not much competition between students (which can be good or bad thing)

plenty of research opportunities if you are willing to look and professors are very approachable and will gladly take you for undergraduate research;"
Sophomore,2,"I like seeing the wildlife around campus, but sadly there are very few professors who are passionate about what they are teaching and the administration is scatter brained."
Sophomore,2,"I strongly advise any incoming freshmen to join clubs like debate or a club associated with your major. This is the best (and pretty much the only) way to connect with fellow students and really achieve any sense of a ""college experience"". 
UAA is severely lacking in both passionate teachers and student opportunities. Even though I've had a few great professors, I have also had many negative experiences. In my experience, some of the staff give off the impression that they are just here to collect $ and don't truly care about the outcome of their students the way you would hope they would. It's nothing malicious but definitely something to consider before attending. If it's an option, I would recommend Alaskan students to apply for reduced tuition at WUE schools before committing to UAA because of the price tag."
Freshman,2,"UAA resident tuition has gone up an insane amount every single semester due to our state legislation. Quality of education is poor. Not the best on campus activities, even though every student gets charged a ""student activities"" fee. Only going to UAA because I cant afford to move out of state due to the increasing costs of tuition."
Graduate Student,2,"While graduate program department faculty has been fantastic, the school overall is in shambles. They can barely afford to keep to keep anything running, and they are running on a skeleton staff and faculty. Which I'll admit isn't their fault. The state of Alaska only provides them with an operational budget that covers the minimum basics. Parts of the campus are in dire need of updates, but the school can't afford to make the necessary updates. Additionally, often more money gets funnelled to UAF all in the name of it being the flagship and research insititute then UAA when UAA has a much larger student population and a great potential for research."
Niche User,2,The university has no competition with other schools. They are able to do whatever they want and get away with it.
Senior,2,I'm a senior at University of Alaska Anchorage. I transferred here from a private college in Minnesota. I've been very disappointed in almost every area with UAA. I had to file 16 petitions for them to take my transfer credits. I'm still graduating late because I had to retake two classes. So if you're thinking about transferring I highly recommend not coming to this school. Unless you're okay with restarting.
College Sophomore,2,"Not many students have any school spirit for the team or the school itself. The athletes seem distant and ""better"" than the rest of us non-athletic students, and we still have to pay the athletic fee even if we don't use the facilities."
College Freshman,2,"I lived here for a while. Only go with the campus if you don't have another home in Anchorage. The buildings are fine, but the location is inconvenient and the layout discourages mingling between students."
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, I see flyers for this stuff but I never pick them up. The idea of trying to party in UAA's cold, crappy MAC housing units is more depressing than inviting."
College Freshman,2,"Alaska is known for its abuse with alcohol and sexual harassment and this is no different on campus. Although I have not seen much and don't ever not feel safe, I know plenty of people with experiences with and around environments with this type of safety. There are a lot of school services that help with the problem of abuse and harassment."
College Freshman,2,I've never been a part of it so I can't say much on it at all.
College Junior,2,I don't know where it is. If I knew where it is I would go there to look for my future job.
College Sophomore,2,Used for partying. It is just an image to greek members. Rules are often broken.
College Sophomore,2,"Not recommend the Greek life. If anything, it's pretty dead here."
College Freshman,2,"At the University of Alaska, Anchorage the dorms are something I wouldn't reccommend. It is very loud, crammed, the social vibes are bad, and it takes about 20 minutes to walk to the study buildings from the dorms. The money is not worth the value."
College Sophomore,2,no party scene on campus
College Sophomore,2,food is expensive and is horrible.
College Sophomore,2,"Nothing on campus, really. Not a lot of good parties."
College Freshman,2,"Very little options for art students, the counselors don't seem to know what their doing"
College Student,2,Not alot of scholarship options for people from outside Alaska other than the WUE program.
College Student,2,Isnt much of a party scene.
College Junior,2,There isn't much of a party scene.
College Junior,2,Parking is very strict when it comes to writing tickets. It is very hard to get out of one.
College Senior,2,"To live close to campus, you pay less but live in a not-so-nice/safe part of town. To live in the much better parts of town, you have to pay more and drive in traffic farther."
College Senior,2,"First, I don't qualify for financial aid but trying to get assistance with scholarships is a joke.  I went to visit a scholarship adviser and they basically sent me to look online which is what I had already done.  I'm still working on finding scholarships and financial aid for school."
College Senior,2,"If you can get scholarships that is the best bet. FAFSA can be difficult to work with, taking out loans is rough."
College Senior,2,"They do not offer that many. I am in Elementary Education and it is definitely a 5 year degree if not 6. They require you to take between 15 and 18 credit hours per semester to finish in 4 years, but most classes are offered at the same times, so you can't take them together."
College Senior,2,I have never lived on campus
College Senior,2,I am not part of Greek Life
College Sophomore,2,"the new Alaska Airlines sports center is beautiful but crappy because there is no hockey rink in the building, and most students are unable to access the facilities in the building. That building is meant for 1% of the student population."
College Sophomore,2,Few places off-campus offer student discounts.
College Freshman,2,"For me, a white female there is not very much aid that I receive. I have to take a few classes, not a bunch so that I can afford to go."
College Student,2,night life? what night life? you need to go home and study!
College Freshman,2,It took forever to work out what I was missing on my financial aid.  This was especially difficult because of the distance between my permanent home and the campus.  I wasn't able to fully complete my financial aid until I arrived on campus and even then it took several days if not weeks to complete.
College Sophomore,2,If you're not native its much harder to find scholarships
College Freshman,2,Public transportation off campus is virtually nonexistent. The on campus bus stops are exposed which is miserable in the wintertime. A car is the easiest way to get around both on and off campus. Campus parking is limited however.
College Freshman,2,"Anchorage has extremely high rental rates. The lowest rate one can find will be around $850/mo, not including utilities, and probably for a small one bedroom or studio. Average prices for a one bedroom are $950-1500/mo, depending on where in town and the age of the building. There is only a 3% vacancy rate in Anchorage, the landlords know it and they can be real jerks and get away with it. Most of the affordable rental units are older and many are in disrepair."
College Freshman,2,"There are only two fraternities and sororities for a total of four Greek societies. There are no houses though, and there are very few Greek events. Not worth the dues at all."
College Student,2,I haven't been a student for awhile.  I'm just getting ready to go back to school in the summer.  I haven't noticed any special discounts for students around town.
College Junior,2,There's not a lot of options out there.
College Freshman,2,"Students can easily get away with things on campus. The security itself is not awful, but often the situations are over-exaggerated, making campus seem unsafe when in reality everything is fine."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms smell of weed quite frequently. And the raves that UAA does not sponsor, and even those that it does, I know underage students can easily get alcohol and substances."
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid process is in need of revamp at our school. It is the most cumbersome part of any process performed at our school. 
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is pretty much non-existent at our school. Their are very few sororities and fraternities at our school in fact their are only 2 sororities (ASA, Tri-Sigma) and 2 fraternities. The way that greek week is done is so low key that by the time you find out about it it is halfway over."
College Sophomore,2,It makes more sense to take the shuttles around on campus then to get the parking permits. With all of the new construction going on around our campus it is almost impossible to find a decent parking space that makes driving on main campus even worth it.
College Sophomore,2,Terrible physics and computer science programs.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is almost non-existent.
College Sophomore,2,"The college is big, so walking outside is cold."
College Sophomore,2,Campus is big but separated from the city.
College Sophomore,2,"There are easily 20,000 students attending UAA and only about 8,000 parking spaces on campus. Each parking permit is between $150-$250 and it generally takes several laps to find parking."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm personally not a fan of on-campus dining. In the dining hall by the on-campus housing I found a maggot in my salad and the vegetables are always cooked to the point of no-nutrition. I think if there's a company in the kitchen they need to know how to adequately cook for 1000+ hungry college students. The food always has me leaving with indigestion and the urge to vomit. It generally smells dreadful and its the least quality food I could imagine. They sometimes even have the same soup in the dispensers for 3-4 days at a time. I do NOT support NMS Food Services on UAA campus, it makes us all unhealthy and fat."
College Freshman,2,the campus are not very close and on snow or rainy days it came be difficult to connect to or to get to classes
College Freshman,2,i have not experience any campus strictness at my school
College Freshman,2,the cost for parking is horrible. it's way to expensive and there is hardly any spots available
College Sophomore,2,Its usually always cold and raining/snowing. Summertime can bring some warmth and sunshine but never a whole lot.
College Sophomore,2,"There is not enough parking spots on campus and the costs of the parking permit is not even worth it anyways. I would rather park a few minutes away than spend  over $200 on parking. If you come after ten and are looking for a parking spot, the chances of finding one within a reasonable amount of time is very low. the parking, however, is close to all the buildings so you don't have to be outside for very long once you find a spot."
College Freshman,2,I didn't receive any help besides loans. There aren't any grants available to current students only to High School seniors coming in. 
Recent Alumnus,2,"The architecture of most of the buildings is Soviet-style northern commercial blandness. The athletic center is 40 years old & under-maintained, but a new one is being built (to open fall 2014). The Student center is also old & is poorly designed. There are many green spaces but since winter is 6 months long, how many enjoy being out in the cold? There are few campus activities since UAA is primarily a commuter campus. Concerning student hangouts, many use the high-speed computer labs, the heated walkways between buildings, the Den, and the library to study & socialize."
Sophomore,1,"UAA has the highest in-state tuition percentage. It appears to be more cost effective to its in-state student's but doesn't seem to take care of them. A university is supposed to instill a sense of gratitude that promotes the future of society. UAA does quite the opposite. I instills money and grace to certain programs. Anything other than engineering and nursing doesn't stand a chance. Student's barely stand a chance. With tuition increases and budget cuts constantly, they leave Their students with no where to park, no where to study and not even a leg to stand on, literally. With permanent damage in my leg from them not maintaining the campus, we're all stuck trying to figure out how to achieve our goals and how to get the money to do it. Good luck my fellow Alaskans, may your degrees not take a hit from non accreditation."
Senior,1,"The organization as a whole is terribly managed with little to no regard for the future of it's students.  The university will milk the students for money at every opportunity. Education is clearly not the main goal of the university, it is a self serving bureaucratic mess that feeds on the young people of Alaska."
Senior,1,"If you are looking for a relatively affordable education: don't look for it at the University of Alaska. The cost of it is deceiving, because you might find that a 4-year program will take you at least six or more years to complete. Why? Terrible academic advising; programs which all of sudden have new requirements; did I mention poor academic advising? Oh, yes. I will say it again: POOR ACADEMIC ADVISING. 
Nevertheless, the faculty at the university if wonderful! And the professors really do care about their students! Academic advisers do not."
Freshman,1,"I had a terrible experience at University of Alaska Anchorage. I was on the ski team for the whole year which was amazing and helped me make lifelong friendships. However, apart from athletics, UAA has nothing to offer any student who is mildly social. This school is only good for people who don't want to socialize, like doing things on their own, don't like to party, and don't mind gloomy weather 24/7. 
People on campus aren't remotely cheerful or happy at any time. Most of the students commute and are older at UAA so there is no student body or school spirit of any kind."
Sophomore,1,"Well, I first went to college for my freshman year at Salish Kootenai College in Pablo, MT. I really liked it there. All the instructors were very helpful and really went out of there way to assist you. 
At the University of Alaska Anchorage, I was always confused, lost, and most of the students and staff were prejudiced. I tried sending an email to one of the instructors asking if he can slow down a bit or even stopped by his office to talk to him. It's like he didn't even care. Students are there to learn, not to feel unwelcome at a university. I really don't think that I would even give one star. A university is supposed to be a professional place. And go way out of there way to assist students. It was nothing like that. I'll be attending another university, but, this time on-line. I would NOT refer anyone to UAA, not at all."
Junior,1,"I am a junior at UAA and will transferring out this semester. Overall my experience has been less than desirable. I have had several really good teachers but the majority really don't care and have willfully told an entire class of students that. The advising is just awful, I can never get a straight answer and despite petitioning they would not accept my credits from other universities. Teachers have also been known to give out arbitrary grades. I regret spending my time and money at this university. I highly recommend looking at other options before committing to UAA. If you're transferring into the school you will more than likely be set back and if you're going into the university as a new student than expect it to take, on average, 6 years to get your degree instead of 4.  There have also been several stabbings and attacks during school hours and students were never informed of it."
Sophomore,1,"There are a few hidden gems of classes and professors at UAA, but overall it's just awful. Some classes (most) made me not only not learn anything, but also lose knowledge I already have. I am an A-B student and I'm just appalled at how terrible my experience at UAA has been. I'm transferring next semester, thank God, but I will never get my year and a half of UAA back. What a waste of time and money. The math and science classes are universally hated, and the English classes seem mostly like ego boosts for the professors who teach them."
Sophomore,1,"I believe a school dedicated to student advancement UAA, lacks in sincerity. It offers many great programs and opportunities for students, all which are student lead, however, penalizes its alumni over everything. I also found it discouraging how much some teachers remain absent from class and cancel on their students who are paying for it. All in all, its a good college the area is beautiful, I believe that is because it is located in Alaska the most beautiful state in the USA but it can use some real boosting up as far as caring for its students."
College Senior,1,"I know nothing about Greek life, I've only seen one flyer for a sorority."
College Freshman,1,We only have a few Fraternities and Sororities on campus and overall it just looks like they are always looking for pledges. I never hear about their events or what they actually do on campus.
College Sophomore,1,greek life doesnt get involved in community.
College Junior,1,"I don't know of many on campus parties, i think that the administration is strict on that aspect."
College Freshman,1,They have no idea how to use money so they waste in on pointless things
College Freshman,1,The party scene is nonexistent and there really isn't a best night for nightlife because there never is any on campus.
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid officers aren't very helpful and often rude.
College Freshman,1,There is really nothing in Anchorage
College Freshman,1,"I believe that we only have a few Greek life clubs organizations, and I do not know what they are: that is the how little of effect that Greek life has on the general community. Because there is such a little amount of Greek Life on campus, I do not think that non-Greeks look down on, or exclude, the Greeks, and vis-versa. 

There is no Greek housing available."
College Student,1,They just let things go the world is getting worst
College Sophomore,1,Terrible financial aid process and expensive.
College Freshman,1,I think the cost  for parking is way to expensive and considering the inclement  weather it is difficult to access public transportion
College Freshman,1,"Parking on and off campus is horrible. There aren't many places available off campus, and the parking lots on campus are small. The Permits are outrageous and not worth the cost. "
College Freshman,1,You have to pay for parking 
College Junior,1,"Anchorage has some of the worst weather I have ever been through. From mid August all the way to November was rain every single day. I have never seen so much rain in my life and it ruins the chance to enjoy my favorite season, fall time. Summer and winter are about average, nothing I have not seen or been through."
College Junior,1,Socially I am dying on the inside.
College Junior,1,"The dorm process is the worst as there was no survey process for roommates for the 2013-14 year, selection was totally up to chance if you did not already have someone in mind. The dorms are small and there is no kitchen area. The social scene is bad as there are no parties on campus. To add insult to injury Res Life constantly promotes things like ""Octsober"" and Jeopardy with a focus on the horrors of smoking marijuana. So if you don't enjoy the knitting or pumpkin carving then UAA is not the place for you."
College Junior,1,It's a pretty diverse school but is a very difficult place to make friends especially if you are from out of state.
College Junior,1,"The Greek life is pretty non existent. There are two Fraternities and Sororities, they are pretty nonexclusive. There are no frat houses or wild frat parties on or off campus."
College Junior,1,I have yet to find a decent chinese or pizza restaurant around campus. There are plenty of fast food chains as well which is no surprise considering Anchorage is one giant strip mall. China Lights is pretty good if all you can eat chinese buffet is your thing but it is not very close to the campus. Overall the food sucks in Alaska especially if you have been spoiled to the fine cuisine of the East Coast for your whole life.
College Junior,1,"It's pretty damn cold but, what do you expect it's Alaska. It is extremely scenic and the rare chance that you get to see the aura borealis is very rewarding."
College Senior,1,Just don't live on campus. Be prepared to get an unnecessary parking ticket at least once or twice a year. They will do anything to get a couple extra bucks from students.
College Senior,1,Don't even get me started on this subject.
College Senior,1,"There is NO ""campus life"" at UAA. And the ""downtown"" scene has been SEVERELY degraded. Our top 2 out of 4 good bars to go to got shut down. There are ALWAYS fights and shootings are not uncommon. The nightlife scene in Anchorage is zilch."
College Senior,1,"Well they got rid of the nursing computer lab and printing, which was the WORST idea possible. They built a BRAND NEW nursing building, and didn't put in a computer lab. Now you always have to have your student I.D. to print, and it can sometimes be impossible to even find a computer in the other computer labs."
College Senior,1,"Very little healthy options, and very little dining halls. And what IS there is not always affordable to students. This aspect blows my mind. You're better off going off campus to eat."
College Freshman,1,"Guys at this school are all mountain men. It is Alaska, so there are hunters, and gun loving men. "
College Freshman,1,I live in Alaska. It is cold and dark in the winter. When it is negative degrees outside it makes you not want to go outside. 
College Junior,1,Alaska does not have great transportation system. But even worse UAA has lack of parking spaces even for parking permit holders
College Sophomore,1,"Awe man I really hate parking services! Not only is parking expensive, but if you pay the large amount of money for an on campus spot you still have to search forever just to find an open one! On housing it is easier, but when there are events at the commons visitor take your PAID parking which is really annoying. If you live on campus then a car isn't very necessary because there are shuttle that go from housing to campus every 15 minutes. Parking tickets are expensive, and the money you pay them off with goes toward nothing important. They build parking structures that are far away from buildings."
College Freshman,1,Food off campus sucks. I have yet to find a good chinese or pizza place in Anchorage.
College Junior,1,"I never hear anything about sports at UAA or at the Mat-Su College.  there are no posters, or promotion of athletics that jumps out at me."
College Junior,1,"It is very difficult to get computer help on campus, they make you pay for all media"
Recent Alumnus,1,Extremely expensive and there is never enough close parking for cold temps.
College Junior,1,"Parking is horrendous.Ice skating rinks are what you must learn to drive on in the winter for our parking lots. If you dont have a car, dont bother trying to go during the winter months. Walking is a crazy idea due to the extreme weather."
College Junior,1,School Councelors have way too much to deal with. At times they can be helpful but not normally. I would suggest making your own schedule and following the degreeworks program by yourself instead of trying to understand what the heck they are talking about.
College Junior,1,"I have several gripes with UAA with regards to Internet, computer labs, and computers. 
1. The Internet was changed at the beginning of the semester and it took over a month and a half to iron out the wrinkles and some people (like me) were unable to get on the Internet with our laptops until last week. 
2. There are NOT enough computers or  labs on campus. Their brand new building, science building, has one computer lab and it's only for chemistry students. There is one printer available in the entire building. 
3. The computers in any of the labs on the ""business"" side of campus are old and outdated, very slow, and glitchy. 

Take home message: get a laptop and being it with you."
College Sophomore,1,"UAA oversells parking passes, which make it very difficult to find a parking space. Not only is this difficulty inconvenient, the passes are very expensive every semester. They have arranged on and near campus to discourage parking that may be free, without paying very hefty fines. It shouldn't be a prime motivation to squeeze money from starving college students, and there should be some better options for free parking."
College Sophomore,1,Snow = Traffic – Here at UAA traffic gets horrible when it snows in the winter. There are always long lines to get out of parking lots. The student drivers are terrible and there are always more than one car accident a day. It gets really frustrating when you can't make it to class on time because of traffic.
College Sophomore,1,We pay 250$ just to drive around looking for a parking spot for 20 minutes just to have to park a 7 minute walk from the building!
College Student,1,Not Much of Anything – There really isnt much dining here. The food is more like coffee shop food
College Sophomore,1,"Not a Member – UAA is primarly a commuter school, so while there are options for those who live on campus, most students don't get too involved with campus activities"
College Student,1,"Zero Greek – There might be 1 sorority or fraternity, and if there is, there is very few people in it. A lot of people just live in the dorms or an off campus apartment. If some Greek life was added, that would add more excitement to our campus life."
College Junior,1,The city only puts a half-hearted effort into plowing the sidewalks. The city bus goes everywhere except straight through the middle from downtown to midtown. There is usually a day in the winter when UAA closes the campus due to snow or ice.
College Sophomore,1,I only know of one fraternity.  I was never approached or asked to join.  I received more offers for the debate team than even seeing anyone in Greek life.
College Sophomore,1,"Greeks Pretty Much Non-Existent – Greek life, tends to be very exclusionary and not at all inclusive. No one knows when rush week is because its not very well advertised."
College Freshman,1,Hockey Is the Big Thing – Hockey is the only thing that's even discussed here. No one really cares about anything else.
College Freshman,1,"Too Much Underage Partying – Our school is strict on underage drinking, but that doesn't stop students from drinking and parting. And as far as I know there aren't many clubs for 21 and older students, which keeps them on campus, providing alcohol for underage students."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Really Noticeable – While I'm sure to some people greek life is crucial it is hardly noticeable at UAA. There are only one sorority, and one fraternity so that helps make the decision for most people. It is mostly filled with people who were looking to climb the hardly existent social ladder. Besides the recruiting events once a year you don't even remember they exist."
College Sophomore,1,"UAA is a great school for those who have a family background of college graduates. For those who are first generation college students, it will be a difficult journey for you because they don't try to help those new coming or continuing students on their pathway to success. There may be small programs out there, but times are getting harder, and more unqualified over-represented people are taking over to ""help"" the students graduate. There are some diamonds in the rough so if you really want to find the most valuable people to help you out, I suggest you dig really hard and deep."
College Sophomore,1,"Boys :P – The guys here are not attractive at all.. Unless they are from out of state. Here, the look is scruffy, unkept. Alot of the guys here are either too skinny, bad hair cuts, or have a birds nest on their face. I would say that the social life here is kind of lame. I like clean cut guys and most of them are most likely going to other schools. The people here do not know how to begin and continue an interesting conversation. They like to do outdoorsy things in the cold but are not open to do anything else."
College Senior,1,You have to get there early to park. There are never enough spaces to park in.

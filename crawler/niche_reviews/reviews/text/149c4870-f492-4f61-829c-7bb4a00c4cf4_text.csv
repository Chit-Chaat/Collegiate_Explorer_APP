Sophomore,5,I love Southern. The community is wonderful and I can't stress how helpful my professors are. They really invest into my life and know me by name.
Freshman,5,I go to the best bible school/Seminary in the world! The professors are amazing and truly invest in the students.
Graduate Student,5,"The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary is one of the best seminars that have currently given space to the growth of the Hispanic community, offering master's degrees in divinities to which I am about to finish, with a degree of excellence in education and knowledge with dedicated teachers and responsible. I am very proud to belong to the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary family and I exolt other Christians who want to study in a master's degree seminar, the Southern offers you everything you need to grow in knowledge."
Junior,5,It has a beautiful campus with incredible staff. I have really enjoyed my time here at this school and highly recommend it to anyone looking to get a great education taught from a Christian worldview that prepares students for ministry.
Freshman,5,"As a fresh master graduate, when apply for admission at southern baptist theological seminary my admission was decided between two week after submitted all required document and my school portal was activated. 
The sbts sent emails regularly to me on all information about the school and l want giving a counselor to guide me through all my application."
Freshman,5,"Excellent college. They do not hide they teach from a Christian perspective. They also have a college (Boyce College) attached to it with degrees in business and other fields. The advisors are always nice and the professors are some of the best in the field, especially in the theological area."
Freshman,5,"The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary defends the Bible and the truth of God. They pride themselves on following the gospel, fostering discipleship and true growth, protecting their students and offering a myriad of great opportunities. Their staff and professors are dedicated to helping students above and beyond the typical education. It is has an affordable college in Boyce and is the largest Seminary in North America. They focus less on parties and wild pleasure like some colleges might, and instead offer true rewards in Christ.  Lives are changed for the better at SBTS with great student life, spacious dorms, an excellent city in Louisville Kentucky that is home to wonderful food, churches, diversity and refugees that need out help. They have basketball, soccer and volleyball as some of their sports and all of the students support and encourage each other more than so many other places."
Junior,5,"It is an amazing community of believers who are pursuing Christ to impact the Kingdom. Professors are more concerned about your relationship with the Lord than anything, they help you learn what it means to have a biblical worldview in all subjects, and they are more than a teacher, they are also your friend. The campus is beautiful and has amazing resources."
Sophomore,5,Helps you to grow with the Lord and points you into the right directions allowing you to find out who you really are. Alot of my fellow class mates are from home schools so its new but its easy to get involved and to learn.
Freshman,5,"The campus is a large and beautiful campus, all of the professors are incredible they are always willing to answer questions on things that you may or may not understand. They are willing to work with you and truly want you to succeed. The Christian community that takes place on a daily basis is amazing and a true blessing. I can not recommend it highly enough."
Sophomore,5,"So far it has been a delightful experience to learn at this institution! The history of the Seminary and the College is really inspiring and is followed by a strong tie of tradition and relevance. There is a reasonable variety in the credentials of the professors that makes the student aware of differing views within  evangelical theology and the Christian worldview. The environment is one of the best things in the school. There is a friendliness about almost everyone and a strong sense of community. You will eventually feel like you belong there! Overall, a great place!"
Alum,5,The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary was an amazing experience for me. I actually attended the undergrad college of this school which is Boyce College. Boyce is on the same campus and shares everything with SBTS so the experience is very similar. The facilities are beautiful. I woke up on campus every day in my dorm room and was amazing that I actually got to live and study there. The dorms are newly renovated and very nice. They are a little small but are private and new. The library is huge and extensive. The professors are friendly and kind and will invite students into their homes for meals. The community is strong and welcoming. I felt very at home during my time there. I learned so much at Boyce College/SBTS intellectually and practically. I am so thankful for my time there and I wouldn't change one thing.
College Senior,5,we do not have drug and alcohol problem in our school
College Senior,5,"Our curriculum is well organized, the registration process is very easy, the workload is really heavy, and special study options are choices made by students, and popular studies are very friendly."
College Senior,5,"As said above, I'm very okay with my school"
College Senior,5,"Here in my school, we have enough courses  and professors at this school. We have quality of courses and processors, the class styles is very okay and the class sizes are very okay too."
College Senior,5,The campus life concerning the health and safety is the best. I'm very proud of this.
College Senior,5,"My campus is very conducive for studies. We have cold atmosphere,"
College Senior,5,"Base on my experiences, my school is able to teach everyone good morals, sound theology, handle conflicts, and give reconciliation at every points."
College Junior,5,"The seminary offers undergrad degrees ranging from business, science, math, theology, etc; whereas, the seminary offers theological based programs (MDiv., MA, MACE, Ph.D, Ed.D, etc) that prepare future leaders for the church.  Classes are small and great professor interaction.  The faculty is world renown and are specialists in their field of study."
College Junior,5,"It's Southern!!  The flagship seminary of the SBC.  With the academic rigor and prestige of the seminary, potential perspectives for career development and placement is available."
College Junior,5,"Southern is an academically rigorous campus that has high standards of education and achievement.  However, the professors are warm, inviting, and humble in their approach to students.  Classes are generally small that allows for attention to students with professor interaction helping student learning."
College Junior,5,It is a seminary with an excellent police staff and desire to honor God through sinless behavior.
College Junior,5,I was contacted regularly and encouraged to complete my application.  It was an enjoyable and easy process.
College Junior,5,"No nightlife in the sense of what the question described. Night fun would include bowling, dinner, family events, etc."
College Junior,5,"Sober fun. That's the kind of partying that happens. Student Life/Housing organizes many social gatherings that students may attend, and students themselves organize many house/social gatherings."
College Junior,5,"It is a Christian institution, so you have to accept that people of the LGBT persuasion are lovingly addressed, but are not permitted to study at this school if they insist on living this lifestyle in conjunction with their Christian faith. People who have these desires but are seeking to pursue Christ in spite of them are openly welcomed and free to participate in all aspects of student life. Similarly, people of other religions are not permitted to attend these schools because it is a Christian school that aims to educate and send out Christian leaders and educators into the world. That is not intolerance, it is consistent with the goals of the school and its students."
College Junior,5,"They have world-class faculty and continue to hire at the world-class level, as recent as this past week (hiring a new counseling professor). Courses are fair and workload varies based on subject and professor, and we are able to assess these classes ahead of time so we can know what we are in for if we sign up for the class."
College Junior,5,"The quality of professors, courses, and class sizes are appropriate to the needs of each class and their students. Certain departments in the school are stronger than others, and could use more professors or a different approach in teaching."
College Junior,5,The campus has campus police and security that help to make our experience very safe and family friendly.
College Junior,5,"I love my school, for it's education and culture. The students and teacher are all there for one unified purpose, and live their lives in hopes that this purpose my glorify God and benefit mankind temporally and eternally. Scholarship and practically are well wedded."
College Sophomore,5,I am very happy with my choice of college. My fellow peers and the faculty there make it the best experience. They are constantly encouraging and they are very loving towards one another. I am very thankful to be a part of such a great community.
College Freshman,5,"Because of the various scholarships, I am able to get very close to a free ride!"
College Senior,5,The Louisville food scene is really incredible. There's a lot to do and myriads of places to try. Simply Thai is a must.
College Senior,5,"Super kind folks that work hard to make your housing experience the best it can be. The whole campus is undergoing renovations, and it's looking pretty legit."
College Senior,5,"People attending this school are preparing for ministry in a church, and are held to high standards."
College Student,5,There's always something to do!!!!
College Student,5,Mullins is one of the best dorm in the world
College Senior,5,"All members of SBC churches receive a tuition discount. I have also received multiple scholarships, with no problems at all having them applied to my account."
College Senior,5,"My wife and I always feel very safe on campus. Campus security is highly visible but not intrusive. We trust those who are on campus, and I'm not aware of any assaults, sexual or otherwise, which have happened on campus."
College Senior,5,"SBTS has a very good ""Ministry Connections"" program, along with other career placement help."
College Senior,5,"I would rate every professor I've had as excellent. Most of my classes have been at the Nashville Extension Center, but whether there or on the main Louisville campus, I've had nothing but positive experiences with faculty and course quality."
College Senior,5,"This is the friendliest campus I've ever been on. I was married before I enrolled here, so can't speak much about the dating scene, but it's a great place to raise a family!"
College Junior,5,My group of friends is the absolute best. I wouldn't trade their friendship for the world.
College Sophomore,5,apply and you will get help
College Sophomore,5,since my college is Christian most people believe the same things
College Sophomore,5,not a huge city but has a big city feel
College Sophomore,5,"The party scene at my school does not exist by the world's standards. We would be classified as lame since our party means eating pizza, watching movies, and painting our nails. I attend a private Christian college."
College Sophomore,5,I believe my school is the best. All the professors are personable and make learning very interesting. The workload is heavy and challenging but definitely worth it.
College Sophomore,5,Everyone at my school is super friendly and loving. Almost everyone is friends with one another. It is a very uplifting and fun environment to grow and study.
College Junior,5,the strictness is to check mate what should be happening at school
College Junior,5,Everybody is trying at there best
College Freshman,5,yes i would. i love it.
College Freshman,5,they are bringing in brand new majors
College Sophomore,5,There are no drugs on campus.
College Sophomore,5,Workload is rigorous but rewarding.
College Sophomore,5,Great theologians who take the time to know you.
College Freshman,5,Great school Cafeteria with manny options and good service. 
College Freshman,5,If you are going to Southern Seminary for the Bar/club scene and secular parties you are an idiot and you must be handicapped.  Plenty of fun things to do though that do not include drinking and clubs.
College Freshman,5,Great Atmosphere with nice people who desire to learn and understand the bible.
Junior,4,"The southern seminary has many beautiful aspects to the campus, the students and professors. The professors make your friendship a priority in order to be able to teach more effectively. They are willing to take time out to include you and every other student in activities to further their learning and spiritual growth. This is very easy to do with the beautiful and peaceful and campus surrounding your every move."
Graduate Student,4,I just started attending this seminary this spring. I am very happy with the opportunities to build friendships and community here. I enjoy my classes and the professors are very approachable.
Sophomore,4,"I am a sophomore at Boyce College, and it has been a very interesting experience. I am a business major, and I have thoroughly enjoyed all of my business classes so far, Business Law being one of my favorites. Our faculty is highly qualified for their positions, especially our business professors and church history professors. They are good people and their offices are open for much of the day when they are not teaching. While the overall campus culture is nice, there is a certain ""bubble"" feeling about the school, most likely because the vast majority of the students are Southern Baptist, but for me that is a minor issue."
Sophomore,4,"After finishing my first year, I've learned to really appreciate people in general and be thankful for where I'm at in life simply by being here. I've also grown a lot academically as well. "
College Junior,4,I will be attending classes this fall. I have sat under a number of the professors during biblical counseling conferences. I have benefited greatly.
College Sophomore,4,The safety and security on campus is excellent. They take the safety very seriously.
College Sophomore,4,Boyce is a great college for students to come have great fellowship and make a lot of friends. There are some negatives in that you are required to live on campus until you are 22 so it can be financially difficult for some. The professors are amazing in many ways and especially that they care about the students and develop personal relationships with their students.
College Sophomore,4,I know that there are many great connections in many areas but I am not entirely sure what the value of the degree is yet.
College Sophomore,4,"The community and campus life is fantastic, cooking can be inconvenient at times but for the most part I really enjoy campus life. The cost is expensive but is convenient in many ways."
College Junior,4,"Internship possibilities abound, though maybe not in the place you most want to intern, because with the possibilities comes competition. they have a strong alumni network, offering many opportunities for alumni to be involved with on-campus experiences and education. Employment opportunities abound as well, and give excellent priority to students with the most need and with adequate qualification (international families and students, etc.)."
College Junior,4,"It's good, though it could improve in many ways. Maintenance of facilities is constantly needed, showers don't work well, heating can be inconsistent."
College Junior,4,"Westminster was really good academically and the staff was really good, but the culture and students are kind of stuck up and entitled. The flight program is good however the revolving door C.F.I s, seem to not all have a ton of motivation on their part, just to build their own hours and move on to the airlines."
College Senior,4,"It has a really unique vibe. Parts of town definitely have that old, colonial feel to them and are filled with businesses. Other parts are very hipster-esque and are filled with a lot of interesting, but wonderful, folks."
College Student,4,Always place to have fun
College Senior,4,"We don't eat out very often, but Louisville is turning into a nice ""foodie"" spot. Our favorite local eatery is the Troll Pub Under the Bridge."
College Senior,4,"My family loves Louisville. It's a beautiful town, with a small town vibe combined with big city amenities. If sports are your thing, though, it's all horse racing and Louisville Cardinals around here."
College Senior,4,"There aren't a great number of options on campus, but the options that exist are good. I prefer the sandwiches, wraps, and pizza in Founders Cafe, but the cafeteria is nice for an occasional change of pace."
College Junior,4,"We have great professors, classrooms, study groups, study rooms, cafe's, etc."
College Junior,4,"Humanities is a frowned upon degree at most schools because of the poor jobs you get afterwards. However, at this school, we have a lot of Humanities majors because we've figured out we can get great master's degrees afterwards."
College Junior,4,"The guys and girls on campus are what I would consider to be average. Yea, we have some cliques that are the populars, music nerds, nobodies, etc. But that's what makes us a school."
College Junior,4,"I personally don't live off campus, we have some rules that don't allow anyone under 22 to live off campus. However, the friends I have living off campus either at home or going part time were able to find fairly cheap/decent priced apartments and they're very clean and well maintained."
College Junior,4,They're old buildings in the process of being renovated.
College Junior,4,"Like I've said previously, the professors are great, the class sizes are just right to be able to have the ability to learn without feeling like the teacher can't ever talk to you and help you move on or understand something."
College Junior,4,"At a small, private, Christian school, we offer some of the best majors possible for what the Lord has called you to do in ministry and further His Kingdom. No, we don't have a lot of the popular majors/degrees, but we're doing what the Lord has called us to do."
College Junior,4,Our professors are the best I could ever ask for. They truly care about you as a person and they definitely want to see you grow in your walk with the Lord. I couldn't ask for better professors and a better education than the one I'm getting here.
College Junior,4,"Our security on campus is the best. They're always driving around, riding their bikes around campus or just making sure students are getting where they need to go."
College Junior,4,We only have basketball at our school.. So it's kinda a big deal when we have home games. EVERYONE goes to them.
College Sophomore,4,our campus tends to be crime free
College Sophomore,4,older campus but very accommodating
College Sophomore,4,"My school does have strict rules, but everyone who attends my college wants to obey these rules so they are not a burden."
College Sophomore,4,"My major focuses on philosophy, literature, and history. I love learning and tend to lean toward the philosophy classes. My minor is counseling and I hope to get a graduates degree in social work."
College Sophomore,4,I personally do no live off campus. but I know a lot of people who have gotten married and moved off campus. There are a lot of different options for a lot of different prices.
College Junior,4,I like the way it has been organised. It has been helpful in the areas of body fitness.
College Junior,4,almost everything needed to survive with are made available in the campus.
College Junior,4,computer and wireless network always available.
College Junior,4,there is security at all time in the campus
College Freshman,4,We dont have greek life
College Freshman,4,being in global studies is the funnest major
College Freshman,4,They are very big on Safety.
College Sophomore,4,Strict for the glory of God
College Freshman,4,"I mostly spend my time in the dorms, dining hall, classroom, gym and library. In my opinion, all the facilities seem to be well kept in general. Some of the dorms seem older but still in fairly good condition, the gym doesn't have the latest and greatest equipment I'm used to but it is sufficient and the library is definitely a great atmosphere for focused study."
College Freshman,4,"Being that I attend a seminary, it is already set apart from mostly every other university across the country. The academic program has mostly to do with the in depth study of the Bible and issues surrounding Christianity. Campus life is entertaining and encourages bonding, especially between those who stay on campus"
College Freshman,4,"Typical interests are sports, fitness, music and religion. Dress is anywhere from athletic to professional, while social life is typically centered around church events, concerts, sports and local attractions. Relationships include a large population of single people with a great many married couples."
College Sophomore,4,My career goal is to serve as a pastor in a church plant model upon graduation. This school is a great way to be equipped for ministry so long as you use your church elders in a mentor ship role alongside your education. 
College Sophomore,4,"It is a Bible college/seminary. You get what you put in. In order to get the most from your classes you need to: 
1. interact with your instructors. Learn about them and allow them to mentor you.
2. interact with peers, build relationships that will impact your ministry.
3. (most important) Get the elders of your church involved in your training. 
If you do these things you will have a great experience and a wonderful base of friends to begin your ministry with. "
College Sophomore,4,"There are alot of good apartments in the area immediately surrounding the seminary. It would be a good idea to find a good church first and ask the people there about apartments and landlords, because alot of apartment complexes only advertise through word-of-mouth. "
College Sophomore,4,"Always something new, if you have money. The best rated pizza place in Louisville is just a few minutes from campus. "
College Sophomore,4,Computer lab is awesome in the library. The Wifi is reliable and always available. 
College Student,4,It's December 1 and 51 degrees outside.  I will take it.  
College Junior,4,"Louisville is great because each section of the city has its own feel. And if you don't find anything in the city that you like, you can always take a day trip to another major city. Louisville is close to most of the major cities in the Midwest."
College Freshman,4,Good off campus options.  Some apartment complexes off campus that would be much cheaper and better than on campus housing.
College Junior,4,"The Seminary has students from all over the US as well as international students, so the diversity includes a very wide range of incdividuals."
College Freshman,4,There are a few places around the campus but it is an overall good experience. They have a weekly rotation for meals in the cafeteria but it is usually decent.
College Freshman,4,"tons of different places to eat, in every price range"
College Freshman,4,Downtown Louisville is only a ten minute drive and there is lots to do in the surrounding areas.
College Freshman,4,Boyce College has a very reasonable curfew of 12 AM on school nights and 2 AM on non-school nights. There are many rules and such but all have good reason in accordance with safety and baptist beliefs
College Freshman,4,"The men are very friendly, smart, and Godly. The reason why I would give an A- would only be because some are a little awkward around girls."
College Freshman,4,Campus has a security guard team that is dedicated to keeping campus safe. They are always walking or driving around campus.
College Freshman,4,The main campus has a starbucks and a sandwich shop for between class snacks and the dining hall always has a pretty good selection of meals to choose from. During Holidays the school  put together special meals for those students and their families that stay on campus.
College Freshman,4,"To be honest, I'm not totally sure. By God's grace I have a car, so I haven't really had to use the public transportation. But I see buses all the time, and taxi's seem readily available."
College Freshman,2,there are some good scholarships...wish we had more
College Freshman,2,"It is bad in the fall, you can walk to class in the morning and it will be cold and mid-day it start snowing. Or it may be cold one day and hot the next, making it difficult to truly be prepared at times"
College Senior,2,"It Really Falls Short – The rooms are very lacking. They have very few power outlets and there is only one ethernet port. The rooms are very cramped and if you are not real good friends with them, you will be all over each others space."
College Senior,1,we do not have the above in action
College Senior,1,we do have not have the above in our school in action
College Sophomore,1,we do not have a greek life
College Junior,1,there is no Greek life.
College Junior,1,when you have no money to run the Education and nobody is there to help.
College Sophomore,1,I say the worst not because people are ugly but because it is irrelevant. If you are looking to pickup a guy or gal than this school may not be the best fit for you. Men and women dress modestly and are concerned with glorifying God. Not finding a date.

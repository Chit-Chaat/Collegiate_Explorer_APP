Graduate Student,5,"Going to Ole Miss was a great experience! I loved getting to meet people from all over. The campus is beautiful, the people are great, and the food is even better. Plenty of bars, restaurants, and shopping for everyone."
Alum,5,Wonderful place launching great career with lifelong friends. My professors still keep in touch 20 years later. The Ole Miss experience is unlike any other school.
Junior,5,My professors are very on top of everything.  That's not the same for other majors however.  Engineering students and professors usually take academics way more seriously.
Junior,5,"I've made many friends, and my professors are very approachable.  The Starship robots that bring food are amazing, and I get coupon codes every time someone uses mine."
Senior,5,"Since starting at The University of Mississippi, I have taken at least one online class per semester. I enjoy and prefer online classes compared to traditional in-class learning. The professors are more avialible and consitantly respond/grade."
Sophomore,5,"This university has had a major impact on me, I love everything about the university. It is gorgeous, and the teachers are all pretty are always willing to help."
Sophomore,5,"Best experiences here, I have meet some amazing people here and people who are always willing to help."
Freshman,5,The University of Mississippi creates a home-like atmosphere with its friendly people and small-town feel.
Freshman,5,My professors are always available for help even while online.  They have changed their lectures online and have moved their open office hours to zoom meetings.
Sophomore,5,"I love being a student at the University of Mississippi. The campus is beautiful, the students are nice, and the faculty and staff are fantastic. Everyone is there to make sure you have the best experience possible, so never be afraid to ask for help."
Sophomore,5,"Ole Miss is a great school for Liberal Arts, Science, History, Mathematics and Engineering disciplines. I am receiving a valuable education thus far with personal attention from faculty and wonderful research experience. I am starting my Sophomore year this month and has been an awesome experience thus far.  I have been on the Chancellor's list twice so far and look forward to many more times in the future. I highly recommend Ole Miss both academically and socially for an undergraduate degree."
Freshman,5,"I have only taken one class so far for the summer session, and itâ€™s pretty easy for me. My teacher makes sure to contact us, and she has even informed me of upcoming assignments that I did not realize or acknowledge as I should have."
Senior,5,COVID has been hard for me to adjust considering I am finally taken my major associated classes. My teachers were all very understanding and we all worked together to make sure it was an easy and adjustable transition for everyone. My grades didn't go down and the implementation of the Pass or Fail grading system alleviated a lot of the academic stress.
Senior,5,"I personally love Ole Miss. The teachers are amazing and you always leave the semester having a story to tell about each and every teacher you've had. Game days are not even comparable. A day in The Grove during any big SEC college game day is, in no exaggeration, on some people's bucket list. The hotels are all cute and quiet and perfect for a family of any style to enjoy their time. Double Decker is our small town version of an arts music festival where the city permits open container. Not only that, but Oxford is known for having one of the most beautiful campuses. There is hardly nothing to complain about, unless you don't like good people, a good time, good food, and even better memories. Hotty Toddy!"
Junior,5,I love this university! They really care about their students and help us succeed. I am so blessed to attend Ole Miss.
Junior,5,The professors are very helpful and want you to succeed. A lot of times they will take time to make sure you understand subjects that you don't understand. As long as you put in the work and study hard....you will have a good learning experience.
Senior,5,"My online classes have gone over super smoothly. My teachers transferred over super easily and I had no problems. 

3 of my five classes were already online or were done primarily online so it was an easier switch for me."
Senior,5,"I had a great experience at Ole Miss, the campus is beautiful and I always felt safe in the Oxford town. The classes were well organized and the professors care about us a lot."
Senior,5,Ole Miss does a great job offering online courses. You can normally reach the teachers by email or phone and they will respond to any questions or concern you have. It is easy to sign up and take an online course.
Junior,5,"The atmosphere and loving community give Ole Miss the family bond that is irreplaceable. They say once an ""Ole Miss Rebel, always an Ole Miss Rebel"", and that stands true. You will never forget the education, family, and bonds formed here."
Alum,5,"Ole Miss is way more than just a university. During my time, I met my best friends and created so many memories I will never forget. The saying ""One never truly graduates from Ole Miss"" is so true. It is my second home. 

I majored in accounting and had some of the best professors in the field."
Freshman,5,As an out of state student you will feel right at home at Ole Miss. The traditions of the campus are rich and everyone is welcoming and friendly. Not to mention the campus is beautiful and the academic programs are great!
Freshman,5,"The University of Mississippi is the absolute best decision of my life. Although, the people that attend there are the nicest and most humble people the thing that really sold me is the campus. It has such a home feeling and the best part is that you don't have to walk miles to get to your other classes. Another amazing feature is the architecture and landscaping, each building has its own distinguished look and every inch of the grounds is either trees or flowers."
Senior,5,My experience at the University of Mississippi is the best place to have spent my 4 years of college. The staff and peers are so welcoming and helpful for anything.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love the University of Mississippi! It has one of the most beautiful campuses I have ever seen. It is so much fun and a great education. You really cannot beat the environment.
Senior,5,I've had a great experience at Ole Miss. I haven't had any issues getting a job or creating connections due to the help from the School of Journalism.
Freshman,5,As soon as I stepped foot on the Ole MIss campus I felt at home. The southern hospitality is genuine. Professors are nice and most of the people are kind as well. They have always been willing to help me when I need it.
Senior,5,It is a great university to attend with a beautiful campus.  The diversity makes the experience for people who like to be in a diverse setting.  I would not change anything about this college because it is a very unique place.
Sophomore,5,"The University of Mississippi, also known as Ole Miss, is the most amazing university. The school spirit the student body has consistently throughout its sports and academics is absolutely stunning. The campus is beautiful and the students and professors are some of the most outstanding individuals I have ever had the pleasure of meeting."
Freshman,5,"In my opinion, the University of Mississippi is a great school. It come with a lot of amazing individuals and opportunities. The social life on campus is great. It is easy to get involved with different kinds of organizations. The appearance of the campus is beautiful. The leadership on campus, students and administration, is great. Alumni involvement is great. The celebrations on and off campus are very fun to be apart of. The diversity among the school is tremendous. There are a lot of people from economic, social, and physical backgrounds."
Niche User,5,I love the University of Southern Mississippi. The campus and the students there  made me confident about me going to school there. I love the student to teacher ratio and everything else that the campus had to offer.
Niche User,5,"The summer before senior year ensued panic, as I still had no idea where to even begin the college application process. The first (and only) college tour I took was at the University of Mississippi, and all my worries were immediately eased as I explored the campus and surrounding town of Oxford. Hearing from students and heads of departments that I was interested in both helped me decide my career path and choose what had become my dream college. Ole Miss is the only school I applied to and I could not be more excited about my choice to become a Rebel in the fall!"
Freshman,5,I love this campus and everything I have been able to get involved in while on campus. The teachers are great and so are all the people coming here from just about every state. All around good school and challenging classes.
Freshman,5,"I love how beautiful the campus is. It is designed so well and outstanding. Ole miss still has the ""old style"" view on a campus, which makes it all the more beautiful. My favorite part is we just bought these new food delievery robots that work wonders and are super intelligent. I love being here at ole miss and I cant imagine myself anywhere else."
Sophomore,5,The University of Mississippi is a beautiful campus. Here I met a ton of wonderful friends and mentors. You can never meet anyone with a bad bone here. Everybody helps you in every way possible and letâ€™s not forget about Saturdays in the grove ðŸ¥°
Junior,5,"The University of Mississippi provides wonderful educational opportunities and room to grow, expand, and network. Diversity and inclusion needs work, as do most of the students."
Freshman,5,The environment is so friendly and involved. The campus is also very beautiful and always has people hanging out. Love all of the teachers and makes learning easy.
Freshman,5,"The University of Mississippi has been a great experience so far! I have felt so welcome on campus and have loved seeing so many students being involved on campus for the betterment of the university. Even though it is a big university, the campus feels small and I see someone I know almost everywhere I go. Oxford is a small cozy town yet big enough to be happy in. I love going to Ole Miss!"
Freshman,5,I have loved my experience at the University of Mississippi so far. The campus is beautiful and very student friendly. The classes I have took have prepared me well for future classes and my experiences I will go through after college. The professors and students here are very welcoming and want you to learn and enjoy Ole Miss as much as they do!
Sophomore,5,"I like that it is an University, but at the same time, it feels so small and like a community. It made it easy coming from out of state, not knowing anyone, and now it feels so much like home."
Niche User,5,"The campus is beautiful with many things to do on and off campus. The party life at the school is unmatched, and football pregame in the grove is something no other school in the country has to offer."
Niche User,5,The campus is beautiful and I felt right at home! I can not wait to hopefully be apart of such an amazing environment! The University of Mississippi is certainly an awesome school to be able to attend!
Freshman,5,Ole Miss is a great school and I would definitely recommend it. The atmosphere is wonderful and not just on game days. The feelings have been that everyone has a great chance to succeed.
Junior,5,"I initially came to Ole Miss because I fell in love with the campus. It has a homey feel and southern elegance. I was worried it wouldn't be diverse, but I've met a larger variety of people here than anywhere else. The resources offered are great and I always look forward to returning to campus after breaks. I've made lots of different friends and feel very positive about my future thanks to a great learning environment and supportive advisors"
Freshman,5,I love going to college here. I haven't been here long but the life long friends I have gained have been incredible. I picked this University that is 6 1/2 hours from home and I wouldn't trade it for anything.
Junior,5,"The University of Mississippi is a home. It's where you create strong friendships and enjoy adult life on training wheels! I love Ole Miss for it's culture, experience, and the fun I have there. My education and degree are the top priority but making friends and enjoying college is also very important. I would recommend Ole Miss to everyone. Oxford is a home, and the people you will meet there make it even better!"
Sophomore,5,From the beginning Ole Miss has treated me Ike family! I love attending college here. It was been the greatest decision of my life!
Junior,5,I like the atmosphere at the University Mississippi and how their Nursing program allows me to pick a second major. This is what encouraged me to transfer to the University of Mississippi from LSU.
Junior,5,"I love the University of Mississippi. When I first came to this school, I was alone and I didn't know anyone here. This caused me to spend my first semester in my room after every class and I instantly wanted to transfer to a school closer to home. My second semester was totally different, I started to get more involved in different organizations and I made friends. The students here are very friendly and they love to include you in everything that they do. Also, the staff in my department is truly like my family. For example, the assistant (Mrs. Anne) in my department is very loving. She truly cares about the students' needs. There has been plenty of times when I've just went to her office and just told her all of my problems and even cried a couple of times. She gave me tissue to wipe my eyes and gave me advice on what to do next. Ole Miss is truly a great school to attend and I recommend anyone to come here, it is a home away from home."
Senior,5,"The University of Mississippi was the only college, out of the twelve I applied to, that actually made it feel like it was a home away from home! The people there are what make your experience great. I have friends all over from Mississippi itself to California. The sporting events are unreal with their incredible atmosphere. The town Ole Miss is in, Oxford, is one of the cutest towns ever. There is everything from eating, bars, and shopping. I'm also really into history and I enjoy hearing about how much history there is in Oxford and at Ole Miss. Hotty Toddy!"
Sophomore,5,The community at Ole Miss is unlike any other I have ever seen. There is so much love and support wherever you go. Oxford has my whole heart.
Junior,5,Ole Miss helped me to discover who I really am as a person. Also the friendly campus is a huge plus as well. It is very welcoming and itâ€™s a home away from home. I definitely made the right decision by picking The University of Mississippi as my top school of choice. I also love it so much there is nothing that I would change. Every school has its ups and downs but the good outways the bad here that you never focus on the bad. The weekdays feel just like the weekend. Not to mention all of the local restaurants and fun things to do that surround the campus! Oxford is definitely the place to go! I am so amazed also by the beautiful campus. Ole miss is rated for its surrounding beautiful campus. Everything is close together and not spaced out. So everything is decorated correctly and perfectly crafted that you feel as if you are in another place other than college. I am so inlove with Oxford and I hope you make the right decision to join us one day as well! Remember! Hotty Toddy!
Junior,5,"I have loved the University of Mississippi. I am currently a Junior working on a Bachelor's degree in Human Resources Management, and I have had the best professors so far. They really do help in every way that they can. Plus, Oxford is the best college town!"
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy going to Ole Miss, I'm currently a rising Sophomore and majoring in Journalism. The school so far has been such a great experience, I have met such great down to earth people along with professors. I have loved every day on campus, including the learning environment."
Senior,5,I grew up an Ole Miss fan and knew I would be coming here for college. I am a Communication Science and Disorders Major. I think that this major has great professors and a very helpful adviser.
Senior,5,Excellent professors. Beautiful campus. Lots of amenities and dining options. Diverse culture and great people.
Freshman,5,"The University of Mississippi is a great college to attend. The staff and professors are opening and helpful, especially the advisors, they are always there to help no matter what. Not only are the people at this college amazing, but the campus itself is beautiful. It feels wonderful to walk around this university and be able to call it my home. The campus is a safe place because of the people who work to make sure everyone feels comfortable and welcomed. I encourage people to attend the University of Mississippi because personally since I had been here I can never image myself going anywhere else."
Freshman,5,It was perfect no changes. I have loved all the people and people on staff who make it a wonderful place to go to school and enjoy every second of it.
Sophomore,5,"I love the small town vibe and the people of Oxford! The professors truly care about the success of the students, which is a fantastic bonus. I love all of the opportunities that Ole Miss offers. No matter what your interests are, there is a group that you can be involved in and belong to at Ole Miss. There is something for everyone! Hotty Toddy!"
Niche User,5,"Every time I call with a question the person on the other end is happy to help.  Everything is very fast and efficient.  As a whole, the community is very warm and welcoming to my family and me."
Graduate Student,4,"I have taken all my classes online during Fall 2020 and have taken a few online classes in the past. The online learning experience is not preferred, but it has been fine with the given circumstances."
Senior,4,"My first three years were fantastic. Everyone is super kind, the classes are hard but fun, and the teachers in the accounting program are all enthusiastic and well educated in their fields. 
As for the social aspects of going to Ole Miss, its exactly what you'd expect. Parties all the time! Some nights all the frats will through parties, so you just bounce from house to house on the row. Pretty much anyone can attend you don't have to be a member or a pretty girl; when you get there you scan your student ID at most house parties just incase something happens to you the school knows where you were. That makes a lot of girls feel more safe going to these parties because if something were to happen to us, then the school can help in the investigation. 
Football is obviously a major deal here. The Grove is like an alternate dimension, I don't know how else to describe how crazy and wild the Grove gets on game days. We may not be the best team in the SEC, but Ole Miss never loses a party."
Junior,4,"Let me begin by saying that I am a transfer student, which means that my experience will likely not be the same as others. Ole Miss gave me a substation amount of scholarships to attend their school and, overall, I do not regret my choice. The professors appear to be more interested in teaching than researching (which is very good for us students). However, if you did not start your higher education at Ole Miss, you will find it difficult to fit in. Cliques are present here."
Junior,4,I have a couple of classes online. The professors are very understanding and professional on how they provide work.
Junior,4,"I am currently still enrolled at the University of Mississippi. I am loving it here so far. Even though we all are going through a tough time with the pandemic, the university is still providing ways for students to feel welcome and safe overall."
Junior,4,"I am only in few online classes. It is difficult not seeing the teacher, but luckily, the teachers that I have send emails and answer questions if I need them to.  I do not think it is fair for students to be charged an extra $200 for having to take an online class and then getting charged an extra $100 for Cengage. We should not have to pay $300 to take online classes."
Senior,4,"I loved the academic advancements that this college has allowed me to fulfill. However, I would love to see more Mental Health awareness and Drug Abuse prevention on campus."
Sophomore,4,"When I came to college, I didn't really consider taking courses online, however, with the COVID-19 pandemic the University was forced to transition to that type of instruction.  It seemed very transparent and seamless.  It scared me at first, however, it has actually been quite a pleasure taking classes online. The professors have been great.  I now recommend this whole-heartedly."
Freshman,4,"I have come to love the campus and the staff. They are trying everything in their power to give us freshman a great first year experience in a safe way. The campus is very homey and not overwhelming,"
Junior,4,"I love the University of Mississippi, it is a very special place with a wealth of interpersonal connections. There are many resources available to students both financially and academically. The professors actively  care about the well-being of their students both personally and professionally. However there is a shocking lack of diversity given the demographics of the state of Mississippi as a whole. The university has a rich history but continues to struggle with reconciling the negative aspects of it. On a lighter note, the campus is beautiful and provides great opportunities for outside activities. On the whole, the people who choose to attend the University of Mississippi choose to do so because there is something welcoming about the campus and the people. There is an overwhelming sense of home and family that permeates both the campus and the city of Oxford. The city rallies around the school, and the school supports the city in perfect symbiosis."
Senior,4,"The campus is beautiful! Fun experiences and delicious food at the Grove. Nothing like Saturday Football. Many places to eat , hang out , and promote excellence through organizations and participation."
Senior,4,"My online experience was consistent and well managed. Communication was engaged by Zoom, while assignments and test were distributed through the schoolâ€™s online  classroom."
Junior,4,I personally love going here and almost everything about it but there is a deep rooted problem in racism that still continues to this day.
Junior,4,Online professors tend to be pretty lenient and try their best to help you in whatever way they can.
Graduate Student,4,"It really depends on the instructor, but I have been pretty lucky so far when it comes to my professors online. Blackboard is pretty easy to navigate and the instructors have been receptive to questions and have gotten back to me in a timely manner."
Graduate Student,4,Ole Miss has been a good experience so far. I am currently in grad school and my program is hybrid. The faculty in my program are great. The connections I have made with my cohort has been enjoyable and valuable as well! I would suggest Ole Miss for a grad program.
Alum,4,"The online experience is challenging, but if you plan well and coordinate your schedule accordingly, the online class will go smoothly if the teacher is working weel and ahead."
Alum,4,It was the best 4 years of my life. I met friends there that are lifetime friends and I learned so much over there.
Senior,4,"My experience at this university has been nothing short of amazing. I have been able to grow away from home and make a new home for myself within this university and their town. In Oxford I have grown into a young adult who handles her own car problems, apartment, utilities, books, and tuition. Here I learned responsibility. 

The university is great, education is what you would expect, and the professors go above and beyond. The campus is beautiful, always highly rated almost the most beautiful. The sports are top to watch in the SEC along with top tailgating. With the grove, circle, and beautiful building I have loved walking across campus and going to class. 

I have had one issue though, near the end of my senior year the guidance from my advisors was not so great. They refused to help me get into a class I needed even though they said they would put me in it. This left me basically helpless with it being my last class. I worked it out bit this is the only reason they got 4/5 star"
Senior,4,"I have loved attending the University of Mississippi. I had the opportunity to attend the regional campus in Booneville. Occasionally we would travel to Oxford for workshops, and I love the campus. The professors are also top notch. I have learned so much at my time with Ole Miss. Classes were difficult at times, but the professors were always ready to help - day or night. I also met some of my best friends through the University of Mississippi. I know if I ever need anything, I could call up a classmate, and they would be there to help me. Ole Miss has helped prepare me for the real world, and for that I am thankful. It has been a pleasure attending this university for the past two years."
Sophomore,4,"This college was fairly easy to apply to. The hardest part was filling out the scholarship application aftering being accepted, as it was very bulky and time consuming to fill out. Overall it was not too bad though."
Junior,4,"I love the one-on-one attention with professors and the courses I take. However, it is heavily Greek-centered and a party school. But if you do your own thing, there are plenty of wonderful friends and fun things to do!"
Junior,4,The professors and advisors are very patient and willing to take their time to work with you. You can tell that they are passionate about what they do.
Sophomore,4,"I love the University Of Mississippi! Even though I am from Oxford, MS, I can truly agree when one says that this campus is a home away from home. My overall college experience has been nothing more than amazing! I would 10/10 recommend this university for anyone who is stuck between choosing a college."
Junior,4,"Ole Miss has such a pretty campus, truly. I haven't had a bad professor yet, and it is my third year here. I will admit though, greek life is very prevalent on campus and it can be a bit bombarding, especially if you choose not to rush like I did. Still, I don't feel like something is missing from my college experience even though I never joined a sorority. People are kind, but there is some definite entitlement that fills the air in Oxford, MS. All in all, if you play your cards right, find great friends, join a club, and major in something you love, Ole Miss is a great place to call home."
Niche User,4,"I have not attended Ole Miss, but I plan to do so in the future. I have visited the campus as well as attended the MOST Conference. Attending the MOST Conference during the summer is really what made me finally decide this was the school for me. A lot of African Americans get the wrong idea when it comes to Ole Miss being a PWI. The Black community on this campus is phenomenal, and only continues to get better as the years go by."
Freshman,4,"This is an amazing university! I am so glad I chose to continue my education at Ole Miss! There are always activities to do and organizations to get involved in, and the hospitality on this campus is unmatched!"
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus more than anything. Whether it is a sunny spring day or a gloomy and rainy day, it is absolutely beautiful. It is easy to get around and most buildings are in good condition. I also really love the school spirit of the students and the student life. My classes are good, but I wish some of my courses had more class times offered. Greek life is huge here, but it is also a very large expense. The schoolâ€™s meal plans are also quite expensive and the system is kind of confusing at first, but the food options are very good."
Senior,4,"So far itâ€™s been pretty cool, though I didnâ€™t do much partying, that is something that goes on pretty much every other day.  The people seem nice and the professors are great.  If you need additional help they tend to be a really useful resource that students can depend on, which makes sense because they have PhDâ€™s."
Senior,4,My experience was great! Good teachers that are willing to help the students during class and during office hours. The students are helpful in many ways. The University of Mississippi has a lot of school pride and is a great and diverse University.
Sophomore,4,"Ole Miss is a university inside of a continuously growing neighborhood. Compared to other large universities, the campus would best be described as a circle inside of a circle. Every building, night life, and sporting complex is within 5 to 10 minutes away -- with accessible transportation (bus routes). Ole Miss is one of the most beautiful campuses, with spring blooming flowers and an evergreen Grove."
Senior,4,The University of Mississippi is a great college to attend. They challenge you and expect the best from you. The college has all type of resources for you to use for many situations.
Freshman,4,"All in all, Ole Miss cares about their students. There are many things that could be changed and could make things better, but that will be true anywhere you go. The University of Mississippi cares deeply about the safety and well-being of their students, and not just about turning them into some sort of cold machine. They value personal input and individualism and most of the teachers here are very encouraging and helpful, you just have to reach out. It's a fun and energetic campus and town, and it's far more diverse than many people think. There are majors, classes, organisations, and scenes to fit everybody."
Freshman,4,"The University of Mississippi is so easy to call home, because it prioritizes and cherishes the strong sense of community that ties the campus together. Its beautiful campus in the cozy city of Oxford is home to professors who provide students with healthy, challenging opportunities to grow and students who prepare for the real world by applying themselves in various ways in numerous student organizations. With the University Police Department's constant availability, student and faculty safety remains a top priority. SEC athletic events always offer a fun, exciting break from studies. Overall, the University of Mississippi uses its many resources to welcome students and turn them into a family."
Sophomore,4,"So far, my experience at the University of Mississippi has been a good one. The people are really nice and genuine. They truly represent the southern hospitality stigma that is associated with the southern states. That can be said for the students and the staff. I love the campus. It's really beautiful and everything is easily accessible. Education-wise, it is awesome. They give you a healthy challenge and make sure you go in the right direction with your major. They even care about your wellbeing. Attending Ole Miss is great because you feel like you are a part of a community."
Junior,4,The University of Mississippi is a great place to attend. Students and professors are very welcoming and it feels like a family.
Freshman,4,"Ole Miss is great. Some of our sports kind of suck. More money needs to be given for academics, rather than sports. Class registration should also be better, and Greek life should be cheaper and not such a big aspect of the school. The party scene is pretty good if you know people, but UPD needs to calm down. Academics are fairly easy depending on your major and what high school you went to."
Senior,4,"Let me start off by saying, I love this school. I am not a sorority girl or particularly southern or a big partier, and I love this school. All types of people come here, good bad and in between. You can find your people here I can assure you. The academics are also phenomenal. I am a computer science major and my professors and department head are nothing short of fantastic. The only negative thing about Ole Miss is the perception is terrible and incorrect, and it needs to change."
Junior,4,I love the University of Mississippi! This school has so many opportunities for you as an individual. It is very easy to find your way and where you belong here. I would love to see more diversity within the University though.
Senior,4,"The University of Mississippi is a great school! It is a large school that feels small. It gives everyone the opportunity to be involved in many different organizations. Although the school has been the center of some not great publicity, it really is an inclusive environment for everyone."
Senior,4,I like the campus and it is very welcoming as a campus. The teachers and students are great. Everyone is so helpful and understanding. The campus is beautiful.
Senior,4,Ole Miss is a very fun school. Greek life rules campus and a vast amount of the professors don't speak fluent English. Chicken on a stick is great!
Senior,4,"Ole Miss is a wonderful school that has many things for every student. The teachers are great, and everything administrative is easily accessed. The school has tried very hard to shed its reputation as a racist institution and contextualize monuments from before integration. My only problem is that the school is weighted so heavily towards Greek life that anyone not participating finds it almost impossible to find friends or leadership opportunities. It is also a huge party school. You can find students drinking heavily on the Square on a Wednesday or Tuesday night."
Senior,4,"Everything about Ole Miss is amazing! For the most part all professors are easy to get a hold of and are more than willing to help you. Although, the downfall is that the advisors are not the most helpful people at the university. Parking is also getting to be a giant problem as the school keeps increasing the number of students enrolled. Ole Miss is among the most beautiful campuses in the nation. I would not want to go anywhere else!"
Sophomore,4,"So far the campus seems very cozy. It feels like home in a sense. Everyone is nice. You do have to walk everywhere, but you get used to it after a while. I personally like how inclusive the most of the organizations are. They feel like a family. No is every left out or feels isolated."
Freshman,4,"So far, I love it.  I love being involved in the new freshman activities.  Learning about the school's traditions has been exciting.  I need to get use to the long walks to class and sharing my small dorm room."
Sophomore,4,"University of Mississippi seats in a beautiful campus setting. Superficially, it seems like it does not have a lot to offer to the students to get involved inside the campus. However, provided through  research is done, it has best opportunities including free volunteering, to paid on campus job depending on the interest. The best part of the campus is its safety at its best and very beautiful campus. It is worthy to say this is home to sea of beautiful girls with hospitality kind of culture. Moreover, unlike many other universities, bus service around the campus makes it a better place to move here and there. Talking about the academics, the course is not that rigorous and provided the assignments are done in time, securing outstanding grade should not be a big deal. The university also got a lot of recreation spots. One can hit to the sophisticated gym or tennis court or spacious soccer and football court and all."
Junior,4,"Absolutely one of the most beautiful campuses, with one of the best available educations in the nation. Rated as an R1 institution, Ole Miss is a great choice for anyone wanting a great school in a great location."
Niche User,4,The University of Mississippi is a great school! They gave me an opportunity to earn college credits early so I can get ahead in school. The atmosphere is very friendly and the campus and dorms are very nice and clean!
Junior,4,"The culture and tradition the school brings with it is incredible, and absolutely something I am thankful to experience every day."
Junior,4,I enjoyed the rich history Ole Miss has to offer. The campus is beautiful and the people in the Oxford community are very friendly and welcoming. Iâ€™d like to see Ole Miss incorporate more things for college students to do after hours. Not just go to the bars on the square.
Freshman,4,"I'm only a freshman so I really haven't done a lot of things, but honestly Ole Miss is a very profound school. People are very sweet, kind, and helpful. Most teachers are very encouraging towards their students and want the absolute best for them."
Sophomore,4,I am an out-of-state student and I love Ole Miss. Everyone is super welcoming right when you get on campus. The only change I would make is that there are a lot of teachers who aren't strong at speaking English so I would like to see that change.
Freshman,4,I really enjoy my time here at the University of Mississippi. Ever since coming here I have met new people and experienced so many new things. I am positive that I made the right decision to come here. HOTTY TODDY!!!
Freshman,4,It has been a challenge. Sorority week was awful but I ended up in the sorority that was the right fit for me. I have made lifelong friends. So far classes are tough but are going well. My roommate left and went back home so dorm life has been quiet.
Freshman,4,"My experience at the University Of Mississippi has been great overall. Starting off as a freshman student wasnâ€™t as easy at first. Being new and not having friends along with me was quite hard, and I thought my adjustment away from home wouldnâ€™t be as easy as I thought, but the students around campus made it so much easier. Their kindness and friendliness made me feel in a sense safe because knowing that you are in environment feel with such positive energy makes the experience so much. Getting to know new people on campus made me learn new things and also made me enjoy pursuing my education even more here. So far I have enjoyed my freshman year here at Ole Miss, and I am very excited to see what the next few years will bring."
Freshman,4,"I love this school because of the friends that I have made and the quality of the classes that I have taken here so far. The main reason I did not give theis school a full five stars is because there is too many parties. Of course college for many is a time to party every weekend and all that, but it seems really over board here."
Freshman,4,"I love the campus and the people here are always so friendly. Game day in the grove is something amazing to see. It is also pretty easy to get help with whatever you need academically. Overall, It is such an amazing school to be a part of."
Niche User,4,My best friend goes to the university and I have visited the campus multiple times. I really enjoyed the staff and the experiences that I have had.
Freshman,4,"Ole Miss has wonderful academics, faculty, and administration. The only aspect of Ole Miss that is at times troublesome is the culture of drinking present in many undergraduate students."
Junior,2,This School was is fun to attend! I love missipe! I would love to send my kids there. great food options as well
Recent Alumnus,2,The freshman are required to stay on campus while the upper class is not allowed to stay on campus at all.  They don't have enough dorms to fit the student population and yet they keep expanding student population.
College Sophomore,2,It is so gross and not tended to correctly. It needs to be knocked down and redone.
College Sophomore,2,"The focus is on the wrong things. People are too focused on their social lives. I pay a lot of money to go to school, and everything is out dated. The workers are even mean. The grove is beautiful, but it doesn't feel welcoming.

My classes are huge, and my teachers don't use class in an orderly manner. They don't teach the material well at all.

A lot of kids cheat and get away with it. I know a lot of kids who pay their friends to take their tests for them. Class is not organized and all over the place. Our blackboard is horrible, and most teaches don't even use it. I have 5 different things to check my assignments."
College Junior,2,i live off campus but this is pretty much consensus
College Junior,2,insanely huge part of the school's culture
College Senior,2,"It's pretty prevalent. You can find drugs at any party if you wanted. ""Study drugs"" are a pretty common thing as well."
College Sophomore,2,"Awful- bathrooms, rooms, all of it. Living in squalor is the best way to describe it."
College Senior,2,"I chose Ole Miss because it was the least expensive option. For me, it was actually cheaper to go here than to attend a community college or an in-state school. I'm glad that I did choose here for that reason.

However, I don't feel at home here. I don't drink or party or do drugs. Everyone else does. There are few people until the latter half of the four years- after a decent number of students have transferred or washed out (due to alcohol/drug violations or not studying) that people stop and take academics seriously. I'm a year older than the rest of my class because I took a gap year, and because of that I'm the only one who actually has a clear focus on my grades. It's shameful.

The school is beautiful. The food is bad. The people are nice. The academics are not good.

I'm transferring out as soon as I can get a decent option. Oh well. I gave it a shot."
College Sophomore,2,Out of state students above the poverty level with a 3.5 have nothing
College Junior,2,Allow will allow you to take out a limited amount of loans when you have no other way of paying for school.
College Freshman,2,It could always be better. Everything in Oxford is way overpriced so it's very hard to find a reasonable place to live.
College Freshman,2,"Basically, if you do not have a 4.0 GPA or are not an athlete here you get NO money whatsoever. They do not help any individual who is trying to get by with any financial aid."
College Sophomore,2,"It's tough, but in truth, it's fair. They've had to start implementing some more serious consequences for drug and alcohol violations that at other universities would be considered absolutely ridiculous, but Ole Miss was getting the kind of reputation that required that kind of action. Parking on the other hand is terrible. The parking officers will give you a ticket even when they aren't supposed to be working. I got a ticket a couple of weeks ago at 9:00 at night, an there was no one around for it to be an issue. I've found this to be a common issue at universities, probably owing to the fact that it's just plain easy money."
College Freshman,2,They're really isn't much to do off campus
College Senior,2,"Being a victim of sexual assualt at this university, I know first hand how seriously the universities police department takes sexual assualt. However, the biggest problem is getting someone comfortable enough to speak up about an assault here."
College Sophomore,2,I'm in college I should not have to check people in.
College Junior,2,I don't like the food
College Junior,2,African American doesn't get treated the same as white greeks
College Freshman,2,"Greek life may be good for people, but has no impact on other people."
College Freshman,2,I'm struggling greatly with out of state fees.
College Senior,2,"The doctors there aren't very knowledgeable. I had a skin infection and they couldn't figure it out. The second time I went, there was a doctor who didn't even speak English and just prescribed me cream for Athlete's foot - didn't help."
College Senior,2,There have been a couple break-ins at a few places and the prices are expensive. Most managements are rude and don't take the students seriously. You usually have to bring a parent along if you want to get answers.
College Freshman,2,There is not enough parking for students.
College Freshman,2,They are all obsessed with their fraternities and sororities.
College Freshman,2,I lived in minor hall my freshman year and it was new and very nice.
College Freshman,2,A lot of fast food and not many restaurants that are not chain.
College Freshman,2,There is not much diversity on campus in any way.
College Freshman,2,"The alcohol use on campus is extreme, and the police don't do anything about it as long as you do not drive under the influence."
College Junior,2,The on campus housing sucks. They are absolutely disgusting and need to be sanitized.
College Freshman,2,"I attend the best university in MS and it attracts a lot of people which makes finding a parking spot very difficult because everyone has a vehicle; however, a parking garage is being built :)"
College Junior,2,"I do not associate with many people who partake in drugs, but I am going to guess that the couple that I know about are bad if even I am aware of it."
College Freshman,2,Parking here is insanely problematic to anyone cutting it close. Get there early if you want to find a spot and not be late.
College Freshman,2,"The few dining options here on campus are not the best! There are about ten dining options and these include: chick-fil-a, subway, papa john's, (big name well-known food chains)! The university created restaurants include: burger studio, magnolia, sunami, a taco place, and a sandwich place! Out of all these choices to choose to eat from, there is still room enough for complaints! The at all of these restaurants is not that good, at all!!!!!!!!! Honestly, I do NOT believe any of the food is cooked with the best of products,which is sad because we all pay so much money to attend school hrre!!!!!! The restaurants and the food that is served definitely needs  a major improvement!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
College Sophomore,2,One can rarely find a good parking spot.
College Freshman,2,The busses arent really useful 
College Sophomore,2,"Because there are huge freshman classes coming with cars, parking has become a nightmare if you live off-campus. The only guaranteed parking are for students living in dorms, and even then they are separated into zones.  "
College Freshman,2,There are simply not enough spots for students who have a parking pass. This forces them to have to park illegally and get tickets.
College Senior,2,On campus housing is  very expensive and not very updated compared to off campus housing
College Senior,2,It is very hard to get internships or scholarships. I have tried very hard
College Senior,2,We are supposed to be getting a new union with better food options but right now i am not happy with what we have
College Senior,2,Parking is a hassle. you always have to try to find parks that aren't very close.
College Senior,2,Diversity is lacking but the school is trying to make up for that.
College Senior,2,There is overcrowding and a dire need for modern transportation 
College Sophomore,2,They offfer more scholarships to in-state students..
College Sophomore,2,"Oxford is one of the most expensive college towns I've ever encountered.  Although the rest of Mississippi's cost of living is fairly low, Oxford stands out as an anomaly because of its popularity in Mississippi, Alabama and across the south for having an excellent educational reputation.  Many alumni of the Univ. of Miss buy and rent out places to live.  The rates are sky-high and the town has grown in terms of off-campus housing availability.  There are lots of great apartment complexes to choose from, but many charge by the bedroom which drives up overall cost of an apartment.  And good luck finding a studio or efficiency to rent in Oxford - they're pretty non-existent.  I would liken the cost of living off-campus in Oxford to that of living in a wealthy suburban bedroom community of any U.S. major city.  Also, transportation is only just widening with a University and Oxford town shuttle system called O.U.T. that just increased their stopping times to 9 PM.  Shuttle bus stops do not extend to the outskirts of Oxford.  For lower cost off-campus housing opportunities outside of Oxford, forget public transportation if you don't have a vehicle because there is none."
College Junior,2,The On-campus housing is okay. The older dorms are kind of sketchy and gross and need some renovations which are coming along. The bathrooms are communal and it could definitely use some sprucing up. The new dorms however are beautiful! The bathrooms are only shared among 4 students and everything is clean and brand new. Wood floors and everything.
College Junior,2,They charge too much for too little spots. They refuse to expand parking but continue to raise prices. They also tend to ignore any student or faculty feedback to their policies and continue to implement ones that no one seems to support.
College Junior,2,Best thing I can say is to be on the hush hush! You will be busted if you advertise your business!!
College Sophomore,2,"It's very hard to go to school here unless you're a white, Christian, male or female. Black and white don't speak to each other. If you're a liberal and try to speak up on campus, people are just going to get pissed off."
College Sophomore,2,"some are nice, some are s***. either way, dorms suck."
College Sophomore,2,It is an average union that has the basic fast food places. It could be a little more sanitary in my opinion.
College Freshman,2,Not enough parking for on-campus and off-campus students. Tickets are given out like candy.
College Sophomore,2,The drug scene at Ole Miss is big.  Alcohol consumption is the biggest problem.  Ole Miss was voted biggest party school several times by a leading national magazie so drug and alcohol use comes with the territory.
College Freshman,2,"I did not receive any financial aid at Ole Miss.  I have a federal loan and a private loan currently.  It is easier to receive financial aid if you score high on your ACT's or SAT's, and participate in sports or band.  So work hard on your academics and you should have plenty of luck."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorm RAs are very strict about alcohol and drug use. Unless you are extremely careful, they will give you a strike and send a letter to your parents. You are also in danger of being expelled from the University."
College Freshman,2,"Ole Miss is a very conservative campus. Students are generally non-openminded and do not associate well with those who break the status quo, whether it be because of race, gender, or sexual orientation."
College Junior,2,"As far as timing goes, they are helpful at providing services. But Im not quite sure about the doctors. Ive went for 3 different occasions, and all of those occasions led to misdiagnosis, for minor things. After the third time, I finally just started going to the doctor in town."
College Junior,2,The police force is very strict on where you park so make sure that you are in the correct parking lot for your parking decal and that you are parked facing with the flow of traffic and not in front of a fire hydrant.
College Freshman,2,"Permit Cost is okay if you're using it both semesters and live on campus. I don't know much about parking if you don't live on campus. It's pretty hard finding spots that are where you are allowed to park. If you have a friend who is bringing a car that you don't mind riding along with you can probably get by. There's always buses to take to get around. I don't drive off campus too much other than to go to Walmart or the Square, but I am the only one among my friends to have brought my car and I drive them wherever they need to go."
Sophomore,1,I did not take any online courses there. But I am sure those would be as terrible as their in person classes.
Sophomore,1,"Choosing University of Mississippi is my biggest mistake of my life. This is a terrible school, the faculties and educational system are in a bad shape. They do not assist their students in the way they should. The city is too small with little things to do. I would never come back there again. There are a lot of better schools out there that you can choose and go. I strongly recommend to AVOID going to university of Mississippi."
Freshman,1,"I went to Ole Miss for one semester and had to transfer. My experience was completely different from what I thought it would be. The food options are all unhealthy in the union, the party scene is out of control and most students will go out 5-7 nights out of the week. If you are not in greek life, you are frowned upon. My dorm was so old and crusty that everyone was sick the whole time I was there and even got carbon monoxide poising!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"The value of my degree is that I have semi-technical degree.  The education I received at Ole Miss, however, is not what I will be putting to use in my career.  I would be relying on what I learned at community college.  The work here built on it only marginally.  Actually, there is a teacher that is adamantly against Object Oriented programming.  It blows my mind how a professor could be against what the entire industry agrees is best practice for most cases."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I transferred here after studying at community college for 2 years.  I found I was exceptionally prepared for classes and had no trouble adjusting.  Actually, the classes here were a joke.  The foundation of classes here is what is referred to as a ""Test Bank.""  This was an entirely new idea to me upon arrival.  It's a list of test questions and answers for a specific class.  If you get the test bank then there is no need to show up to class or even study.  The Test Banks are more often than not verbatim the questions AND answers to tests.

How do you get the test bank?  One way is to join any of the greek organizations.  They all have collections of Test Banks.  If you aren't in one of these organizations, you need to have a little charisma, especially when asking a sorority girl.  The guys seems to give it out more freely.  Once someone outside of greek has it, they spread like wildfire.

I'm fairly certain most test banks come from a sorority girl sleeping with a professor.  This is an absurd accusation to make, but hear me out.  I was sitting in an auditorium lecture, when I first discovered Test Banks were a thing.  I over heard a conversation, on of the guys near me asked a girl ""Hey, can you send me the Test Bank?""  She replied with,  ""No, we aren't allowed to give it out.""  Now, why would someone not be allowed to give it out?  Is it cheating?  If it is then they shouldn't be allowed to use it.  If not, then to me, it must be because of the amount of work some one went through OR the shady work someone did to get them.  Based on the fact that it's a simple as taking a picture of the test, it can't be for former and there for must be the latter.

Do the teachers not know there is a test bank?  If not, then how can you say anything positive about their involvement with their students.  If they do know about the Test Bank and don't even change the wording of their questions, how can you say they are good teachers?"
Recent Alumnus,1,"In a quick summation this school will not prepare you for adult life. They have no real connections to major cities like Chicago or New York or Miami. My major was finance that school has nothing to offer business majors. However, Milorad Novicevic, Stewart Schaeffer, and a Ghanain Economics teacher whos name I do not remember were good professors. The professors were like all from the North or other countries so honestly I liked most of them. But for 40k a year out of state tuition?? gimme a break. A degree from this school is beyond weak try applying to Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, or CME with it and youll know what I mean. Stick to colleges near large cities so you can actually get a job/internship to go along with your thousands of dollars in debt. You can ignore all of this if you are from the south and love living in small towns though best of luck."
Recent Alumnus,1,Its overemphasized and childish I would over hear women in their 40s gossip about their former greek affiliations.... get a life
Recent Alumnus,1,"Let me start off by saying I'm from the Chicago metro area, and I would strongly advise prospective students from areas similar to these to not go to Ole Miss. I'll start by saying something positive which, in all honesty, cant be refuted even by someone with a negative bias (like me)... The campus is gorgeous and very well manicured walking back to my apartment or to class was always enjoyable especially at night when all was quiet. Now, for the many negatives, first there is no diversity and I'm saying this as a Caucasian from a middle class family. And when I say ""diversity"" I dont mean just black and white I mean theres no Americans with ethnic backgrounds (italians, germans, irish, polish, russian, greek). I found this stifling and I found I was kicking myself upon realizing this because duh its the middle of nowhere Mississippi. This being said, the people or the most part are very simple minded and lack culture, basic things I view as part of life they dont even partake in or cant relate too. I dont think they know what suburbs are or what an actual shopping mall is, they dont know what going to professional sporting event is like, or being in an actual large city, they dont know what riding a train is like. These are just simple things that come to my mind. Many students there come from small towns surrounded by nothing. I'm used to being in an area of 8 million + people with an unlimited amount of things to do. The town is filled with extremely average amenities (restaurants) that are lauded as being special (I assure you they are not). And you are surrounded by absolutely nothing!! I was losing my mind. Memphis is like ""the big city"" to them... I think it has like a sears and a macy's...  At this point I'm just going to throw out random gripes: they have a weird cultish greek life that they put exorbitant value in if you aren't in it you will find yourself lacking things to do and people to meet (im running out of space hope ished some light on this 4 u)"
College Freshman,1,"Greek life does nothing but ruin the campus. The process of rush for both Fraternities and Sororities over-runs the campus even for non-greek students. If you are not a part of Greek life you are looked down upon. The sororities are an army of oversized t-shirt wearing snobby white girls. The fraternities are full of dim-witted guys who only want to party and struggling to maintain their 2.5 GPA to stay an active. If you are not considering Greek life at all, DO NOT COME HERE."
College Freshman,1,"There aren't enough scholarships for out of state kids, as well as students who are not freshman. I feel like they could offer more scholarships."
College Junior,1,"I'm not a part of the Greek life here but it runs/ruins everything.  The typical Ole Miss fratstar is a scrub in my book.  Frat life is filled with the all-state croquet players who were no-body's in high school that come to Ole Miss and get pumped about doing a frat because it means they might actually have some social significance.  Granted, if they weren't in frat, nobody would care who they are.  By joining a frat you are basically paying $5,000/year to get a status symbol and buy your ""friends"".  If you aren't in frat you are second tier to girls.  Girls here deeply care about status symbols (frats), what car you drive, how much money you have etc.  The Greek life ruins the social scene at this school, good luck having a good time and meeting people if you aren't in a frat.  This is coming from an Engineering major, in great shape, athletic, just not in a frat."
College Sophomore,1,"So parking is VERY bad on campus. That is something they are currently in the process of redoing, but it is bad. Parking police are Nazis, but it can be hard to find a spot anywhere else. You don't need a car on campus, because you can walk pretty much anywhere and buses take you to the store. However, it is a nice convenience...can be expensive...but is a nice convenience."
College Junior,1,It's basically only available to Mississippi residents
College Sophomore,1,The weather blows and I hate it. Most unpredictable and miserable weather ever. It is the beginning of April and I am just now putting away my jackets and coats and boots.
College Senior,1,It sucks. It's so boring here.
College Freshman,1,"It's so hard to find a place to park and you can only park in designated places, usually a parking lot near your dorm. "
College Junior,1,"PARKING AT THIS UNIVERSITY DRIVES ME INSANE. THE EXPECTATIONS OF FINDING A SPOT ARE OUTRAGEOUSLY LOW, AND WHEN YOU HAVE TO IMPROVISE YOU'LL HAVE A TICKET TO SHOW FOR IT. DIRECTOR OF PARKING ADMITTED TO OVERSELLING PARKING BY 45 DECALS SO THERE ARE MORE CARS THAN SPOTS. I LIVE ON CAMPUS AND CAN HARDLY PARK AFTER LEAVING TO GET TO MY OWN ROOM. RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!"
College Junior,1,PARKING SUCKS AT THIS UNIVERSITY AND THE SHUTTLE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE/LATE/INCONSISTENT. 
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus can be ridiculous most of the time. Especially during the weekdays. You'll be able to find better parking spaces on campus on the weekends because that's when most students decide to visit home. If you live off campus it's best to come to campus at least 30 minutes before class begins. That way you'll be able to find a good spot. During your freshmen year, do not expect to get the best parking spots."
College Sophomore,1,The campus police force can be very strict about underage drinking and drug use. The first time an offender gets caught they get something like a referral sent home. The second time it happens that person is most likely in danger of losing their housing. The policy about these things are pretty serious so there really is no third time. It's just best to stay away from them but if you must  drink then do it discreetly and not out in the open. You'll  get busted if you don'y make wise choices about it!
College Junior,1,I feel that the financial aid office really do their worst at helping anyone.  I have never received my full aid and they push students to get loans instead of the money they are eligible for through fasfa. I have never received enough to pay for all of my classes and books. I have to choose not to buy some of my books every semester because of this and I believe that the financial aid office is bias and completely wrong based on the way I have been treated. I have hardly any money and I do not work because of my child and the continue to use my husband's income even though we were separated an entire year.
College Junior,1,All parking goes to teachers and students that are not using transportation at all or live on campus and are walking distance to their classes
College Junior,1,I have been told that my gpa is not good enough and I need to do better. I have done this and now I can not take the classes needed to graduate on time. I feel that the school is very unfair to me because I have struggled to finish school only to have an extra year added to my time in school. I also feel that they are nit as helpful as they claim to be because I have been really working hard to get through school and receive a degree and they are making it very difficult.
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is the worst. There is hardly ever anywhere to park
College Junior,1,"I always eventually get my financial aid, but first have to go in person and talk to multiple people before it ever comes through. Also, when I first applied and got accepted I was passed up for finical aid I qualified for because they finical aid office incorrectly marked me down as a transfer student. By the time the mistake was realized the school had disbursed all the finical aid and refused to give me any. I missed out on thousands of dollars of finical aid because of the finical aid offices mistake."
College Junior,1,"Greek life is very important at ole miss and if you are not a part of it it is impossible to participate in any student government activities. The Greek life certianly creates a culture where even people who are not Greek affiliated feel they have to party and drink to be taken seriously. Personally I feel the Greek life here has too much control over the student body and encourages an environment that is detrimental to the purpose of the university, learning."
College Junior,1,Parking is quite an issue. There is not enough spaces and you spend quite a bit of time just walking from the parking lot. Commuter lots are not located close to campus buildings.
College Sophomore,1,"I'd give this a higher grade except for the fact that nobody tells you nursing school is three hours south in Jackson, MS. No one also tells you that you better come in with outstanding SAT/ACT scores in order to get into the classes you need for the nursing program. The program also discriminates against out of state students, preferring to keep the program completely Mississippi bred. If you don't keep up with your prerequisites, you're bound to end up doing three years instead of two for nursing school."
College Sophomore,1,All my financial aid came from the government not the school. I applied for the only scholarship through the school that I could and I was denied.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no diversity at Ole Miss. The only diversity is students from different states. The girls are in sororities and the boys are in fraternities. Most are middle-upper class, people dress the same. I personally love it. I wasn't looking for diversity so Ole Miss was perfect."
College Sophomore,1,Parking at the school is very expensive and can be hard to find if you do not come early.
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is a hassle. There is rarely enough space, and on game weekends you can forget about driving because you'll never find a place to park."
College Freshman,1,"If you do not have a car your two legs are the only way to get around Oxford, Mississippi.   There isn't even GreyHound service to get out of the city."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is awful. There is not enough spaces on campus to accommodate for all the students that commute to campus in a car.  Although, a new parking system has been implemented, where a student can park on an off-campus parking site and ride a bus into campus: it is effective but sometimes inefficient for time."
College Freshman,1,"There is not that much diversity at ole miss.  Most people are very conservative, christian, white, and in the middle class, upper class economically.  It is a VERY preppy school.  However you will see every different types of people, the above statement does not regard everyone at the school, but the majority of them."
College Junior,1,weed is a predominant drug at ole miss. students use it very visibly. Some teachers even by it from the students. No joke.
College Junior,1,"parking at the college campus is horrible. There are barely any available parking spaces, so many students take the bus to class.Students even take the bus to class from where they parked their cars."
College Junior,1,Ole miss is very strict. However I wouldn't change my experience for anything. They have strict visitation hours ending at midnight and if someone pulls a fire alarm prepare to not see your friends for 2 weeks minimum in your room! Teachers are also very strict on attendance. However the worst part by far is ole miss parking services. They will give you a ticket for even touching the line of your parking spot!
College Senior,1,I go to a satelite campus where we have no sorority.
College Sophomore,1,"Ole Miss is not very diverse at all.  Students tend to befriend people strictly of their own race.  It is very rare to see groups of mixed races together at this school.  Even in the Union and classrooms this is visible.  Most students here come from a pretty wealthy background which is very obvious.  You see a lot of girls with BMWs and Mercedes, and boys with big trucks and SUVs.  For political beliefs, most students are Conservative Republicans.  Branches of Protestant Christianity are by far the most common religion, and there seems to be a pretty big number of Catholics as well."
College Senior,1,it sucks. you can't get parking within half a mile of campus so you might as well walk from your house or take a bike- the parking ordeal has been a disaster- and UPD loves booting students' cars
College Senior,1,"I had an awesome internship but only because of my advisor and I breaking our necks to fill out endless forms for approval- the university was not helpful at all and does not generally encourage internships outside of the ""Washington Internship Experience""- my internship experience was incredible but not because Ole Miss helped out any..."
College Freshman,1,"The parking at Ole Miss is scarce, especiallly if you life by frats or sororities and go home on the weekends and come back on Sundays. You will never find a parking place due to all of the commuters parking there to go to their houses. Also, there aren't enough parking places for the number of ID's the UM Police Department gives out which results in parking tickets."
College Freshman,1,Its in the middle of nowhere!!!!!! If you're used to that kind of thing you'll be fine but if you're not then you'll get very sick of it very fast
College Freshman,1,"Parking at Ole Miss is awful. I got a parking ticket my second week at school for being in an designated fire lane. There are never enough spaces, and the cops seem to spend all their time searching for someone to give a ticket to."
College Freshman,1,"Pretty much everyone drinks. Many people smoke cigarettes and marijuana, and a good bunch do harder drugs. You just have to know people. If not, Ole Miss may seem like no one does anything more than drink and smoke cigarettes."
College Sophomore,1,"It is an understatement to say I love Ole Miss but parking is literally the most complicated thing to do at the school. Yes, parking is available but chances are you will have to drive around numerous times before you find a parking spot. Commuters have it the worst because parking is very limited and if they are lucky enough to find a parking spot they are in the middle of nowhere. Either way if you are looking for a parking spot prepare to leave 30 minutes early from your house, apartment, condo, etc or else you will be late for class."
College Sophomore,1,"Good example: ""Parking on campus can be a nightmare. Be sure to get to campus at least 30 minutes before your class to ensure you'll get a space and make it to class on time. As a freshman, you get the worst parking.""

Except freshman don't really need to worry about parking since they live right on campus."
College Senior,1,The parking at Ole Miss is a hassle. There are way more students and faculty then there are parking spots. Some mornings it takes thirty minutes to find a spot.
College Sophomore,1,"The Dorms are noisy, crowded, dirty, generally bad places to live.
The elevators routinely break down leaving people trapped inside and others having to walk up 10 flights of stairs.
The fire alarms go off at all hours, including at 7:00 AM on a weekend morning, and 2:00 the night before a test.
Everyone gets in trouble when some drunk idiot destroys the posters the RA is required to put on the walls.
Sometimes in the winter, the temperature inside is so hot you can't even sleep with your blankets thrown off, and sometimes in the summer it's so cold that it's miserable to take a shower.
People will be running up and down the halls screaming at 3:00 in the morning.
I lived in girls' dorms. I heard the guys' dorms are much worse.
Fortunately only freshman are allowed in dorms, so you only have to put up with it for one year. The downsides are: 1) All freshman are required to stay in the dorms. 2) Upperclassmen have to find off campus housing or try their luck at securing an on-campus apartment."
College Freshman,1,Parking is horrible at Ole Miss. UPD gives parking tickets out like crazy.
College Junior,1,Way Too Overcrowded â€“ Parking at Ole Miss is awful.  You can hardly ever find a spot thats closer than a mile to your nearest class.  The parking decal office issued about 2500 more decals than parking spots that are available last semester.
College Freshman,1,They gave away more parking decals then there are parking spots.
College Sophomore,1,"Tickets galore â€“ Yea some people may get a little luckier than me, but along with the fact finding a spot is impossible, there are also certain spots you have to watch for that aren't equipped with warning signs.  I got 2 tickets in one day for parking in areas that I didn't know were off limits.  So in other words you'll probably learn your lesson after you rack up 200 dollars worth of tickets.  Yea thats at least 2 weeks worth of fun money."
College Freshman,1,"Party Central 24/7 â€“ There are parties every night. But the big party scene begins on Thursday and continues until Sunday. The people are rowdy, loud, and extremely annoying, especially when intoxicated."
College Freshman,1,"Shallow. Shallow. Shallow. Girls are generally pretty, guys are generally cute, but douchebags. Most people are very fake, and a lot of people are involved in Greek life....if that tells you anything."
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is such a hassle. There are specific places that are for on campus housing students and off campus student but it is very limited. If you want a good parking spot you'll have to come early in the morning just to get one. In fact, I would suggest taking the bus if you can."
Recent Alumnus,1,"First things first, the permit costs for a commuter are very affordable,HOWEVER it is affordable because it is awful. There is never commuter parking close to anything. It doesn't matter if you get there 30 minutes early because there won't be any parking open until students get out of class. Tickets have gone up since we lost alot of our funding after this mascot nightmare. Especially when you park in 30 minute parking behind the union, and you are parked there for 31 minutes, you can bet you will have a ticket."
College Freshman,1,"Guess Hall â€“ Take my advice, live in any other building except Guess. The washing machines are absolute crap, there is no elevator, some of the showers don't even have doors on them (just curtains) and it's a COMMUNITY BATHROOM, the temperature can't be regulated independently, and the garbage from your room needs to be taken down all the stairs to the dumpster in the parking lot, where raccoons live. Throwing things out after dark is not an option. This all makes me sound lazy, but trust me, it is extremely inconvienient. However, the location of the dorm is great because you can make it anywhere on campus in 15 minutes or less, and there is a bus stop right next to the driveway."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The Connection at Oxford â€“ I am at the Connection right now, and I will be moving next year. Rent is high, and if you renew your lease rent goes up higher. Also the office help are the complete opposite, no help whatsoever. The overall apartment is a little above average, but just no the place for me."

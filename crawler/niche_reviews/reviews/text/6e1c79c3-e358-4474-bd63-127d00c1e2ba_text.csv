Freshman,5,"It took me a while to get off my couch to go and apply for college. I'm so glad that i chose this school in Ontario, ca. The admission counsler i was talking to made me feel super comfortable and confident in going back to school as I am not a school peron. I am on my first month and cant wait to get my degree!"
Sophomore,5,"This school is amazing. They reach out to you when you need help whether you're taking online classes or campus classes. You don't have to worry about waiting for technical support because you can access it 24/7.  The teachers are good at teaching, which is awesome because learning is fun and thorough."
Niche User,5,"I've taken science prereqs for the nursing program here.  It has been great!  Yes, the classes are pricey, but I was able to get them done quickly.  I got 4 science classes done in about 6 months.  Wouldn't have been able to do that at most other schools. Also, the science teachers were amazing.  Great teachers who really helped their students and wanted us to succeed."
Freshman,5,"The staff and Instructors have your best interest in heart. Curriculum is great and prepared you for your trade. There are a lot of available help ,tutoring ,instructors to student to help you understand what you are learning. Instructors are very accessible and open to help students."
Graduate Student,5,I love this school getting things done and on time ! Fast paste and enjoying it ! I would definitely refer this school to other friends and people looking to go back to school
Sophomore,5,"SJVC has many great teacher. I had the pleasure of interacting with the teachers one on one.  Class rooms are small, so if i ever needed help i was able to communicate better with  the instructors. They have pretty challenging instructor  but thats the beauty of it, it helps us grow and learn  to a higher advantage. Life lesson, class lesson and always pushing us to improve  and do better after we graduate from there. Never have i ever thought i say "" i love learning"". These instructors kept education  interesting and and teaching at a faster pace and learning the material very well was shocking for me. Over all i love my experience here, and i hope others can further there education here, as it is an amazing place to go."
Freshman,5,"I'm not a student of SJVC yet, but I'm hoping to have a excellent school year. I would first rather attend and get to know everything about SJVC before I decide what should be change."
Niche User,4,I love the way our professors educated all students and how the staff is the best of the best. Always putting our needs and what we students need to succeed in life. That when we graduate or go on to extern the staff there would make sure we have all the tools and education we need so when we actually go out to the real world we are mentally prepared to face all the obstacles that are put in our way.
Sophomore,4,SJVC is awesome college. The nursing professors are awesome. What I would like to see scholarship available
Graduate Student,4,I like the friendly instructors and course material. The program can be a little bit more organized.
Freshman,4,"So far, i love everybody i have talked to, the teachers are very helpful and very involved with students academic grades, and students personal life. They have great tutors and the library is open for help or a place to study any time."

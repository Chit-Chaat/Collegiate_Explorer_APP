Sophomore,5,"If I could explain Quinnipiac in one word, I simply wouldn't be able to. From the teachers, to the hockey games,  to the endless involvement opportunities. AND the beautiful campuses they have. I have met the most amazing people here at quinnipiac, including my professors. I am really getting the most out of my education here, and I know I am going to be set for my future. All my professors really care about me, and I know I am not just a number here at QU. I also have a diverse group of friends! From student athletes, to friends in greek life or student government! You really will find your best friends here at quinnipiac and people who share the same values as you."
Senior,5,"Quinnipiac is my home away from home. Any student moving on to college faces a huge adjustment. But Quinnipiac provides so many resources to help you feel comfortable. I’ve loved my time at Quinnipiac so much. This school has done so much for me- boosting my confidence, teaching me the necessary tools to succeed and finding lifelong friends. Can’t say enough good things about Quinnipiac!"
Freshman,5,I love Quinnipiac! I have grown so much since my first semester! I truly believe that the Acadmic Coaches and Learning Specialists want you to succeed and they will help you!
Freshman,5,"At first, it was difficult, however, my Professor's guided me on the online platform and I easily adapted. It's so easy to communicate with my Professors and their response back is always quick!"
Sophomore,5,Quinnipiac is a great school the staff and teachers are very kind and nice their. they provide quality education. great environment for students who want to succeed in their lives.
Sophomore,5,they are always ready to help. to be honest them being expensive is worth it because of the amount of hard work they put in to help there students achieve whatever they want
Alum,5,Quinnipiac prepares young adults for entering the real world work force or for advanced degrees.  They have grown so much and continue improving the institution!
Alum,5,"Quinnipiac University provided me with an opportunity to become independent and confident.  Not only did I learn in the classroom, I was able to attain life skills which I would only be able to gain by living on my own.  Growing up in a close knit South Asian family, it's like the family from the movie ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"" where everyone is always present.  Bring away taught me to value my family and to hold them close.  This is why I'm also completing my graduate studies within the same institution.  Life shows us many peaks and pits, and I'm sure I'll be able to pick up a few more lessons from this institution once again."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Quinnipiac and cannot think of anywhere else I'd rather go to school! During the admissions process, I applied to 12 schools and assumed Quinnipiac would be a safety. When I got accepted, I put off visiting but as soon as I stepped foot on campus I knew this was going to be my new home. I love the School of Business, my professors are great, Greek life has become an important aspect of my life  & the social scene is great. The friends I've made here are also lifelong! I have the perfect balance of work and fun & I find everyone here at Quinnipiac has the same mentality. I've been successful in my classes and have made great connections with my professors!! I cannot wait to go back next semester!! I love QU!! I cannot say enough good things about this school!"
Freshman,5,I love the people and the atmosphere everyone is super friendly and welcoming.  I don't have any bad words to say about the school.  It's absolutely gorgeous and the surrounding town is awesome to go out with friends.
Senior,5,"I liked how the classes were set up and how having smaller class sizes. Also, I liked the various clubs that were offered. On the other hand, I hope the university offers more club sports in the following years, specifically field hockey."
Graduate Student,5,Excellent professors and online studies. The faculty & staff are always taking care of the students.
Freshman,5,I absolutely adore Quinnipiac. It is truly somewhere that I feel I can call a second home. I love to share my adoration for Quinnipiac with others so I serve as a Tour Guide and am looking to work as a Peer Catalyst for incoming freshman as well as be an RA.
Freshman,5,Everyone at Quinnipiac University is extremely welcoming. The professors are there to help their students succeed.
Freshman,5,I would like to attend this college in the future. This University has the major and various programs that I am interested in. I have been welcomed in this community.
Freshman,5,Quinnipiac is a wonderful learning environment that has so much to offer. Various clubs and organizations offer students a chance to lead and engage in activities on campus as well as in the community. Professors are kind and hold office hours for students to help outside of class. Great campus and beautiful location. A bit more expensive than it needs to be.
Graduate Student,5,My undergraduate experience was mixed between living on campus and commuting both of which offered my on campus student life and off campus focus on my area of study with minimize distractions. The professors were supportive of my success and the curriculum prepared me for my successful career so far of 23 years. I am returning now as a graduate student as I believe in the staff and curriculum.
Graduate Student,5,"I can’t even stress how much I loved attending this school. The four years I spent were the best in my life and I am always proud to tell people where I went to school. As someone who tried to do a masters somewhere else, I genuinely felt that the help, the people and warmth overall on the campus actually helped me decide that Quinnipiac was the only school I ever wanted to attend. This January I will be going back for my Masters and I couldn’t be any happier. You realize how nice everyone is here when you see other schools. It’s amazing how much a difference it makes when you see Quinnipiac compared to other places and how friendly everyone is."
Junior,5,Quinnipiac is an amazing school. As soon as I set foto on campus I loved it. I felt so welcome and so at home instantly. Professors here do everything they can to be the best they can be and to help you along as you figure out what your path is. I'm currently a junior and the amount of love I have for this school is indescribable.
Niche User,5,"It is a super safe, diverse and welcoming campus. When I visited, everyone was very friendly and the school seemed like a second home."
Junior,5,"The university offers a nice campus and a pleasant learning environment. However, it is pretty certainly too expensive considering the quality of the education and the academic ranking. Like most schools, some of the professors are very good and some are rather poor. There are also a pretty good number of decent professors."
Graduate Student,5,"I have started yet.  Classes start soon.  So far the admissions and financial aid staff have been extremely helpful.  It has been many years since I graduated from college as an undergraduate.  So I had many questions, they were very willing and kind to answer them all.  I am so excited to start my master's degree."
Junior,5,"Quinnipiac is an amazing school that offers so many opportunities. The atmosphere on campus is so welcoming. As a junior I’ve had the best times and memories here. I’ve loved all of my professors, they’ve helped me so much within my classes. The campus is beautiful and SAFE which is such an important aspect. All of the students here are so motivated to do well on top of being involved in countless clubs, activities or D1 sports"
Sophomore,5,"Great experience if u love to party and get a good education. Big bar seen Thursday’s and Saturday’s. House party’s on Friday's, dartys on Saturdays. The campus is outstanding and the dorms are well above average from almost any other university. Teachers take the time to work with you and make sure that you are on track. As long as you keep a balance and get involved this university will exceed app expectations. There are plenty of clubs and intramural sports to get involved in."
Sophomore,5,"Quinnipiac University has, so far, been an excellent collegiate experience for me. I so enjoyed my freshman year and really connected with so many other students and professors that helped me adjust to college life. The classes are all enjoyable and I haven't had a poor professor. All of the students and faculty are also incredibly friendly and helpful."
Junior,5,"Quinnipiac is a vibrant and up and coming University. This school offers many friendly and engaging activities, majors, clubs, and programs. This school is a perfect balance of size with classrooms being usually small and personable, but big enough where you can meet many new people from all dimensions."
Niche User,5,It is a beautiful campus and offers so many opportunities for students in terms of academic choices.  There is a diversity of class we can choose from and everyone that I met on campus was friendly and very helpful.
Sophomore,5,"MY experience at Quinnipiac University has been good,  Growing up in a harsh neighborhood with a blended family that received low privileged shape me to be a well-rounded individual who must adapt to a diverse society.taking in count my parents pay for my education, and had to work their way to middle class Looking ahead from the cultural and ethnic lens it's not expected for someone who is part of the largest multiracial minority group in the USA like me to be part of an A1 division school like Quinnipiac University. its been highly important for me to adapt and start to post culture assimilation I believe more on-campus activities should be held for different cultures"
Senior,5,"I love how the  professors actually care and want to see you  succeed , the advisor are also a big help and the campus is beautiful. I do wish the was the bursars office handle things  differently than they do , for example when you need help with paying tuition they don’t help you they just tell you it needs to be paid in full and that’s it they don’t put  effort in helping you pay the balance or give you payments,  they act like the amount is a amount you could just pull out your wallet and pay . Other than that the school is amazing."
Senior,5,"Quinnipiac is an awesome school. It is not too big and not too small. The campus lies in the town of Hamden on the southern side of Sleeping Giant State Park. The campus is beautiful and the number of opportunities that are available at the students disposal is almost limitless. The faculty does everything they can to help each and every person succeed to hit their full potential and beyond. Overall, the education I have received at Quinnipiac so far has been more than promising, and I am excited to see where the rest of my journey here takes me."
Freshman,5,"The easiness of the common app to apply was amazing! Tours of the school were a great way to learn more about the environment. The school has a great academic reputation as well.
Only problem would be the cost and low diversity."
Freshman,5,"The programs are very well designed and dig deep into each and ever major/minor. The faculty is always here for each student (an amazing 16 to 1 class ratio), and there is a lot to choose from outside of the classrooms."
Niche User,5,Cant wait to transfer in here! Amazing school with great opportunities all around! LETS GO BOBCATS!!!!
Niche User,5,"Quinnipiac’s various medical programs is amazing! That is what they are most well known for, particularly their PA and OT programs"
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Quinnipiac and an occupational therapy major. So far my experience has been amazing. I love my major and find the classes to be fair and interesting. Most of my professors have been great, one or two have not been so great but that is normal. The campus itself is gorgeous and pretty up-to-date. Everyone is so friendly, that includes fellow students and staff. Everyone is willing to work together. I am involved in greek life and I am so happy I am. It is a great way to meet new people and find your 'niche' on campus. Getting involved has only enhanced what was already an amazing experience. The residential life is very good. The buildings and rooms are all decent and pretty average compared to most colleges. The sports teams and school spirit are very good overall too."
Freshman,5,"Beautiful campus, friendly students excited to be there, professors interested in your success. Sports and fitness oriented, very nice tennis courts, amazing ice arena and gym.  The dorms are above average, many different styles to choose from. Great to have a choice on what would be a good fit for you, suite style vs. traditional vs apartment style dorm rooms."
Freshman,5,I am a freshman at Quinnipiac University and it already feels like home. I've made great friends and the academics are of course rigorous but the professors really want to see you succeed. The food is great and the activities are endless. I would absolutely recommend this University to anyone considering attending.
Alum,5,Very good school with quality programs that set you up for success in the real world.  The campus is top notch and they have pretty much every medical degree possible. A great experience attending this university. The only downside is the cost of programs.
Niche User,5,"Quinnipiac is an extremely well-rounded school and provides the ideal college experience for students. The campus is beautiful and situated in a safe, friendly area. The dorms are very homey, something students could appreciate when feeling home-sick or in need of a place to unwind. The medical facilities are extremely impressive, especially those used by students of the the prestigious physician assistant program. Overall, Quinnipiac appeals to all kinds of students, providing high quality education in a sensible, yet such a desirable, environment."
Freshman,5,Quinnipiac was my first choices when choosing a university to attend and I am proud to call this school my home! Academically and socially it's everything that I hoped for and more!
Senior,5,Quinnipiac is a great campus with students who help and encourage each other and advisors ready to provide support.
Alum,5,I liked the opportunities provided following graduation.  I felt I was extremely prepared for clinical work following.  The professors were always available and helpful.  I felt the campus was safe and clean.  I have since had students who have graduated become my students and have always been impressed with their level of readiness for the work place.
Graduate Student,5,QU has prepared me for life after college. My involvement in a few of their clubs allowed me to meet others with similar interests. I really liked the small class size as it allowed me to get individual attention from my professors. I’d definitely recommend visiting & seeing it for yourself...you won’t be disappointed.
Niche User,5,I love this school and really hope to get into its 3+1 program. It is my top school at the moment. I love the location and campus setting. The information tour was very friendly and I had no questions after and made me want to attend here so much more.
Senior,5,"Love going to the hockey games! Entrepreneurship and small business management professors are the best! Beautiful campus, but single dorms for seniors are too small and too expensive!"
Freshman,5,Quinnipiac feels like home the moment you step onto campus! The campus itself is absolutely stunning  and the students are always so warm and welcoming!
Niche User,5,I loved everything about Quinnipiac University. They made my experience at open house amazing and the campus was gorgeous.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love quinnipiac university! I’m going to be a sophomore there and I wouldn’t have wanted to go anywhere else at all! The only thing I would change are the food options! I would love to have more choices!
Sophomore,5,Quinnipiac University feels like home. Every professor I have had thus far is so understanding and caring and really wants to see their students succeed. They are always available outside of class to answer questions and give extra help. So many different clubs and extra curricular activities ensure you will never be bored and always have fun. The one thing I would probably change is the food...but honestly its bearable.
Sophomore,5,"Quinnipiac is an amazing University, and is really on the rise! It’s known as an amazing school for a reason. As a freshman I was super nervous for college, and I was afraid of not fitting in. Immediately I felt safe and welcomed by everyone. I’ve loved all of my professors, they truly care about their students. Quinnipiac is expensive but financial aid does their best to help every student. I believe it’s worth every penny because QU offers amazing opportunities and resources to students, they work to keep the campus safe and beautiful, and the spirit of this school is the most welcoming and fun experience yet!"
Sophomore,5,"I love Quinnipiac University. I wasn't sure if I would like a medium sized school, but I love how even though the campus is smaller everything is spread out. All the professors really care about doing the best you can. The campus is beautiful and there is a great atmosphere."
Sophomore,5,I love the health science program. It is very hands on with an amazing group of faculty. It challenges you and really helps you to decide what major you wish to pursue. I would like to see housing and food change. Applying for housing each year is very stressful and the options are limited. Food isn’t the best it could be and the hours are not consistent.
Sophomore,5,My experience has been great so far. Some issues in administration need to be addressed such as issues with advising. The registration process for an upcoming semester also needs to be made more efficient for all students so that everyone gets a fair chance. Campus life is very enjoyable.
Senior,5,"I cannot say enough about the positive experiences I have had as an Undergraduate student here. My professors that I have had throughout my four years at the University have been extremely well-educated, and almost all of them have received experience in their field of study. Not to mention, they have all been accessible both inside and outside of the classroom for any questions or additional help. Furthermore, there are countless ways to get involved on campus, all of which have the potential to help students grow as people and leaders outside of the classroom. I can also confidently say that the residential halls here are extremely high-quality relative to those of other colleges and universities. While tuition for this school is on the higher end, I truly believe that students who take advantage of the academic and internship resources offered here will find that this school is one of the smartest investments that anyone can make for their future."
Niche User,5,"Love the campus and help I received to get me in and take care of my needs
The students were helpful and the professors are awesome and I will be in a new program and I received so much help getting started."
Senior,5,"I had a great experience at Quinnipiac. I'm graduating in May with my Bachelor's Degree in Health Science and I feel very prepared for my next step in life, graduate school."
Freshman,5,As a career professional and a mom I needed a program that fit my lifestyle from a school with credentials. I found that In Quinnipiac’s online degree program.
Freshman,5,"As a freshman, I have adjusted very well at Quinnipiac University. I come from a family of just my mom and I so I guess you could say I was babied. I have made many friends at Quinnipiac University and the academics are great. There are a lot of resources like the learning commons and advisors if I'm having trouble in school. The campus is beautiful and I always feel safe. The only thing I wish would change is the quality of the campus food and the tuition cost."
Graduate Student,5,Great professors that are willing to go the extra mile to help students. There are so many programs to choose from and I love the option to complete my degree 100% online. Tuition is a bit pricey though.  And I'd love to see some scholarships that would fit me.
Niche User,5,I really like the programs at the school. when i visited the school the campus was super nice as well as all the staff
Senior,4,Quinnipiac has invested a lot of time and resources to teach all faculty members to properly use online resources such as Zoom.  The courses were designed to be as effective as possible while online during a challenging time.
Senior,4,Quinnipiac offers a great education and campus life.  The professors are passionate about the subject they are teaching and always available for extra help outside of the classroom.
Niche User,4,"As a parent of a senior, her education in the Communications dept. has been excellent, and the education is the main thing, of course. I would also commend the staff for being very responsive, bursar, advisors, etc. There are some other areas that fall short - healthcare is the worst - very overburdened, dismissive, and not nearly as responsive as it should be, including, importantly, mental health care.  Quality of food has been an ongoing issue for many, though my daughter didn’t have many complaints. Finally, keep in mind that it is a relatively non-diverse and largely upper-middle class student population. If your student falls outside of that demographic, he/she may feel uncomfortable. Again, however, the education has been the best part. Very pleased. Definitely a college worth considering."
Niche User,4,This has worked well for many - kind of depends on the subject.  As long as the professors maintains time for questions and it isn’t just straight lecture it works well.
Sophomore,4,"I am taking a good amount f my classes online, except two classes. However, it is not an issue. All my professors still hold classes at the same time and are using their technology to their advantage! Not to mention, the online classes are helping us TREMENDOUSLY with containing COVID-19. We have tested about 8,000 students and still have 0 positive cases. I am proud to be proud of bobcat nation here at quinnipiac, and I am still thriving with online school and getting the education i deserve. Being an Occupational Therapy major, i am still given the hands on experiences with labs, just in a much safer and mindful way. These opportunities may not be fully available as they were before, however they are still there and i am grateful for that."
Senior,4,I don’t think any school should get 5 stars for online learning since COVID-19. It has been a huge adjustment for everyone! But professors at Quinnipiac really made a stimulating learning environment as well as considered the students needs during a stressful and unknown time
Junior,4,"I love it here, but the only thing is that the diversity is not as good. The people can be nice, but there are some people who are their on their parents money instead of their academics."
Niche User,4,"Online classes were super easy, professors were easy to contact. Online classes during covid were easy to adapt to although online classes are not for everyone."
Junior,4,"I like the quality of the education at the school. The challenge is great. The school is beautiful, especially York Hill. Great food. I transferred here, so I wasnt really sure what to expect. This school looks great on applications. 
There is a downside to this school. Lack of diversity, and not only that there is no support for the people of color and minorities. With all that goes on, we dont feel supported or heard. We are just as capable as the next. We have black cooks and shuttle drivers, yet there is still a lack of inclusion, as well as respect. There could be more activities to get involved in for everyone to get along with. The could have more dances in the gym, they could do a lot more. Nonetheless, I only have two more years there and hope to see some massive change."
Senior,4,"The atmosphere is amazing- constantly different events going on- most are student run. Also, professors can be genuinely helpful and understanding of deadlines. It is very costly though!"
Sophomore,4,Quinnipiac University is an amazing school. They offer many opportunities that help you during your 4-year experience and after you graduate. You have the ability to meet wonderful people who can impact your life for the better.
Alum,4,"Quinnipiac was a wonderful school to earn my bachelor's degree from.  I felt like the classes were made for me.  When I walked on campus, I thought ""this is what a college campus should feel like"" and my mind never swayed from that.  QU has so many options for students, it really was the best experience."
Freshman,4,"I am going to be a sophomore next year and I thought about transferring, but after talking to the amazing staff I decided against it. I think the real savior is the dedication of the academic professors, advisors, and deans (specifically communications in my case). While I think the place it lacks is in campus life, but they're getting better! Greek life is getting better, the food is improving, and Judy has been implementing relatively decent changes with only being here for a little bit of time. I see a bright future ahead for the school. The gym also needs major renovations, but that comes with time. Amazing return on investment if you are a 3+1 of some sort student."
Graduate Student,4,"Amazing school, high tuition but you get what you pay for. Very safe, great professors & highly regarded institution"
Junior,4,"As a commuter, participating in extracurriculars can be very difficult as all clubs meet at 9:30 pm on a weekday or during the weekend. Academics are pretty decent--professors are passionate, the general atmosphere is supportive, and most students who are there want to learn. While the campus is secluded, it is well-maintained and has lovely scenery"
Freshman,4,"Love all my professors, I recommend looking at rate my professor before choosing a professor because there are a few difficult ones you dont want to get stuck with.   Highly recommend Quinnipiac University. There are plenty clubs and activities to keep you entertained.  I got placed in MTV and I love my dorm. Its not as close as the other dorms but I only have to share a room with 1 direct roommate and 7 indirect roommates. MTV also offers residents a kitchen so if i don't feel like walking to the cafe I can walk down the hall and make a ""dorm cooked meal"". Cafe food isn't the best but if you have a car or Urber eats you'll be set."
Freshman,4,"I like how beautiful the campus is, the food is also really good with many options. There are resources everywhere so it's okay to reach out to someone at any time. There are many interesting class options and great atmosphere."
Graduate Student,4,"I was an undergraduate and graduate student at Quinnipiac university. The campus is beautiful and it has expanded since I first started. The ambiance is amazing and the aesthetic scenery is calming and relaxing. The classes are personalized and smaller which allows teachers to give undivided attention to students. Teachers are always accessible after class hours through emails. They want students to pass and to assist them in any way possible without hesitation. School's food have been okay. Mount Carmel has more food options now compared to when they did 5 years ago. However, being primarily at North Haven, there is not much option or choices and cafe hours vary. Lines can be incredibly long as well."
Sophomore,4,The majority of freshman that come here are here to party. The school improves in your sophomore year when all of those people either drop out or get themselves together.
Niche User,4,"i really liked the quiet campus from the tour i took. it wasn't too loud, but not to quiet either as civilization was just around the corner."
Freshman,4,"I love Quinnipiac. Very expensive but as long as you make the most of it, it’s worth it. The school is absolutely beautiful. Food here is not too bad, a lot of variety but not much quality. There are many opportunities as a student. Athletics here are engaging and exciting with the hockey, lacrosse, and other teams. The location of the school is perfect with Sleeping Giant down the road and New Haven around the corner. So many opportunities to explore as well. Academics are good, most professors are professional and educational. Some, not so much exactly."
Freshman,4,"The university has a great community feel to it.  Academics are great, you create amazing connections with your professors that will help you get internships."
Senior,4,"I love the education I am getting a quinnipiac. I am in a challenging physical therapy program with professors who are very knowledgeable in the fields that they teach and and always holding review sessions and office hours to help. Something also really helpful at Quinnipiac is the learning commons which I did not make use of until sophomore year, but they have students there who are great tutors and they have them for almost every class. I have had amazing opportunities joining greek life and meeting some of my best friends, volunteering in the community and on campus, and even finding a part time job related to my career. The only bad things are the food, not being the best quality but a good amount of options, and the location not being in the best area. But the on campus housing is really nice no matter what you get, and the York hill and North Haven Campuses are Fantastic!"
Freshman,4,"It is a Charming and  welcoming university. Quinnipiac does a wonderful job preparing you for your intended profession.  The campus is beautiful, and the faculty cares about students."
Sophomore,4,"Quinnipiac does a wonderful job preparing you for your intended profession. they offer many career fairs and have a multitude of opportunities for internships . Knowledgable professors, who many times have real world professional experience in their fields . They have a beautiful campus, especially in the fall ."
Niche User,4,"The experience at QU is quite charming and welcoming. The professors are all open and relatable, and they help get you the real-life experience that is important. The campus is beautiful but seems a little outdated at times. Overall a great experience."
Freshman,4,I like Quinnipiac University so far. My professors are very good and everyone for the most part is pretty nice. The one thing that could be improved is the food.
Junior,4,"Quinnipiac has an amazing community and academics. The campus is beautiful, and the faculty cares about students."
Sophomore,4,"I very much enjoy my program, Occupational Therapy. It is challenging but I like how the student begins learning Occupational Therapy from Freshman year instead of Sophomore or Junior year as most programs at other colleges do."
Junior,4,Quinnipiac University has an academically challenging yet supportive educational system which prepares students to enter the career field of their choice. One thing I would like to see changed at Quinnipiac is their support for financial aid. I wish it was easier to access their scholarships.
Senior,4,"Decent college. Good professors abs some terrible. Supportive staff and lots of people to meet. Decent school, expensive though."
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed my time at Quinnipiac. I have met some of my best friends here so it has been a good experience. I love my professors. In my program, we are all very close and we are all there to support each other. I wish the food was better and that there was more to do around campus."
Junior,4,"They always have a variety of events happening on campus. It's never dull, there would be big events such as going to Six Flags, Haunted Houses around Halloween. There are paint or movie nights to destress. From time to time there are bouncy houses. They always reach out to the students to see what they want and need their goal for them to enjoy the experience here."
Junior,4,"My experience at Quinnipiac so far has been very good. The teachers are mostly willing to help their students and always get to know them personally. However, Quinnipiac seems to be the type of school that is money hungry and will do whatever it takes to give you the least for your money. For example, the food is just okay. There are not many options and not enough things for a healthy person to eat but still get enough protein and nutrients. Considering we pay $65k to go to this school, you'd think the dorms would be beautiful and there would be A/C but they are really just old, hot, and feel like prisons."
Freshman,4,"Going to Quinnipiac University as a freshman was overall was a great experience. When you first arrive on campus you are greeted by student helpers to have your things moved in. As I started my career at Quinnipiac University, the teachers first semester were very welcoming. The only complaint I have about my school is student involvement. There really is none. The only things students participate for is the Ice Hockey games which is division 1. That is great to show good sportsmanship but other organization that needs support. But overall I really enjoyed my experience so far."
Sophomore,4,"Quinnipiac University is a fantastic place to grow both academically and socially. The professors care about their students, and make an effort to treat as a student, and not just another body passing through a classroom during the semester. I feel that most of my professors have pushed me past my perceived academic limit to get higher quality work out of me, which I appreciate.
Socially, this is the place to thrive. I have made many friends in both my classes and in the resident halls, and some of these friends may last me my entire life. The party scene is definitely there and not going anywhere if that is what students are interested in, but there is also a great diversity of clubs and intramural sports around campus. The campus is beautiful, as it is nestled right beside Sleeping Giant State Park, and the surrounding town of Hamden and the city of New Haven make for great places to get off campus."
Junior,4,"I personally think Quinnipiac has an incredible academic program. Professors are always there to help no matter what major you are, and want to see you do your best. They want you to be prepared when it comes time to get a job and move on. With this experience, I have also found that getting connected with students is not as easy as they make it seem. People are very cliquey, and stick to their roommates and friends they started with. Housing also doesn't help this situation by picking lottery numbers on when you get to choose, and if you get a bad number you are basically guaranteed not the best housing. With all the money people pay to go here, they should get a better system with simple things like this. I overall do think the experience here is good, and it is worth waiting out."
Freshman,4,"I have met some of my best friends here at Quinnipiac. Overall, the school is very good. However, the food can certainly be improved. I am only a freshman and already sick of the food. The freshman dorms also were very hot at the beginning of the fall semester."
Freshman,4,Quinnipiac University really cares about their students. Our success really defines the success of the school.
Junior,4,"Quinnipiac University is a beautiful, unique campus. Not only does this university give numerous academic opportunities, it also provides extracurricular opportunities as well. Quinnipiac offers amazing programs in order to keep your academic excellence on track. The student life is becoming more diverse as students work together to provide a comfortable atmosphere for all. 
Although there is not much to change, I would recommend there being more housing options as the incoming classes continue to grow."
Alum,4,"A great private school, preppy but you can find your niche. Football lovers beware because there is no team but hockey is HUGE here."
Sophomore,4,Quinnipiac University is a very welcoming university that allows many opportunities for a student to achieve success both academically and professionally.
Graduate Student,4,"Incredible resources, tight-knit community, challenging academics, beautiful scenery and notable organization to propel your growth as an individual, student, and professional!"
Freshman,4,Fair and caring professors who want to see you succeed and make themselves available for extra help if needed.  Professors provide good feedback and instruction on how to make improvements.  Beautiful campus setting in the suburbs.  Plenty of clubs and activities to get involved in - something for everyone.
Senior,4,"Quinnipiac University is a great college that offers competitive classes in a one-on-one teaching mode. The campus is beautiful, it is in a safe town, and there is great school spirit. This school excels in specialized programs such as ""3+1"" or ""3+3"" masters and doctoral programs. The downside is that it is very expensive."
Sophomore,4,"I love Quinnipiac! The campus is a great size, making it easy to walk everywhere and find everything you need. The classes are small enough to allow one on one interaction with teachers."
Niche User,4,"Never actually went there. If I have to be honest, I am just sending this in because I need money. Quinnipiac is going to cover about 85% of my tuition though so I highly recommend applying for straight A students like myself."
Niche User,4,The positive attitudes of attending students during my open house visit. The area where the campus is located is rural with three separate campus'.  Also the sports teams are very competitive providing student spirit. Quinnipiac has a prestigious reputation in the region.
Niche User,4,I love the school and all of the people in it! Everyone is very friendly and cooperative. I chose Quinnipiac because of its academics and it’s sports. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a little something different than what they’re used to.
Sophomore,4,"I love the small class sizes. The small class sizes allows for a more personal learning environment. All the professors are available for meetings and want nothing more than to see their students succeed. If a student is ever struggling the Learning Commons is free to all students and will provide individual and group study sessions. Overall, students receive an individualized curriculum and a personalized learning environment to achieve their goals."
Niche User,4,"Quinnipiac is a great school, that is such an New England School with a New England feel. The professors really care about your learning and want to see you succeed."
Junior,4,"I love Quinnipiac University overall. I will say the academic environment is very good and comfortable. However, one flaw is the way they run the class registration process/housing can be very frustrating at times."
Sophomore,4,I am a transfer at Quinnipiac and really love it. The only problems I have are the food is pretty nasty. It is hard to find something to eat everyday but thats college for you. All my professors have been really nice so far. The rooms are pretty big
Sophomore,4,Quinnipiac is an amazing school with a great atmosphere . They give everyone incredible opportunities for success.
Sophomore,4,"Overall the school is very good. Personally found issues with it, but most love it. It is located in a more rural town, with a larger city nearby"
Sophomore,4,"I am a BMS major and the teachers I interacted were amazing. The class size is small, like an average high school class, but you get the one on one experience with the professor and they all care to see their students to succeed. All of my professors went out of their way to help us learn the material in new ways whether it was through verbal lecture, videos, or hands on. The people here are super nice, but it can get cliquey at certain points. Join clubs! The school offers so many and its a great way to make friends. The food is not the greatest.. Our hockey games are super fun and the Yale vs. Quinnipiac is something you do not want to miss. The school is my opinion is not big on frat parties but there are some to go to. You mainly go into New Haven to go to a club. Definitely go to Toads. New Haven has a lot of restaurants to go to and if you have the car, CT offers many other places to go to. The dorms are nice, unless you're in a quad, it depends on how you make it work."
Sophomore,4,"I liked how there were many different events at Quinnipiac. There isn't much I'd change. The professors want to see us all succeed, and I feel that I am doing well because of the quality of academics at Quinnipiac and the access to extra tutoring by upperclassmen and professors outside of class."
Niche User,4,"Loved the campus and facilities however, there were close to 20-25 people on the campus tour and was difficult to hear."
Junior,4,This campus is gorgeous and has a great view of the Sleeping Giant State Park. Not only is the view great there is so much to do if you go into town. New Haven has a lot of great food places and the green is a great place to check out a concert in the summer time. The professors at this school are intelligent and have connections all around. If you are willing to put the time in with them they are willing to work with you and help you get to places.
Graduate Student,4,"The faculty are very open and friendly and help to support the students in any way they can. There are multiple resources for the students to utilize including transportation between campuses, library videos/books/events, and community outreach programs for students to build their skills and volunteer. Some things that I would like to see change are expanding the dorm areas. Currently, there is not enough room for the students attending Quinnipiac and the school has strong potential for growth, but the lack of dorm rooms makes it difficult to move forward in the process. Also, the tuition and on campus food plans are unnecessarily high making it difficult to afford. With that said, the campus is the perfect size for being accessible for students to walk to classes on time. I would strongly recommend Quinnipiac as a consideration for furthering education."
Niche User,2,Professors are amazing but there is not only a lack of diversity but people are rude about it. If you aren't a rich white kid from new york/jersey you probably won't like it.
Sophomore,2,I didn't like the online experience during COVID-19 because I feel like some professors handled the situation better than others. Some understood the drastic change that was happening in student lives while some didn't. I lost motivation when we transitioned to online classes and certain things just didn't make it any better.
Senior,2,"It was generally known that you were not a true QU student unless you missed at least a handful of classes due to the food poisoning from the school's horrendous caterer (Chartwells if you would like to look them up). The school is a rampant lier, still telling students they live on the main campus for the first two years when they, in fact, are usually squished into off-campus accommodations after freshman year. If you want to use the silverware or access any amenities the school offers, you better make sure you do it while prospective students are touring, since it is the only time when they actually make sure the silverware, trays, and coffee/other machines are not covered in filth. The education itself is lackluster, and I was told my senior year that I should not expect to be ""job-ready"" after completing a bachelor's at Quinnipiac from the head of the department herself, so there goes $200,000+ for nothing."
Freshman,2,"Quinnipiac is not the  best place to go if you actually want to be in a welcoming community and are a positive contributing member of society. The girls are catty and cliquey sorority girls with no respect for themselves and others and will treat you like you're invisible unless you have money. The education here is great, with small class sizes and professors that are very accommodating. The party scene is the same shitty frat parties and clubs in dangerous New Haven - have fun getting shot if you stay in New Haven past 9pm. The environment is not a welcoming or diverse community, and there is essentially nothing to do on or off campus, even when involved with many clubs and extracurriculars. Overall, though the academics are good, everything else is not up to par and is a complete waste of tens of thousands of dollars. I will not be coming back next fall, and will spend my money on a college that is worth my time."
Graduate Student,2,"I did not like the masters program I was in and decided to wait 30 days before dropping. I forfeited my entire $15,000 tuition for that semester upon withdrawal per Quinnipiac's refund policy. I am lucky enough to have a decent job and a strong family, less fortunate individuals may find themselves in crippling debt they are not able to pay. The school did nothing to attempt to help me by putting me into another program or trying to find another solution to help me find some return on my investment. Needless to say this school basically stole my money and did nothing to attempt to help me."
College Sophomore,2,"Well my experience was bad because my roommate was constantly trying to kill herself and the other one was disrespectful. She would come into the room very early in the morning very loudly knowing that I can an early class in the morning. I hope this year, I will have a better experience."
College Freshman,2,"While I have an excellent job on campus, I'm worried about the future"
College Freshman,2,"Between the many fire drills and the building literally shaking when the generator runs, it is very annoying"
College Senior,2,"Get off campus as soon as you can. It's okay when you're a freshman or a sophomore, but many people move into Hamden once they are a junior and definitely by senior year. The dorms are absolutely average. The space itself is fine, but the regulations are ridiculous. You can't have the same guest over two weekends in a row so if you have a boyfriend/girlfriend that's going to visit you every weekend, you'll have to find someone else to sign them in. 

Unfortunately, Hamden is trying to pass a lot of laws to regulate off-campus housing and forbid kids from moving off of the school grounds so you may get stuck there for all 4 years if they succeed."
College Senior,2,"Greek life is not very big here. It has a presence but only because there's literally nothing else for students to do around campus, unless they're involved in student media or athletics. The kids in Greek life like to pretend that it's a big deal, but that's because many of them have never been to a school where Greek life dominates the campus. It's big if you're a part of it, but it has no effect on campus. There is no Greek housing."
College Senior,2,"If I could do it all over, I would not choose Quinnipiac. It is far too expensive and unjustifiably so; you won't get a better education here than anywhere else. The school itself, while seemingly beautiful, is just that: superficial and shallow. Most of the kids here still use mommy and daddy's credit cards and it shows. There is a complete lack of respect for anyone and anything. Kids trash the campus, have a horrible reputation in the area, and are literally being kicked out by the town of Hamden because they're hated so much. Most of the students here are the definition of having ""first world problems"". There is no culture, there is no arts community. It's like a glorified high school. 

If you want to go to college for the ""experience"" and party while doing little to no work, come here. But if you actually want to spend 50,000 a year on a decent education and get something out of college, don't. This school is simply not worth it."
College Student,2,It is available but not very popular. Greek life does not have the best reputation and there is no Greek housing
College Junior,2,"I am not Greek. I would never consider going Greek. There is at least one girl in every sorority on campus who is unnecessarily rude to me and has tried to start drama with me. The fraternities are okay, though. I think the sorority drama is because QU is 70% female, and the Greek girls feel entitled to the 30% of guys, so they get mad when they find out that all of my friends are guys and act towards me with jealousy. Of course being a female engineering student, I honestly can't help that my friend group is all-male. I have only met one girl in a sorority who I've not seen cause drama and it's because she's an engineering student. There is no Greek housing available. Greeks think they run the school, and there's no need in telling them otherwise because honestly there are better things to do than convince mean girls that they're average just like everyone else. If you remember the plastics from that movie Mean Girls, you've got Greek life at QU."
College Junior,2,the college isn't keeping up with the number of students being accepted. non-athlete and athlete gym is pathetic for a D1 school.
College Sophomore,2,Quinnipiac is not my favorite you have to like going clubbing and seeing the same people everyday of your life. Its like a high school everyone knows your business and everyone hooks up with everyone and the diversity actually sucks.
College Freshman,2,They don't have a variety of options and it's TOO expensive. It should be per swipe not per item which is overpriced to begin with
College Senior,2,The food is not high quality and there is no variation
College Junior,2,My prep schools' food was better and had more options (healthier too) than chartwells.
College Junior,2,The York Hill cafe is horrible.  They close before dinner time and there are barely any food options.
College Junior,2,Not much to do on campus and Toads get crowded
College Sophomore,2,"Girls are insecure, validation seeking, and shallow. Guys are cliquey, territorial, and also shallow. Both sexes are mostly pretty closed-minded, and conformist in that most are nearly into all the same things, judge their friends on their ability to attract the right people of the opposite sex and their ""friends'"" potential ability to get them a job. If you are a guy, the other guys (for purposes of friends) and girls (for not being seen as ""different"" than their friends) expect you to be like them in interests AND background. If you're a girl, the other girls expect you to only put out for athletes and popular guys. Also, less than top notch social skills or different value sets are heavily punished. If you're not Irish/Italian and Roman Catholic, even if you still have white skin, you're socially in a rough spot. Drama is also huge at this school: your business is everyone else's, and not the converse. In other words: this is a high school."
College Sophomore,2,The teams mostly suck except for b-ball and hockey: the hockey team is quite renowned. Problem is no one really goes to their games given the whole two campus thing so freshman and sophs don't wanna be bothered by having to take a shuttle. Too many seniors live off campus to be bothered with TD Bank Arena's parking.
College Sophomore,2,Why does a school like this even bother? It gives no financial aid worth talking about to most people. They should be giving it to attract better kids who wouldn't afford it at all instead of why they current give notional financial aid (which is to lure people whose parents just want a discount).
College Sophomore,2,"Not many big parties, tho dorm parties and off-campus gatherings are common. Frats and sports teams throw stuff, but the sports team ones are very exclusive, frats only allow girls."
College Sophomore,2,"Go off campus when you have access to a car. All campus food is gross except the superexpensive ""deli"""
College Sophomore,2,"Freshman year its kinda cool for getting into a group quickly, but conducive to serious cliquiness thereafter: as in groups of friends congregate. Junior and senior year are horrible: shuttle service to campus is slow and off campus housing can be far from campus or expensive. Not to mention ungrateful neighbors."
College Junior,2,"The food is usually low quality, and is usually unhealthy."
College Junior,2,"Let me start off by saying I am not a huge partier. I don't drink, nor do I really enjoy the whole party scene. However, the party life here sucks. I've been to other colleges that have actual parties - Quinnipiac pales in comparison. There aren't any good parties on campus, which forces everyone to go clubbing at scummy places in New Haven like Toads and Empire. People involved in the party scene literally do the same thing every weekend. You'd think they get bored after a couple of weekends. And, Quinnipiac students have a bad rep with other New Haven area schools - Yale, UNH, and Southern - that also utilize New Haven's entertainment district. The people that go to Toad's are categorized as slutty, stupid, and just plain distasteful."
College Senior,2,"Hockey, Hockey, Hockey. That's about it."
College Sophomore,2,Very much a party school
College Junior,2,"Unless youre smart, good luck getting a large scholarship"
College Junior,2,A lot of fast food or too expensive restaurants for college kids
College Junior,2,Not too sure. I don't party so I would not know it
College Senior,2,"New Haven is a rough city and rent is prohibitive for students in Hamden and North Haven. There is s special Hamden law that allows police to question residents of a home where more than 4 out of state cars park on the street. Rent for a 4 bedroom house goes for over $3,000 a month. The town of Hamden but a stop to all student housing permits which require you to sign a ""Good Neighbor"" policy which treats you like a five year old. Hamden hates Quinnipiac and it is ridiculously expensive."
College Senior,2,Freshman were not allowed to take the shuttle and they are fined $100 for possession of alcohol.
College Senior,2,The gyms are overcrowded and outdated. There are no locker rooms for students only varsity athletes. We just got sued for Title IX infringement because we openly discriminated against women's athletics.
College Senior,2,The food in Hamden is inexpensive but not particularly diverse or health conscious.
College Junior,2,"Easily the worst part about the food at school is definitely the price. The school gives you a set amount of money for the whole semester and makes you pay for each item of food separately. Recently they have started to give more options to widdle down the costs, such as meal deals and contests, but these only bring down costs very little and are rarely advertised. Very, very many people run out of their meal plan money early (I have no clue why they tell campus tour guides to say otherwise) and this is usually because they try to eat three meals a day instead of rationing out one or two throughout the day. Healthy food is usually a little bit more expensive everywhere, and this school is no exception."
College Junior,2,"Most parties on campus are small or get broken up pretty fast. Off campus parties have more people but are hard to get to if there is no designated driver or cab nearby. The cabs can be very expensive too. The shuttle to New Haven is also an issue because there is usually a huge line to get to the shuttles, and on some weekends people get so aggravated that they decide to take cabs all the way there instead. The cab ride to New Haven is at least $35 each way, though the shuttles also pick people up from the entertainment district they drop people off at. Also, with so many people going to New Haven or home during the weekends, the campus can look almost barren during these times. May Weekend is usually the only time where people all stay and hang out on campus together."
College Junior,2,"Though the scenery is spectacular to look at, most of the local area can be pretty unexciting and hard to navigate. Because it is a mountainous area, many of the roads are very winding and tough to drive through, and without a car, you won't be able to go really anywhere. There is a free shuttle through the school to New Haven that people use, and a couple good places to eat like Ray and Mike's, the Corner Deli, and Acropolis diner. In New Haven however, there isn't too much to do other than go to the small clubs there, the biggest one being Toad's Place, which can get extremely trashy very easily."
College Junior,2,Quinnipiac University is a very expensive school to begin with. Having two other siblings in college does not make it easy to afford this university. The worst part is the tuition keeps going up each year and they give out less and less financial aid. They should offer more if they want to keep raising the prices.
College Sophomore,2,"Campus is incredibly homogenous. There is also a small, but noticeable existence of racism and homophobia."
College Sophomore,2,"The only sport that gets any attention at all is hockey, which have enjoyed a level of success, especially in recent years. However, no one cares about any other sports. Even basketball, who enjoyed success this year, struggles to get student attendance out of single digits. This does mean seating is very easy to come by. Locals go to hockey games, but not as much to basketball games. 

The TD Bank Sports Center is one of the best facilities in the country. It feels like, and functions like, a professional arena. However, the facilities for all other sports are really lacking. 

In terms of non athletes, there is the Mt. Carmel Gym and the York Hill Gym. The York Hill Gym is very nice aesthetically, but is more suited to cardio than lifting. Mt. Carmel Gym is better for cardio, but the gym isn't very aesthetically pleasing, and is in desperate need of an update."
College Sophomore,2,"The sleeping giant is a nice backdrop. However, the Mt. Carmel Athletic Center is in desperate need of updating. The student center really doesn't lend itself to ""hanging out,"" so most hanging out happens in the dorms. There really aren't that many on campus events that are worth noting, nor are there any great traditions. Its an up and coming school, so there isn't a lot of tradition established."
College Sophomore,2,"Girls for the most part are very self-centered and cliquey. They are also very catty as well. They are also very into partying, which can get very irritating as well.

Guys are very into their bodies. They are often at the gym when not in class. However, like the girls, there isn't a whole lot of substance to them either."
College Sophomore,2,"The local atmosphere really isn't that great. The campus itself is very secluded, with a 10 minute walk off campus necessary to reach anything of substance. Even after that 10 minute walk, there is only a pizzeria, subway and frozen yogurt store there. Outside of that, you will need to ride the shuttle, which is a terrible option, or you will need to take a car, which freshman do not have. 

New Haven, a town south of Hamden, isn't the best city in the world, but it does give a student some more options."
College Sophomore,2,"The people in the cafeteria really try. I feel for them, especially since people always complain. However, the food quality isn't anything to write home about. Plus, for those who have allergies, they generally aren't sensitive about cross-contamination. They do have a freezer full of gluten-free options, but they often don't stock it as well as they should. Plus, during passover they put matzo in the gluten free case, which almost led me to eat something that would have made me sick. In terms of variety, there are different options, but nothing special. They are always improving, however, which is a good sign."
College Sophomore,2,"Its the kind of school where girls are trying to find their future husbands. Girls are OBSESSED with finding steady boyfriends, ""making it work,"" instead of just sitting back and enjoying their youth. The girls tend to dress rather preppy, but guys wear Ed Hardy, Affliction, or skater clothes with a few prep articles mixed in here and there. People are very gossipy and catty: everything you do is everyone's business and you will be judged. People you never met or maybe even saw, will call you a weirdo, strange, you name it. Its a glorified high school. Everyone's interested in the same things. If that doesn't appeal to you, don't waste your parents' money. Or worse, your own."
College Sophomore,2,"The shuttle drivers really are good people. They try to stem conversation on shuttle rides with less people and everything. But the overall lateness, unreliability, and frankly unnecessary break periods that the shuttles have are too much to cope with. Some students rely on the shuttle system to get to and from class in a timely manner, and this is just close to impossible with the shuttle system as it currently stands. Going out to places like Walmart, which for some dorms with severed meal plans is extremely important, will take at least an hour out of your day, even if you were only planning on shopping for 15 minutes. More shuttles being available would most likely be the best solution to solve these issues, but no noticeable action has been taken thus far. Luckily at least, the shuttles are completely free for any QU student to use, and safe because you need to show your I.D. in order to get on. There also needs to be a shuttle to the North Haven campus, as students who do not have cars literally have no way of getting there at all."
College Sophomore,2,Most upper-class white kids. Some minorities
College Sophomore,2,Shuttles are extremely unreliable. Freshmen cannot have cars.
College Senior,2,No houses and high dues
College Sophomore,2,"This college is high school all over again. You are in a tough spot if you miss out on freshman year because most people are cliquey and the members of that clique are usually freshman roommates. People are rather apathetic to anything that isn't the popular thing at the moment, music, tv, celeb gossip. Any other interests like music, reading, you're a weirdo. Its a small school and rather gossipy. People are also obsessed by what their friends will think for being friends or dating other people. If you're not Irish/Italian and Catholic, you're odd man out. This school's job placement for anything aside from OT/PT/AT/nursing is terrible. Business students will wind up in ops or sales, and CAS/Communications, nowhere. Business students often look at temp jobs on graduation. Most of the student clubs do not take themselves seriously. Socially, while the guy to girl ratio may look favorable, many of the girls will mainly chase athletes. They also mainly care about what their friends will say or think, which will affect your ability to get with them. The school is gay friendly, but sadly, it winds up hurting the social scene more because many girls choose to mainly hang out with them. But pretty campus tho!"
College Sophomore,2,"The lot has no markers to avoid getting lost, and its WAYYYYY too small."
College Sophomore,2,"If you're a health science major (nursing/OT/PT/AT) I hear its somewhat rigorous, but everything else is a joke. If you're pre-med, you're likely to wind up in PA school, or if you make med school, an offshore one, after which you'll have trouble getting a good residency. If you're business, you're either gonna be in auditing, or if you major in finance, you will never make it to real spots, only sales and ops. CAS, forget about it, and their career dept. I hear is non-existent. And thats sad because they actually have curious students there. Most people don't take class seriously, mad people bring their laptops to play games and Facebook on. Some of it also probably owes to the anti-intellectual atmosphere prevalent among students."
College Sophomore,2,"Hockey and basketball are good, and the rest is a joke. Yet somehow the athletes tend to be the kings of campus socially, even tho I don't wanna imagine some of their SAT scores after what we saw with UNC. Intramurals are very popular, and along with the right roommates/dormmates freshman year, how you'll make friends. Also guys who are not in them are looked at funny."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is a sad joke on this campus. No houses, and the director of Greek life really hampers everything, getting her nose into parties, etc. Two of the frats throw good parties, but otherwise sororities never have anything and the houses are far off campus. New Road would be a good frat row but for the school's poor decisions and relationship with the town. Only one or two real frats, the others are magnets for, ehmm, an alternative set. The girls are really stuck up, often over nothing, especially given how airheaded many of them are. Yet the girls in Greek life see guys in Greek life mainly as friends, which defeats the purpose of Greek life in part."
College Sophomore,2,"hard to get a computer in the lib, dated technology, they crash, and I hear the computers they have people buy are equally terrible."
College Sophomore,2,"This is basically a greatest hits of high school, or rather unreleased B-sides. If you don't major in OT/PT/AT or business, you're looked down upon as a human being or not taken seriously. God forbid anyone should be interested in anything other than the music/TV which is currently popular, as opposed to having one's own taste. Having political views in itself is seen as ""weird."" Religionwise, this school is almost like a Catholic school in everything aside from name."
College Freshman,2,"Many students go to Toads, the local club, on the weekends. I personally have never been to Toads but I have heard unpleasant things about it. Quinnipiac is a dry campus but many students go to and attend parties regularly on the weekends. There are shuttles that run from Quinnipiac to Toads from Thursday nights to Sunday nights."
Alum,1,"I graduated a few months early before Covid hit.  My peers in Health Sciences said their professors piled on the classwork & all of their labs were online. They were nervous about becoming healthcare providers without hands-on experience.  Dissecting something on a screen is not the same as in person.  My peers from the School of Business received little to no classwork. They sipped wine during class time.  Again, this is not an academic school across the board.  Do not come here if you are interested in challenging yourself."
Alum,1,"If you're looking to learn and further your career, do NOT come here. QU ranks well but what they don't tell you is that the school avoids difficult topics like basic pre-calc. Tests are online with open notes, & so students look up answers on Quizlet.  Many students don't develop critical thinking & problem-solving skills. Professors genuinely care and want their students to succeed but they cater to below-average students who don't want to learn. My professors begged me not to go to QU for law school (I didn't). Most students are lazy, interested in superficial things, and come from upper-class backgrounds.  Many students can be racist, homophobic, ableist, cliquey, & manipulative.  $66k/yr absolutely absurd (even with the highest scholarship of $25k/yr). The food is awful. The sushi and Starbucks are safe but other places like the Rat and the main cafe give students food poisoning.  Chicken is sometimes raw, dead bugs are in the salad, and most of the hot food is dripping in oil."
Senior,1,"Don't waste your money. I agree they have a beautiful campus, I will never take that from them. But where's the substance? They DO NOT care for their students. Racist behavior is swept under rugs with minimal punishment, due to these kids being assets either by sports or their father's pockets. If you are a bright, determined student that wants to go to a school that practices positivity and really cares about the future's of their students, go somewhere cheaper. My English teacher from High school came to QU 10+ years ago (maybe 10 at the time I was in her class) and told me repeatedly to NOT come here. She told me if you don't have money you are of no importance. Trusting in the school, I took the bait. I wish I would've listened. Build your future somewhere where YOU matter. Popularity means nothing. The good always win, always."
Sophomore,1,I just transferred out of Quinnipiac and I could not be happier. The school fits its stereotype more and more every year. Mostly made up of people who come from money and don't even need financial aid. Half the kids don't have brain cells. People get made fun of for wearing fake designer things. School is in the middle of nowhere. New Haven is one of the closest towns but is so unsafe. Greek life here is very judgey and there's a lot of dirty rushing. The food isn't always cooked and has made many people sick. Advisors are very inefficient. The education is not worth the money being paid unless you're OT/PT/nursing. A lot of people I know who don't like it are just staying because they're too scared to transfer. I would never recommend this school to anyone. Always felt uncomfortable and out of place.
Freshman,1,I went to this school and ended up leaving second semester. The girls are stuck up and love to show off  their expensive things. The professors seemed to be picked out of a hat. There is no help for students who have IEP’s. The learning commons is  no help. They will never offer you the right help. While picking classes online you have to wake up early morning and if you do not get into a class it is a entire process to get you in one. At one point they were unable to add me into a class and I was paying for 15 credits not 10. Nothing to do on campus or off campus. Hamden in general is just a gross town. The party scene is horrible. Public safety is more worried about students having drugs then the safety of the actual campus. Anyone can walk. Many made fun of the school due to “where does our money even go”
Alum,1,"There is no substance to a Quinnipiac education. They are experts in marketing so they do a wonderful job of bringing students in but are severely lacking in every area. Not enough parking (especially horrible parking coordinator), sickening food (known as ""Shartwells"" around campus, Hamden is dangerous for women, unhelpful career services, school spirit is limited to hockey games, and rude faculty. The worst part is that they know all of this and make no efforts to improve life for students but continue to invest in QU branding. Stay. Away."
Freshman,1,"Quinnipiac  was my first choice school, for over 4 years. I loved how the campus looked and felt when i toured twice. Only 24 hours into starting there, i ended up really disappointed in how things were going. The food was awful, and made me sick. Whenever I had a question regarding any services on campus, it was very difficult to get a straight answer. My roommate got in trouble for having drugs, which i reported but was then questioned and accused of being involved in. Upon transferring out, I still received notifications about my dorm over 2 months after leaving, accusing me of not cleaning vomit found 2 months later. I have also had issues getting transfer paperwork filled out and an inaccurate disciplinary report, removed."
Freshman,1,I was put in the smallest room in my building with no financial reimbursement. I tried out for several activities that I was interested in which was a strong reason that I chose the school and was denied from every one. The food made me extremely sick and I developed severe anemia due to the lack of nutrition that I was getting from the food. I went to the counseling services and received no advice or relief. It took me a week to get an appointment which was over with within a half hour. Besides the 60k tuition everything is extremely expensive. The freshman are not allowed to use the buses for the first three weeks because they are worried that if kids go home they will realize how unhappy they are there. Ultimately there was absolutely nothing to do unless you like to party. My friend got sick in my dorm and when I called public safety for help we were accused of being on drugs. He has cancer and was having a stroke. Needless to say - I transferred.
Niche User,1,"Quinnipiac University is one of the worst institutions in the United States. Most professors work part-time and offer no additional help outside of the classroom. All of the administration always seems to have something better to do than help their students. The administration is there to get as much money as they can while providing their students with very little assistance when they need it. They put their image first before their students. This school is way too expensive for what it is offering. Yes, the campus is beautiful but its deceiving to the eye because it really offers no additional amenities for the students except for the appearance. The food at this university is another complaint in itself, it is never fresh and has no flavor. They have sushi but they let it sit in a non refrigerated counter-top all day instead of making it fresh."
College Student,1,"School started over admitting with the class of 2019 and are only accepting even more kids. The housing is terrible because there are not enough dorms to accommodate the next freshmen class and sophomore class. The school is not doing anything to fix the problem, they just keep overenrolling. Doubles have been made into forced triples and rooms of 8 have been made from study lounges (terrible set up and unfair to other students)"
College Sophomore,1,"Tuition is very high and just gets higher every year. At 20 years old, I am already in 40K debt. Although this school is known to be one of the best, the professors don't care if you get good grades or pass classes. My advisor is the worst. He never knows how to help me when I'm struggling in classes, gives me the wrong information and tells me the wrong classes. Registration is horrible and classes are always full"
College Junior,1,"They cross contaminate on EVERY campus. They do not start serving lunch until ridiculous hours on the weekends and for people, like I, who are early risers, we do not want breakfast at 1pm."
College Junior,1,I can't receive any financial aid because of my parents income.
College Junior,1,"I'm appalled by the administration here at Quinnipiac. They instate the stupidest rules, like forbidding students from having a guest (whether the same guest or a different person) two weekends in a row to prevent problems between the roommates. That's what RA's are for, QU, and also, shouldn't students start to handle their own problems instead of being babied by the school? We're adults, right? So treat us like ones. 

They also treat cars like criminals here. Park in the wrong lot for more than 10 minutes? 40 dollar ticket. Don't pay it in 15 days? 80 dollar ticket. You'd think the tuition would be high enough for the school to not try and get more money in these petty ways."
College Junior,1,"Parking is TERRIBLE. Freshmen can't have cars (but that's true for most colleges, so no big deal). But when sophomore year rolls around, you either get Hilltop, which grants you the luxury of parking on campus within two minutes of your dorm, or Westwoods, where you park a mile off campus and have to depend on a unreliable shuttle to drive you back and forth from campus. As someone who uses their car pretty regularly, it was incredibly inconvenient to park in Westwoods. The shuttle can take anywhere from 5-45 minutes to pick you up. The driver takes at least 15 breaks a day, each one consisting of 15-30 minutes. You always have the option of taking the 10/15ish minute walk back to campus, but when it's freezing, and raining or worse, snowing, the walk can not only be annoying, but dangerous. I know a few people who have been hit by cars on Mt. Carmel Ave, and when the snow covers the sides of the road, the walk back can literally put your life in danger. And the best part? Hogan Lot is on campus, can sustain all the sophomores who park in Westwoods, but is reserved for York Hill residents to park their cars in during the day (who also get 3 shuttles running daily and a parking garage - screw you, snow!). Quinnipiac needs to get its' act together, Westwoods is actually a safety hazard."
College Junior,1,"Campus dining is TERRIBLE. You get a set amount for your meal plan at the start of each semester - a little over $1000 if you don't have a kitchen in your dorm, and around $800 if you do. Despite what they may tell you in tours, nearly EVERYONE runs out of meal plan money by the last two months of the semester. You'll often see people selling meal plan money on Facebook, and plenty of people throwing down even more money just to get more meal plan credit. Plus, the food is not that great. There's no variety - it's the same stuff every week. The quality of the food is poor, and way too expensive. The workers are all really nice, and Chartwells is not really to blame. It's the school. They control the prices, not the food company. As if tuition and housing didn't cost enough."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek Life is the worst of both worlds. Don't let any of these reviews fool you, Greek Life doesn't offer the community any great events, like greek life at other universities, but they still create a divide between greeks and non-greeks. Sure, there is no animosity between Greeks and non-greeks like there can be at some other universities, but friend groups often stay with greeks and non-greeks"
College Sophomore,1,"Buildings are nothing special. I lived in Mountainview Freshman year, which was a highly-sought-after dorm, and even that wasn't much. In terms of social atmosphere, on the weekend, on any floor there was drama occurring. It was inescapable."
College Sophomore,1,"they give every kid who doesn't need a campus job a job, and thus screw over the kids who need more aid for their tuition, who come from disadvantaged homes, etc."
College Sophomore,1,"Nice ratio if you're a straight guy, but don't let that fool you. These girls all look for the same things in guys, ie who they're friends with, and if you major in whatever is popular (so that if they were to marry you, you'd be worth it). Very stuck up, and not open to meeting no people. If you talk to them, you're assumed to be hitting on them."
College Sophomore,1,"Outsourced to Chartwells, which charges insane amounts of cash for the same stuff, both unfresh and unhealthy. Lines are forever too."
College Sophomore,1,"Students man the check-in table at the psychological services. ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? Oh yes not gonna spread gossip. Students who dare be depressed or sad are put on medical leave, and their semesters, maybe even their lives, ruined because the school refuses to have real therapists. And they have students as employees driving kids to their therapists. Joke. Utter joke."
College Freshman,1,"Facilities are terrible, athletes want to leave because of it"
College Sophomore,1,small dirty overpriced houses. no frat houses. 
College Sophomore,1,"chicken as hard a a brick, only fatty foods. "
College Sophomore,1,may as well be in high school. no freedom. 
College Sophomore,1,no frat houses on campus. new haven has clubs.
College Sophomore,1,"strict as hell. no weed, no drugs of any kind."
College Junior,1,Everyone goes to Toads (a club) on Saturdays. Just don't go unless you want to dance with 40+ year old men and random college students.
College Junior,1,"A lot of people do drugs; a lot of people smoke pot and I've heard of people doing cocaine. Alcohol use is rampant and almost everyone drinks excessively. You really feel pressure to drink and even though security tries to break up big parties in the dorms, they really have very lenient punishments and sometimes don't do much."
College Junior,1,There is no diversity in terms of race or economic status. Almost everyone is white and rich. Majority are Christian and Jewish.
College Freshman,1,the diversity consists of white snobby conservatives
College Sophomore,1,This school has been my worst nightmare so far. There is nothing to do on or off campus. A lot of kids come with a group of friends who are not very accepting. People judge each other so easily and it is definitely not worth the price tag. Its a rip off. The work load is not worth it and the people are so snobby. Good luck going here and to the ever-so-judging Q. May the forces be with you
College Freshman,1,"Mostly white, Everybody seems to know all the black kids on campus. Kids are accepting of other races, but often use racial slurs"
College Student,1,Heads up! Campus security are some of the worst kind of people I've ever encountered. They don't care about human rights and have no problem checking any room from top to bottom if they get even a whiff of something illegal. Good luck having friends come to visit they'll stop them at the door and check their cars before they step foot on campus.
College Freshman,1,There is not nearly enough parking for all of the students and you have to get to class extremely early and stay all day in order to get and keep your spot.
College Sophomore,1,The shuttles are so inconvenient. No real schedule.
College Junior,1,"Given the fact that the gender ratio is 70% girls and 30% guys, it is frustrating for females to find a nice guy."
College Freshman,1,"There are very limited bars and clubs that Quinnipiac students attend. It is pretty much the same ones for different nights of the week. No one goes out Sunday-Wednesday and on Thursday's some students go out. The only place students go to on Saturday's is Toad's. There are no frat parties because there are no frat houses. If you are an upperclassman then it is easier for you to attend house parties, but you need a driver because you cannot walk there. If you are an underclassman, house parties are extremely difficult to attend to because freshman do not have cars. Only sophomores do, and upperclassman usually do not hang out with underclassman. There is no where to walk to straight from campus. You would have to take the shuttle into the city of New Haven and that is where you can walk places. Most students from Quinnipiac do not like to walk around New Haven toward the nighttime because they are scared. Most people leave campus on the weekends to either go home, or party at bigger surrounding schools."
College Freshman,1,"The campus is predominantly white students. There are students of color or ethnicity, but not many. The school tries too hard to achieve a more diverse campus, like giving more scholarships for ethnic students."
College Senior,1,"Guys/ Girls – Mixed bag not the best, no southern bellas here"
College Senior,1,"Some are much better than other, a docteral is not requried to teach but the better teachers will have one."
College Senior,1,I received a little but for what your paying in tution is a lot.
College Senior,1,"I will be transfering out, I think it is overated and the cost is very over priced."
College Senior,1,"In need of a little powerwash, old chalkboards in some rooms still but is getting better."
College Senior,1,During a snow storm the bus broke down and I was late for class
College Senior,1,It is a mixes bag you will get all sorta of people
College Senior,1,Off Campus Dinning – Not many dinning options because the campus setting is rural.
College Junior,1,The majority of the guys at this school (the 25% of the student population) are mostly white/ Caucasian and rarely ever do you see them seek interest of a girl of color. Those minority males that do exists are usually on sports team and are busy doing everyone. Minority girls on this campus are screwed in terms of finding one on this campus.
College Freshman,1,The Parties Are Uniquely Boring and Stupid – crowding in dorm rooms drinking beer and talking about nothing
College Freshman,1,"most of the girls are shallow, dress the same, and really cliquish and mean. guys are guidos and a lot of them are idiots."
College Freshman,1,"repetitive, greasy, disgusting, overpriced, and there's nowhere to eat after midnight"
College Freshman,1,"kind of a s****y town. There's basic shopping available, but all the nightlife is in New Haven and even that kind of sucks."
College Student,1,"If you don't live on campus and think you can just simply park your car and head to class, you're WRONG! It can take up to 20 minutes to find a parking spot in the main lot at times. Unless, you want to go to Hogan lot, which is in east bumble... Cars are constantly whipping around corners, in hopes of snagging a good spot and actually arriving to class on time. QU really needs to fix their parking situation somehow!"
College Freshman,1,The food experience is bad the variety is few and far between and it just does not match the expensive costs
College Junior,1,"There is no Greek housing at Quinnipiac University, but there are sororities and frats. Greek life doesn't really affect the social atmosphere of the campus. Most non-Greeks view Greek students as students that want more friends/parties in there college experience."
College Senior,1,"Stay Away!! I never once took the time out of my day to write a review about an establishment prior to today. Currently I'm a junior at Quinnipiac University but will thankfully be graduating earlier than expected this upcoming May. If it wasn't for me graduating early from this University, I would not be here today. I would highly recommend to any high school student / transfer student to look into other schools than Quinnipiac University. This school is highly overpriced. The teaching staff is very unhelpful and doesn't want to see students succeed in their classes but rather be overly challenged by the assignments and tests given. The staff in general is rude to students when it comes to something as simple as ordering food in the cafeteria or dealing with a problem through security. Quinnipiac University comes off as a wonderful school to all when you look at the outside but you don't get to see what its truly like until you experience it. You're suppose to enjoy college as it is the 4 years of your life that you are able to expand your knowledge and become your own self. If there is one piece of advice I could give to anyone it would be to stay away from Quinnipiac University and go someplace where you feel like you will belong."
College Sophomore,1,Parking is very limited. It's better to take your bike or walk to class.
College Junior,1,"Very Strict – Due to past year's events campus officials are very strict regarding policies, to prevent such accidents as death from happening, but certain students should be trusted to handle certain responsibilities."
College Junior,1,Travel Between Main Campus and North Haven – there is not private transportation between the two campuses and very little parking for commuters coming from north haven to the main campus.

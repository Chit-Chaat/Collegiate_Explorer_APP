Junior,5,I like the options of classes offered at Shenandoah and the diversity of the teachers teaching them.
Junior,5,"One of my classes was fully online, the others are sometimes online and sometimes in-person. The teachers are also trying to transition to the online version, so it's good to know you aren't alone in trying to learn how online classes work."
Freshman,5,"Really nice school full of nice people. Campus and city of Winchester as a whole are super nice. Food is underrated, especially the grill. Obviously there isn't much partying because of coronavirus, so I cant speak on that. Felt like home almost right away which is really nice. School also handled and is still handling covid very well."
Sophomore,5,The Professors are really nice and work with you with whatever youâ€™re struggling with. The actual teaching is phenomenal.
Junior,5,"I haven't yet talking any classes there, but I did take classes before  online so I know it will be okay"
Junior,5,I haven't yet entered it but I am excited to transfer there. It's a great school to go to and to communicate with
Junior,5,"I attend Shenandoah's Accelerated Second Degree Nursing program at the Leesburg campus, and it truly has been an amazing experience. 

Before I ever even put in an application, the counselors were incredibly kind and so helpful. They answered every question I had, always had great communication, arranged my own tour of the facilities, and overall made me feel extremely supported. 

That is what made me choose this program over the others I was considering. And that same support for me as an interest carried right over to me as a student. 

You really can tell how much the professors care about the students and truly want us to succeed. Whether it's providing lecture recordings, offering ample office hours, replying to emails quickly, or simply listening to our concerns, the faculty here truly goes the extra mile for their students, and that is something I do not take for granted. 

Shenandoah has a wonderful program and I recommend it to anyone considering this school."
Junior,5,"My program itself wasn't originally an online or hybrid program, but with COVID-19, like many schools, we transitioned to online learning. That transition was a very seamless process and didn't impact my learning experience in a negative way at all."
Niche User,5,I am enrolled in the accelerated nursing program. Every faculty member I have come in contact with have been very pleasant and helpful. The professors are  great about getting back to the students very quickly and are there for the students whenever we need their help.
Freshman,5,"I knew Shenandoah was the right school for me as I committed just a year ago. I was excited to be in the Conservatory, studying under Akemi, and able to live on such a beautiful campus. I never saw the events of freshman year coming as a new student. All schools say how great they are, but I was cautious as to what I actually believed. However, what Shenandoah said day one about being a family and coming together... I now have overwhelming proof of. When I faced a certain family situation three months ago, the care team, work study office, pastor, my professors, and a few others came to my rescue. They gave me grace with assignments, words of love, access to resources, and constant support. Two juniors in the violin studio even let me stay in the house they rent for very little cost, and I now have a place to live August. Some have even helped me to afford food and medicine. Shenandoah didn't just give me a great education, opportunities, and growth- it has also given me a family."
Junior,5,"I love it here! The campus is beautiful, and there are many peaceful places for studying. All of my professors are amazing teachers and always there to help me. Tutoring sessions have all been helpful. There are also a lot of free events for students and it has been an easy transition for me to make friends here. I enjoy smaller classes here because I can interact with my professors and get a lot out of the lectures."
Senior,5,"Shenandoah is a great environment if you are looking for a small school. Large variety of majors, minors, and graduate programs. Lots to do in the surrounding area such as the walking mall downtown. The school is continuing to expand and improve. Needs more parking if they are going to keep expanding."
Graduate Student,5,I was in the Fast Track program for Physical Therapy at Shenandoah. My 3 years of undergrad were great. The campus is small which is what I was looking for and it felt like a family.
Junior,5,"Shenandoah University provides excellent education, especially in the arts. I enjoy the vibrant community and close-knit relationships I have experienced with all of my professors. I enjoy the small class sizes because I am able to understand the materials more. Shenandoah has prepared me well for my future career."
Senior,5,Great small private school with unique learning opportunities.  I love it here!!  I am in the  Media communications major and a film minor.  I was lucky enough to work on the film Santa Girl.
Freshman,5,I love my school so much. It has so many great opportunities and great experiences to offer. There are a lot of great resources around campus along with friendly faces everywhere you look. I thrive in this environment and cannot wait for the future here at my school.
Freshman,5,I love having the tight knit group of people that shenandoah offers. Everyone is so friendly and I can't to continue my academic career there.
Senior,5,It was such a great experience.  Everyone was very friendly and wanted everyone to succeed in every way.
Sophomore,5,"fantastic school with great professors. academics and academics are top notch. the campus is beautiful and the surrounding community is just as great. Winchester is only a short drive to get to many good places to eat, adventure, and have fun."
Niche User,5,I am really impressed with Shenandoah's administration and counselors. They really helped inform me to choose the best school for me and I am so excited to start college now majoring in Nursing!
Junior,5,"This school is an all inclusive school. The professors are very nice, and want to see you succeed. If you need help with anything people are there."
Graduate Student,5,"Shenandoah is a close knit community and has a really great atmosphere. The academics are up to standard and the faculty are amazing. They all have an open door policy and are more than willing to help you. It is very much a welcoming feel. The only con is the price, being that it is a private university it is quite expensive but with the extra attention you get it is worth it."
Alum,5,This college went above and beyond to accommodate students with medical issues that occur during their time at the university.
Sophomore,5,"SU is close-knit campus that offers a broad expansion of opportunities. It is a community where everyone feels at home and safe. Every door offers a friend and a kind smile. The classroom vibe is is light and welcoming, and you are always given the opportunity to receive help or one-on-one interactions with your professors. SU makes it easy for students to achieve their goals in their education and travel interests. The campus life is diverse and interesting with its many social events."
Sophomore,5,"I love SU. The material is challenging while still learnable, the campus is beautiful and close to stores and restaurants, they make it really easy to get involved with clubs or other students."
Niche User,5,"I haven't started my schooling at Shenandoah University yet (I will be starting in the fall of 2019) but I have taken a tour there and my experience from the tour was one of the reasons on why I choose the school. The community that Shenandoah represents is truly amazing, everyone was nice that I came in contact with and very welcoming. Another reason why I fell in love with the college was the teachers there. They aren't just teaching for money like some universities, they generally care about you and the education you are getting in their class.  All in all, the campus is beautiful, the teachers are hard workers, and the community is one of the best you will ever come in contact with."
Niche User,5,I really liked the encouraging family environment and the intensity of the conservatory program I was enrolled in.  I think the dance program could use more physical and mental health resources as well as more career planning prep.
Freshman,5,"I cannot imagine attending another University. Shenandoah has made me feel at home since the first day. The campus is a wonderful size, if you prefer a smaller size. The professors are beyond amazing, the truly care about your success. In regards to sports, students are very school spirited, we are highly supportive of all teams. Saturday football games are always a blast with friends. The safety of the school is very good too, considering we're an open campus, DPS really does their best to monitor everything. I highly recommend attending this University."
Senior,5,Amazing campus with professors always willing to do everything in their power to help you succeed. There are numerous opportunities to get involved in school activities from sports to clubs.
Sophomore,5,"Personally, I love Shenandoah its a very good school to learn and branch off to meet new people .We all come together for the homecoming football games in the fall, and the breathtaking conservatory performances all year round. My favorite time of the year on campus is just before Winter break when campus is all decorated with red and blue Christmas lights. And then there's always the Apple Blossom festival at the end of the spring semester."
Niche User,5,"Shenandoah was a wonderful school to visit! Their conservatory program looked very competitive and prestigious, which is exactly what I am looking for! Their dorms were fabulous and so were their facilities. The students I encountered on campus were fantastic to meet and I cannot wait to go back again in February for my Conservatory audition!"
Sophomore,5,"Everyone is very friendly. Professors are down to earth and care about your academics.  Everyone cares about you. The food can be better, but the food is manageable to like."
Sophomore,5,Shenandoah University has a very attracting campus with great health programs. Everybody is nice and always willing to help. The class sizes are relatively small so you get a better relationship with professors. Shenandoah is always adding new buildings and expanding campus each year.
Junior,5,I am a rising junior Music Therapy Student.  The Music Therapy department staff are all very understanding and close-nit and I feel very fortunate to be a part of this program.
Niche User,5,This school has wonderful opportunities for young artists at the Shenandoah Conservatory. I can't wait to start school there in the fall
Freshman,5,"At first I was on the fence about even going to college as I felt maybe school just wasn't the right fit for me. I decided to go and give Shenandoah University a shot and I haven't regretted it one bit. Although it is a smaller school, it provides a great environment to live in. Also, the safety provided by the school is amazing and I have yet to feel in danger since I have been here. The professors here at the school do more than just lecture and offer great classes to learn from."
Alum,5,"Shenandoah University is a very friendly school set in the beautiful and historic small town of Winchester, Virginia is northwestern Virginia. My first degree at SU was in the healthcare field. Shenandoah started as a conservatory for music majors but has grown in the scope and field of the programs offered. SU boasts one of the best Pharmacy schools and nursing schools in the country. They have since added more to their health professions with a Respiratory Care program and a Master in Public Health. The MPH program is brand new and promises to be a competitive program focusing on global and rural health issues."
Niche User,5,"Shenandoah University has an incredibly warm and friendly environment, a beautiful campus, and an awesome set of course offerings for various majors! There's truly something for everyone at Shenandoah."
College Freshman,5,everyone supports the football team overall and mostly men's sports. Women's sports aren't supported as much as they should be equally.
College Freshman,5,Love this school and the location. The staff are very friendly and determined to help the students succeed.
College Junior,5,"Being a new member of the SU Hornets, I look forward to experiencing the game of baseball like I never have before. I've been playing baseball my entire life, and I look forward to adding to the great achievements on and off the field for the Shenandoah Hornets! Whether this includes championships or even revamping the entire program, I look forward to participating!"
College Sophomore,5,I play baseball and its a very good program with alot of followers
College Sophomore,5,"Great school, fun activities and they are active in the community"
College Freshman,5,"Professors, in my two semesters of experience, have a great passion for the subjects they teach and are always readily available to help the student learn and to answer more specialized questions outside of class. The courses that I take are always relevant and extremely useful!"
College Freshman,5,it has a 97% job placement in my field.
College Freshman,5,i couldn't have found a better fit.
College Sophomore,5,DPS is always watching out for us and making sure we feel safe!
College Sophomore,5,Choosing Shenandoah was one of the best decisions of my life!
College Sophomore,5,I've learned so much and the experience is great academically as well as socially
College Freshman,5,"Shenandoah university and Winchester, VA are great. I would go here again if needed.  Made friends with a diverse group of people."
College Sophomore,5,The faculty is really strong
College Sophomore,5,Honestly one of the best schools I have attended.
College Senior,5,"I honestly feel really safe on my campus, no matter what time of day it is. Pretty sure nothing bad has ever occurred while i've been here the past three years. Campus safety are very diligent and will help you with anything you need."
College Freshman,5,"DPS is always on call, always available to help. Hardly any issues ever."
College Freshman,5,"You can literally leave your $2000 MacBook on a table in the student center and walk away and no one even thinks about taking it. So safe, all around. Great student body"
College Freshman,5,"Degrees from this school - especially in the Conservatory - are worth a lot. You really learn what you need to know - there's no memorization, it's REAL learning."
College Freshman,5,"I haven't met a professor yet that didn't care about their students. They teach really quality courses that teach you not just about the content, but about how it relates to life. Class sizes make sense for each class."
College Freshman,5,"I am a nursing major,  and I know I will have no issue getting a job after graduation. During the process of getting my degree I will have clinicals in different settings, mostly nursing homes and hospitals, this will help me get my foot in the door and get my name out there so that hospitals will know me when I apply."
College Freshman,5,"Shenandoah is wonderful. The campus is gorgeous, class sizes are small, and it has a small town feel. The professors are always willing to help and there are so many great resources to help students throughout the year."
College Freshman,5,"Shenandoah is an amazing school with small class sizes, a small easy to learn campus, a diverse campus, and all of the faculty strives to see their students succeed."
Freshman,4,"Handled it very well, but wifi sometimes acts up which is pretty annoying. Overall though not much of a problem."
Sophomore,4,"While the switch to online learning was not an easy one, I believe that all of my professors did the best that they could. I did not feel as though I had learned any less effectively than I would have in person."
Sophomore,4,"My experience with Shenandoah has been a very beneficial one. I love the people, and I am learning at a very impressive rate in my opinion."
Sophomore,4,Shenandoah is a very nice and beautiful place to be. I have made some of my closest friends there. The teaching of my major in Acting is fantastic. Although it is very expensive the university has a lot of opportunities and activities.
Junior,4,"My time at Shenandoah University has gone great. This school really delivers as a close-knit community. Everybody is friendly, The professors here genuinely care about you and you're well being. It's difficult to say that if you go to a really big school. But to each his own. The campus is very good looking especially in the spring. Winchester has a very relaxed environment. I did not expect to like it as much as I do being that I originally wanted to go to a school that has a city feel. Overall coming to SU was the best choice I could've made looking back."
Sophomore,4,"Shenandoah University is a great school with a beautiful campus, great people, and many great opportunities. SU has a wide variety of programs and is inclusive with them all. There are many resources that are offered to students on campus that are very helpful to students which will help students succeed. The technology provided to each student is excellent, updated and very useful. Campus life is very lively. There are many activities, teams, organizations and clubs that are available for students to get involved with. The local area, Winchester, Va, does not have much for students but Downtown Winchester has many things for students to do.  Campus dining is average. There are little healthy or vegan options, the options that are available are decent."
Sophomore,4,"The best part about Shenandoah University is the community.  This is a school where your professors actually know your name and are willing to help.  Instead of letting their students fail, the professors do whatever they can to try to help that student.  The courses are challenging, but completely manageable.  
The town around SU is great.  Has a lot to do and celebrates an Apple Blossom Festival.  There are tons of local places to eat."
Sophomore,4,"Since coming to Shenandoah i have had some great experiences. The professors at Shenandoah are great. With small class sizes, you can really develop a relationship with your professors. The professors  show how much they care about you learning and succeeding in your college experience. The professors are also always available to help students in class and meet with them during office hours."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the community, support, and resources offered to us students at Shenandoah University. The faculty is also very welcoming to everyone and they seem to genuinely care for us. At Shenandoah, we are treated as more than just a number."
Freshman,4,This is a great School academically. But the security could use a little bit more improvement. The resident assistants are always looking to get someone in trouble.
Niche User,4,"I visited Shenandoah 2 times and it was such a lively campus with a beautiful environment. I LOVE their conservatory and their amazing music program. It is a private school, so when it comes to music, they will definitely give you that one-on-one experience. I mainly love their major, Musical Theater Accompanying for piano, which I couldn't find in any other schools I looked into. Their dorms are not as great for freshman and their food is average, but this is definitely my top school I want to go to for their major that's specific to my interests and their music program."
Sophomore,4,I love Shenandoah University. It has given me a chance to expand my education greatly. They have a beautiful campus and a great student life. This university has shown me opportunities that I wouldn't dream of having before. They have also given me the opportunity to study abroad as a sophomore. This school has changed my life.
Freshman,4,"The people are so nice and welcoming, the campus is gorgeous, and the conservatory is so in-depth. The only thing I'd change is the food poisoning that people get from the dining hall sometimes."
Sophomore,4,My first year here was amazing!!! I couldnt have wished for a better college experience!!! I'm an acting major at this school and I can confidently say that the people and professor in my field are some of the most caring people ever.
Niche User,4,"I applied and I was accepted to attend for the 2019-2020 year , I am so excited to get to work and study hard to become a Physicians Asst or I may switch and want to be a Lawyer but I am ready to make a difference in the world with whatever field I choose."
Freshman,4,I am currently a freshman conservatory student majoring in double bass performance. At Shenandoah University there are lots of ways to get involved and apply yourself. I love representing the school as a Hornet Ambassador and volunteering on campus. There are also always activities going on on campus to make up for the sometimes lacking surrounding area.
Junior,4,"Many activities are provided here. The professors truly care. The other students are wonderful to work with. They have a really great program over here and my experience for the most part has been great. However, there are times where it feels like the University cuts corners on there students. Such as low quality food, poor quality dorms, lack of rec/ gym area, and poor quality selection of food. They say they are on a budget yet spend millions of dollars on a sports complex when we are not really a sporty school."
Senior,4,I like the community. With the small student body and small campus it makes it easy to connect with others. This has been useful in the sense that it helps build a network as we build our careers and it provides an opportunity to learn from others while having a family at the same time.
Alum,4,Class sizes for the upper level classes are small. Everyone is friendly and caring. As a student you feel like the teachers and administration care about you. There are lots of performances and concerts to go to for free with your student ID. With the smaller school size you get to know your fellow classmates pretty quick.
Junior,4,"I love the small campus vibe. You are able to know people easier, have a connection with teachers, and get from one class to another quicker!"
Sophomore,4,"I like how small the campus is and the ratios of teacher to student. The professors here are all really great. There are over 80 clubs to join and even though we are a D3 school, the sports teams are really good. The are lots of new and nice buildings being made for athletics and the college of Arts and Sciences. The food has improved a lot over the past two years, and the conservatory puts on really good performances. Also, I love how close all the restaurants and shops are."
Sophomore,4,Great school for a learning environment. Class sizes are small to enable students to be close to their professors to ensure that the students are able to learn to the best of their ability.
Junior,4,"I have loved my time at Shenandoah! The staff and faculty are all extremely passionate about their specialties. They are open and will sit down and have a heart to heart conversation with you. The campus is warm and inviting, the student life is full of energy and opportunities for involvement. We all come together for the homecoming football games in the fall, and the breathtaking conservatory performances all year round. My favorite time of the year on campus is just before Winter break when campus is all decorated with red and blue Christmas lights. And then there's always the Apple Blossom festival at the end of the spring semester."
Sophomore,4,"great school with great academics, great people that go there, everyone is friendly, great teachers, everyone is there to better themselves, great campus, but the only downfall is that it is a small school so there are days where you can get bored"
Freshman,4,"I found Shenandoah to be a place with good curriculum and generally decent professors - a lot of mine were excellent but I know of a lot of not-excellent ones, but when reported, they were addressed by the necessary offices and authorities. I found Shenandoah to be open-minded but still full of faith; proud of its tradition but not stuck in it; and although I complain about the food and lack of parking and mold problems they've had in years past, I've made friends that I would give my life for and found a program that I can't imagine myself working outside of. I study music composition and Shenandoah has broken me down as a composer and is rebuilding me, and the process is one I enjoy."
Niche User,4,The ease into freshman year is a huge focus for this school and it helps the students tremendously. Finding resources and help with future goals was little hard but overall everyone is helpful.
Freshman,4,"Very family oriented, seemed like home. I went on a blind recruiting visit for football and truly fell in love with the school.  It sits in the Shenandoah Valley and is rich with the history of our founding fathers."
Junior,4,"I like how Shenandoah is such a small school. The longest walk on campus is seven minutes so you can always make it to class on time. You get a really amazing sense of community here, everyone is so friendly and will hold a door open for you if you're walking from a mile away. One thing that I would change about the school is the geese control. There are geese all over campus, which makes it difficult to walk without stepping in a land mine."
Sophomore,4,It is a good school. It is a little expensive and very small. there is not much of a nightlife. Sports are not a huge deal and the classes are extremely easy. They have tons of cool teachers. The food is terrible at times but amazing at others.
Graduate Student,4,"I really enjoy my time at Shenandoah University. I not only graduated with my Bachelor of Arts in Mass Communications, but I also have chosen to pursue my graduate degree. The staff and faculty you interact with really do care about your well being and education. You can also always meet with your professor one on one and they will know who you are. I always stay in touch with former professors and they love to hear from me. It's a great family where you will feel welcome and it'll always outweigh the bad!"
Sophomore,4,"I like that Shenandoah University has a beautiful campus and is in a very safe area in Winchester, Virginia. I like that the Shenandoah River is nearby and Abraham's creek flows right through campus. I am a part of the conservatory at Shenandoah University and I admire all the incredibly talented artists who attend this school to pursue their passion in the fine arts. I believe we have strong academics and through the extra domain of general education we are encouraged to become well-rounded, knowledgeable learners. I also love that Shenandoah University has Division 3 athletics. The sports are competitive but no where near as much as a Division 1 school. The school is very small and we are lucky to have athletics at all! I would like to see better facilities especially for the dance students. I am a dancer myself and I often get shin splints from unsprung floors. Also, with the amount of choreographing/composition we have to do, we should have facilities open to us at all times."
Freshman,4,The campus is beautiful and a majority or the people are very easy to get along with and talk to. The food is not the best but there are many places to go off campus.
Junior,4,Shenandoah University has been a great college to attend. The professors are very willing to help you achieve. They are very passionate about teaching and helping their students. I am currently in the accelerated nursing program and I absolutely love it! The school is in a great location and there is plenty to do in the area. I highly recommend anyone interested in nursing to attend Shenandoah.
Niche User,4,Shenandoah university is a great place to be if your more into the business side of the world. The campus is great not many students with a student to teacher ratio of 15:1.
Freshman,4,"Shenandoah University is a great school. It is a big famous with a small campus feel. All the classes are small and the Professors are there for you. If you need help with school work or you would just like to talk they all have very flexible hours. There are many clubs and organizations to join, also many free and fun activities to blow off some steam in your free time. One of the things I would change is the food. The food is alright but defiantly not the greatest."
Sophomore,4,Over all SU is a quiet little campus where you see the same faces everyday aiding to make it feel like a community.
Junior,4,It is a wonderful school that has the perfect number of kids where you can create a social bond with the professors. They care about you and you're not just a number to them they want to help you inside and outside the class room. Most of the kids so a passion for learning and the put a good investment into the school.
Freshman,4,"Shenandoah is a GREAT SCHOOL. The professors work with students one on one outside of class to provide extra help, the students are nice and accepting of everyone, the campus is beautiful and peaceful, and the sports teams are very fun to watch! I would recommend this school to anyone hoping to seek an education while also having a great experience in college!"
Junior,4,"Shenandoah provides me with the skills and confidence to become a nurse. The courses are challenging,  but it pays off in the end. The staff is very friendly and willing to help me."
Sophomore,4,"Shenandoah University is a place where students come from all different backgrounds and are encouraged to speak their mind and opinions, while being open to others' opinions and beliefs. I came to Shenandoah University as a freshman last year having grown up in a small conservative church and school community, and I met others with many different beliefs and opinions. In our classes and extracurricular activities we are encouraged to collaborate ideas and make them apart of our own identities we are creating as adults. The faculty and students that I have become close with have come from different backgrounds, and I have been able to think for myself, give others my perspective on issues, as well as be influenced by others' experiences and opinions. This school provides not only an education for students, but opportunities to be global citizens with a passion for peace around the world."
College Freshman,4,Shenandoah is a unique school with its own flaws and quirks.
College Sophomore,4,Overall Shenandoah is a fantastic school for a new freshman!
College Sophomore,4,Safeties on campus is great. Never have I ever felt threatened or unsafe.
College Sophomore,4,Athletes here are literally your next door neighbor! Lovely people for the most part and teams give athletes plenty of time to make sure class comes first! (from former athlete)
College Sophomore,4,"Lovely school, perfect for a student wanting a challenge."
Senior,4,Shenandoah University was a choice I made based on academics and being closer to home. Even though I have been here at Shenandoah University for only one year not only has my GPA but my confidence in myself has grown tremendously. For that I am tremendously grateful.
College Freshman,4,"I know some people get what they want when it comes to internships but when I reached out for help they couldn't really find anything for me with theatre's especially back in my home town, so that was disappointing and I ended up working in a fast food restaurant instead."
College Freshman,4,I've like almost all of my professors and the courses I have taken.
College Freshman,4,I have gotten lucky twice to have a big room and a bathroom I do not have to share.
College Freshman,4,I like the acting program and the other classes that I have taken but sometimes the environment can be a little uncomfortable with the discrimination that happens on campus and off campus as well.
College Junior,4,"Being a student here, although its only been a short time was a joyous experience. I'm glad I chose this college. The campus overall is just BEAUTIFUL and it is located in the great area of Winchester, VA! Professors are as passionate as the students are and will do anything to ensure that they understand the topics covered. Sometimes classes consist of 20+ students, but the professors ensure that they are all receiving a great education!"
College Junior,4,"Campus security takes the issue of consent, and sexual assault seriously! The campus also has a strict alcohol and drug policy and reserves the right to test any D3 NCAA athlete. Overall, the campus is not only safe, but provides a great learning environment."
College Junior,4,Living on campus gives you the chance to become a social butterfly. Something as simple as leaving a door open invites anyone in to a simple conversation and a chance to make many friends to enhance your college experience.
College Junior,4,"Being a transfer student to Shenandoah University really opened my eyes, being from Hanover Township, PA and not financially sound as a student, I worried sometimes about how'd I would be ever able to pay for college. However, sometimes I feel like its worth the debt to be experience such a great area and campus!"
College Freshman,4,"It's very diverse you got different race, sex, religion going around school."
College Freshman,4,I don't really see to much of drugs being used on campus.
College Freshman,4,The value of a degree from this school is beyond measures because if you do get one you are guaranteed to get a job in the field you majored in.
College Freshman,4,The quality of the classes are nice. The class size usually runs from 25-30 and the professors are outstanding.
College Freshman,4,On campus we don't really have to worry about to much everyone is to their selves.
College Freshman,4,At my school there is a lot of school spirit everyone supports the athletics.
College Junior,2,Can't think of a single team I'd want to go see.
College Freshman,2,Conservatory jobs are hard to find
College Sophomore,2,Football and men's basketball usually get some crowd and attention but otherwise sports aren't well promoted or attended.  The athletes love what they do but the rest of us don't really interact with them as much as we could.
College Sophomore,2,"We aren't rowdy or excited about anything. My high school was 5 stars and my college is only 2 stars, its sad."
College Junior,2,Meal plan times don't match up to when you actually have time to eat. The food is terrible and unhealthy. I wasn't able to eat meat because it didn't look cooked properly. The best thing is that you can use flex dollars at chipotle.
College Freshman,2,"I'm a chemistry major, and quite frankly the entire chemistry department is pretty bad. They're disorganized to say the least and constantly seem like they're trying to figure out what exactly they should be doing. The biology department, however, is extremely organized and much more challenging."
College Sophomore,2,"Academically, getting into the program is not excruciating. The worst part of being selected into the program is the judgmental opinions of the program. Personally, I had to undergo many cosmetic changes due to the judgement I received. Many of my fellow classmates have also experienced the same type of judgement. I feel that if we are qualified academically for the program, then cosmetics and culture should not have any say on our admission and progress into the program."
College Sophomore,2,"The school does offer academic scholarships based upon a student's grades. However, the school is very unfair on amounts. They base even academic scholarships on financial ""need,"" even though both students may have the same grades."
College Junior,2,Division III school..sports aren't in favor at SU.
College Junior,2,Make friends and find rides. Our school only provides transportation around campus.
College Freshman,2,"food options, policy problems, and a lack of a computer science program have caused me to seek transferring to other schools"
College Freshman,2,lack of variety and quality. healthy options are only available by the luck of the menu
College Freshman,2,alcohol is not tolerated inside of underage dorms but there are frequent parties off campus which attended by many students and not technically discouraged.
College Freshman,2,"Depending on the hall you get, it could be comfortably spacious, or scarily claustrophobic."
College Freshman,2,"The football team isn't all that good, so if your looking for a big sports university/college, Shenandoah isn'y for you."
College Sophomore,2,I feel that I need more financial help. 
Recent Alumnus,2,It serves its purpose of getting a meal in & has your major chain eatery. Downtown is much better. 
Recent Alumnus,2,DC is so much better than Winchester.... I would have way more fun!
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is absolutely NOTHING to do in Winchester, VA! People usually go home or go to DC to have fun. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"Some of the Freshman dorms are alright. I like that after Freshman year the dorm situation is not like a typical campus. The Newest dorm has so many issues, and isn't fully ready for living. Every year since it's been open, people have had to live in a hotel. It is very inconvenient! Each building has it's own grade. There isn't anything consistent across the board. "
College Sophomore,2,The caf food is bad
College Junior,2,"Shenandoah is currently experiencing an apathy between the student population of its conservatory students and student athletes. In basic terms only students who are apart of these programs, such as sports, are the only ones supporting one another. Despite it all the athletic programs and department still operates  with full integrity and vital importance of all students being student athletes."
College Sophomore,2,"I received a good sum of financial aid, but it was a hassle trying to obtain financial aid. The office tends to be disorganized, and they tend to lose forms, especially from my experience."
College Sophomore,2,"As a conservatory student, I find the parties on the weekends are lively, filled with great music and lots of dancing. Unfortunately, these parties are few and far in between, and you only can get in if you know a conservatory student. Sometimes, you need a personal invitation. There are also sports houses such as the soccer house, but these get busted easily because of the mass amount of people that go. Also, they tend to be rowdy, and I've experienced some fights breaking out at some sports houses."
College Sophomore,2,"There are only two dining options you can use with your meal plan, three if you include the little coffee place in the student center. Sandella's offers healthy options, and next to it, the grill offers american food such as burgers, chicken fingers, etc. The main dining hall lacks in nutritional value. If you're not picky with what you eat, it's perfectly fine. The dining hall hours also seem to frustrate students."
College Sophomore,2,"The computer offers MacBook Pros for all students that is part of your fees and access to the library desktop computers, plus a small technology fee. The computer comes installed with Microsoft programs, iMovie, Garage Band, and more. Printing is through WEPA systems, so it is better to just get a personal printer. However, most assignments are done through Blackboard and do not use paper. Along with the computer you also get a choice of an iPad, iPod, smart phone (you pay your bill). The reliability and speed is pretty good, although Blackboard sometimes crashes or goes under construction."
College Senior,2,"Safety is ok, but the health part sucks. Mold in the dorms, and buildings, uncleanliness in the bathrooms."
College Student,2,"Not to Much â€“ The parties aren't too ""hopping"". There are the occasional good parties especially around Apple Blossom. Most of the good parties are at the sports houses which depends on what season it is for what parties will be thrown."
College Sophomore,2,We all get a computer when we start the program so i only to go library when i need to print
College Freshman,2,Night Life â€“ The night life at my school is okay it could be a lot funner then it is. There is not a lot of parties and when we do try to party they get busted.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life at Shenandoah is only for the conservatory which I was very disappointed in, but the frat does put on some hilarious comedy shows."
College Freshman,2,"SU = $$$ â€“ It wasn't that hard. The people in the Financial Aid office are very nice. But, it's so expensive to go here!"
College Freshman,2,"Drinking Is a Habit â€“ People LOVE to drink at SU. It happens far too often, and people do a great job of getting away with it, even if it's prohibited."
College Freshman,2,Not Quick to Respond â€“ I was dissatisfied with the response I got from the financial aid department because people couldn't answer the questions I asked and sometimes the people I was referred to weren't helpful or couldn't answer the questions I needed answered.
College Freshman,2,"The campus saftey is okay, but i never see any security around and if i do. they dont look like they can stop anyone.."
College Freshman,2,The audition process was stressful.  I am a musical theatre performance major and I had to wait for hours in a holding room before entering my audition.  It was too long and housed far too many people at once.
College Freshman,2,"Find Another School â€“ There are never any parties on campus (we don't have frats or sororities). Normally the parties are off campus at someone's house. They're a lot of fun, however, since there's no where to party on campus, the house parties can get kind of big and cops find out about them"
College Freshman,2,I need more money from financial aid.  Tuition is really high!
College Freshman,2,"Sheanandoah University Dining â€“ Food is extremely greasy and unhealthy.  Only a handful of healthy choices everyday, with no variety to them.  They do not show calorie information on half of the food there, and more students along with myself would like to see that to see what we are eating."
College Sophomore,2,"Class Registration â€“ The system often crashes when too many people try to register at once.  There is no definite time on when the registration opens so you have to try at different times of the day, and if you miss it, you may not get the classes you want.  Also in order to register you have to email your academic advisor the classes and then you have to wait for their approval which is often handled at their leisure."
Niche User,1,"Dear Musicians, 
Please DO NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT go to this school. The Music performance faculties are great, but some academic professors and people who work at the conservatory office are the worst people. Full of miscommunication and racism.  The school rule changes every moment and every year. It is just a terrible school, you don't wanna deal with these nonsense people.  They really should learn how to run music school from other big and great music schools."
College Junior,1,The school spends too much money on sports even though no one thinks they are good and the never win a game.
College Senior,1,We do not have greek life. Just academic fraternities.
College Sophomore,1,"Football gets their own space, but basketball has to share the same court with volleyball and they put down tape that ruins the paint on the floor which is very upsetting for us basketball players. The basketball court should only be used by basketball players. Not only that but anyone can get on the court which ruins it!"
College Sophomore,1,"Public safety thinks that they are real police officers. I mean one or two of them but the rest of them have never even taken a criminal justice course, they are just mall cops, that take their job too seriously"
College Sophomore,1,I live with my single mother who has to deal with my school tuition and is sending my sister to college next year and the school is still being stingy with money. Which i think is very unfair because i go to Shenandoah University a d3 college and we have football players coming here for free. This is illegal and not fair because these boys have very poor grades and are being saved by their coaches each class they fail. They should not be getting athletic scholarships. More of that money needs to go into academic scholarships to students that need and deserve it.
College Sophomore,1,Sedexo is a poor catering business. They need to be terminated.
College Freshman,1,"Apparently we were told there is some kind of transportation system somewhere, but I have not seen it or a schedule for it anywhere."
College Freshman,1,"I'm not a partier, so if there are parties, i wouldn't know. All i need are my small group of friends and im good."
College Freshman,1,Shenandoah has no Greek life.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The food at SU Sucks! After a while, they start serving the same dang blast it thing which causes people to eat off campus or if they have a house cook at home!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"The faculty & staff treat the students of shenandoah as if they are 9th grade high schoolers. A lot has been taken away or made more strict because of administration. Compared to my Freshman year, you could get away with more but now you get in trouble for sneezing hard enough in class. All fun aspect now have to be an educational reference and sometimes you just need to breathe a little. In addition, there are a lot of people that are against certain types of people and usually are unsupportive of their events and I don't think that is the way things should be. "
College Sophomore,1,Not worth the expensive tuition. It's a small school and you know everyone. There isn't much to do around the school. There aren't that many returning freshman.
College Freshman,1,This school sucks. no nightlife. don't go here if you want a full college experience
College Sophomore,1,"We have no transportation, if a class is going on a field trip or you have classes at a different building you have to find your own ride."
College Freshman,1,"It's not a lot to do on campus. Outside of restaurants and stores, there is virtually nothing here"
College Sophomore,1,"Whenever I have gone to the financial aid office, I have always left with disappointment. The workers are on their phones, eating, or gossiping. It makes me wonder why they even getting paid. It is difficult to actually sit down with someone. Someone told me to leave a message, so I did, but then I didn't get contacted back. None of my questions were answered clearly, and my financial statement has frequently been incorrect, or not updated."
College Sophomore,1,"Shenandoah University happens to be in the Shenandoah Valley, which means it is always about 10 degrees colder and windier. The winters here are brutal not only because of the lots of snow and cold temperatures, but also because of the non stop wind. I sometimes wish i went to college in Florida."
College Sophomore,1,"Too much, or none at all â€“ Youmwon't find much of a middle ground at SU. People either party every weekend, or don't party at all. It's almost isolating to be in either of these groups"
College Sophomore,1,"Don't get your hopes up â€“ Going to this school has been rather unpleasant. The campus is dull, ugly, and very constricting, the city is small and offers little in the way of... well, anything. There aren't many extra curriculars that aren't athletics, at least, it seems that way when you're there. the professors, while knowledgable, are generally ineffective. The food is rather unpleasant, and not, generally speaking, healthy. On the whole, my advice is to look elsewhere."
College Sophomore,1,What to Say? It's basically a commuter campus - you've got the pharmacy school and conservatory students who mainly stay on camput and some other majors but the rest commute.  There are NO campus activities.  If a group sponsors an activity - they go and no one else.  If you try to round up a group to do something/ anything (homecoming / dance / student center activity (when they have one :( they will laugh
College Sophomore,1,"Small Town â€“ The town rolls up the sidewalks at 9:00 no matter where you are.  There was a special once a month deal in the historic area, I coaxed some kids to go and we got there at 8:30 and places were already closed.  The mall/shopping = no stores you'd expect, attractions = none. Honestly, it's a sad place for a college student."
College Freshman,1,Thats the only good sport here. I don't even go to the football games.
College Sophomore,1,Printing on Campus â€“ Our campus has the new Wireless Everywhere Print Anywhere (WEPA) system.  It's convenient to actually be able to print anywhere but it cost to print and that's ridiculous.  I don't think many students like it.
College Sophomore,1,"The Allen Dining Hall â€“ They have a wide variety of food but over all, the food is not good.  I do not enjoy eating in the Dining Hall at all.  It's pretty rare that they ever have something really good and sometimes they don't have enough seating either."
College Freshman,1,If you do not own a car then you are not going anywhere unless you walk.
College Freshman,1,No Fun on Campus â€“ there is nothing to do unless the kids plan it on their own. there is nothing to do here after 10pm on campus so my friends and i go out at night and don't come back till early in the morning.
College Freshman,1,"I rarely see transportation buses anywhere on campus.  The only means of transportation that I have ever seen were taxis, but I have never used them because they cost the students money.  For transportation I just ask a friend."
College Freshman,1,"Winchester Is Dull â€“ there are very few concerts or events in town, which, coupled with the small size and relative conservatism of the town, provides for a pretty dull atmosphere in Winchester VA. the town is not really involved with the university as much as it could be and, outside of a pretty small and insignificant ""downtown,"" is a sprawl of strip malls, outlets, and car dealerships. on the plus side, there is a good disc golf course."
College Freshman,1,we only have one greek fraternity and its a band fraternity. Very few people in the one fraternity.
College Sophomore,1,"No Buses. The only transportation that's offered to students by the university is the SU shuttle and the times for those are difficult to find out and the route that the shuttle takes is unclear to most students. Also, city transportation is basically non-existent near campus. No taxis/buses are seen and they're not really used by students since they can't really be accessed easily."
College Sophomore,1,The dining options on campus are limited with poor quality food.
Recent Alumnus,1,"One Printer â€“ there is only one public printer on the entire campus. Actualy there are 2, but one never ever works. so, there is only one available to students in the library."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Do It Yourself â€“ I came to Shenandoah University because they offer an excellent theatre program. However not all parts of the theatre program are that good. In the Costume Design Degree there are only 2 professors who are not that willing to help/teach outside of class. This degree is entirely hands on, but we are completely left to ourselves to learn the handson aspects of sewing."
College Junior,1,"The only thing we have at Shenandoah, is a couple of small shuttle vans, that only go throughout the campus, I am not even for sure what time they are where...?"
College Junior,1,"I do not believe the campus is very strict.  I actually believe that the campus security officers should be more protective of their students and could do a lot more.  Most often, the only way to get real help on campus is to actually call the real police."
College Junior,1,"Shenandoah's athletic teams are not that great.  They do not will very often, especially the football team.  Most of the members I have met from the athletic departments are extremely mean and very egotistical.  I think some of the athletic students need a reality check."
College Student,1,They should offer greek life on campus. Only major based fraternities.
College Sophomore,1,The cost for parking is outrageous. They have taken away spots which makes it much harder to find a spot and not be late for class
College Junior,1,The Food Is Horrible â€“ There are few vegetarian and healthy options.There is no variety and the food is frequently over or undercooked.

Freshman,5,"Everyone is very accepting and it is an empowering, motivating, and competitive environment that fuels creativity. Those with big career goals would thrive here."
Sophomore,5,I love it so much. How I can create my own way and be unconventional. It was a difficult semester being quarantined at home and trying to learn everything over a computer.
Sophomore,5,"It is such an amazing school! All the teachers are extremely enthusiastic about their classes, extremely qualified, and the small classes offer more one-on-one time with the teacher, and also allow for students to get know each other, which lends itself to a tight knit community that helps one another."
Alum,5,I didn't take any online classes but their online system work great and is easy to use. It's user friendly and has all the information you need right there.
Senior,5,Best experience of my life and best college. It can be hard to fit in to the culture in the beginning but trust me the student body is friendly and the college is very supportive. Some professors would make your experience better some might ruin it. Do your research and compromise when it comes to good and bad. Believe me if you be you and hustle like FIT students you are fit for the school. (pun intended)
Senior,5,Honestly I did not feel like I was learning less. It was new for everyone but the professors caught up and delivered everything we needed to learn from the course. Some professor actually made it fun. But the experience can vary on the program you are taking. I am an Advertising and Digital Design student. My most work was digital. I have no knowledge about the programs where you need to use your craftsmanship to the projects. I believe they had totally different experience.
Junior,5,"The Fashion Institute of Technology has by far the most accredited Business school in the world. Rated for its top performing alumni, industry experienced professors, and incredibly motivated and talented students, FIT has challenged me to be my best and had more than prepared me for my career. FIT gave me the incredible opportunity to work full-time for the hottest fashion brand in the world - Dior. I have not only been a full-time student and full-time professional, FIT challenged me to do even more, where I am double specializing and minoring. FIT truly inspires and motivates its students to be their best and has the necessary resources and tools to make this happen!"
Freshman,5,Fashion school in the middle of New York City is a dream. I wouldn’t change anything about the school. If you are passionate about the fashion world this is the school for you.
Alum,5,"I was in Fine Arts, and their department and professors were very helpful.  They made us constantly go on trips to galleries and museums to keep us up to date. Everyone was super friendly and never judged anyone on their art."
Niche User,5,"Everything about FIT I love! The people, environment, academics are all amazing. The area around FIT is also very good and safe place."
Freshman,5,This school is welcoming and filled with existing courses that open you up to new ways of thinking .
Junior,5,FIT is great because you get started with classes in your major right away and it’s in the middle of New York City!
Freshman,5,"I'm having a great experience at FIT.  Its even more than I expected.  The teachers are great, the other students are supportive and good people, the dorm I'm living in is amazing (and I have great roomates)."
Freshman,5,Love this school!! Just started a couple months ago my  first semester and I already studied abroad for 2 weeks in Amsterdam to make jeans
Junior,5,FIT has a wonderful creative environment even for those not in artistic majors. Lots of amazing professors and cozy surroundings. Connected overall school culture and amazing resources.
Niche User,5,Best fashion design school. Fashion designer Veronica Castillo Apsan graduated  with honors from this school.
Sophomore,5,"Fashion Institute of Technology is an open community of students working together towards their future careers. We are always offering help to one another and suggesting ways on how to approach difficult obstacles. Through the years, you will must likely share classrooms with the same people and grow together in academic experiences. There are also many opportunities to study abroad and help prepare students for real world interactions with their career goal in mind. Given how great the student community and academic staff are, I will like more career opportunities spread to the art department through class presentations from professors or visiting artists. There is also a lack of internships for art students who wish to have experience outside school."
Freshman,5,"I’m enjoying my first year at the Fashion Institute of Technology immensely. I like this school because it allows me to create connections that will become helpful to me when I am in the Design Industry. FIT also exposes you to a vast amount of people from different cultural and economic backgrounds, which is something that is not commonly seen in private colleges. While FIT is a public university, the money that goes into the funding is well-spent, and goes towards ethical projects within the school."
Niche User,5,"Great atmosphere, great people! I went to visit the campus and take a tour and was left with excitement. Cant wait to apply and hopefully get in!"
Niche User,5,I have heard many good things about fit and I really want to go. My friends really like it there they say that it is a very good school and they like the way everyone help out each other. Fit sounds like a great school and what I want to major in is interior design. I believe that fit will allow me to become a great interior designer because they have many great programs for people to see how fashion is and for people to allow themselves to show what their own style is.
Alum,5,I was a commuter student in the early 80’s I earned my associate degree.  It would have been a lot better if my parents let me live in New York rather than commuted everyday.  I was very lucky we were all very lucky to have studied when we did before so many of the applied arts became a part of pop culture and before the computer took over the world. We learned the art of hand rendering.  The world of interior design is completely different than when I studied.  I am proud to be a graduate.  It is a very good value as well.
Junior,5,I am an illustration major and I had the most superb professional teachers.  The teachers have experience in their field and they give a lot of advice and support.  I had numerous life drawing classes that really helped in becoming a better artist.
Sophomore,5,"Amazing school with many opportunities for future business fashionistas and designers. You don't have to be into design to go here. This school is based on everything you need to know to be in the fashion world, whether it is business or design. They give many intern and job opportunities."
Sophomore,5,The fashion Institute offers a chance to younger students who are seeking experience and technical skills to enter the field. This college allowed me at eleven years old to build and shape my talent allowing me a fast track into the industry to build connections and proficiency. When I applied after high school I was more advanced allowing my portfolio to stand out amount the rest assuring a spot for me. Not only did FIT set me up for future success with their school but other universities accepted me for early decision. This school has always been a supportive force in my creative and business endeavors. I hope more young students will be able to walk in the path that I did.
Junior,5,The Fashion Institute of Technology is the school every Fashion student should go to if they are looking for careers in the Fashion Industry. Its competent and industry leading professors are one of their many assets. Students receive insights from their personal experiences and learn from real world activities. The people in general are there to better themselves to have a voice in Fashion world wide. The Fashion Institute of Technology was voted the #1 Fashion school in the world for a reason!
Alum,5,This school is highly intensive but the faculty is fantastic. Most are professionals currently working in the field that will help propel your career forward.
Freshman,5,Great school for creative scholars of the future! We are taught to speak out on current issues with an informative wit and style.
Sophomore,5,"Overall, I love my College. I never knew that studying here would take me all the way across the world to study fashion in an entirely knew atmosphere. It makes you aware of the world outside of your own little idea of what fashion is."
Sophomore,5,My experience so far is splendid. I wouldn’t trade anything in the world for the position that I have in this elite institution. Highly favored and a popular school that most students who dream of going to including myself. I am most gracious to study my major fashion design at one of the most recognized fashion school in the country.
Freshman,5,"Overall, I love the atmosphere and environment of the college. It is one of the most inspiring places for me as an artist, designer and creator."
Senior,5,Professors are great motivators. You will come across many opportunities to Network with great people.
Niche User,5,My dream school. There are so many opportunities to grow your career and develop a passion for fashion.
Alum,5,"I loved everything about this school. The location, the atmosphere, and the opportunities for all students are all incredible. It's definitely my #1 choice!"
Freshman,5,"The Fashion Institute of Technology is very diverse since it's in the heart of NYC. The only down side of FIT is that of course is not like any regular college. The party scene here isn't that big since FIT is a dry carpus meaning no smoking or alcohol on campus. But the academics and courses do make up for the low party scene. FIT is not only known for fashion but other majors in business, interior design, illustration etc."
Freshman,5,Great school! the campus is in the perfect location of the city and the dorms are really nice too. The professors all have experience in the field that they teach which makes classes really interesting and fun. Im so happy I chose fit!
Niche User,5,As a Pre College student FIT was a great way to become comfortable and get a small taste of what life would be as a student fulfilling my dream.
Freshman,5,I absolutely love FIT. It has been my dream school since I was 14 and has lived up to expectations. The only thing I would change is more vegetarian/vegan options in the cafeteria.
Freshman,5,FIT is great for networking and learning real life professionalism and business practices. I’ve only been here for one semester but so far I’m confident that be a successful creative director or brand manger before I receive my associates based on the knowledge that I’ve aquired as a FIT student.
Junior,5,"I transferred to FIT as a junior with an AA from another school.   The level of education we receive for the tuition cost is impressive. My professors work in the industry at a high level and do a great job connecting us with opportunities (colleagues, alumni, field trips, etc.).  I've learned a lot in just my first semester."
Junior,5,It's a great college that offers a lot of resources to their students.  They have a great selection of teachers that have incredible experience & they're always willing to help.  I'd recommend this college to anybody that's interested in the fashion or business realm.
Junior,5,"I am a current junior at the Fashion Institute of Technology and I honestly love going to this school. The opportunities and resources available for our use are immense. From having professors who are from the industry and can teach us personalized experiences about the industry we are looking to go into to, to having career fairs and bringing companies weekly to recruit they are a school invested in making sure their students succeed and graduate with a job and that is something I really appreciate and is one of the many reasons I love attending here."
Sophomore,5,"You get so many opportunties at FIT. Your professors are experienced in the industry and it's a great time that you connect with your professors and build a better connection with them. You also get internships and other opportunities opening up to you. The school is very big that you could meet new people there and most of the time, you can study anywhere on your own. The library is also big and have more better equipments for every student there to do their projects and assignments. I recommend FIT, if you're able to pursue your career/major."
Senior,5,Fashion Institute of Technology is great! The professors are straight from the field and they actually care about their students success. FIT is pretty competitive but that is what gives it it's edge compared to  other colleges. It it conveniently placed in the heart of NYC with plenty of places near by to eat and have fun.
Freshman,5,They have great communication and make processes easy to understand and complete. The admissions and financial offices have been very helpful and answered all my questions.
Freshman,5,"as I'm a first semester freshman, i love it.  I love the  professors , they truly care about their students. the classes move at great pass where you don't feel overwhelmed"
Freshman,5,"Attending the Fashion Institute of Technology has been the best decision of my life. Coming from a small town in Ohio, I was not exposed to much diversity. Which is a totally different story at FIT. I am so glad to have the opportunity of attending school here. The academics and professors are amazing. I have learned so much about the industry, people, and life overall. I would highly recommend the Fashion Institute of Technology to anyone interested in fashion or business."
Freshman,5,"LOVE IT! Diverse people, good selection of classes, opportunities to meet new people, multiple security guards everywhere. Safe and clean campus."
Freshman,5,"I am currently on my first year at FIT and I am very content with the safety of the campus. As a women of color I am very comfortable at the college due to the diversity it hold, though I believe they need to work on the food the cafeteria holds."
Sophomore,5,"FIT offers amazing opportunities in a variety of specialized areas including fashion, art, design, mass communications, business, and more and offers professors with real world experience who you can connect with.  It really is an out of the ordinary school and isn't your typical college, but it is located in the vibrant and dynamic hub of New York City where opportunites abound and almost anything can be done."
Sophomore,5,Great school teachers really push you to be great work is very time consuming but isn’t hard you just have to take time to get things done I wish the FD work rooms stayed open past 2 am for fashion design student because we honestly need more time but it’s great
Junior,5,"FIT is a great school. Full of resources and connections. It's really what you make out of it. The facilities can be upgraded, but we have a lot to appreciate for."
Freshman,5,"Great (and cheap) housing in NYC.
Dorms = Big/Walls = Thick
Good food.
Good profs
Focus on getting jobs
You get an associates degree then BFA
Not too much work
Study abroad options
Many freshman get industry jobs over summer(Illustration major)"
Niche User,5,I toured multiple art schools in New York this summer! FIT far surpassed my expectations and the way they design their curriculum is highly effective to allow me artistic skills to flourish.
Junior,5,"If you are interested in the fashion industry, this is a great school for that. Everything is designed to get your foot in the door, whether it's through the career and internship center or the connections with the professors. FIT makes sure to give the students the advantage of being in New York City."
Sophomore,5,"FIT is such a great school for fashion studies. Professors are extremely passionate and all have experience in the fashion industry. They get to know each and every one of their students personally, and go out of their way to make sure all their students are understanding. Best of all, it is located in the heart of NYC!"
Freshman,5,I love the fashion institute. Its like getting an education and real world experience at the same time. They have so many opportunities for students to learn and grow both inside and outside the classroom and they have an amazing internship program. The professors are always open to help and will even stay after class occasionally to help with complicated concepts. If you decide to create something you haven't learned yet they help with the construction of the design. They are as invested in your education as you are. It's tough but you get out of it what you put into it.
Senior,5,"This school is very diverse and prides itself with their slogan, ""where creativity gets down to business,"" which couldn't be any more true! FIT prepares you for the real world with relevant work and projects relating to your field of study."
Sophomore,5,"Of all the things I love about the Fashion Institute of Technology, is the harmony of living and learning in an environment that is safe and welcoming.  It is an absolute treasure being able to learn from and socialize with people from all walks of life, different colors, ethnicities, different sexual orientations, etc. Everyone is so welcoming and open-minded, willing to explore far beyond the bounds they've known for so long. In addition to exploring, there is also willingness to begin anew and let go. This school is like a breath of fresh air, and I'm honored to have the opportunity to learn more and do more!"
Niche User,5,I love this school and have found that every part of it is comfortable. From the dorms having a real home experience to the classrooms and teachers providing a top notch education so you can take whatever knowledge you gain to the real world and have many opportunities.
Junior,5,My experience at this school has been great. I love the diverse minds and creativity that flows throughout the campus. I am in the EOP program which is great and they offer me a lot of support.
Sophomore,4,"I didn't particularly like it at first. The campus was less than ideal, but I enjoyed being in New York City, enjoyed some of my classes, but the social life was definitely something to get used to. I was a commuter, and you only really begin to bond with your fellow students when you dorm. For a while my freshman year, I was concerned I wasn't making too many friends. However, that all started to change when I began putting myself out there and joining clubs. Then I began meeting new people and actually enjoying myself at school. You definitely have to put yourself out there to meet people, but once you do its all uphill from there. Not to mention- FIT kids don't party much, its mostly clubbing (which is a plus)."
Sophomore,4,"Online learning is definitely a bit of a challenge, but our professors try to make us feel as normal as possible. Balancing them is a bit of a struggle if you don't have too much self-control, and group projects are a bit tougher, but once you get used to it its not too bad."
Freshman,4,The online experience so far has been positive. All professors strongly want to help and do their best to make the class as fulfilling as possible.
Alum,4,"I took only a few hybrid classes, they were easy to follow and the instructors made everything clear."
Alum,4,"What I didn't like about the school was the length of classes vs. the amount of credits received. For example, a semester long 3 hr twice weekly class would only earn you 1.5 credits. Additionally, the amount of liberal arts classes required to complete the degree. In order to graduate on time and avoid summer sessions, we would often have to pack our schedule with 10 classes/21 credits each semester."
Junior,4,"Great school with very good professors. I've learned a lot here and am extremely grateful to continue my studies. Strong academics, but the social scene is a bit of a put off. Very competitive environment and students can be cold and unfriendly."
Sophomore,4,"Online experience with FIT has been pretty good, although nothing compares to a traditional class. Everything is easy to follow as all the teachers use blackboard, and material can be found there or with your textbook. Still learned just as much and was able to communicate with teachers. Overall  a good experience."
Freshman,4,"Due to the pandemic, FIT adopted to use Blackboard as its virtual meeting place which I found very impressive compare to what I expected. The professors and faculties were very skilled in guiding us to learn and access through it. As a person who didn't really appreciate nor acknowledge its technology, I thought that my remote spring semester went smoothly."
Alum,4,"The Fashion Institute of Technology is where I went for my Bachelor Degree in Home Products Development. The small HPD program allowed me to work with teams, learn how to give major presentations and taught me how to create product with intention."
Junior,4,"I didn't register for online classes however, due to COVID 19 my education experience became remote. It was difficult adjusting to the new format because much of what I do is hands-on. My professors were very helpful and made the transition less difficult. As a whole, we came up with creative solutions to make the most out of the situation."
Alum,4,"If you want to go to art school but under budget, FIT is the right school for you. In the end- professors work throughout the NYC, which means you'll have same professor as your friends in Parsons. I can't recommend a better school for not only fashion, and other major as well."
Junior,4,"Great college and the professors are great and take time well to teach their students and make sure they understand what there students are learning. Food is good and they have a Starbucks inside the campus. They have many dorms and types of housing available and for everyone and all budgets.There are many stores, deli’s and things nearby by. There is also bus stops and subways near by."
Sophomore,4,"FIT has a great reputation in the industry and is the top rated fashion college in the country. I like that the school has a lot of different majors and specialized minors. However, I feel that FIT lacks in diversity and inclusivity. Colored people  remain minorities at the college and its very obvious."
Freshman,4,"Professors are really good and friendly as well as helpful.
Resources are perfect. Loads of opportunities and the school has great connections to companies."
Freshman,4,"I believe the Fashion Institute of Technology provides a unique learning experience available to everyone at an affordable price. For it’s location, alumni help, staff excellence, and opportunities it is well worth the price for those interested in the fashion world. The campus itself is gorgeous for those interested in the arts, with plentiful escalators and galleries, exhibitions and student work in the halls. There are many competitive students but as long as you become confident enough to ask for a hand, they will be there to help you. The intimate classroom settings enable better learning retention. Dorms are pretty expensive, so many students commute. Overall, it is a wonderful art school that provides a handful of resources for those wanting jobs in the fields of art, business and fashion."
Freshman,4,"FIT is a very competitive college. It has a lot of resources as well. The school feels like a big community, and encourage students to get as many opportunities that the school provides."
Sophomore,4,"Fashion Institute of Technology genuinely provides a safe and secure environment for the students not only through the security department, but also through the members of the staff. They are kind and empathetic towards the student's needs when available."
Sophomore,4,"A really good education in general but needs some updates. The studios are way too small, most forms, irons and sewing machines break frequently. It isn't a typical college experience but worth it for the education."
Niche User,4,When I visited Fit It was a very independent and creative enviornment with many different types of people around the campus. The tour guide we had was very honest and opened about the school and had good attitude and made me feel welcomed.
Senior,4,"I enjoyed the small class room atmosphere and the ability to learn through hands on experiences. The professors, were extremely patient and focused on geting the material across in the classroom. They also gave me the ability to explore different areas of interest, such as, writing."
Sophomore,4,"The dorms are great, the location is amazing, and the ease of living here is a definite plus. Everything you need is available nearby."
Senior,4,"The courses and professors at FIT are of great quality and prepares students for the fashion industry. Employers love FIT graduates and we have high placement of jobs before graduation. I enjoyed all the classes I have taken! It is a public SUNY university which makes it easy to transfer to other state schools if you wanted. I had trouble receiving help multiple times with my curriculum, graduation, and even financial aid help because no one knows how to help you. You get a different answer every time you step into their office. Because of this, students end up taking the wrong classes to fulfill their graduation requirements. I wish Financial aid was more helpful as many students have trouble understanding all these financial documents. Security concerns me because anyone on the street can walk in. We recently had a school shooting scare that no one got hurt, but measures for safety have not been changed since then. We should have more than enough funding to keep our school safe."
Freshman,4,Love the motivation this school brings. It’s the best place to learn fashion in one of the best cities. There are endless opportunities
Sophomore,4,Love the school's location. Professors are great and knowledgeable. Great clubs and volunteering opportunities.
Junior,4,"I'm an illustration major, and the program is better than I expected it would be. I've had amazing professors who are also working professionals that have helped me developed my skills so much over the past two years."
Freshman,4,I haven't started yet but them campus and neat but small and it is right by the 1 train. Good for me.
Sophomore,4,"I just finished my freshman year at FIT, and it has really been an eye opening two semesters. The classes are really hands on and give me good experience for the real world."
Freshman,4,"It's a great school that sets you up for a career in the industry. Definitely not a party school, but NYC is a great playground to be in!"
Freshman,4,"The location of the Fashion Institute of Technology is at the heart of New York City, so you will have a plethora of cool places around the school. The resources are amazing and free, so all you need is your FIT account to access them. The professors are well qualified and have at least ten years of experience under them, so you can network through them and make good connections. Even though the dorming halls/buildings aren't the best, nothing can compete with the experience its given me. I've met some really nice and unique people thoughout all the majors offered at the school. I would not have met these people if I commuted. FIT also offers a various amount of ways to get involved on campus. These include becoming and RA, becoming apart of a board of a club, creating a club, and so much more. The workload can be a lot for some students and a way that the school destress students is by enhancing the party scene."
Junior,4,"I think FIT's campus is pretty good in terms of community, diversity can use a bit on improvement but everything is relative."
Alum,4,"Great value for New York state residents. Post-graduation I had multiple offers for jobs. 

The bulk of coursework is to prepare students for real world experience. Classes on Excel, Powerpoint, Statistics, Business Communication, etc have all prepared me for working in a professional environment."
Freshman,4,"I love FIT, however, everything is so expensive. That’s my only issue. A lot of the teachers ask you to buy stuff that they might only use once. Also, it’s extremely hard to make friends if you’re not staying on campus."
Sophomore,4,"I think academic wise, this school is really good especially for what you pay for. It is a SUNY school. I do think the name may scare off some people because it isn't solely a fashion school. I am studying art, and not fashion related art. There are a lot of things you can take besides fashion related majors. It's right in the center of Midtown in New York City too so there is always something to do. Sadly, this takes away from on-campus activities. It's hard to make friends because the majority of the school is commuter students who don't really like to linger after classes, would prefer to go home, meet high school friends or go to an outside job. Not many folks go to on-campus clubs or sports. The people who dorm also don't make much of an effort. They'll probably meet people by going to city parties and enjoying the city nightlife. But academic wise this school has a lot of options and wonderful facilities and faculty."
Freshman,4,"If you get to live in the apartment style dorms (CoEd or Alumni) your freshman year, that's great! You'll have no issue living here. Living in the traditional style dorm (Nagler) is kinda crappy, there's no air conditioning and you're required to have a meal plan. The dining hall doesn't really have a good, healthy option besides the salad bar."
Freshman,4,"If you want to do anything fashion related in your career, this is the school for you. However, FIT is the type of school where you go to strictly for education because the social life isn't really that good. Not only is social life a problem, but also there isn't a lot of diversity."
Niche User,4,I really enjoyed the urban setting of the school. The professors there are very dedicated in making the most out of all their students.
Sophomore,4,"Excellent education, the teachers are great and are required to have 10+ years of experience in the field they teach. The downsides are I have noticed that many FIT students aren't very friendly and are very cliquey. That doesn't go for everyone though because I have made some great friends here!"
Junior,4,The school is for those that will take initiative ONLY. If you are here to just be lectured too you will graduate with nothing.
Freshman,4,"I like all the opportunities you get from the first week of being there.  The campus is a little out dated, but overall, great school."
Junior,4,"I love attending the Fashion Institute of Technology. There are, of course, some things I'm unhappy with, but overall it is a great experience. I really feel like I belong at this school, like the teachers care about whether I pass or not."
Freshman,4,"Fashion Institute of Technology is an amazing school full of diversity. I've had an amazing time here for my first year and can't wait to go back. I can't speak for other major's professors, but the professors in the Illustration department really push you to be the best that you can be. The students here are also very talented so it's a bit intimidating, but for the most part everyone is super friendly which is surprising to me as I've always been told that New Yorkers can be quite scary. Everything is easily accessible and within walking distance, but if you really aren't in a walking mood the subway is very easy to use once you get the hang of it. There are 3 dorm buildings on campus (Alumni, Nagler, and Co-ed). All buildings are guarded by 24 hour security and you have to show your ID to get in. The cafeteria food is okay, but if you aren't feeling that you can always get something from outside of the school. There are food carts everywhere."
Junior,4,The professors at the Fashion Institute of Technology are seasoned professionals in the fashion industry. Their knowledge and guidance is so valuable. It is also in a great location- Chelsea.
Niche User,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed how interactive majority of the professors were - you could approach them for course assistance and would often receive it with no feeling of imposing. The library had computers and books available in pristine condition. Campus was always clean and fitness Centre was a plus. 
As an international student, I had hoped they had more financial aid assistance and resources available to help make certain processes easier. They could look into providing scholarships to international students."
Alum,4,"The class size is small, with 10-25 students per class. There are a lot of clubs on campus. The student government has a lot of events for students on campus. The IT department is helpful. The professors are knowledgeable. The school does not help very much with job placement after graduation. The administration is not great."
Freshman,4,"F.I.T is a very welcoming school. Classes are filled with around 20 students no more than 30. It is organized well, and helpful. The school has many on campus activities and an awesome writing center that can make an improvement on your grades. So glad I’m in this school!"
Alum,4,"The school is great for fashion students but it specializes in fashion design. If you are sure you want to pursue a career in fashion design, the school is highly recommended. The school has a great fashion design curriculum with many renowned professors in the fashion business. It is important to note that the school is intensive and fashion design students spend late nights working on projects. The fashion business management program is a good program if you are planning on staying in the retail industry and in fashion. The school has many connections with companies for internship and full time opportunities. Most students study full-time and have internships during the semester."
Junior,4,"I love that it has so many resources for students concentrated career choice, and that there is a wide-array of classes to take."
Freshman,4,I came into FIT unaware of the opportunities that would arise for me. FIT is literally your second home. When you reach out to the right people they will help you. Not only is this a school but it also cares about your success outside of campus.
Alum,4,"FIT is a great school for someone who is very determined to become successful in fashion. While I enjoyed my time at FIT, it is not a typical school. There are no huge football or basketball games. You basically go to class, then go to work or go home. The only way to break this mold is if you are involved in any of the clubs. I was in the Gospel Choir and I met so many great friends that way. FIT will challenge you and prepare you for the real world. They are all about their business. I think they need to improve on their Financial Aid office, that is my only con."
Freshman,4,The energy of creativity and the student displays of art throughout campus really encourage you to go out and display your craft.
Freshman,4,"The college enables students to not only interact with other students, but also enables them to gain work experience through internships and such. The professors have years of experience for heir respected field thus enabling students to get a better understanding for their own future."
Alum,4,FIT has incredible professional connections that help students find internship and job opportunities. The professors have relevant industry experience and are extremely helpful.
Senior,4,"Most of my professors are very well educated and immersed in their industries. The campus is okay, but it's in NYC, so I don't really care that it's not the most state of the art campus. The school has provided me with countless opportunities and many students get excellent jobs after graduation."
Freshman,4,I love FIT. The academics are great. It is very diverse and inclusive and there is always something to do.
Niche User,4,"I like that the campus is all connected on one street so you don't have to walk back and forth between different buildings. The atmosphere is lively and friendly, however some parts of the hallways and classrooms reminded me of an old high school setting. Despite that, everyone is motivated to work hard, and that is how some very famous people came to be!"
Sophomore,4,"The diversity is very high, allowing you to get to know people from different cultures and ethnicities."
Alum,4,"My overall feeling about FIT’s education is that it is very course heavy when it does not need to be. There are some courses I have taken that felt like they were just repeating themselves. This is another part of FIT that can be limiting at times, especially if it is with the same professor. There is a certain technique or medium or aspect of art that will be focused on and then practiced again and again in the various levels of the course. What is frustrating about this is the fact that there is nothing I can do since the courses are required to graduate. Even if it feels like I am taking the same course multiple times in a week, I have no choice but to take it. And how do I benefit from taking the same course where I am only exploring a certain technique every time I take it?"
Freshman,4,The Fashion Institute of Technology is a great place to attend school! The professors are very knowledgeable in their field and go out of their way to make sure their students succeed.
Sophomore,4,"FIT really prepares you to enter the fashion industry with the necessary knowledge. Some of the classes are a bit general and basic but I guess that is for people with no prior knowledge about the industry. So if you already have a background, these classes reinforce what you know."
Senior,4,Fashion Institute of Technology is a great school right in the middle of Manhattan. The school is very diverse which helps make any student feel right at home. There are some really amazing professors who will teach you valuable skills to use for your career.
Freshman,2,"Lacks diversity despite being in one of the worlds most well known cultural melting pots. Worst guidance counselors you’ll ever meet. You’ll never get a single class you pick, and you’ll be stuck in 6 yes I said 6 hour long classes."
Senior,2,"Good college in the sense that the professors are great although some still feel as if they're in their glory days back in the newsroom or agency. The worst aspect are the students; a majority are pretentious and snobbish who feel the need to more often than not put people down. Maybe it the fashion industry in general who feel that their work in the industry matters to society, well it doesn't.  And apparently some girls never leave high school because the cattiness level is through the roof, I've seen girls and their little posses (because FIT is clique based) talk so much shit about other girls that it's appalling! And god forbid your the kind of person that isn't into partying and a bit shy, both the teachers and students make you feel bad for being shy. Honestly FIT isn't worth your time, but if your the kind of person who thinks fashion is everything and like to bring people down because of pettiness this is your school!"
Senior,2,I'm in the fine arts department. It's a pretty strict curriculum with no room for exploration. They give you a set of classes that are mandatory. Each semester I take 7-9 classes and I've been here for four years. I even take winter and summer courses. I'm in my senior year and I have never been more stressed. It's very overwhelming. But the fine arts professors do know what they are teaching. They are very knowledgeable and helpful. I have learned A LOT here. But just be prepared to balance out a busy school schedule along with a work schedule because materials are not cheap.
College Junior,2,"Our school is division 3 ncjaa, so there aren't many sports options to choose from. I am an active student and like to workout and play sports so I always wished we had intramural teams at school too. However, FIT does offer fitness classes for students to attend which I think is effective."
College Senior,2,"Besides our teachers, most things here are from the 1960's. 2 floors of new computer labs in the C building, but it's literately one tile is brand new, the next is super old. half the sewing machines don't work, and the working ones are held in with tape. only straight guys are in Menswear or architecture."
College Senior,2,"There are a few in-door multi-purpose courts, but girls and guys rarely participate in or at all use the facilities. regularly try to get basketball games happening but rarely anything happens"
College Sophomore,2,"I know people who participate in sports, but I never hear much about it. Sports are not a huge part of campus life or for the school in general."
College Freshman,2,"Almost impossible to have guests, hard to make friends because the doors don't prop open. No private bathrooms, no fridges or microwaves allowed under any circumstance-- can't reheat food or save food... Roommates can only have one guest at a time"
College Freshman,2,"It is a fashion school, we have one facility to keep us in shape, but I use New York City to walk and keep active, most people have jobs anyways and walk to them, it's an active enough city that it isn't as though we are at a lack of activity."
College Junior,2,They are really really strict here! Parents love it and security is absolutely everywhere at all times. It's nice when you first move to NYC expecially if you're coming from a small town but after a while it becomes excessive.
College Senior,2,"The RAs are extremely strict. If they don't like you, your life will be hell."
College Senior,2,FIT is not centered around a sorority or frat. We are more of a community although we do have a Greek life some what. I feel like since we're all in such a big city it's not important.
College Freshman,2,There are no real parties but clubs are fun.
College Freshman,2,It was very hard to find out they only gave me loans.
College Sophomore,2,I cannot seem to find any scholarships that are helpful to me and I am even in the honor society here.
College Junior,2,"There are not many parties on campus, it is hard to find them"
College Freshman,2,No parties on campus at all. Either go to clubs or bars or you'll end up indoors all the time.
College Freshman,2,Dorms are tiny and outdated. The lounge area is small and the kitchen area is smaller than a closet. There is no a/c in Nagler dorms and the heating is always way too high in the winter.
College Sophomore,2,No Greek life almost at all. It's good in a way because you can concentrate more on what you need to do for school
College Junior,2,Expect to find everything yourself.
College Junior,2,Honestly for the same money you could get much better meals off-campus.
College Freshman,2,Financial aid has not been any help to me and it doesn't seem like they are trying to be. My parents keep sending in all the required forms and they still are asking for more. It is a very frustrating process.
College Freshman,2,"Since FIT is not known for its sports, most people don't pay attention it. Even the varsity sports mean nothing to people. The gymnasium for practice and games is very nice and the locker rooms are nice. That doesn't mean anything to people who don't participate in them though."
College Freshman,2,Living in Manhattan is tough. It's too expensive to live off campus.
College Junior,2,FIT is an institute so it is unlike most party school colleges and its a dry campus. If you want to party you can go to clubs or there are even cool warehouse parties in Brooklyn. So off campus party scene is way better.
College Junior,2,"Theres not much, theres a few sports here and most of the fitness classes are just dance or yoga classes cause ew exercise. The fitness room is really sub par and small with hardly any weight lifting equipment its just mostly cardio there."
College Sophomore,2,"It is basically an all girls school, a fashion school."
College Senior,2,"I am no longer enrolled into this school, but at my previous school there were just so many rules that  felt it was hard to express ourselves, which was sad because it was an art school."
College Senior,2,I am an AMC major and basically take the same classes over and over again for the past two years.
College Senior,2,Rooms are small and neighbors can get annoying quickly. We have RAs but they dont really do much.
College Junior,2,"The weather has been horrible lately. Snow storm after snow storm. And it really sucks to travel in that weather since I don't exactly live across the street. Usually, though, FIT will close the school when it gets really bad. Notice I said ""WHEN"", and not ""In the instance that it might"". FIT will wait until 5 of the 10 inches of snow are already down to close the school."
College Freshman,2,"They hardly give any money, and if they do, its loans."
College Freshman,2,"Very sad excuse for a dining hall. The hours are terrible for students. The food is sometimes okay, and there are a lot of options, but you are restricted in what you actually get as a meal. It's not buffet style like a lot of other schools and the food is not very good."
College Freshman,2,"Leave your car at home, take public transportation instead. A lot cheaper and also saves you a lot of time."
College Junior,2,"FIT is in Manhattan, everyone who knows the city knows it's hard to find parking. That is why everyone walks or takes the train. If you drive there is usually parking blocks away where the price is an arm and a leg. You don't need a car on campus because its NYC;there is public transportation. There is no parking at FIT at all."
College Freshman,2,"I only recieved a loan from FAFSA with a pretty high interest rate. The other scholarships from FIT are very hard to find and get information on. There is the Michael Kors Endowment, but that's only for BFA students. Other options include scholarships to study abroad and state grants. I'm an out of state student and found little to no options for help from the school. "
College Junior,2,Everyone gives me different information.
College Junior,2,"I don't drive to school, but if i had to i still would not drive into Manhattan."
College Freshman,2,The school is located in the city therefore there is no need for a car on campus. To have a car on campus costs a lot of money anyways. There are rarely any parking spots located on the campus street.
College Junior,2,"Still trying to figure it out, but I do not receive financial aid. "
College Freshman,2,"There is a high women population, and most of whom have boyfriends. Most of the men are gay or taken, as far as I've seen."
College Senior,2,It was voted one of the worst colleges to go to for meeting single guys!  The school actually is comprised mostly of girls.
College Freshman,2,"There are a variety of options, but I am a picky eater and the only things I eat at the dining hall are not too healthy and the healthy stuff isn't part of the meal plan. I am required the meal plan with my dorm. I am kind of stuck into eating the same thing every day. they do have choices but not that are available to me. I don't want to gain the freshman 15 due to the lack of choices I have for me."
College Senior,2,"New York real estate is expensive plus you most likely need a broker which includes an additional fee. Parking is difficult on the street and usually involves the need of a garage AKA another fee, but there is no place like NY."
College Sophomore,2,The only transportation Fashion Institute of Technology provides is from the dorms on 32st to the school on 27st. Most of the time I end up walking because there is not enough room in the shuttle.
College Sophomore,2,"Although it says it's a dry campus, there are always drugs going around. It's not a problem if you stay out of that scene."
College Freshman,2,They exist but it's not a huge aspect on campus. People love working out at the gym though!
College Freshman,2,"In my opinion, I don't like people at FIT. They are very snooty and high strung and tend to think they are the next big thing. Usually not the case. 
They all are magnificently dressed though. Sometimes to a fault because no one would be caught dead wearing sweatpants at FIT."
College Freshman,2,If you are in a computer class you will have access to Macs. If you need a computer outside of class you'll need to go to the computer lab. It is somewhat small and only has a few macs. This makes it hard during busy weeks like finals. You'll probably have to wait to get a spot.
College Junior,2,"It's the city, what should one expect? The parking lot behind the school, on 28th street, is rather expensive, and there are barely any parking spots on the school's street, 27th street, because they fill up very fast in the morning."
College Senior,2,"No one pays attention to sports at our school- but I think administration is trying to change that. We just got a new FIT Tigers logo, etc, but teams are still completely ignored."
College Freshman,2,"FIT has a reputation for really awful, rude, meat-packing-district-party girls (and guys) and it definitely lives up to its reputation. Lots of students are only interested in dropping names and following trends. However, I have also met some of my best friends here, so with the bad always comes some good!"
College Freshman,2,"It's basically fine if you're commuting, because there's not really much to do wrong there, but if you're dorming the ""strictness"" is pretty awful. The curfew and how you'll get shipped to the hospital if you come home drunk is simply ridiculous. When I was dorming I also hated how if I did something wrong none of the guards even told me I had a problem until it was time to fine me for it. This happened to my friends as well. For example, once one of my friends forgot her key to her room. She asked the guard for help so she wouldn't have to go retrieve the key since it was late at night. The guard happily agreed to unlock her door for her, but it wasn't until AFTER it was unlocked that my friend was informed that she was now to pay a fee of at least $15. If she'd known that, she would've just crashed elsewhere until she got her key back. Not very fair."
College Sophomore,2,"Clubs, Clubs, Clubs. It's very rare you'll find a party on campus. FIT is a dry campus."
College Senior,2,"Security is pretty tight in the buildings, which is good, but if you are living in the dorms it's absolutely ridiculous. You can't have an overnight guest stay over unless you sign them up at 4 pm that same day."
College Sophomore,2,theres girls soccer track and volleyball other than the dance team there isn't much sport teams.
College Senior,2,VERY DRY – We go to school in one of the most open cities in the world and we're a totally dry campus. It just doesn't make sense.
College Freshman,2,"No Dorm Parties, Just Clubs – There are basically no dorm parties at F.I.T because it's a dry campus and there are serious penalties if you get caught. The nightlife here is mostly going to clubs that you hear about from club promoters or older students just go to bars on the Lower East Side or around NYU."
College Sophomore,2,"Exactly What You'd Expect from a FASHION School – Since FIT is a fashion school I think the Athletics department is underwhelming compared to other schools. We do have a soccer and a volleyball team, but I've never seen them. I know our mascot is a tiger, and it took a lot of digging to figure that out. So if it's sports you're into maybe this isn't the right place. However, our gym equipment is excellent and clean. So, hey, if we had a football team at least we'd be able to say they'd have the best uniforms in town."
College Senior,2,Renting in NYC – NYC and the boroughs have many apartments rent is high. Try to get roomates
Alum,1,Professors are terrible human beings that enjoy making students feel inferior and worthless. The students are snobby and cliquey and WILL bully you if you are different. Do not recommend this school.
Alum,1,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE Administration and Customer service. AVOID If at all possible. My daughter graduated with honors and became a successful exec at age 27.....BECAUSE THERE WAS TWO MONTHS IN 2013 when our address changed and she missed 3 loan payments, only three, they negatively affected her credit rating and REFUSED to correct it even though they could. TO THIS DAY,almost 5 years later,  it still shows up as a negative on her credit rating. THIS SCHOOL IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST IN THE WAY THEY HANDLE CUSTOMER/STUDENT SERVICES..it is despicable. They are rude and they do not care for the reputation or well-being of the students after graduation. A SHAME that they get away with this. It is appalling"
College Senior,1,"Usually, leaving dormitory students are forced to move out on the day of Final exam. amazing!"
College Junior,1,Don't think we have Greek life at all.
College Senior,1,its a dry campus... what greek life
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,"Don't have greek life, which I'm happy about"
College Junior,1,"Does not exist. But we arnt here for house parties or sorority parties. We usually get together to talk about art and politics or drink free champagne at a gallery opening. This is not the school to go to if you are looking for a typical college experience. New York is your campus and you literally have thousands of options for places to party, but it's not gonna be the quarterbacks smelly basement."
College Junior,1,A lot of the times it is very unclear where our grades are coming from. Often I would have only two tests a semester with no homework or way to see my current grade. Teachers are also very unhelpful with academic concerns vexing that they are not formally teachers but rather just people with real life work experience. The registration process is infuriating because they require you to take very specific classes for your major at very very specific semesters but do not offer enough classes in order to meet the need. This results in fall behind which can get very overwhelming. It is impossible to get an appointment with an academic advisor around registration unless you book it 2 or 3 weeks in advance. More often than not my teachers have no idea what the answers are to a lot of the questions academically but they offer a lot of amazing real life advice. Academically I do not feel like I am getting my money's worth but at the end of the day you only need the school's reputation to get an amazing job and you just have to stick through it!
College Junior,1,This is absolutely not the school to go to if it is solely for sports purposes. This is the school you go to in order to experience the real world and be thrown into the fashion industry fully. FIT promotes health and fitness but rather focuses on things that will better your career instead of how to throw a ball around.
College Junior,1,I have never been so displeased. The schools dining hall is absolutely disgusting. I understand working there may not be the most glamorous job but the staff is so rude.
College Freshman,1,My school doesn't offer scholarships
College Freshman,1,"Barely any straight guys, everyone is a girl."
College Freshman,1,"Barely any teams, the teams that do exist, no one cares about them. School spirit is poor."
College Freshman,1,"The food is disgusting and options are limited. There is sushi, grill, deli, pizza or the special. There is no variety and most of the food tastes like crap. Starbucks is the only good thing about this school."
College Sophomore,1,Non existant at FIT. No men= no frats
College Sophomore,1,Not much in the way of athletics at FIT!
College Freshman,1,"There is no Greek Life at FIT. There are clubs and organizations, but no sororities or fraternities."
College Junior,1,I'm starting to think I'm just really unpopular because no one has parties in these dorms. You have to go to NYU if you want a good party but all the boys are thirsty as heck so watch your drink. And most of the clubs are 21+ so go get a fake if you want to go out one night.
College Sophomore,1,It's New York. I guess that's enough said.
College Sophomore,1,"We have very few athletic sports and even fewer people that participate. FIT isn't really an athletic school so it makes sense. We have personal gyms to work out in and I think two gymnasiums for group sports or sports classes but it isn't a huge part of FIT life. We also have 0 school spirit. Majority of the students here are career oriented and put more focus on that aspect of their lives, which is pretty typical for any FIT student. I think we all prefer to dip our toes in the pool of the fashion industry rather than concern ourselves with other school activities."
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life.
College Freshman,1,the connection is bad and there are not enough computers available. there is only one computer lab.
College Freshman,1,we do not have a greek system so it is irrelevant.
College Freshman,1,Its a struggle looking for roommates and apartments.
College Freshman,1,"Bad food, bad rooms, bad wifi, not a social campus, too expensive to live in NYC, TERRIBLE customer service from FIT and its staff, etc."
College Sophomore,1,We have no Greek life on campus.
College Freshman,1,"Its NYC, parking is hard to get!"
College Sophomore,1,"there is no greek life, but why does that matter, you are in a fashion school"
College Junior,1,Really the course-load is absolutely ridiculous (but worth the neurosis) for most majors except for FMM and maybe one or two others therefore they might be the only ones in clubs and extracurriculars such as sports. We have a mascot but school spirit is at like a 3/10
College Freshman,1,I was supposed to receive financial aid through working on campus but the jobs that were available were taken by students from the previous year. Jobs on campus even if they are a part of financial aid are not guaranteed and the financial aid office cannot help at all.
College Freshman,1,Its New York. There's barely anything thats inexpensive or affordable for college students.
College Senior,1,"I have yet to find an attractive guy worth my time on this campus. All of them seem full of it and on any drug possible. The girls might be okay but they all are a little dramatic for me as well as ""sluts"". Most just talk about having sex and drinking all the time."
College Senior,1,"Again, I am probably being harsh considering the campus is in the center of NYC. Most people that I know (myself included) don't dine on campus becuase there are so many options surrounding the campus. However, I did have a meal plan my freshman year. Compared to other schools our cafeteria is tiny and has a fraction of the options of other schools. There are some healthy options such as salads and sushi, but it gets boring eating the same meals over and over. Also, I am allergic to gluten and they recently added a very small selection of gluten free options, but they definitely have a lot of work to do in that department. The food is also pretty expensive if you do not have a meal plan. It is cheaper to eat off campus."
College Senior,1,"The campus is okay. The facilities are not the best, it is difficult to find an open computer and there are not many nice spaces to just hangout. I guess being that it is in NYC it is a bit different though because the city really is your campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I currently go to FIT, and anyone considering going there should know, that unless all you care about are trends and fashion and looking good, this school's social scene sucks. It's cool that it's in the city but it's like being on a runway all the time. It can be very intimidating to go up and talk to people or meet friends outside of your major. People are very competitive and closed off to conversations with strangers. There are barely any straight guys whatsoever. If you are more of an alternative person that doesn't care about mainstream trends and fashion, then it's very hard to find other people who share your views, let alone get them to talk to you or find the time to hang out with you. If you're looking for a real college experience, do not go to FIT, this school is great for someone who really cares about business and getting into ""the industry."""
College Freshman,1,"Way too strict. You have to sign people in online by 4pm if you want them to sleep over that night. Very few people drink because it is a dry campus, and if the security guards or some of the RA's know you are drunk they will call an ambulance."
College Junior,1,"I have been trying to get financial aid since I was accepted, and because I have been left alone on a lot of things that I feel I could use more help with, and now I may be dropped from my program due to non-payment."
College Sophomore,1,"There is almost no parking at FIT. And you don't need a car anyway, you are in the middle of the city!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not helpful would be an understatement – I was very disappointed at the quality of the campus housing at FIT. The rooms itself were fine, but the faculty (Resident Couselors, Resident Directors, etc.) were not understanding. I don't quite understand what their job responsibilities are if they don't even want to help their residents/students out."
College Junior,1,You Don't Drive in New York – its difficult even to get in when you are moving into the dorms. You definitely don't need a car. But the school is situated between the 1 train (7th ave) and ACE trains( 8th ave)
College Freshman,1,"It seems really hard to get financial aid, only a few students get any from the school, meanwhile a lot of students need help. I feel as though the students who are getting the aid don't actually need help."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Enjoy paying $20 per hour for parking! Sorry, not responsible for mystery dents and scratches"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Have Fun Now Kids, the Real World Is Coming! Disclaimer: I'm a life-long NYer. While many reviews here are from starry-eyed out-of-state students fulfilling their Sex and the City fantasy, you're getting a non-bs review from me.
Wow, so many A's here for FIT. Well congrats FIT, you brainwashed a generation and bankrupted their parents. 
So heres the scoop. I'm a recent grad at FIT and I will list the biggest problems that students will face after graduation from this school:
- If youre in business, leave this school. Any employer who sees ""Fashion"" Institute of Technology will dunk your resume, no matter how good it is in the shredder. I am not the only one that has noticed this, plenty of former classmates I know are going through this right now. 
- Changing majors? They will throw you under the bus if you even have the thought of doing so. Want to take that photo class as an elective? Forget about it
- Economic reality: A lot of professors here, especially in business fumigate the classroom with this air of ""what I do here will prepare you for the outside world"". I'm out here now, so are 10 others I know and still talk to. The professors, at least in the core classes are 10 years behind the rest of the world. Marketing majors should consider taking design courses (cause theyre axing graphic designers and marketing gotta pick up the slack) but of course, if you decide to take a design supplement course, they shut the door hard in your face.
Basically, theres a lot of red tape in this school that will hinder any chances of you achieving anything in the future except flipping burgers. If you are here at FIT, I suggest you write an apology letter to your parents of whats to come."
College Freshman,1,"It's all gay guys, and girls. Don't expect to come here and find any social life. The girls are mean, the guys are mean, you get judged up and down everywhere you walk."
College Freshman,1,"Lack of Variety – The food itself is pretty good, there is just very little variety. After the first month I was already sick of everything they offered."
College Junior,1,Some classrooms have nice computers and others do not. Accessing wireless access takes too long and printing on campus is expensive. We should be able to print for free.
College Senior,1,People dont drive in the city. There is a parking lot nearby but the hourly/day rate is outrageous.
College Sophomore,1,there is only one shuttle to and from the off campus dorms that only starts at 8pm.
College Sophomore,1,"it is NYC there is not much parking but a lot of parking garages. I would not suggest having a car here, you don""t need it."
College Sophomore,1,"Great Friends – FIT students are mainly female. As a female I think that it is almost impossible to find a guy at school. I have made a lot of great friends, however school has not been a place to find a significant other for sure."
College Freshman,1,"There are no actual athletic teams who compete and/or play big games like other colleges. However, we do have a homecoming game in the beginning of the year where the girls play volleyball and guys from another college are invited to attend the game."
College Freshman,1,Don't Bother – We are located in the middle of NYC. No car is necessary. Even if you drove to school you would pay 25 dollars to park for 4 hours in a local parking garage. There are trains all around and we are walking distance to everything.
College Senior,1,I am miserable in the rain and snow because I have to walk everywhere. Moving out of NYC soon!
College Senior,1,"Tehy Don't Get Enough Credit – I know we have teams and I know some of them aren't too bad, but they are often neglected and I never know when games are."
College Freshman,1,Good luck getting any scholarship or grant from FIT. they are the most money hungry school I've ever seen. You get charged for EVERYTHING
College Freshman,1,Things that set FIT apart from other colleges: gay guys in heels... extra bitchy girls with through the roof egos... and a lack of community-no one cares to get to know one another here (let alone talk in a class with ~20 people in it)
College Freshman,1,"New York City Campus – Gay night clubs are extremely big on campus.  So if you are not too fond of the gays or of being around catty girls, then this probably isn't the place for you...some of us find this out too late.  Me and my girlfriends can never find anywhere to hang out.  You'd think NYU, Fordham, or Columbia would be a good refuge...think again! Those schools have just as little to do as FIT! If you're looking for a school where people like to actually leave there rooms and have a fun weekend this place AIN'T for you."
College Senior,1,"If you ever need to print a paper before class, well don't count on it. Show up an hour early. You won't be able to find an open computer."
College Sophomore,1,Living in the Dorms – There are many rules when living on campus. FIT is a dry campus meaning not only you cannot have alcohol inside the dorms but you cannot enter intoxicated or the security will not let you in.

Senior,5,Mostly positive experience.  The great part of a small school is being being able to interact with your professors but being online has made that a lot harder.
Senior,5,"Excellent professors, mediocre dorms but apartments are good.  Rigorous coursework. Don't go for the food, but the food is really good."
Sophomore,5,"I love Hendrix. I am a California native, so going to a school almost all the way across the country has been tough, to say the least, but the faculty and staff at Hendrix have made it so worth it. I have always felt so very welcome and at home at Hendrix. It is the place to be!"
Freshman,5,"Hendrix is a hidden gem in the middle of Arkansas. Professors are all passionate about their material and small class sizes allow opportunities for students to clearly understand concepts. Campus is beautiful, with the new creative quad and art museum, and the old Martin and veasey halls, it is a picture perfect setting. And as far as sports go, for a division 3 school athletic facilities are extremely nice. The overall environment is very welcoming, Hendrix students are extremely nice and intelligent and will always invite you to parties with them. The party scene isn’t so bad either."
Freshman,5,"Hendrix is such a welcoming community full of extremely driven students! The faculty is especially wonderful, and they will do everything they can to help each student succeed! They genuinely care about their students, and it is refreshing how much they do! The student culture is amazing and fun while still being safe! The school is pretty small, and they do not have a lot of money to work with. Despite this, it is a great experience, especially for those in need of a lot of financial aid going into college!"
Freshman,5,"Hendrix is amazing! I love how many opportunity's it has for its students, it is really hard not to be involved in something! I quickly made friend's when i came to campus.  It has been more than I expected in terms of community and friendliness. Overall, so far, a rather enriching, challenging, and fun experience!"
Freshman,5,I have been accepted into Hendrix college back in December and it was a very easy process! Hendrix not only works with you greatly on financials but also the amount of help I got from campus financial aid was unlike anywhere else.
Niche User,5,"I absolutely loved Hendrix College when I went and visited a few months ago. All the people were welcoming, and the cafeteria was amazing. Right now, Hendrix is at the top of my list for colleges."
Niche User,5,"Hendrix intrigued me from my first visit. From the prestigious campus, a personal visit from the President Tsutsui himself while visiting with an advisor, and the challenging education Hendrix provides, it still has a sense of home. The Odyssey program incorporates hands-on experience, while the internships truly excite me. The opportunity is an elevated way to learn and to participate actively in your education. The student:professor ratio is great because you get one-on-one experience to help drive your success. It is remarkable to me how Hendrix strives to make sure everyone succeeds. I would love to call this place home."
Alum,5,"Hendrix pairs a rigorous academic experience with a tight knit community that made me feel right at home. The school places a premium on critical thinking, writing ability, and multidisciplinary, liberal arts education. Its Odyssey Program provided me with the tools and opportunities I needed pursue novel academic and professional development. The school did a terrific job of encouraging growth and nurturing my progress along the way. Hendrix’s faculty and staff are top tier professionals, but they are also deeply engaged in student interests and wellbeing. I had a terrific experience!"
Sophomore,5,"I love Hendrix! The campus culture is great, and there are tons of things to get involved with. The administration and teachers are amazing as well. While the traditional dorms are old and a bit run down, they are still vital to campus. Your freshman dorm becomes part of your school pride. The events on campus are fun and inclusive. School-sponsored parties are held at least once a month, and if those aren’t your thing there often alternative events going on. The campus is gorgeous, especially in fall and spring. Everyone is there to learn, but the environment feels more encouraging than competitive. Students push one another to be better. The school puts a focus on mental health as well, encouraging students to take care of themselves physically, mentally, and emotionally. Orientation week is one of the most fun weeks of the year, and the student leaders are awesome."
Sophomore,5,"Hendrix is home. The staff and students work together to create a cozy, accepting, supportive environment. One never feels forgotten in a classroom or out of place on the campus. Every space is made inviting, and every person is welcome."
Freshman,5,"I really like how important the students are to the teachers and how kind the community is. As a college freshman, it was very effective to have fellow peers who understood what it was like being away from home and studying. The classes prove to be a bit a difficult, but they are very effective in helping you learn, and there are plenty of resources in order to succeed."
Freshman,5,"This college has a great academic and athletic setting. For a small school, Hendrix knows how to do it big. There’s no other place I’d rather be."
Alum,5,"Hendrix was amazing. Very academically enriching, and I loved the small feel. But it wasn't too small! It was perfect and I miss it."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Hendrix so far is that it has been a lovely place to learn. In my first year at Hendrix I made more close friends than I did throughout all of high school, and entering the summer months it has been hard to let go of that constant support system. The faculty is for the most part kind and passionate. I have cried in the offices of multiple professors and was treated with nothing but empathy and understanding. The dorms are pretty dated, but when my friend and I wanted to room together mid-year the housing people immediately helped us do so. The small size also makes it a tough place for a rough break-up. I don't really have a solution to that one, but at least there's a disproportionally large gay population so people to choose from if you're like me :)"
Freshman,5,"Hendrix College is an amazing university that offers a rigorous academic environment, while at the same time has lots of social events and outlets! There is something for every person at Hendrix!"
Sophomore,5,"Hendrix is a great school with outstanding resources and staff, all ready to help you achieve your dreams."
Freshman,5,"I wouldn't go anywhere else. Could use some more financial aid, but overall a solid choice for academics and overall environment."
Sophomore,5,Great place to be an individual. Academics are exceptional and atmosphere is awesome. Lots of community support.
Sophomore,5,Hendrix is a place where the work/social life balance seems intertwined with the collage itself. The dorms are all old and are set to be renovated. Good is amazing. Staff are all wonderful.
Sophomore,5,I   love the diversity and the ability to be myself and feel comfortable around the other students.  I   love the academic challenge that Hendrix professors present to all their students.
Freshman,5,"I love the environment. Not only does Hendrix have a beautiful campus, but it also has great people. It's such a small school that you get a chance to meet most of the people that go here at some point, and they're all so friendly. You can be walking from one class to a next and can run into five different people to talk to. The teachers are also great and very encouraging. They try to adapt to your teaching style, and they truly care about each student's grade."
Alum,5,"It's a small school in a small Southern town so if you're looking for a bustling nightlife and and 20-story dorms, this school isn't for you. If you want to go to a school with great professors, a welcoming and tight-knit sense of community, and countless experiences to grow as a person, Hendrix is the place for you. I graduated in 2012, and without question the four years I spent there were the best of my life. So many friends, experiences, lessons, and memories that have profoundly impacted me and will stay with me forever."
Sophomore,5,"I love that Hendrix is small but gives you the full blown college experience as bigger colleges and universities. Hendrix offers a great education and one thing for sure, whom ever attends will leave this institution with a new perspective of everything they encounter. I have learned this and I have not even graduated yet. It is just my sophomore year but I know when it comes to education, Hendrix will prepare you for what ever field you want to go into."
Sophomore,5,"Hendrix is an amazing liberal arts college, and I value every second I spend on campus. The faculty and staff are amazing and so helpful. The only thing I don't absolutely love about Hendrix is the price tag."
Freshman,5,"I love Hendrix. I am a current freshman here and I have loved every moment. Orientation week makes you feel so welcome in a new environment, there's so much to do on and off campus! You will meet people of all walks of life so you don't have to worry about fitting in because you will surely find your place here. The academics are wonderful. I have not met a teacher that does not love their field of study and what they do. If you ever need help, office hours are held almost daily and most teachers will even give you their phone number in case you need to call them to ask a question. T The cafeteria staff is amazing and ultra-kind. They make an effort to learn your name and ask you about your day. Birthdays are a huge deal at Hendrix. We have a birthday song, the lunch staff comes out with a cake, and your friends throw you into the fountain (no matter the weather). Life at Hendrix is never dull and there's a place for everyone."
Alum,5,Loved it have fond memories. This college helped me prepare for my future. I had wonderful professors and great experiences. I always felt safe and part of a caring community.
Sophomore,5,"The school provides an incredibly supportive learning environment. Although small, which may leave you with limited options for professors or a huge choice in courses, most professors provide quality teaching and treat students with respect and understanding. The school administration provides a large support network beyond the assistance provided by professors through their classes."
Freshman,5,"If you need help with ANYTHING, people are there for you. That, the community, and emphasis on diversity/world views are the best things about Hendrix. It has really good food, its quirks, and a beautiful campus. Classes are great because there's a range from intro to really hard. It's a liberal arts school, so you have to take a bunch of different classes besides your major but that's great because it keeps things interesting and lets you find interesting things that you'd never think of taking otherwise. Some parties are majorly fun. Clubs throw a lot of events/parties that everyone is invited to. Here, you feel like you're being taken care of but at the same time growing up and you have lots of independence. Only complaints are the dorms are gross and hard to get out of after Freshman year, the town really sucks."
College Sophomore,5,"I have loved almost all my classes. My teachers have been passionate about their subjects and engaging in their teaching. Even the really challenging classes have shown me that every teacher really does want to see all of their students succeed. The choices for classes are diverse, many times it is hard to choose what to take because so many sound interesting. You are highly encouraged to take various types of classes to become a well rounded student."
College Sophomore,5,The campus is small so I am never really far from my dorm so I can get quickly back if I feel scared. But I don't usually feel scared on my campus. There are always others studying late in the library with you and you can always ask a guy to walk you back if you feel unsafe. We also have our own sort of campus cops that can drive you to your dorm if it is farther away or you feel unsafe. We have plenty of measures to keep us safe.
College Sophomore,5,"Hendrix was the best choice for me, personally. The atmosphere is that of belonging and mutual support. Its open minded values and small size make it feel like a second home. Hendrix is always welcome to those with an open mind for knowledge and inclusiveness. I knew Hendrix was the right choice for me even before I started my first day."
College Sophomore,5,"Hendrix is my home, I get homesick when I'm away."
College Sophomore,5,They have a classics program. Dr. Resinksi is my role model. I love everyone there and the environment is amazing
Recent Alumnus,5,I think a Hendrix education is a great investment.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Hendrix is a wonderful school. It has a great reputation and alumni network. The classes are rewarding, and the people are very interesting."
Recent Alumnus,5,We don't have it (and don't want it). The lack of greek life is one of the best things about Hendrix.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Hendrix is a wonderful place. The students are intelligent, and the classes are rigorous and rewarding."
College Sophomore,5,A degree from Hendrix College holds a lot of weight when looking for job/internship after graduation.  The majority of students will already have a job lined up before they graduate from Hendrix College.
College Sophomore,5,"Hendrix College has a variety of classes to take.  The classes are small so that the professors can spend quality time with students if they need extra help.  The diversity of the classes allow me to take different styles of classes, and also different cultures, etc."
College Sophomore,5,"The campus security are always driving around campus and keeping an eye open.  We have measures set up for text alerts when there are issues on campus.  Overall, I feel safe when I am on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"The athletics at Hendrix College are excellent.  They just added football a couple of years ago, and the team has done great.  The field is one of the nicest in the area.  They have baseball, softball, lacrosse, all kinds of different sports.  Fans attend just about all of these sports at home and many even travel to support the teams.  The athletics facilities are top notch.  Work out equipment is kept pretty new, and the facility is huge with all kinds of workout material."
College Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at Hendrix College has been wonderful.  It is one of the best schools in the region.  The administration really care that I succeed in my education.  I am always able to go and speak with my professors and my advisor.  They knew I needed more experience in writing papers and had me take Introduction to Writing, so that I could learn how to properly write papers.  I feel welcome in all the school buildings.  The students and staff are all warm and welcoming.  I am also able to play baseball for the College and that has been a good experience also.  I have learned to be a part of team and to also be a leader to other players.  If I had to do it again, I would choose Hendrix College as my school.  It is just an all-around wonderful College."
College Senior,5,I have grown into a better person and stronger student at college. I am free to be who I want.
College Freshman,5,"I came to Hendrix for an education, and to play lacrosse. I know that if I cannot play lacrosse again, I would still attend Hendrix."
College Sophomore,5,"Hendrix College is an incredible oasis of genuine hope in the midst of a beautiful Arkansas landscape. Hendrix encourages you to be fully yourself and gives each student the tools and opportunities they need to receive the best education possible. Hendrix makes it possible to do anything. The community is incredibly focused on service to the world as well as education that benefits everyone who comes in contact with it. A wide range of incredible degrees and professors that know you by name. A Hendrix experience is a personal one as well as an communal one. From the moment you walk on campus there is an aura of inclusiveness and community. I cannot say enough about how much Hendrix has changed my life and introduced me to the most incredible people. People are put off by its small size, but it is only a bonus. Having professors that know you and ask about how your life is going is priceless. I would go to Hendrix all over again, no regrets."
College Junior,5,"Hendrix College is a primarily residential school, and I am an untraditional student. I will be starting my junior year in a couple of months, and I have a two year old son. The balance has made school harder, but everyone there, from staff to students wants me to succeed. It really is a family there. Senior year of high school when my principal knew I was considering going, invited me to his office to convince me, and will still help me if I need anything. Some of the guys and ladies in the cafeteria have worked there for over thirty years, they learn your names, ask how you're doing, become friends with you, and consider you family. They recognize people that come back to visit 20+ years later, and one of them has even given me holiday gifts for my son. The Deans and President of the college are almost ALWAYS on campus, and come up and talk to students regularly. It's not unusual to see one of the deans with his kids playing a video game in the student area or the president and his wife, who is also a professor, walking their dog on campus when not at work. It's the same way with professors, and not unusual to be doing your workout with one of them. The school encourages you to explore new things and classes with it's collegiate requirements, and you meet a lot of people with different backgrounds. The school has several international students, and half of my class alone is from out of state. There's no shortage of things to do on campus, and between going to club sponsored events and department talks, you could almost get by without a meal plan or buying food. If you're having trouble in classes, there are plenty of tutors and professors will work one on one with you, and it's typically not hard to get an appointment. Since the class size is kept smaller you can't be lost in the system, and I know that despite whatever might be going on, I always have someone in my corner to help me succeed."
College Sophomore,5,We have a great variety of students on campus. Everyone is different and there are really no divides. We accept everyone for who they are and we all fit. There is a place for everyone here. Beautiful girls and hot guys.
College Sophomore,5,Parties are amazing! We have the best party scene plus every party is always in walking distance. There is drinking but there is no pressure to drink and thing never get too out of hand. Everyone really looks after one another here and we always have PSafe if needed. There is always a lot of dancing and socializing and great music. We have a bunch of themed parties which are pretty awesome.
College Sophomore,5,"The food is one of the best things about this campus. It is sooooo good and the caf workers are absolutely the best. I feel so at home and there are so many options. They serve everything under the sun!! If you have an dietary needs or allergies, there are no worries. I love the caf so much!!!"
College Sophomore,5,Hendrix is very expensive but the financial aid department does everything they can do to help out and make sure that every student has the aid they need and deserve. The process is very smooth and my mom and I never have any problems. They are very understanding and every student is treated as an individual and they are very understanding of everyone's situations.
College Sophomore,5,"Breakfast is essentially the same sunday through sunday except for Tuesdays and Thursdays. Lunch and dinner always include a great deal of variety, desserts are always delicious. Dinner is served every night except Saturday."
College Freshman,5,"The dining hall is such a wonderful facility. In all my college searching and visiting, I have never come across such a vibrant and fresh dining space."
College Senior,5,"Seriously, I can't imagine having gone anywhere else. If you want a top education from challenging, thoughtful, engaging and interesting professors, Hendrix has it. If you want to compete in a DIII sport that you love, Hendrix has it. If you want to be in any and every club, from service to languages to outdoors to cooking, Hendrix has it. And if you want to have the best four years of your life surrounded by the most welcoming, intelligent, kind and passionate people, Hendrix is the place to be......and we throw great parties too. And Hendrix will get you a job, or at least an internship, right out of college."
College Junior,5,Hendrix was recently recognized for its green initiatives- mostly for our LEED certified Student Life and Technology Center I bet.
College Junior,5,I LOVE THE CAF! Late-night caf is the greatest thing since sliced bread. The only downfall to the caf now is that they had to stop serving peanut butter due to a bad peanut allergy from one of the students.
College Junior,5,"Hendrix is an incredible academic experience. I was fortunate to come from a challenging high school, so the course load is not too much for me to handle. The material can be challenging but professors are always more than willing to help students with anything- inside the classroom or out. Most students study in the library at night, in the Burrow during the day, and out in the Pecan Court/Grove when the weather is beautiful."
College Junior,5,"I didn't encounter any problems from admission. I am going pre-med, and because the school is small I am able to get all the classes I need. For admission you just need to be a well rounded and diverse person."
College Junior,5,I really enjoy going pre-med. The workload is tough but very doable if you study hard. The counselors and school is very good with setting you up with job and internship opportunities. Many people who graduate from the school are able to find a good job and do what they want to do.
Freshman,4,"Right now I'm loving being at Hendrix & all my classes. Due to the pandemic, I have yet to be at the school in person but I can't wait."
Freshman,4,"The school has been doing it's best to keep everything going well online. It's handled the fact that we can't be on campus very well. Clubs are still going, classes are running smoothly, for the most part. There are some Tec issues but the help center is great. There is also a lot of help for students. BEST EXAMPLE IS THE WRITING CENTER."
Alum,4,"We had to switch to online-only due to the coronavirus pandemic. I think the switch was ungraceful, but I imagine administrators were doing all they could. Individual teachers were wonderful, though. Many expressed concerns about student well-being and were flexible in their approaches. I had an easier workload doing online than I would have had in-person."
Sophomore,4,"This was not an easy experience in general, but the professors at Hendrix tried their very best. Additionally, the school has been very, very communicative and supportive throughout this entire process."
Sophomore,4,"Coming from Hawaii, Arkansas was a big culture shock and on top of that, I was never able to go on a visit so I was going into it blind. When moving in and starting my first week, the students and faculty were very helpful and made me feel at home. I experienced true southern hospitality and made a lot of friends. There are a lot of resources for all students to use at their disposal and everyone there wants to help. The school is a very academic-focused institution and all of the classes and curriculum are challenging, even the ""easy courses."" The campus is really nice and rustic but everything is up to date. Conway is a college town but there really isn't much to do so it helps you to focus on improving yourself. Hendrix is quite a small college with a pretty small student population, but that means very little lecture halls and a good teacher-student ratio."
Freshman,4,"Hendrix has such a beautiful campus and such great faculty. I loved all of my courses and almost all of my professors. I had so much fun my freshman year; there are lots of fun parties, clubs, and events. The food is excellent, and there is a good variety of it. The only thing I don't like is that a good portion of the student body is very rich and entitled; Hendrix is not a cheap school, and as a lower middle class student, it was hard to find a group where I fit in and felt understood. However, there are some really amazing people attending Hendrix, and the campus and classes make a little struggle completely worth it."
Sophomore,4,"Hendrix College is a very welcoming environment with an overall very friendly student body. The professors are incredible, and the preparation for a future career in anything is tangible."
Freshman,4,"I have had a great experience at Hendrix so far. The academics are challenging, which is what I was expecting, and most professors are very good at teaching and approachable. I have no problem getting help when I need it. I definitely would have chosen a different college if I hadn’t received so many scholarships, though, due to the cost of attendance."
Alum,4,"Hendrix is a politically liberal private liberal arts college in central Arkansas. I met some fun, creative, and intellectual people there. The classes were challenging and engaging and there were some interesting out-of-the-box courses. The school could improve in terms of integration/diversity. The Creative Writing program was good, but there were a couple small aspects of the thesis program which bothered me."
Freshman,4,"Hendrix college is a fun and safe environment to lots of different students. The small town feel but with a lot of people is an awesome feeling, when going to Walmart you will definitely see someone you know. Thats one of the things I love about Conway."
Junior,4,"Hendrix College has incredible academics, passionate professors, excellent extracurricular opportunities, a strong alumni network, and a friendly, yet competitive, atmosphere. There is a clear ""Work Hard, Play Hard"" mentality among the students here. Professors take personal interests in their students, and the rigorous course loads pay off in spades. Hendrix College can be way too stressful at times, but at the end of the day, there are plenty of resources to help those in need of stress relief. The student housing for underclassmen, however, is abysmal. The dorms are not in the best shape, but there are plans to renovate in the next 5 years. The student Quad is better, yet the walls are so thin you can hear the student above you sneezing. The apartments are better, but they are sometimes a crap-shoot. Overal, the summer opportunities, Odyssey Program, academics, decent level of financial help, and extremely liberal atmosphere makes the high price tag worth it."
Niche User,4,"I liked the fact that Hendrix have a small class size, and as result, talking to professors directly much easier."
Junior,4,The professors at this institution are some of the most intelligent and thoughtful people I know. The students are some of the most diverse and hard-working. The campus is close-knit and beautiful.
College Sophomore,4,I've not yet had the pleasure to go to the career center on campus as I have only completed my freshman year so far. But I know upperclassmen that are more confident than not that they will find a job after school. A lot of students go on to grad school and I know that most students get into a good grad school because of their diverse education at Hendrix.
College Sophomore,4,We're seen as the best school in Arkansas so i think a degree from HDX will be beneficial
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms aren't in the best condition, Im pretty sure mine is filled with mold and we don't have sinks in the rooms. However, the environment and the way that we feel like a family more than makes up for it."
Recent Alumnus,4,I always feel safe on campus.
Recent Alumnus,4,"While many students are athletes, Hendrix has much more of an academic than athletic vibe."
College Sophomore,4,It's not the most racially diverse but pretty accepting for the most part.
College Sophomore,4,"The professors care about the students, the classes are challenging and subjective grading in subjects like English, make it difficult to get A's."
College Freshman,4,The professors are very helpful and the courses are a little challegnge
College Freshman,4,Health and safety are adequate. Just like anywhere in the world you can't be 100% safe
College Freshman,4,"Housing is very available, but it is school housing so there really isn't much to expect"
College Freshman,4,I don't like exercise so I don't really use the athletic facilities
College Freshman,4,The people are very friendly. I would choose to go here again because I really like the atmosephere
College Freshman,4,"PSAFE might not seem super active on campus, but I've never felt unsafe here. My best friend lives all the way across campus so there's been a ton of times where I'll have to walk back to my dorm late at night alone. During finals, they offer rides from the library back to your dorm at night which is pretty cool."
College Freshman,4,"As a freshman I haven't had too much experience with this, but from what I hear it's pretty good!"
College Freshman,4,"All my classes have been under 25 students so far. All my professors have been insanely kind and welcoming. They truly want you to come talk to them, and see you succeed."
College Freshman,4,"I love this place! I came in from out of state and not knowing anyone. With the orientation (you take a 3 day trip) I made some great friends i feel confident I'll know for life. Everyone is very accepting and welcoming. I can't imagine myself anywhere else. Also I know for some, Arkansas might be a turn off (I'm not from here and was hesitant myself to come) but it really shouldn't be! It's so much more beautiful than I expected and fall was amazing."
College Freshman,4,I feel pretty safe on campus and have never felt endangered.
College Freshman,4,I have really enjoyed my classes and professors thus far.
College Freshman,4,I love being a part of a varsity sport. The facilities are amazing and the coaching is amazing. I wish that more students payed attention to the varsity sports teams on campus.
College Junior,4,"Hendrix is a wonderful institution which seeks to live up to the moto of ""unto the whole person"". The professors are interested in their students success inside and outside of the classroom, they invest their time into ensuring that we as students succeed. If I could re do the college experience from freshman year to now, I would do the same thing."
College Freshman,4,"I love Hendrix. It is an amazing community full of wonderful people. My only issue is the cost. Hendrix is expensive, but the administration works hard to make it affordable. Looking back I wish I had considered the cost a little more, but I am glad I decided to attend Hendrix. I have made friends that I will keep with me for a long time."
College Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love living on campus. The dorms are typical dorms with the regular college amentities. I live in Veasey Hall and the social atmosphere is simply amazing. The sense of community is great. Everyone knows everyone and if you ever need anything or need someone to talk to, there is always someone. The RA's are amazing and very helpful and sweet. I think it is very clean."
College Freshman,4,Hendrix recently built a new athletic facility and it goes above and beyond in offering students options.
College Freshman,4,"Despite some behavior on the weekends, campus life is great. Students are happy, the staff are friendly, the buildings are clean, the landscaping is top-notch, and the Hendrix Village is a thriving area. It can be a bit expensive once everything is said and done but it is a wonderful school nonetheless."
College Sophomore,4,The openness to everyone having a good time and being a college student is great!
College Senior,4,"When it comes to respect, support and appropriateness, the admins are fairly involved, but so are the students. We take pride in welcoming all types of people and being supportive to everyone. We, as students and admins, also take pride in keeping our campus progressive and attuned to student's personal and social interests and issues."
College Senior,4,"At Hendrix, it is definitely work-hard play-hard. We take our academics seriously, but we take our parties seriously too. Most parties have themes and while we have our favorite traditional themes, people always come up with new ones every year."
College Senior,4,"I feel safe on-campus and even when I walk back to my apartment at night from the library, especially with the new late-night escort policy."
College Senior,4,"I don't live off-campus, but I have a few friends who share a house and enjoy it. Lots of house shows and local bands are at the off-campus locations. Good options for living near by but mostly houses to rent within a 5-10 minute walk, but most people bike."
College Senior,4,"Conway seems hard to get used to freshman year, but as you get used to the area, you will really start to love it! Lots of great hiking and outdoor spots within a 30 minute radius and Little Rock is so close!"
College Sophomore,4,"There is always something to do on campus, such as movies, dances, or parties."
College Sophomore,4,A lot of the students are really nice and friendly.  There are quite a few good looking guys.
College Sophomore,4,"Toad Suck Daze is a huge event here in Conway,  the shopping is pretty good as well."
College Sophomore,4,Most of my professors have been really nice and are really good at teaching the subject they teach.
College Sophomore,4,The academics are very challenging but the professors will help you especially if you ask them.
College Sophomore,4,"The workload is just enough, all of the professors are really nice in the business department."
College Sophomore,4,There have been a few problems with someone taking offence to something that was said or done.
College Sophomore,4,"Hendrix is a pretty safe campus, but I am still scared to walk across campus by myself at night."
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of great places to eat out with friends.  Cactus Jack's is a good Mexican place that my friends and I like to eat at.
College Sophomore,4,You should apply for every scholarship or grant that you can.
College Sophomore,4,"The school is strict on some things, but they are looking out for the students."
College Sophomore,4,The apartments are close to campus and parking and safety are really good.
College Sophomore,4,I plan to have an internship later on to help me in my future career as a business person.
College Junior,4,"Conway is growing and so are the food options. There still isn't much, but if you venture over towards UCA and other parts of town, there's some good stuff. And if you're really wanting great food, just make the 30 minute drive into Little Rock for Big Orange."
College Junior,4,"I wouldn't trade my experience at Hendrix for the world. It's the perfect fit for me. That being said, Hendrix isn't the perfect fit for everybody. There is a pretty big acceptance rate, but once you get here, the classes aren't high school anymore. The professors challenge you and they push you to take as many opportunities as you get."
College Junior,4,"I got an internship through my own connections at home, but once I had to register it with the student career services office, everything went smoothly there. The online class over the summer was kind of rough, but that's just because I wasn't really in ""school"" mode."
College Junior,4,I honestly don't even remember going through the process because it went so smoothly.
Alum,2,"Conway AR was and is a high violent crime, high poverty town.

Hendrix has few majors which may limit your career choices as it did me.

I found Hendrix to have very little name recognition beyond the borders of AR.  When I moved out of state this became a big hurdle at job interviews where I was competing against graduates from better known schools.

For me, the faculty was so-so.  I certainly had some very good professors, but the bad ones made up for them.

My dorm room was terrible.  It looked like a jail cell sans toilet and bars.

I thought the student body was very cliquish.  Luckily, I was from a nearby town and could always escape Conway and Hendrix on the weekends.

There are just too many other schools that either don’t have these negatives or don’t have them to the same degree including the Big Ten university where I attended graduate school . . . no thanks to Hendrix.  If I had it to do over I would have gone somewhere else."

Sophomore,2,Small class sizes though not particularly challenging. I would like to see a better variety of course options. Student body is not diverse and professors even less so. About all there is to do off campus is see a movie.
Freshman,2,My classes and professors have been fine but not enough to make up for the issues around campus. Lack of lighting around the paths and landscaping make the winter time darkness pretty scary. Everyone knows where the drug dealers loiter around the perimeters. Administration ignores complaints. The location is pretty remote as well with poor public transportation.
College Freshman,2,"Professors are hit or miss, courses are a bit hard to get into, and applying for classes is a pain in the ass."
College Freshman,2,"The internet and wifi is absolute garbage. The rooms of the dorms are filthy, and the rooms are small."
College Freshman,2,"There is an athlete's only gym, and then a regular gym, which has no full power racks, lacks resistance bands, is mostly cardio machines, and lacks enough weight."
College Sophomore,2,"P safe are usually rude to students, and don't do a good job of making us feel safe"
College Senior,2,"-Hendrix is a residential campus, so you HAVE to live on campus all four years unless you apply to live off campus. Applying to live of campus is difficult because Hendrix is currently broke, so we need the money from students living on campus.

-Dorms are disgusting. Most have active black mold that the campus won't deal with. Galloway is a historical site, so everything that is broken (which is the whole entire building), can't be fixed. Everytime it rains your closet is wet because the roof is leaky, the air conditioners are always broken, the floors are rotting, etc.

-The Village apartments are the only apartments that come furnished, which is really nice. All the others are not furnished, AND don't have washer/dryers anywhere in the complexes, so you have to go somewhere else on campus to do laundry. The Huntingdon/Clifton apartments are backed up against some questionable houses/neighborhoods and are frequently burglarized. These apartments were broken into over the summer by a student and a girl was tazed, raped, and all of her stuff stolen.

God bless if you come to HDX, it's falling apart."
College Freshman,2,"The town views Hendrix students as the smart ass rich kids, and thus there is quite a bit of animosity towards the students.  The town adamantly advertises welcome and discounts for UCA students, but Hendrix is ignored entirely.  There is quite literally nothing to do in town.  Little Rock, the capitol, is a 30-minute drive away, and offers some entertainment and escape from the monotony that is Conway."
College Freshman,2,"The town my college is located in does not have public transport, nor an active taxi service (that I am aware of).  College transportation is limited to an airport shuttle that only operates during major holidays."
College Sophomore,2,Other than on campus parties there is little else around without going into little rock. 
College Sophomore,2,There are not many nice off campus housing options available. However the campus run apartments are fairly priced and some are really nice.
Recent Alumnus,2,Not many people live off campus so many of the nicer options are closer to UCA.
College Sophomore,2,"Hendrix does have a lot of diversity, but you should think more along the lines of quality not quantity. Diversity among ethnic or racial lines is average, but there are a lot of different people here with different experiences, places, and backgrounds.
The overwhelming majority of students are white, but there are several international students and minority students. Hendrix is also accepting and very liberal for the most part as well as. I think most students are from the lower - upper middle class and beyond and democrats."
College Sophomore,2,"What It's Like in Downtown Conway – Conway is a relatively small town with the nearest mall being 30 minutes away.
Hendrix is walking distance from downtown Conway in which one would find small shops, restaurants, and a couple of new bars. During May there is a Toad Suck festival which is like a small carnival in which the whole community is invited."
College Freshman,2,"Well, the guys are intelligent, but there aren't many to choose from.  Surprisingly, a lot of them are Autistic...  Attractiveness ranges from unattractive to average.  There are a few gorgeous men out there, but they are extremely rare...as are generally attractive guys.  I wouldn't try to find a husband here, but you'll definitely make a few good friends."
College Freshman,2,"Fast Food and More Fast Food – Basically everything is fast food...I mean, we are in the South.  However, there are two Chinese buffet-type restaurants and some good Mexican places...well, actually one called La Huerta.  Another good place is Due Amiche ($2 pizza!), an Italian restaurant.  You can also find the typical Chili's, T.G.I. Friday's, etc, but that's a wee bit expensive for the average college kid.  Oh and some places give you a student discount, but all places will have a UCA (University of Central Arkansas) ""Paint the town purple"" poster and....basically nowhere supports Hendrix with posters and whatnot."
College Junior,2,"Public Trasportation – there is no bus, no subway in Conway, you need to have a car or at least a bike to survive in Hendrix"
College Freshman,2,"There are lots of computer labs across campus, and the main one in the library is open 24/7, so you can still get things done if you don't own a computer. Printing is generally quick and you don't need print credits or anything, and double-sided is encouraged to save paper. Wireless access is technically available all over campus, but it's pretty slow (although if you get an ethernet cable in your room, it's not as much of an issue). Our IT services are not good at all. They are slow to respond and if your laptop breaks, it takes them a week to get it back to you, and it's not even fixed. Luckily there are several reliable computer shops around town."
College Freshman,1,Very lenient alcohol and drug policy. Drugs are taken at the edge of campus in full view for any to see.
College Freshman,1,"The alcohol policy is extremely relaxed, and poor lighting makes it very easy to get away with things, and rather dangerous on campus."
College Freshman,1,I don't enjoy parties and avoid them at all costs.
College Sophomore,1,"Public transportation is nonexistent in Conway, and Hendrix does not provide regular transportation either. The only exceptions are airport shuttles the school provides for breaks, but even those have limited spots for students travelling over break. On the bright side, many students at Hendrix are willing to offer rides, and carpooling is a great way to meet people from the same area as you."
College Senior,1,"While most students live on campus and parking is not really a big deal. Finding a spot near your dorm or building can sometimes be a nightmare.  The campus needs more parking, but they sacrifice this in order to encourage green space."
College Freshman,1,"While there are many religions and ethnic groups represented at Hendrix, a vast majority of the student body is white."
College Senior,1,No Drinking – the kids will peer pressure you into drinking if you never did it before they are going to say this looks cool and you suppose to do this when you really dont
College Sophomore,1,"Watch Out for Psafe and Ras – You really don't want to be caught doing any sort of drugs or drunk while in a public space by PSafe. The RAs also know your name and where you live and will report you, you could be put on probation or if living in a substance free house, lose your housing."
College Freshman,1,"Basically Non-Existent – It's super convenient to have your own car at Hendrix and Hendrix even encourages students (including freshman) to bring their own car.  If you don't have a car, you have to sign a waiver to remove the parking fee.  There is no transportation provided by Hendrix besides shuttle buses on designated breaks (Thanksgiving, winter, etc.).  However, these shuttle buses are $10 and there are maybe one or two.  Most students drive, have a bike, longboard, or a combination of the three.  The campus is super easy to get around, so you can easily walk to any of your classes (It's about a 10 minute walk to the other side of campus), so there isn't much to worry about.  I don't have any form of transportation besides walking and I get around fine.  Everything is pretty close and you can always get a ride with someone (even though it may be a little annoying at times).  I suggest a bike."
College Sophomore,1,"Not a Sports-Driven Place – We have a great athletic facility, but organized sports aren't a big part of campus life. People don't come here to play sports, they come here to do well academically. That's not to say we don't have talented athletes, because we certainly do. There just isn't a major drive on the part of the student body to go to games. None of our teams are really stellar anyway; most, if not all, had losing seasons this year."
College Freshman,1,"At Hendrix, almost everyone is white and the minority students tend to all band together and isolate themselves. Most students at Hendrix aren't very religious but those that are take it pretty seriously. Politically, almost everyone is liberal and if you aren't you will definitely attract some negative attention if you make your views known."
College Senior,1,Cultural Events – there is really no significant cultural events. the town is boring.

Junior,5,"I have took all my courses online, I currently am taking 15 units, so five classes, and they all seem to go pretty well. My professors have accommodated their switch very good, they have been using zoom, and youtube mostly, but they also bring in guest speakers from all over just because with internet all we have to do is provide a link. I think online learning is harder then if I were to attend the campus just because the pressure is on me. I have to time manage a lot, especially since my classmates, and myself don't know each other. Fresno State has done a good job with the switch, and I enjoy the courses I take. Sometimes it gets lonely, just sitting at home in my room with my laptop and it sometimes puts a strain on my mental health, but I push through it. I want to get my degree, I want to have my education so I need to be someone who can adapt so what's going on."
Junior,5,"Unfortunately my only option are online classes, however so far I am actually enjoying them. My teachers are actually  very helpful and are not intimidating, so asking questions and getting clarification on certain assignments is pretty easy."
Junior,5,"My experience with Fresno State thus far can be summarized in the word Awesome. Fresno State is a robust campus both physically and virtually. The campus promotes great gender equality seminars and advising sessions both on and off-campus. It also offers a friendly environment that genuinely respect freedom of religion. We also have a great sport culture and incredible players with national rankings. Currently, the campus and most of my professors are coping well with the pandemic. The university is doing its best to adjust with COVID-19 by offering students many free and accessible options of benefits such as technology lending service at the library, peer-tutoring online or on campus according to arrangement, and partnerships with leading tech corporations and services that offer students low-cost solutions for educational tools."
Junior,5,"Online courses are getting on great. The best thing about this experience is how students and teachers are collaborating closely together without hesitation or reservation. At the Craig School of Businesss, specifically, students and teachers are incredibly open to each other about everything, especially solutions to business assignments. We are quick to adapt to the new demands of the pandemic, and are always ready to take on challenges that comes with new innovation. While we may disagree on a lot of things, most of our disagreements are helping us getting closer to the real issues of online learning, thus provide us a vivid canvas of our mission and goals."
Freshman,5,"The professors are there in case I need some extra help with some things I may not have understood during the class . Even though classes are online, that hasn't stopped me receiving good grades. I like to stay on top of all my assignments. All the information that my professors are teaching is really fascinating. The college learning experience is way different that the high school learning experience. There is a more wide variety of information to learn. Even though this online college experience isn't what I expected, I am trying to make the best out of it."
Freshman,5,"I love the teachers and I am learning so much information I previously did not know about. I didn't expect my college experience to be onlin, but I do not mind it. I try to stay on top of all my assignments to not get behind on any work. If I feel like I get behind on any work, then I feel like I don't do as good of a job and I don't like that. This is a college experience I didn't expect to have but all the Fresno State professors are there for you whenever you need help. When I send an email, they respond with detailed information explaining what I may not understand and they are even available for private zoom meetings to help you out with whatever you are stuck on. Fresno State has made my college experience one to remember."
Senior,5,The school cares deeply to see students graduate. They care to make sure all students are taken cared of
Freshman,5,What I like the most of California State University Fresno is the diversity and the staff members and people that make you feel connected and in a family.
Junior,5,"There are many resources and ways to get involved around campus. I also feel that there is a strong sense of pride among the students, it is a great school to study at."
Junior,5,"I have had a great experience with online learning, my professors have been very understanding and patient."
Sophomore,5,Fresno State is beyond the great for many reasons they provide the students on campus many resources that will help us on our personal life and educational wise. Being a sophomore this year just gives me the wanting to never having to be consider a alumni. The involvement for students is far beyond the great they many clubs and organizations to meet new people and find our passions within ourselves.
Junior,5,I really love how helpful all the professors and advisers are. When I first got my job the orientation time conflicted with one of my classes and I had a test to do and my professor was really understanding and didn't mind if I ran a little late and I found that to be super helpful.
Senior,5,"I transferred in as a junior standing student, so I cannot speak for anything beyond the Lyles College of Engineering, but that department is fantastic. The vast majority of the staff take their jobs very seriously, but still know how to have a good time while providing instruction. There are also a wide range of research opportunities available for undergraduates and graduate students alike."
Senior,5,"With COVID-19 in place, California State University - Fresno went completely remotely. The transition was frightening, and there were a lot of questions that I had about what would happen next for students. However, the transition was very smooth, and all of my professors were very helpful with any questions and concerns that I had."
Senior,5,"Overall, California State University - Fresno has been a pleasant experience. I admire the diversity that is present on campus, and I also admire the staff. There are a lot of clubs and activities that occur on campus, which can accommodate every student."
Senior,5,Great university! Awesome resources and environment. All campus is student centered and focused on success
Senior,5,Stressing but professors work hard to make it function n flow smooth they ask for a lot of feedback n very understanding
Freshman,5,"I like how fun it is, it’s a bit diverse but the athletics and programs are kind of cool. Fresno State has a lot of reliable resources, their housing is great!!"
Freshman,5,"I am just now starting college at Fresno State currently trying to change my major to Nursing, because I plan to be a Nurse Practitioner!! Overall, I haven’t gotten to talk to some Professors. The Principal of Fresno State is pretty awesome!!"
Alum,5,"I did not take any courses online at California State University, Fresno. However, I have had friends who did take classes online and they enjoyed it. They were able to learn a lot at their own pace and they were able to successfully pass their online classes."
Junior,5,"I like the diversity of the campus, you feel like you belong. Everyone is nice and polite. There are a lot of resources for students in terms of academics and student life. There are so many ways you can get involved on campus such as clubs, student organizations, and on-campus student jobs. They have many events for students to find opportunities outside of campus and programs to help students and a center for undocumented/dacamented students."
Junior,5,Fresno State is a great school! Great campus and awesome professors! I highly recommend this college!!
Freshman,5,I really enjoyed my dorm experience. Everyone there was very nice and helpful when I had any questions. This really helped me reach out and make connections on campus and made the high school to college transition very easy.
Freshman,5,"Fresno State is a great university that brings many different opportunities to students. Also, this university is all about diversity and makes students feel welcomed and comfortable. There are many different departments for students to choose from and there is also much assistance from individuals that help and support students to what they want to succeed and achieve on. Fresno State overall is such a great university and there are many different activities to do and to have fun!"
Senior,5,"As an Agriculture Education major, I could not have asked for a better faculty and staff. From professors to farm techs, to students and SI leaders. Everyone tired to the Jordan College of Agriculture Science and Technology is driven by our community. If you come to Fresno State,  to learn and be prepared for career, you will do just that.  You will also make relationships, both professional and personal, that will last a lifetime."
Freshman,5,What I liked about Fresno State was that it was a home like campus it isn't to big where you can get lost the first day and were you can walk to your class. Another thing is the Library its every useful and has many useful factors. Something I would change would be the foods some they should add more.
Freshman,5,"I was nervous in the beginning, but everyone from the professors to the follow students made it easy to relax. One of my favorite things about the campus is that it feels like a community and it takes the weight off my shoulders whenever I tend to feel homesick. And they never fail to remind us of the many resources we have throughout the campus. They have someone who specializes in mental health all the way to sports. Any question you have can be answered by someone and that makes it a lot easier to get through the year, especially since I am a first year college student. Overall my year has been great so far. there is always someone willing to help me and always someone to reach out to. They have really made it easier to get used to the new environment and I am really excited for the future years that I have to come."
Sophomore,5,Fresno State is place filled with diversity. Many different students with different backgrounds. This is a place filled with different perspectives and great ideas. If your coming to the U.S. from a different cournty or if you want to learn more about other cultures this is the place to go!
Niche User,5,I went to visit Fresno sate on a college tour and it was amazing! The library was great and my tour guide was very informative. I got to watch a basketball game and Fresno won. The band was very good and so were the cheerleaders.
Junior,5,I am enjoying my time at Fresno State. I met my boyfriend in my criminology class. I started off bad my first semester and then over time completly changed my grades and turned my life around.
Niche User,5,What i love about Fresno State is how diverse the school is. They have a variety of majors that range in all branches of careers. The tour guides and direction staff are very helpful in helping new comers find out places to go. The campus is also very clean and under control when it comes to tagging or landscaping.
Freshman,5,"As a freshman at Fresno State this year, I absolutely love this campus. It offers a variety of student directed clubs and programs that encourage students to get involved and give back to the community. Fresno State has an incredibly diverse campus and promotes cultural acceptance and awareness to every one of their students. Not only is it a safe and welcoming space for students of all different backgrounds, it is also an outlet for students of the LGBTQ+ community to feel comfortable and accepted in their own skin. Overall the environment this campus has to offer makes me proud to be a bulldog, and I'm excited for my next 4 years as a Fresno State Student. One thing I would like to see changed at Fresno State is new and improved buildings and classrooms. It's a fast growing campus, and several of the classrooms have been worn down for the past couple years. A new and improved classroom environment makes students more encouraged to learn, and motivated to do their very best."
Niche User,5,I never been to Fresno State but I plan to go there when I grow up because it has the majors I want to major in to fulfill my life when I go there. I would want to be a RN when I grow up and Fresno State has that career in their pathways. By the time I get there I hope I can succeed and go on into working as an RN. It would be an amazing experience and moment in my life. Everytime I wake up I would know that I get to save people's lives and meet new people eventually and live my life to the fullest.
Niche User,5,"I like the cleanliness of the campus. I wish the food, specifically the fast food, on campus was better."
Niche User,5,I heard it's a really good college.  Their campus seems really nice. I visited it once because I applied there for college so hopefully I'll get in and it is my dream college.
Freshman,5,My experience at Fresno state has been remarkable. I never thought I was going to fit it but I found myself my second home. Meet great people and I’m excited to continue to continue my journey at Fresno.
Niche User,5,When I went to visit the campus of Cal State Fresno I had an amazing experience. They had a very beautiful campus and it was amazing to experience a new campus outside of the one's I've usually seen. I was interested to moment I stepped on to campus and I hope to one day attend that school. Fresno State opened my eyes to many other opportunities outside where I live.
Freshman,5,"As a current student at California State University Fresno, I am overjoyed to see the amount of help they offer to students. They offer various resources to help students who are struggling with any subject. They not only care about our academic readiness, but also about our mental health. Caring about mental health should be the number one priority of any college. I admire Fresno State for offering free consultations to students. As a student, I know the internal struggles we face daily. Which is why it is important to take care of ourselves, and Fresno State values that. I am glad I chose this school because I love that they are student-focused and that they truly do care for us."
Niche User,5,"A great community to be part of, lots of things to do around the school. Overall was a great experience and I would let to go back to their in the future."
Niche User,5,When I visited this campus it was very nice and welcoming. I felt like it was somewhere I can belong. The general population seemed great and everyone I communicated with where very friendly and made me think twice about wanting to attend there next year.
Junior,4,"I transfered into Fresno State in August 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. I think Fresno State made it feel as a university should feel. Since it is my first semester there, we had Dog Days online and it turned out fine. I got to zoom meet a lot of people, we had an online welcome transfer party. I got to meet Victor, our mascot Bulldog. They are doing the best they can in a pandemic, so there is not much I can complain about. It was a smart idea to close campus right when the pandemic hit, or who knows how many students would have caught the virus. My experience is probably like everyone else's, we are just trying to pass our classes, and get our degree. I can't describe much else since I never been on campus, or attended a football game, but overall for online it feels like i'm homeschooled by a university."
Alum,4,"I liked the price and the professors . I loved the academic material. Nice campus, very outdated classrooms, stale hand soap"
Alum,4,Good structure for the online classes. Lots of work in them but it’s nice you can do it on your own time
Sophomore,4,Fresno State was a pretty good school overall. The campus is a bit old compared to the other CSU but is under construction.
Sophomore,4,"After switching to online learning, all of my professors were able to navigate the course pretty well."
Senior,4,The online learning experience has been a challenge but all the professors are starting to get better working online
Freshman,4,"So far my online learning experience has been very good, the only bad things about it is that students don’t get to make a connection with other classmates or meet new people in person."
Sophomore,4,Meanwhile during this pandemic we moved to virtual learning. So far online classes are going great my professors are being patient and giving us gaps of time to turn in an assignment. Before going online the classes in person were great just being involved in student life was a great motivation to keep grades up and be focus with our classes.
Junior,4,Fresno state is a nice campus with many resources for students. It has a big library and tutoring center and other resources that are beneficial for students.
Alum,4,"California State University, Fresno was a beautiful campus that provided many resources for students to receive help. Many of the professors were respectful and helpful when teaching their students as well."
Junior,4,The professors are still learning. They are doing their best and I am grateful for it. I feel like online learning needs to be a little more hands on and immersive though.
Junior,4,"Admin needs to think about their students are STUDENTS who are trying to learn and advance in their future, not just moneybags. Otherwise, a great community with excellent professors."
Junior,4,"I did not start taking online classes until the campus got shut down because of the global pandemic. Though it was a rough transition, almost all of my professors helped make things a little easier for us students. They were very flexible and understanding, which made my personal experience with online schooling quite nice."
Junior,4,"As a year 3 pre-nursing student, I have had a great experience! There are so many resources that aim to help and involve students on and off campus. My favorite being USU Productions! I also love and attend SI sessions for some of my harder classes. The SI leaders are almost always super helpful and friendly! If I had to change one thing, it would be how hard it is to get into some classes that students need to stay on track. Most pre-nursing students have to wait a semester or two for a class they need to open up, and I found myself in that position many times. Other than that, most of the teachers that I have had have been so helpful and understanding. I would, and do, highly recommend this school to anyone wanting the real ""college experience""!"
Junior,4,"During this time the online learning experience was not as bad as expected. Most teachers are very willing to help and help with whatever it is you need to relearn or do. However, there are a few that did not make so much input or the effort to guide your learning. If you are someone that gets distracted easily, loses track of time and assignments, or simply does not work well on technology it may be a little difficult to get through the course."
Senior,4,"The professors in the Psychology department are so great! I started off as a Child and Family Sciences major and ended up switching over to Psychology. I was so nervous about it, but the professors made me feel okay and I also realized that this was definitely the right major for me. There are also so many beneficial services for the students. Everyone I have come across who works at this school is very dedicated to the students no matter what their path looks like. I was very hesitant about transferring over to Fresno State from Fresno City, but it is such a great place to be and I am so grateful I am able to attend the school."
Junior,4,"The university, as far as I know, has well-versed instructors that care for your education and future. They really encourage their students to aim higher than what is considered normal. That is good for my case as I am aiming for an out of the city career. The only reason why I did not give it a five-star rating is because of their financial aid program. I have only received it for one year, my freshman year, but after that, they changed the criteria for being awarded and I have yet to receive any help for two years. Tuition is not cheap, and students are not rich, every semester takes a huge toll on my finances."
Senior,4,"This is a pretty nice campus. I have the most experience with the faculty in my major department, psychology. With the exception of a select few professors, I have been happy taking classes here."
Sophomore,4,The academics and professors are both very good here at Fresno and almost all of the professors I have had so far are understanding and encourage you to do your best and try to push you to do better.
Sophomore,4,Cal State Fresno is a campus not only blooming with tress but with diversity. It's a campus that allows one to grow and develop professional skills with all the provided resources.
Freshman,4,"Fresno State is a diverse college. The diversity allows everyone to feel welcome when entering. It has a great variety of majors and minors to choose from, there is something for everybody. I feel welcome everyday that I go to school. The activities on and off campus are always fun. I have gone to football and basketball games at state and enjoyed all of them. State has many programs that are helpful to students like the migrant program, career and development center, and major advising assistants. I have been to all three and they have helped me plan my future classes and how to feel more comfortable on campus."
Sophomore,4,I love the tight knit community and most professors were amazing. I would love the campus to improve on getting more up to date buildings and classrooms. Overall great school!
Sophomore,4,"I like how Fresno State has many resources available to students and make it known to students by constantly advertising it via social media, flyers, emails, etc., I would love to see more food diversity, but overall, a very lovely school to attend."
Freshman,4,I really enjoyed being on campus. It's full of nice and generous people. Everyone is so helpful when you ask for help.
Niche User,4,"Because I come to Fresno State a lot to go to the library to study and do some of my homework, I am greeted by nice people. Along with the campus there are nice people and the campus surprisingly has squirrels that are extremely friendly and the food at the school is top noch."
Sophomore,4,"Since High School, Fresno State was always my first option since it is close to home and I was already very familiar with the campus and resources provided."
Freshman,4,It's a good university and the area around campus is rich in food and entertainment. I have so far enjoyed the campus when I was there. It could use improvement on lounges and transportation. Other than that it is good
Niche User,4,Its very chill with a great environment. The people are great and very nice to look at. The food around the area is good mostly the tacos. its a hidden gem.
Junior,4,"The music program here is phenomenal, and could be made even better with better facilities and instruments. The community is great, and I almost always feel welcome when I attend events on campus. My main issue is that I am a middle-class white student who receives no financial aid from the university besides loans, and when I tell other students this fact they are amazed, because they all receive financial aid. I wish the university would fix this, because I will have to deal with student loans even though I have a GPA above 3.9, I have participated on campus, and I have worked hard in my classes from day one."
Niche User,4,It is very cheap to attend. its campus is beautiful. although it has many impacted majors like nursing and criminal justice
Alum,4,If you choose to go to Fresno State and live on/nearby campus and engage with the community it is a great experience. The professors dedicated to majors are excellent and the college spirit around the university is one of the best in the Cal State system. I have worked and lived in San Francisco for a decade now following graduation and the degree helped me get a start to be successful.
Junior,4,It's a good school!! Very helpful faculty and staff!! Wish there was  more variation with food on campus
Freshman,4,Fresno state is great. Could be hard getting into the classes you want but overall it is awesome. You also get to meet a lot of new people. Students at Fresno state are very independent so everyone minds their own business.
Freshman,4,"Environment is friendly. Professors are helpful and staff are welcoming. Made a bunch of new friends relatively quickly even though I'm not very involved in clubs, sororities, or sport events. Curriculum is reasonable and lots of scholarships and financial aid are offered to support academic success."
Niche User,4,"Strong academics and sports as well, I haven't had any bad experiences here, they will get you where you want to go in regards to your career."
Junior,4,The professors in the psychology department always do their best to make sure the students learn and know their material. It's nice to see passionate and caring  professors. The library has amazing resources and it's big a spacious. The counseling and health services are top notch and you can tell that they want the best for the students.
Niche User,4,I love how they offer study abroad programs! I am not yet a student there but I applied and hope I get accepted so I can enjoy the full experience!
Niche User,4,"I like the environment and all the clubs they provide. Richness in culture, creativity and diversity is also another thing. Students truly make Fresno State unique. Central California is one of the most culturally diverse regions in the world. In the past, farming drew people from throughout the world to the San Joaquin Valley - from Armenia, Mexico, Germany, Cambodia, Sweden and Japan. Overall it is a great college."
Junior,4,"Overall the school does a great job when it comes to academics, the faculty doesn't just teach you facts but how to use them in our life, communities, and in our world. We get a better understanding of the world we live in and the skills we learn help us to be productive. Diversity is excellent as Fresno State offers dozens of campus clubs for people of all demographics, the schools offers tutoring for struggling students, the library offers resources for research, and the school has many events for students to get involved in, the food around the local area is great and the school spirit is alive and strong. Overall, my experience has been great and I see the school will improve and be even greater after I graduate."
Sophomore,4,"I have loved attending Fresno State for my first two years of college. It's such a pretty campus when all the leaves start to change in the fall. I haven't had too many problems with professors, but I would love to see more of them who are connected with their students."
Freshman,4,The teachers are well educated and very helpful. The school offers several resources for the students at no extra cost.
Sophomore,4,"The library is nice, has multiple levels and available private study rooms. There are many different types of student: international, transfers, higher education, etc from all over the world."
Senior,4,"The worst thing about CSUF is the parking issues and the lack of food options on campus.

The best part of CSUF is the many clubs and activities on campus."
Freshman,4,"California State University is a great college campus. It is diverse and there's kind people. Professors and tutors willing to help students. A lot of places to hang out with friends , quiet study areas, dining areas, etc. The central gatherings are mainly at the fountain or at the library."
Sophomore,4,"I feel like teachers and counselors don't care about you and to even schedule an appointment it takes months. I wish that there would be more help from advisors and counseling about paying for tuition, careers, etc."
Sophomore,4,"I think that California State University - Fresno is a really good college. It is well known in the Central Valley and has a few strong points. The college does its best to make sure all students feel welcome, I especially felt that as a Freshman last year. They communicate fairly well with all of the students and information is always being exchanged. They also offer many supplemental activities to ensure that students will improve on their studies. The ambiance overall is pretty good."
Alum,4,"My overall experience at CSU Fresno was great. I love that they offer flexibility for students by providing a variety of majors to choose from. The programs on campus, such as EOP were very helpful for students who were new to the campus as well as advising. It made my education experience much easier."
Niche User,4,I haven't attended Fresno State but I have been there many times for college tours and love it! Definitely recommend.
Freshman,4,"So far a good experience, I can not wait for the opportunities Fresno State will give me! The faculty and staff are all very nice and helpful, and there are a lot of different clubs and organizations to get into. There are so many things to do like visit the Student Union and go bowling or taking a break in the nap pods. Fresno State ensures each of their students are healthy and safe and work with local organizations to help any student in need."
Sophomore,4,What I enjoyed about California sate university-fresno was the close tight-nit community. It was like a family wherever you went and along with the sports environment made the experience even better. The way everyone was so involved wishing the community made it feel like more of a family than a university.
Graduate Student,4,Loved my experience with my non-major professors. I’ve learned a lot thru them compared to my major professors which is ironic. All professors are interesting in their own way but I wish Fresno was not so conservative.
Niche User,4,I have went to Fresno State for their Dog Days and on a couple of field trips. I believe it to be a great school which looks out for the students both money and security wise. The handful of teachers and students I have met where very upbeat and thoughtful. The work I did there was as stressful as any other college work but I felt that I could ask the teachers for reliable help.
Sophomore,4,"So far my experience at Fresno State has been really good.  The school overall has a great atmosphere where it features both academics and athletics and clubs. The professors are great as well and great educators, anytime I have a problem, question, or concern I got an immediate response either through email, a phone call, or instant feedback while in the classroom."
Sophomore,4,It is a very beautiful campus and very welcoming of all. The only changes I would love to see would be added parking. Parking can be tough most days.
Sophomore,4,Fresno State is a great university that has excellent professors and lots of activities around the city and the overall in school community. I believe it is a good local choice but overall there are probably better choices for certain degrees than this university.
Sophomore,4,"At Fresno State, there are many different opportunities that almost every student can take part in. There is a wide variety of clubs and organizations all around campus and there is a high diversity rate at Fresno State which gives this school a lot of cultures. The administrators help out the new students making sure that they are on track to graduate on time and they make sure that they keep this campus safe for everyone."
Sophomore,4,"After my first year in college, I absolutely loved the acceptance and energy staff and students provided to first time freshman. However, I honestly lacked the knowledge of college life and how to support myself independently. Yet, this college helped me learn how to deal with these certain tasks at hand. You are not alone and this college makes sure of it!"
Senior,4,"Overall this school is great. Constantly improving and bettering for the students. There are a few professors who believe they are better than they are,  but those are few and far in between."
Junior,4,"CSU Fresno is great because they have excellent teachers and pofessionals in general that are always very happy to help their students succed. As an International student, I have been having a good transition at this university."
Sophomore,4,"My experience with Fresno State so far isn't bad. Coming in last year as a freshman wasn't easy of course. Trying to get used to a different routine every semester, but eventually I got the hang of it. Then the teachers there are always willing to help out anybody, you just have to ask for help. I can't wait to go back for another year of unforgettable memories at Fresno State! Go Dogs!!"
Junior,2,"The instructors are genuinely nice, but busy with so many students that there is no personal connection. Your money goes to clubs and organizations that you do not agree with, and the staff in general are not great at communication."
Freshman,2,"My semester at Fresno State was terrible. I had issues with every professor I had, issues with getting classes, and issues with the financial aid department. I will be transferring after the Spring Semester if it still doesn’t get better since I have now changed my major."
College Sophomore,2,Fraternities and sororities have a bad image after what is know about them.
College Freshman,2,I mean its there if you need it but its not something that would eb considered grand or anything
College Freshman,2,I only talked face to face with one professor and that was the only one that i thought knew me. The other professors were just a teacher that i had for a class
College Freshman,2,Its not as good as it could be it could be better
College Senior,2,Most people don't feel safe walking at night because there's constantly criminal activity in or around campus.
College Senior,2,"Living on campus is a good experience because you get to make a lot of new friends. However, the buildings are extremely outdated and the RAs are really strict and treat you like children."
College Senior,2,"There's a big sense of school pride but there's also a lot of bandwagon fans. When the team is doing well, the stadium sells out. But lately, the football team has been lacking support with coming off consecutive losing seasons."
College Student,2,"Throughout my semester of this school year, the school spirit seems kinda dead to me. I don't really hear anyone talking about the games. People do actually attend the game but its not celebrated/pumped up before the games."
College Sophomore,2,"Living at the Fresno State dorms is actually a good idea if you don't know anyone at all. You will meet your best friends there. Unfortunately, you and your new best friends will hate living there. There are many rules that are unnecessary considering we are all adults. The wifi there is the worst. Only good thing about living there would have to be how close it was to all my classes allowing me to sleep in a little longer. Other than that, I did not enjoy living there but I did enjoy being able to make friends with my floormates."
College Sophomore,2,The only options for living off campus are either living kind of far from campus for a cheap price or living close for really expensive or in a bad area. You cant win.
College Sophomore,2,Very expensive would have to live with a few roommates.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't go to parties but I heard there isn't a lot of them. But when there is, it's not that great."
Recent Alumnus,2,It could be a lot better. Their are aspects of administration that are too strict or need to be restricted.
College Sophomore,2,I do not ever hear about scholarship opportunities
College Freshman,2,They need more dining options on campus.
College Freshman,2,The pledging process is horrible.
College Junior,2,"in the last week, there was reported sexually assault. as well as  lots of crime alerts have been going on often. Its sad, sometimes i fear for myself. I think it is due to the location of school that makes it very unsafe. School is located in a bad part of the city."
College Junior,2,"Well, its not all that bad, its just a lot of safety issues . Cars get broken into, and so do apartments. Thats the real issue. That good things is that there is a lot of apartments close by that students usually live in and walk to school from because they are like a across the street literally."
College Sophomore,2,It's a really hit and miss kind of deal. Some days the Dinning hall is fantastic and others it's horrible.
College Freshman,2,"stolen bikes, assualts, campus drinking,"
College Junior,2,"Not much surrounding fresno state let alone fresno.  Pretty bad area and the campus is right across from a place called ""sin city"" where a lot of gangs and drugs are near."
College Senior,2,I've been stolen from a total of four time in the year and a half that I've been in my apartment.
College Senior,2,It's Fresno. What else can you really say...
College Freshman,2,"Fresno state is not in a very safe neighborhood. Had I known how dangerous it was, I would have gone somewhere else. There is usually cars getting broken into and people getting robbed."
College Freshman,2,There is always a long line for the Financial Aid Office. It really sucks to not qualify for Financial Aid.
College Junior,2,"The diversity on campus is great. Ethnic/racial ethnicity is acceptance is ...although there is challenges in regard diversity on ethnicity and diversity, economic background, political beliefs religion, economic background, and/or sexual orientation. Those challenges may"
College Junior,2,"Its took forever for the school to process the requirements. The money also took a while to come, especially when the student is close to their due dates. I always have to pull out my own money and pay half of my tuition fee, before I even get any money from financial aid."
College Senior,2,I've personally never had an issue with classes but I hear many of my friends complain.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The off-campus housing is bad. The pros is the convenience, parking, and sometimes cost. The cons of this is that it does not feel like a college student community. The apartments are offered to anyone. It does not feel safe."
College Sophomore,2,There is never enough student parking spots open. and it seems like teachers have way more parking spots available.
College Sophomore,2,I don't meet that many guys a lot of people stay to themselves
College Sophomore,2,I wish there was more information on how to join
College Sophomore,2,Definitely choosing the right people to party with makes the difference if you get left out or peer pressured in.
College Sophomore,2,Parking passes for one semester are too expensive and daily passes are only $3 a day. You have to be really careful not to park on a teacher and staff only spots. Tickets are $50! Parking is only guaranteed early in the morning like 8 and earlier. Vandalism is big off campus.
College Sophomore,2,I hate fresno. Way too much crime.
College Sophomore,2,It's way too hot. We have gotten no rain this year and are currently in a drought. I prefer the raining cold weather.
College Sophomore,2,They are not very helpful at all. I had to go back several times until I gave them exactly what was needed. There's all these issues that are not clarified and some of the financial aid staff is rude whenever they answer the phone.
College Freshman,2,"I got some financial aid, but my parents still end up paying more now that my sister is going to a good high school. I still need more aid so I can pay off more and be more at ease."
College Freshman,2,I constantly get emails of crimes nearby.
College Freshman,2,"I really don't like it. It may be because I have 2 roommates. I would prefer living in a more roomy environment with my friend and my dog. It's good of the first few days to get that experience but after, its best to live off-campus"
College Junior,2,They offer an array of degree options and the curriculum is average.  Registering for classes could be such a hassle. Just hope that you get into the classes that one may need because they fill up quickly.  The Psychology and many other departments are packed.
College Freshman,2,Tons of safety alerts about incidents on campus at night. Fresno is not a very safe area. Don't walk alone at night.
College Student,2,Most of thew transportation to school are unreliable
College Sophomore,2,it is not readily available but we do technically have it.
College Sophomore,2,It is a dangerous city to live in and there is not very much to do.
College Sophomore,2,"This is absolutely not a college town.  It's a big city that happens to have a college that was built here.  The town life around campus is horrible.  It is run down and on can sometimes be scary.  You have to travel away to Clovis or RiverPark in Fresno to get any kind of fun atmosphere.  The safety around campus is a concern and not many people like the town of Fresno, but do enjoy the college."
Recent Alumnus,2,Nothing but fast food and crap
Recent Alumnus,2,"Fun at first, then it gets old"
College Senior,2,"Tower isn't too bad, but apparently this town has never heard of drink specials during normal "" going out"" hours.  The best bar in town, hands down, is Swigg's!  They actually have regular drink and food specials.  It's a cool joint too."
College Senior,2,The professors suck at communicating and are too wrapped up in their own research to even help students effectively.  Registration is awful to deal with.  Communication from even faculty and campus staff is so poor that even the most basic tasks become convoluted.
College Senior,2,The school is predominantly Hispanic- very rude and uncouth Hispanics who are unwelcoming to Caucasians and are generally very poor communicators.  a lot of information and important detail is lost due to the lack of effective communication here.
College Freshman,2,The poverty in the city is horrible it is the city addicted most to crystal Meth there could just be better solution with the police enforcment and the trouble that goes on here.
College Sophomore,2,"The local public transportation is the only virtual transportation. Some options are available to females and those that are disabled, that is all though."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus is plagued with drinking and pot use. I find is repulsive, but I am afraid it may be a sign of the times..."
College Sophomore,2,"The dining hall is not awful, but not much more than that. As for the food court, it contains average fast food chains, none of which are particularly amazing"
College Sophomore,2,"It is a MUCH cheaper alternative to on-campus housing, but comes at a price. It is not as safe, or convenient, BUT again, money talks."
College Freshman,2,"I have very good academic standing, but haven't won a single scholarship. "
College Freshman,2,I always smell and see drugs on campus.
Senior,1,"It's a cheating system, I took Gerontology once, then I had the class showed twice in my transcript."
Senior,1,"The campus is dirty, and the weather is worse during the day in Fall. CSU Fresno did not worth my time, the grading is somewhat wrongful."
College Freshman,1,Don't know never tried to be in one.
College Freshman,1,Never lived in the dorms
College Freshman,1,"It was a bad decison on my part, i went to the dorms thinking that it might be a good experience but it turned out to be the complete opposite. Before signing up to the dorms i had called to get information on it and i asked if i could opt out any time, they said yes, ""you pay on a mothly basis so you can leave once you pay for the month if that is what you want"" so i thought, if i didnt like it i could just move out, but apparently these people want to chain me there they said that i couldnt leave until the school year ended. So i signed up for a petitio for cancelation and even the lady told me that it was most likely that i would leave, i sent them a reason why i was trying to leave and told them i had financial problems, i had to take out a loan and even my parents had to borrow money, but they told me pretty much, ""well you should've thought of that when you came so no you cannot leave"" honestly thats the reason why once the school year ends im getting out of that school, becuase they try to milk you for any little reason. I tried to change my meal plan to silver and they told me that i couldnt until i had been a resident there for a year."
College Junior,1,Too many idiots getting drunk.
College Junior,1,Need more housing inexpensive options for students.
College Sophomore,1,when i lived on campus i had terrible dirty rude smelly roommates. the on campus food was terrible. they do  not offer healthy options.  There is only one place to get purified water. over all terrible
College Freshman,1,"scary, dangerous area, lots of gangs and crime"
College Senior,1,"All the money goes to athletics. We are at a school. Shouldn't they money be going to, oh I don't know...education!"
College Sophomore,1,"There is not enough enforcement of the law in Fresno, a LOT of gang violence"
College Sophomore,1,I don't like any other transportation except my own car because it is very unreliable and can make you late for class.
College Senior,1,They are all stuck in some time warp in which the norm consists of ditsy girls who don't know how to think for themselves.
College Senior,1,"Again, there is nothing but greasy unhealthy food.  Most of the restaurants are chains.  People here cook with an over abundance of fat, salt, sugar, and anything else unhealthy.  It's insane how unhealthy everybody eats here.  It's a miracle if a restaurant even offers low-cal salad dressing."
College Senior,1,"This town is made for and by fatties who like meat and grease.  You'd think it were the 50s here with all the unnecessary salt, lard, oil, and sugar these people pack into all their food prep."
College Senior,1,Nobody is willing to provide any help or guidance.  You don't even ever get to speak with an actual staff member in the financial aid department when you go in-person because they only put student workers up front at the windows.
College Senior,1,"The entire city needs better approaches to public transport.  I've never lived in a ""college town"" where cab rides cost so much money!"
College Senior,1,not a part of greek
College Student,1,KIds need a car to fully experience college life in Frenso. Buses are sketchy. 
Recent Alumnus,1,There is not enough parking on campus or in the surrounding community to accommodate parking for all the students.  You can pay for a permit and it is not even guaranteed that you will get a parking spot near or let alone on campus.  Tickets and fines are prevalent especially if you park where there are meters and if you park across parking lines.  Parking spaces and the convenience of parking spaces are hard to take advantage of.
College Senior,1,Permit costs are absurd!! you can't even find parking!
College Senior,1,"If you're caught drinking on school grounds and underage  you should be gone. But they give warnings, I think that pathetic."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking permits are over priced and prices keep going up each year.  Ticketing and fines are reasonable.  Very limited parking spaces, it could take up to an hour to find a spot.  I've had a lot of issues with parking to I just started riding a bike to school to not have to deal with it."
College Senior,1,"Worst time of my life! Terrible roommate and unsupportive staff. Highly overpriced even for the cheapest option. The food is below mediocre as well. Indeed, you do make friends but that could be anywhere. Try to avoid these dorms!"
College Junior,1,I didn't receive any financial aid upon applying. There are some great research grants made available for those in the College of Science & Mathematics.
College Freshman,1,"A LOT of drugs, alcohol, and partying
if you dont party 
dont go to fresno"
College Junior,1,"No transportation around campus.  You must walk across campus, but is not that bad.  You can called for transportation if you have night classes."
College Senior,1,Greek Life at Fresno State does not have a huge presence. They throw the occasional party but not a lot of people know what they are really doing.
College Junior,1,"Greek life in Fresno are nothing but parties.  If you are a type of person who likes to stay out late, party a lot and hardly get sleep then the Greek life is for you.  Not saying that people who join do all of those things but a majority of them do that.  All depending on which one you join."
College Junior,1,Hate It – You have to show up extremely early to get a park! Permit costs $89 a semester
College Junior,1,Budget Cuts Force Departments to Merge – Because budget cuts are causing departments to merge it means that degrees will not be that great because they could potentially be taught by someone in another department.
College Freshman,1,"NOTHING AVALIABLE – Classes are always full, and with the budget cuts teachers arent really teaching anymore."
College Student,1,Not a Very Good Experience – There is almost nothing that makes this school unique. They lack technology.
College Sophomore,1,"There is not enough parking lots on campus. Many have to park in the event center parking lot, which is in a whole other block, and others won't even find a parking space in the lots across the street. You will find yourself snaking through the parking lots, often stuck between cars that have stopped to wait for a car to leave. Have been late to class because of parking!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"I have to say that I have never went to an event at Fresno State during the night. There is no nightlife that I have heard of. If there is I never heard anything about it, they don't announce these things. They need to let more people know through the campus newspaper."
College Freshman,1,"our off campus housing is not located in a very nice neighborhood. There has been some violence known to happen on those streets, and I wouldn't want to live there."
College Junior,1,Alot of drugs in our city. Very easy to buy and sell them. Too many people are effected by the drugs.
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking is horrible.  Not enough space for students.
College Freshman,1,"Greek sororities and fraternities have booths on-campus to recruit during both the fall and spring semesters. Most sororities and fraternities are ""academic"". Greek students are viewed by non-Greeks as the partiers and drinkers of the school."
College Sophomore,1,The Dorms Are Too Old – CSU Fresno just turned 100 this year and the dorms are extremely small and need to be redone to improve ventilation and cleanliness. All of the dorms are the same regardless of what class level a student is.

Sophomore,5,"Switching to online has been a really difficult adjustment for me but I think the professors (and the school) have done a fantastic job with integrating the in-class learning to an academic learning option. The only issues I've relay come across is everyone just trying to figure out the technology and time zones, but that comes with time."
Senior,5,"Very well coordinated. The administration has been very responsive, well organized and patient with this."
Senior,5,"Amazing learning environment. The student community was very welcoming and communicative in case of an issue arising. Professors were very dedicated, knowledgeable and were always supportive of students."
Freshman,5,"Very good school. Professors are engaged and advocate for students, and the classes and work are comprehensive. Beautiful campus and well-funded."
Alum,5,"Loved my Lake Forest experience! Excellent small college, you really get to know your professors. Fun campus experience with a lot to do!"
Sophomore,5,"Lake Forest College provides great environment in terms of class settings. Professors are close to students, which means students can talk to professors very easily and get help whenever they need."
Sophomore,5,"Lake Forest is small, but has so may opportunities.   I love the athletic facilities and the athletic community.   The athletes all support each other.  The professors are accessible in and out of the classroom."
Freshman,5,Lake Forest College is a school were you can be yourself and get a great education because there is such a small professor to student ratio.
Junior,5,"Lake Forest College is a great school for small class sizes, interesting professors, and an extensive study abroad program. In my case, I was able to acquire an excellent financial aid package. One drawback, however, is the requirement to live on campus for your first two years."
Senior,5,"I personally love the biology department! It tends to be more collaborative as oppose to competitive like some of the other sciences here. Also, in addition to having a brand new science building, we have a plethora of research opportunities that are harder to come by at larger universities. 

You can take up to three for-credit internships here as well! The career advancement center is extremely helpful in assisting you with finding and setting up internships!

As for as the student body, I personally have found it overall to be super friendly and accepting! It is fairly close knit as small school. 

The food used to be subpar but we recently got a new food provider and the quality has increased somewhat. 

However, people that are looking for night life might be disappointed here. The town of Lake Forest is pretty quite. Also, it takes about an hour to get to downtown Chicago and usually becomes an all day event."
Senior,5,"Lake Forest College is incredible. It is a private liberal arts college that consists of only 1,500 students. It has such a nice community in that everyone on campus knows each other because it is so small. Everyone there is dedicated to learning, and motivated to find new experiences. The career advancement center and various professors provide incredible opportunities to students, which allow them to further their knowledge in the subject of their interest."
Junior,5,"I made a wonderful choice to attend Lake Forest College. It first drew my attention for being close to home, and I later found out about all the other great features it has. The small student body size allows for more one-on-one time with faculty. This allows for students to get more personalized feedback and assistance with academics. Also, Lake Forest does an excellent job of fostering student leaders through a variety of clubs and programs on and off campus. I feel as if there are plenty of opportunities for my voice to be heard and to make a difference at this school. Additionally, all the professors I have had the pleasure of taking classes with have been amazing. They are all extremely knowledgeable people who want their students to succeed."
Freshman,5,"Lake Forest College is the best decision I have made. I love Lake Forest because it is very diverse and friendly. It is also close to home. Not only are the students nice but the staff as well. They are very easy to talk to and understanding. Also, Lake Forest College offers many financial aid opportunities and scholarships which really helps students like me that are first-generation and low-income. Overall, I am happy with Lake Forest College and would not change a thing."
Senior,5,"Lake Forest College is a really great school and community. We have so many great resources on campus, and we have such a great faculty and staff. Staff is super friendly, and they all strive to make everyone feel welcome. Faculty makes material fun and engaging. Faculty tries their best to work with students and make course material that will benefit and engage all students."
Senior,5,I loved everything about Lake Forest. We are a small community and family. Everyone is very nice and helpful
Junior,5,The small class sizes and one-on-ones with the Professors were very helpful. I also enjoyed seeing the amount of diversity found within the college campus.
College Freshman,5,I feel extremely safe on campus. Public safety is always around and even a bit overbearing at times.
College Senior,5,"In my experience, academics here can vary based on major and department. My experience, which has skewed towards sciences and foreign languages, has been extremely positive."
College Senior,5,"This school sets itself apart from other national libarts in our conference by emphasizing strong career connections in Chicago and a highly successful alumni network. Lake Forest recently received a multimillion dollar donation to enhance experiential learning on campus and strengthen our career center. I think the results have paid off. Funding is available for some off-campus internships should students want to work in the city. Like all other great aspects of the school, nobody will hold your hand and walk you to the Career Advancement Center, but if you do choose to use it, it's very much worthwhile. I've worked a variety of internships in several countries since the summer after my freshman year and am confident my degree has been well worth the money."
College Freshman,5,"My first semester classes were a lot of fun. My first year studies course was very informative and intersting. It gave me a new perspective on college football. The rest of my classes were fun and engaging. My econ class gave me trouble, but there were many resources to improve your understanding and knowledge."
College Freshman,5,"Forester athletics are top-notch. I am a member f the varsity cross country team, the athletic facillities are very wll kept and state of the art. The rec center is very nice and a great place to stay in shape."
College Freshman,5,"Lake Forest is a dream come true. I love evrything about it. the location is perfect. The classes are wonderful, and the professors are very nice, engaging and care about the well-being of the students. The students are some of the nicest and most genuine people I've ever met and I made many friends from my first day of campus."
College Sophomore,5,"I currently transferred colleges, before I came to Lake Forest College I attended Ripon college. The two colleges are completely different and deciding to transfer was the best decision I could have ever made. The atmosphere here at Lake Forest is staggering. I do not say this about a lot of things, so saying this is a lot. I believe what makes this school so unique is the fact that although it is a small school it is very diverse. So far I have met students from places all over the world such as Botswana, Cairo, and even the Netherlands! Not only am I able to connect with the all different types of students but my professors as well. I have not met professors that were so willing to help you succeed until coming here! What makes Lake Forest college so special is the ambiance and the friendliness in everyone here. Whether it be athletes, professors, or international students, the Lake Forest community is one."
College Freshman,5,"Lake Forest College really has helped me feel welcomed. There are a lot of days for freshman orientation, but I think it's really worth it. And the small classes and campus really makes me feel like I'm a part a something big, and that everyone cares for each other and is there to hep you out. I really believe that Lake Forest will help me prepare for my career and success in life in general."
College Senior,5,Rigorous libarts with Chicago's global connections
College Freshman,5,"In town there are a lot of restaurants, however, since it is a rich neighborhood, the prices are kind of high."
College Freshman,5,I recieved a lot of fincnial aid from the people I have talked to. They have a whole building dedicated to admissions and financial aid.
College Freshman,5,"I honestly don't think I would want to live off campus unless it was my senior year. Most people stay on campus all of their four years for two reasons: the atmosphere is great, as well as, location and it's cheaper."
College Junior,5,Being a business major on campus is great. There are many clubs to join that offer professional experience. The professors are great and the opportunities are endless.
College Junior,5,The diversity on campus is awesome. Students come from all over the world and I have learned so much about different cultures from fellow classmates and friends.
College Freshman,5,"Nollen is the newest freshman dorm and is where i lived my freshman year. I love it its really great. There are two laundry rooms that you can pay with credit/debit card and it tells you when its done. There is a cafe on the ground floor that is open from 8-12 all week except Saturday. There are several lounges where people can hang out or do homework. The RA's are super chill and become more of your friends than RA's. The rooms are also really nice, pretty average size but you definitely do not feel cramped in them. There are a few bigger rooms on each floor which i was lucky enough to have. the basement also has slightly bigger rooms. Moore is the newest dorm and looks like a hotel, but constantly gets trashed on the weekends. It does get cleaned up well but often there are damages that get charged through the dorm."
College Freshman,5,Great professors that actually care. Its really easy to get in touch with them if you're having trouble and the resource centers help a lot. Classes are really small so professors get to spend much more time with you. Lots of options for classes.
College Freshman,5,Easy to find out info on good professors. Education majors are helped out a lot here. Workload is great.
College Freshman,5,The campus is very safe. Walking around at night alone doesn't make you feel unsafe. You can leave your stuff alone in the library or study halls and come back an hour later and it won't be touched. Public safety is present almost everywhere and they are easy to find.
Recent Alumnus,5,The staff helped me with the financial aid  process and they were easily accessible. I give them all 5 gold stars.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The campus is one of the most diverse in the midwest. The people come from all across the globe as I personally had friends from many European countries, South Africa, the Middle East, Russia, and China. They host many programs engaging the students to experience the cultural diversity. The cafeteria prepares different cuisines from around the world for a week every year, the professors host speakers who cover political differences, religious differences, and sexual preference, and if having a diverse student population, diverse menus, and speakers to cover different areas of diversity is not enough, one can always talk to one of the many different professors from around the globe. I was taught by professors from China, India, Russia, Germany, and many other countries that were always more than willing to share their personal experiences."
College Sophomore,5,Beautiful Lake Forest. The cops and campus police are bored so they do ALL THEY CAN to make their jobs meaningful.
College Sophomore,5,"Firstly, I think we have the most beautiful campus around! It has lots of lawn space and really beautiful old buildings combined with some of the more modern new buildings like the sports center, the library and student center/dining hall. the campus is surrounded by these deep ravines that have little streams in them and you can hear the water bubbling as you walk by and over them. LFC has also invested a lot in making the academic spaces available to students the best they can be. The art department, for example, has a fully functional gallery space to exhibit in, giving students the unique opportunity to curate a show. 
The modern buildings are beautiful and sleek. They use a lot of glass to bring the natural beauty of the campus indoors, which I love! They are also really fun and functional spaces. 
I would highly recommend visiting to see all of this in person as it is hard to explain by writing."
College Sophomore,5,"Other than being a mildly inefficient office, they are all really nice people! When they patrol the campus on Friday and Saturday nights they will stop to talk to students, not to get them in trouble or anything, but just to have a conversation. Students have a genuinely friendly relationship with public safety generally. When they break up parties that are not in dorm rooms, they usually just make everyone leave. If there are drugs involved, its obviously a little more serious, but if you drink and are not loud, sloppy or destructive, they will most likely just say hi and leave you be. Having said that, it's worth saying that I have never gotten in trouble with public safety, maybe if I had I would feel differently.
I feel pretty safe on this campus and in this town. I have a job that requires me to walk to and from work at night and I have never felt threatened. If I did, LFC has an escort service. They recently updated it because people were taking advantage of them, but the rules now are: It must be dark, you must be alone and you must feel threatened. The pathways to and from town aren't really well lit and in the winter they get pretty icy. 
"
College Sophomore,5,"The computers in the library (1st floor) are available 24/7 for student usage. They're pretty fast and easy to work on and there are tons of them, it's never too crowded there because most students have their own computers. Upstairs there are several computer labs that have larger and fancier Mac computers. There are even computers in some of the study rooms scattered throughout the library."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The campus security doesn't even need to be present, honestly. This is one of the safest places in the world just because of the township and people living in the area. There's no reason to feel threatened on campus(other than the occasional extra-crazy Saturday night)."
College Freshman,5,"There is a lot to eat, considering the caf is buffet style. The ice cream bar is the best!"
College Freshman,5,The diversity here is great. There are people from all different backgrounds and the college makes sure people know this.
College Freshman,5,"We have a really caring, dedicated staff of health and safety."
College Freshman,5,Almost all facilities have been renovated and are clean and nice.
College Freshman,5,"There are many computer labs at Lake Forest College, I have never had a problem ever finding a computer to work at. Most students do have their own laptops and still choose to use the computer labs to work. Having a laptop is great for entertainment purposes, but not necessary if you don't mind working at a lab in the library. "
College Junior,5,"I am apart of the Psychology, Theater, and Art History departments at LFC and the quality of teaching is remarkable. We don't have TA's and the largest class size I ever had was 50, so professors will get to know you pretty fast. They truly care about teaching and will hold you very accountable. I have learned an incredible amount. These professors prepare you for success in your chosen field for your future career."
College Junior,5,"Apart from the odd cat-calling and egging from local high school students the LFC campus is extremely safe! Public safety can be the bane of all fun sometimes, but their hearts are in the right place and if you treat them with respect they will treat you and your friends with it in return. Theft doesn't appear to be a large issue, people often leave their belongings in the library or student center to save a spot. That being said, if you have common sense, there is nothing to worry about!"
College Sophomore,5,I declared a major in neuroscience within one month of school and I couldn't be happier- I definitely made the right choice! The number of opportunities I've already been presented with in one year is incredible. I feel the support of my professors and my advisor on a daily basis. Professors know you by name and that's one of the greatest hallmarks of the college. I hope to apply to medical school in the next few years.
College Sophomore,5,"Being a Neuroscience and Biology double major is challenging yet very rewarding. The professors, undergraduate research, facilities, and job opportunities are all phenomenal. Beginning from summer of freshman year students are provided with opportunities to conduct research in biomedical areas."
College Sophomore,5,"I came to Lake Forest College because of the campus atmosphere here. All of the professors are over qualified in their respected disciplines. The classes are the right size in where you can get to know your professors personally if you choose so. There are so many things to do on campus and off campus. There are so many clubs, organizations, and activates, which anyone can be involved in."
College Student,5,"Financial aid is amazing. My EFC is ""0"" and I hardly have to pay for anything. They have great need base aid and merit aid. Plus the aid office is amazing and friendly.  "
College Freshman,5,"The Sports Center – I love LFC sports center. It's great to work out in and everything is new and works well. We have an indoor soccer field, work out rooms, yoga, great programming. You name it. The gym is a good size for our school as well. The only negative is the swimming pool. The swimmers often complain it's too small for proper competition"
College Freshman,5,Fairly Easy – Such a small school. Everyone is there to help you succeed
College Freshman,5,Diverse Student Body – The college is completely made up of different races; a Lake Forest College education is international. Individuality and equality is built into our community and we get a global experience that can't be found anywhere else. Students are from 47 states and 78 countries!
College Freshman,5,"Small Class Sizes – The professors are always willing to meet with you to discuss any problems you may be having with the course. The largest class size here is about 30 students, so the teachers really take the time to get to know every student on a personal level. Being a biology major, having small class sizes has been more than beneficial."
College Sophomore,5,"The health center is always open and available, giving out flu shots, emotional wellness support, and the nurse is always available to help. Campus security is always around capus making sure activities do not get out of hand and are always willing to pick you up when it is dark or give you a ride to the train station."
College Freshman,5,Amazing Rec center. One of the best I've seen in a college
College Sophomore,5,"Diverse Campus Life – Compared to most schools, Lake Forest College is extremely diverse.  There are people here from almost all of the U.S. States and over sixty countries.  The school prides itself on its diversity and acceptance of ethnicities, economic backgrounds, political beliefs, religion, and sexual orientations.  Many of the cultural groups help this school flourish and become involved in Chicago (conferences, protests, speeches, etc.).  Most students here get some sort of financial aid, which allows people from all backgrounds to come.  There are many rich white kids, but there are many international and ethnic minorities at this school (40% of my class is an ethnic/religious/sexual minority).  We have so many campus programs that host different events for all of the groups where most of the student body gets involved, which helps people understand more about one another."
Recent Alumnus,5,The teachers are VERY friendly. You can use almost ANYTHING to persuade them on grades. I mean ANYTHING.
Sophomore,4,"I am glad I chose Lake Forest College. I don't think I would be happier anywhere else. The small size of the school allows for easier access to advisors and professors and it feels like a close and tight knit community here. The only downsides to going to Lake Forest versus a more bigger and more endowed school is that a lot of the dorm buildings are not very modern, and the food is honestly hit or miss every single time you go. The town of Lake Forest also has very little options in terms of fast food or shopping options that aren't little boutiques, Starbucks, or Lululemon, so you either have to take the Metra, an Uber, or use the shuttle that operates like 4 times a day. For me, it helps me not spend money on fast food, but I can understand why others would be frustrated. But I'd say overall I've had a pretty good school experience despite the issues."
Sophomore,4,"It really all depends on your major, your professor's preferences, and your personal preferences for online learning. For me, I've had a mostly good experience. A lot of the classes I've had involve professors recording their lecture or something that would be normally done during class, and then the online zoom time involves basically a discussion and questions about the videos. The professors seem more prepared for online classes in fall 2020 and the course materials are very accessible and what normally would be paid textbooks is being uploaded/scanned for no cost at all on Moodle. If you have a science major.. well, good luck Charlie."
Sophomore,4,"I love Lake Forest college for many reasons...the staff, the people, the campus, the available courses, and the easy commute to and from the city. These all have made the campus experience amazing! The only thing that is tough for me is the food, but it's something easy to work around and not that big of a deal."
Alum,4,I liked the food that Lake Forest College had to offer. I found their staff to be quite helpful. I liked that it was not a big college despite the fact that the campus was spread out across multiple buildings. I did not like the shortage of parking spaces for visitors and students. Nor did I like how there is only about 10 minuets to get from class to class.
Sophomore,4,"My experience is that the professors are pretty top-notch, you won't be taught by a T.A., most are PhDs and experts in their field. There is a wide variety of study abroad options, and I just applied today! The location is a bit of a drawback coming from California, as Chicago gets very cold, but my education is great so far!"
Junior,4,"I like that it’s a very small school, and it gives you a much better opportunity to get to know your peers and professors."
Senior,4,"I have really enjoyed my experience. The college is what you make of it, and I have been fortunate to find very cool opportunities along the way."
Sophomore,4,I found that the College holds students to very high standards and is inclusive to all people and there is good diversity on campus.
Alum,4,"I went there many years ago and had a wonderful experience.  The teachers were very dedicated and caring and helped me develop a love of east asian language and culture.  It is a beautiful campus, full of gorgeous trees and foliage."
Freshman,4,"I had a great first year experience, it was welcoming and it was a great transition from high school. A lot of welcoming programs and great students that are willing to help you and get together and study."
Junior,4,I think the professors are fantastic. They try hard to ensure each of their students understand the material well.
Sophomore,4,"It's a fantastic Liberal Arts School, which a deeper connection with professors because of the smaller classes"
Senior,4,"I am about to start my Senior year at Lake Forest College. My experience here has been amazing, to be honest. Professors and other works at the College do an amazing job of interacting with students and making sure they are on track. Professors are very flexible and work with students so they don't fall behind and I find that amazing. Especially since it is a small school, being able to communicate and work 1:1 with a professor is easier. The only comment I can make about what I feel needs to change is the food, but it isn't so bad that it is a must change thing."
Sophomore,4,"LFC is a small school and Lake Forest is a small town with little to no entertainment. However, the school itself allows for all students to become immensely involved in clubs and activities. There is a large variety of organizations to become involved in and if there's a club you want the school to have, it's not difficult to get one started. There are some amazing professors at LFC and all of mine have been wonderful but one. There are some professors students seem to think are too difficult or are not good fits for them so I would do your research on a professor before choosing a class."
Senior,4,I really liked that everyone was here and that you are able to make GREAT connections with professors and students
Sophomore,4,Lake Forest is a small school and is good for those who want access to a city but don't want to be living in one.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the community aspect, but I would love to see more attention go to the theater department. Millions of dollars have been spent on the Moore housing, science department, and random things like Hamilton tickets. However, the school still uses one of the oldest (and extremely small) buildings from before the school existed to use as the ""blackbox"" theater. Its just a very awkwardly shaped rectangular room with all of the walls painted black. We have administration that loves theater, as well as a diverse group of students who are passionate about the art, but there has still been an extreme lack of focus for Theater."
Freshman,4,Lake Forest College has a wonderful academic program. There are many opportunities to get involved with research both on and off campus even as an undergrad. Some of the buildings could use some updates though.
Sophomore,4,"Lake Forest College is a higher education institution which motivates its students to not only do well for themselves but for the greater good. The campus is beautiful and close to Chicago, beaches, forestry and and culture. A Lake Forest education is one that gives you a full experience with no gaps."
Sophomore,4,I like how friendly everyone is. Everyone seems to be genuinely happy which is refreshing to be around. I also like the competitiveness of the college. Even though we are a division 3 school everyone takes their competitions very seriously. I also like how the class sizes are small and the administration says that we are a family which strengthens the community. I wish that we had the same facilities that division 1 schools have. I know that it's harder to accomplish this because there are fewer kids that go here than a division 1 school but it would make people think more highly of division 3 schools. Also would like to see underground parking because there isn't much parking around here and freshmen are not allowed to bring cars which is unusaly at college.
College Junior,4,Enjoy my dorm space a lot
College Junior,4,Lots of events and good people involved in Greek Life
College Junior,4,"The school's small size allows for the diversity of Lake Forest College to be a strong selling point. By the percentage, international students, homosexual students, or students of non-christian/catholic hold a higher percentage of the student population than larger schools. Those looking to meet people of many different cultures and diversities will like this school. On north campus, there is a house that houses many of the international students. Most of the international students keep to their own social groups, but that is applicable to any social group at the school. In reality, this comes down to the small size of the school, so once you've seen all the diversity of the student body, there is little else to experience."
College Senior,4,Some professors are better than others. Course in my major are great. Class sizes are small.
College Senior,4,It depends on you to join the correct fraternity or sorority. It can be great or it can suck.
College Senior,4,"Football is the biggest sport at LFC, but the school has a good soccer and handball team too."
College Freshman,4,"In terms of the quality of education--it's great! However, I do wish that students were less cliquey and were more eager to make friends and participate in clubs and events. Also, food must improve. There are very few healthy food options."
College Freshman,4,Lake Forest College offers many networking options as it is located in a wealthy business district area. There are many connections to made and many research and job opportunities if you get to know the right people.
College Freshman,4,"Although going to such a small school has its drawbacks at times like the formation of niche groups, it has over all been a great experience. Class sizes are small, allowing teachers to be more involved as easy to reach out to."
Recent Alumnus,4,Fairly safe campus with a student body that looks out for each other most of the time.
Recent Alumnus,4,Some of the buildings are a bit older. The difference of quality between the newest building and the oldest one is pretty drastic.
Recent Alumnus,4,"If I could do it over, I would still pick LFC. I took advantage of many opportunities to shape the culture of the campus. As a Student Ambassador, First Connection Mentor and later a Student Coordinator, one of the ladies who brought the first Latina-oriented Sorority (Gamma Phi Omega Int'l Sorority Inc.) to campus, I was really able to leave a mark at LFC. I wasn't lost in a big sea of too many things to do. I was able to learn about myself, my interests, and my potential in my time as an undergrad."
Recent Alumnus,4,There is a ton of school spirit at LFC! The stands at home games will often be filled with Foresters and entire sports teams going out to support their peers who play a different sport.
College Senior,4,"When a friend from USC visited Lake Forest, he mentioned our athletic facilities were some of the nicest he'd seen. I agree. Team spirit isn't particularly high across campus, but it's a Division III school and we seem to hold our own in the conference. We're also bizarrely good at handball (national champions for years). That's pretty cool."
College Senior,4,"Lake Forest is one of the safest cities on Illinois. The College's security, Public Safety (""PubSafe""), may be irritating to students because they tend to stifle the on-campus party scene, but they do keep the campus secure."
College Freshman,4,it is a very safe campus and the students are very friendly and calm
College Freshman,4,"I live in Harlan Hall and even though it is old, it is still a great place to live. The rooms are great and spacious. Even though the basement is not so great, the people who live in my building are great people and fun to live with"
College Freshman,4,I felt like I was home when I stepped onto the campus.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I enjoyed my time at LFC because of the support provided to the students. 

Positives

- Professors willing to put in extra time and effort

- Athletics and facilities

- Beautiful campus close to Lake Michigan beaches

- New dorm halls

- Other students

- Diverse backgrounds 

Negatives

- Rick Cohen

- Parking restrictions

- Parking spaces

- Cigarettes littered from smokers

- Stacy oliver

- Old dorm halls with no AC

- Not enough room in the library

- The sports teams should be better"
College Sophomore,4,A small school with dedicated professors.
College Sophomore,4,"My first year at LFC was great! I loved it a lot, ups and downs and all. I wish there was more to do both on and around campus, but the town is small and expensive so I know that won't change. I love the small school atmosphere. The teachers were great, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the food wasn't too bad. I'm halfway through the summer and I'm ready to go back."
College Freshman,4,The coaches helped me get accustomed to college.
College Freshman,4,The public safety officers are constantly on patrol and are very approachable.
College Freshman,4,"The comunity that the college is in is very friendly and clean. There are a lot off ammenities close by including restaurants and stores--even a metra station to take frequent field trips to the city. Some of the dorms are small, but it doesn't bother that me that much. Fifteen minutes away there is a shopping center and a free shuttle bus provided by the school takes students everyday."
College Freshman,4,"I've received a lot of financial aid. It's been a great help! It would be really helpful if the college put up more information about costs, instead of the base cost."
College Freshman,4,I wouldn't want to live off-campus. The small campus makes it easy to hang out with friend from different parts of campus. And it's cheaper than renting an apartment in town.
College Freshman,4,"I think considering how small of a school we have, the party scene is great. It was much better than I expected. There's almost always something happening Thursday-Saturday."
College Freshman,4,"I do frequently eat the same thing in the caf, but that doesn't bother me. There's plenty of fresh food and healthy options as well."
College Junior,4,I think the campus strictness at my school is at a good level.
College Junior,4,The academics are great. We have outstanding professors at the school that want you to succeed. I wish there was a larger selection of majors but otherwise I would change anything.
College Junior,4,So far I have had a good experience with the financial aid process at Lake Forest College. I suggest starting/applying early.
College Sophomore,4,This school gives fantastic financial aid. They met my financial need.
College Sophomore,4,The great thing is that Lake Forest College is only a hour away on the train from the City of Chicago.
College Freshman,4,"The town of Lake Forest has the necessities (CVS, Walgreens, grocery store) with some fun stores too. There is also a mall, shopping center, target etc.  about 15 minutes away and there is shuttles that run to those daily. An uber there also only cost about 13$ so if you need to get somewhere and there is no shuttle at that time, there is a way to get there."
College Freshman,4,They don't get in the way of the fun unless its really obvious and most workers seem to want to help students.
College Freshman,4,"I love my dorm (NOLLEN), but folks who live in Harlan or Blackstone have no air conditioning, but those dorms are less expensive than Nollen.  Pick your poison.  Harlan and Blackstone are in Middle Campus, the social hub of the entire school.  And Nollen is pretty far from the academic halls, but a cool little coltesac of dorms (Moore, Nollen, Gregoy, McClure, and Roberts)."
College Freshman,4,"They are very present and want to make sure we are safe.  They want so protect us from people who might hurt us or in some cases if we are doing something dangerous, they will want to protect us from hurting ourselves.  I feel safe with them around.  They could do more about checking for underage drinking, but that's witch hunt."
College Freshman,4,"ALL CHAPTERS AT LAKE FOREST ARE DEDICATED TO THE COMMUNITY.  They are all service oriented and I think that's what is the coolest thing about them. They aren't really big on parties, considering we don't have ""Houses"" for them, and they are really accepting of people from all walks of life."
College Freshman,4,They gave me a full ride--And I'm able to use all the money I received for Studying Abroad my Junior Year!!! Which is just crazy cool.
College Freshman,4,Public Safety is always patrolling the campus grounds to make sure that everyone knows they are present and ready to help you.  I had a friend who was injured during a game of capture the flag and Public Safety was there in an instant to help her get to an ambulance.
Niche User,2,"Lake Forest was a proper disappointment in the two years I attended the school. The academics can be very good, but the majors are limited. Still, a 4-year college is about the whole experience, which is where all other aspects of this fairly pricey institution fall flat on its face. Housing is a joke, the small student population leaves everything feeling socially claustrophobic, and the entire experience feels underwhelming overall. On top of that, the administration doesn't take safety very seriously despite all the rules they set.

This school is too small for its own good. It would be better off downgrading itself to a community college, which is what it feels like much of the time. Most of the people I knew from freshman year transferred out by the end of my sophomore, with me following suit. I would re-attend my Alma Mater as many times as I would avoid LFC if I had to re-do college again.

Be warned: If you are looking for a holistic, proper college experience look elsewhere."
Sophomore,2,"Lake Forest College is a place that requires much consideration. For starters, the surrounding area, the City of Lake Forest, is incredibly small, so you shouldn't expect to do much there, especially after 6pm. For that reason, you're very much stuck on campus, so it's important to engage yourself in whichever way possible. That being said, the events that occur on campus, while great, are limited to the resources that are available to clubs and organizations. Everything begins to feel like a repeat, and after a few months, you would have seen it all. There are also professors who aren't necessarily the best at what they do. That being said, many many professors at the college are Associate Professors, which isn't necessarily stated as you come in. I would greatly advise giving it some thought. It isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't great. They provide good financial aid though, so I think of it as getting what you paid for."
College Junior,2,"Due to the lack of places off campus to find entertainment, most students end up drinking in their dorms, either socially or not. There are 2 bars in town, both of which are attached to grilles and attended by older men of the area more than the students. It's a 15-minute walk into town, and Ubers will arrive in about half an hour from a more populated town once ordered. Parties overall suffer from limited space in the dorms, cliques being prevalent throughout the school, and the overbearing feeling of the authorities watching over all the campus properties (And rightfully so, there are cameras throughout the dorms intended to deter parties). This applies for both underage and of-age student, and often leads to students wanting more, or going to Chicago or other schools for the weekend."
College Junior,2,"Greek Life at Lake Forest College suffers from turmoil brought upon by both the town of Lake Forest as well as the administration. Greek organizations are not allowed to have houses due to both local and school decree, and that leaves most of the organizations disjointed and cliquish given that people of the same organization cannot live together in groups of more than 5 people (as per the limitation of the dorms). There are no houses on of off campus for Greek organizations. Instead, the housing administration gives the ""privilege"" of giving each organization a lounge, which is a leaky basement room in each of the oldest dorms on campus, accessible only by one key to the space. Because the athletes in Greek organizations are told to hang out with their fellow athletes instead of people outside of their sport (In any sense), it can be difficult to become friends with your fellow brother/sister that is on a sports team because they were explicitly told to hang out with their teammates. The segregation of living location makes all the Greek organizations, again, very cliquish. Because of all the reasons stated above, it is difficult for members of Greek life to make a large impact on the social aspect of Lake Forest College. Non-Greeks look at the Greeks with little regard, especially for those not on sports teams, a demographic that far outweighs any other demographic at the school. There are no benefits to being Greek at Lake Forest College given the costs in both time and money, considering the little impact the organizations can make to campus outside of the odd annual event."
College Junior,2,"I'm not well versed on the subject of Lake Forest College's alumni, and I believe that is due to a lack of exposure to either me or my friends. I honestly believe that the Alumni prefer to disassociate with the school, a because I never see them outside of homecoming or when they have formal speaking lectures, which happens rarely. I was recently offered an internship by a family friend, rather than being contacted by anyone from the school. I have found more promising programs through my fraternity brothers and my own initiative, rather than getting any word from the school. I took a tour of UIUC, and their internships come to the school to allow convenient experience-building for students who may also be taking classes. Lake Forest College leaves the commute up to the student's ability to travel (In other words, have a car) to their internship, which are often centered around the Chicago area."
College Junior,2,"Lake Forest College suffers from problem inherent to any small school. In effect, this school is the second part of high school, but with more drinking. The academics are needlessly difficult, and students have little else to do besides studying out of limitations of on-and-off campus. The administration is restrictive and does not fully let the students gain the necessary experience as adults for a fulfilling college experience.

Starting with campus life, students are required to live on campus until their senior year. Due to this, most of the student population find themselves partying in cramped dormitories. When not partying, which is often, the students are complaining of nothing to do whilst drinking to pass the time. There are not accommodations similar to living in an apartment on campus, and Greek housing was cut in the 1980s, relegating the fraternities and sororities to meet in leaky basements. My fraternity has faced the unique problem of having a wheelchair-bound person, and we risk injury carrying him down the stairs every time we have chapter because the building does not have an elevator. Only three of the seven buildings do.

Socially, the school is essentially split to athlete and non-athlete, and these cliques are formed strongly before the regular school year begins. Even Greek-life is affected by this, where the fraternities are either wholly a sports team, or disjointed by the athletes and non-athletes, diminishing the internal culture of the chapters. 

While I agree college should be a challenge, there are times when it can be taken too far for little reason. The intro to Psychology course requires a rigorous experiment to be conducted, difficult enough to turn plenty of curious students off the major. A friend of mine said that Penn state had to weigh their prospective transfers' GPAs from Lake Forest College due to the difficulty of the classes compared to the acceptance rate, as well as the recognition by employers about the college."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek Life is very clique-y. Also, there is a lack of diversity in many sororities. The fraternities are the more diverse part of Greek Life."
College Junior,2,There is not much off campus housing in Lake Forest and if you find something it is usually too expensive for a college student.
College Freshman,2,"Hard to find , expensive"
College Freshman,2,"Compared to my high school, the team spirit here is ridiculously low.  Games aren't won and therefore teams aren't supported.  It's a tough dynamic.  Teams are still proud of their sport, but the student community doesn't.  If we had better teams then maybe the team spirit and school spirit would be boosted.  But really, our school spirit is starving for a team to win."
College Senior,2,"Our public safety isn't very consistent with it's ruling on different issues which is frustrating as a student because we are never sure what to expect in regards to our own safety. I had someone breaking into my dorm on multiple occasions at the beginning of the semester, and Public Safety assured they would install a new key system specifically for the people of my floor and they did not install it. Sometimes they will bust people for doing things they didn't do. They mainly harass people about parking."
College Senior,2,it is quaint. I like the town library. Sweet's is the best.
College Senior,2,"There isn't any businesses in lake forest that cater to the college community besides food stuffs. If you go to The Lantern with your friends, and you happen to want a beer but your other friends are under 21, you have to sit at a separate table as them. This makes 21st birthdays really uncomfortable. Chiefs is delicious, but they charge for every topping, even cheese for their burgers. Egg harbor is THE BEST breakfast, try their skillets but get there early, they are always packed. I like to buy their dressings and sneak them into the cafeteria to put in my wraps. If your friends have a car, driving to Chipotle in Vernon Hills is always an option."
College Senior,2,"While my dorm for the last two years has been a great place to live overall (my current single is 9.5 feet by 13 feet with a large walk in closet) the Residence Life at Lake Forest College has been less than adequate at responding to issues I have experienced. In several instances my neighbor's alarm went off at odd hours and my neighbor made loud phone calls at early hours of the morning (anywhere from 3-6 AM almost every morning for a month) and while Residence Life told my neighbor that there would be consequences, they never actually instated them. Their behavior continued."
College Freshman,2,Not much to do off campus around the college. To get to Chicago or sporting events takes either a lot of gas or taking a very long train ride
College Freshman,2,Campus housing can be a hit or miss. There is really only one nice upperclassmen dorm. Most dorms on campus are very old and are in dire need of renovation or being torn down.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I lived off campus. This was the smartest decision I could have made. However, the school did not help and actually tried to have my roommates and I evicted for a party that was thrown at my house in which 4 of the 5 of us were not actually at the party to begin with. Since I graduated the rules have changed to only seniors can live off campus but the high cost of living in the area makes this difficult for most people."
Recent Alumnus,2,"In 4 years at the school I was never able to utilize the transportation offered by the college. It does offer specific pickups and drop offs to town which is a mile from north campus, two miles from south campus, and to the neighboring town to go the the mall and bigger stores if you need to shop. However, these runs are far and few between leaving many guessing when the times actually take place. The only good transportation is into Chicago itself as the Metra is on a set schedule and is easy to understand, get to, and utilize. The campus is located too far from any restaurants to walk to on a regular basis especially in the winter time."
Recent Alumnus,2,The computer labs are constantly full due to an expansion in the colleges student population. The college has not yet upgraded the computer labs and tech to handle this surge in population since they recently finished the housing remodels to accommodate the students. If you have your own the wi fi is found across campus but there are several locations that have little to no connection.
College Sophomore,2,"Can't complain too much. I'm not vegan, however, and the school gets pretty basic in how they treat them. My food is okay. Also, the dining hall hours are a joke. If you're too late, you don't eat. The meal plan is a scam. You're literally meant to run out of campus flex and have to purchase more. "
Alum,1,I had no online learning experience because I took no online classes. I took most of my classes on campus in person.
Sophomore,1,"Lake Forest is a small, all too intimate school, filled with narrow-minded and exclusive people. I am an individual who is not shy, and am confident in being my unique, true self. Unfortunately, unless you mold yourself to the masses, you will not be accepted or appreciated here by anybody - except perhaps your professors if you are able to form a connection with them.  While the school claims to be incredibly diverse racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically, this is not the case at all. The majority of the students who attend this school are white, trust-fund kids, who seek to pass their free time getting drunk and doing cocaine in somebody's dorm on a weekday, when they don't have to study for their classes. LFC does indeed offer a decent-quality education, but in my opinion it is not worth it if you have to spend four years trying to be successful amongst people who don't have the slightest idea about how to define success."
Niche User,1,"There are more cliques than a High School, and the RA's don't help at all. I am transferring out. Even though the sports are D3 the coaches still don't really care about you, I was told many times to seek counseling due to problems with my roommates and ""my inability to make friends"". 0/10 would not recommend. The food is provided by Aramark, and their employees say they are willing to work with special diets, but then proceeded to tell you one thing and do another.
P.S. if you don't party and/or drink this isn't the school for you."
College Junior,1,"Students are only allowed to live in dorms, and dorm space is limited, so the parties are limited in resources as well as space, given the closeness that all the students experience with their fellow foresters. Alcohol is clenched by the buyer since liquor stores close early in the county, and most students are too cheap to be generous. Party planning is poor at best meaning that the parties that had sponsored alcoholic beverages run empty quickly, there is not enough room for guests, or there were never enough guests to begin with. The best parties take place off campus for 5 minutes until Lake Forest Police Department arrives and shuts it down. Because of all these hurdles, many students choose to drink with a small group of friends in their doems with no expectation of going out, or walk miles on and off campus and come back to their dorms disappointed."
Recent Alumnus,1,"In four years at this school res life completely turned their policies around 180 degrees. As a freshman the school understood that we were adults and treated us with respect allowing us the privilege of making our own decisions on when and where we wanted to drink, party, or just goof off, knowing that when we crossed a line we had to be reprimanded. By my senior year the public safety office and res life became extremely strict seeking out people who were having a single beer in a dorm just to write them up and put them on probation. People were all treated as criminals beforehand and if they were clean after the search they could go with one eye watching them at all times. The leader of the public safety charade, Rick Cohen, even went so far as trying to get the PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER'S, not cops, the right to carry handguns to protect themselves. This in a school of 1500 kids that did not see any bullying, hazing, or abuse in my entire 4 years."
College Freshman,1,"Most students choose to live on campus at Lake Forest College. There are a few apartments around the town of Lake Forest but it is not a convenient walk, a bike and/or car is necessary to get to class promptly. There are a few apartments in the surrounding towns of Highwood and Highland Park but those are a commute to campus that a car is necessary for. Some students go as far to live in an apartment downtown Chicago and take the Metra Commuter rail about 45 min- 1 hour to get to the station to then walk 10 minutes to class. "
College Freshman,1,"The food on campus is HORRIBLE. I was not expecting a five star meal but I wouldn't even rate it as a one. There are only certain foods like potatoes, wraps and chicken nuggets that aren't completely gag worthy. Every one suffers through it or just doesn't eat on campus at all. I actually bought a George Foreman grill and groceries from town or else I would loose the freshman 15, not gain it...The food quality and preparation is horrible for as much as people pay for it."
College Freshman,1,"You can only have a car if you're an upperclassmen, a commuter or extenuating circumstances (i.e.: medical appointments every week, a job far from campus, etc.) so there are very limited parking options."
College Sophomore,1,"The public safety officers at our school are very strict about underage drinking and drug abuse. For people that get caught, they get written up and have to go in front of the administration for a ""hearing"". It is very strict, however there are people who get away with it because they are not being so open and publicizing it. It is important to make the right decision, and if you are choosing to drink then do it quietly and with people you can trust."
College Sophomore,1,To briefly describe the nightlife in Lake Forest: there is none. Go to Chicago or wait until the school throws an event.
College Sophomore,1,"Depending on what your idea of good ""nightlife"" is, you might rate Lake Forest a little bit higher than what I did. However, I'm from the city and I say the nightlife in Lake Forest SUCKS. The parties are...alright on a good day. Heaven knows they need better DJs! If you don't pre-game (which I do not), you will probably find the parties very boring. Just a heads up. This is NOT a party school!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Pretty Boring – I played sports in a big high school (a high school of 4000+) and the teams at LFC are embarrassing.  My high school teams were better.  I wish I was exaggerating.  Needless to say, this makes sports a snoozefest to watch unless you're loaded."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Either you need to be rich, or you need a car so that you can drive to the far-off Burger King."
College Freshman,1,"Lake Forest is a really wealthy town so there is nowhere off campus to live that is convenient. There are apartments but they are still on campus. I'm sure that the college would like to be able to offer more off-campus housing options, but in a town this rich it really isn't possible. Living off campus means being really wealthy or living in the next town over."
College Freshman,1,"Like High School – I don't really that is anything really interesting that sets my school apart. In fact, there aren't many things to do besides going to the Jewel that is in the town. It's nice that there are a lot of students from other countries, but overall there isn't a wide variety of academic programs or much of a campus life."
College Freshman,1,"There are a few Greek life scenes on the campus, but barely enough to be heard about. No one pushes you to join one, but it lacks in making it feel like a real college."
College Freshman,1,There are no off-campus housing unless you do not live on campus. Lake Forest is a rich neighborhood so the apartments that can be found are very expensive!
College Sophomore,1,The dorms are mostly old buildings but in decent shape. The problem is that they are not kept very clean. The bathrooms are very dirty and there are bugs in most places. There is a simple fix... clean up the mess!

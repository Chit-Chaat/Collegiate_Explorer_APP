Graduate Student,5,I did not take any online classes however due to covid my first month of class was on zoom. Class was still spectacular.
Graduate Student,5,"The perfect school. Everything about Rice screams elite. The best professors, students and learning environment. Simply put, the perfect education."
Freshman,5,"The food was good, the classes were taught by good professors, and the dorm life is very fun. I am glad to have went."
Sophomore,5,"Rice has everything you'd expect from a top university. The professors are great, there are plenty of career resources, dorms are nice, etc. I would say what sets it apart is the closeness of the undergraduate community and the cooperation over competition mindset. However, there is visible disconnect between the undergrad community and the administration, which runs more or less like other top universities. Overall, it's been an amazing undergraduate experience."
Sophomore,5,Rice has been on top of their game when it comes to online learning. Most Professors have put significant time and effort into ensuring that their course transitions smoothly online.
Freshman,5,"I cannot imagine a better school for me. Everyone here is so friendly, supportive, and welcoming of one another. O week is one of the best kept secrets of this school, where you undoubtedly form relationships that will last you the rest of college. They have so many systems in place, like RHAs, fellows, magisters, clubs, and residential colleges, to support students. Every residential college has its own distinct culture and helps students have a smaller home within the larger rice community. On top of all that, the campus is absolutely breathtaking."
Freshman,5,I think online learning is pretty great. The professors are very articulate and are very fast at replying to emails.
Freshman,5,I love Rice University because of the people who are on the campus. They are some of the most caring and wonderful people I have ever met in my entire life. There isn't much competition and everyone just wants to see everyone else succeed.
Freshman,5,We moved online because of Coronavirus and the professors were incredibly understanding and sympathetic as we navigated the tricky time. The quality of education was still very good even though it was difficult to maintain motivation from home.
Sophomore,5,"Online learning has been a difficult transition, but Rice has been very accommodating, especially by giving a discount on summer classes."
Sophomore,5,"Rice is a great school, with vigorous academics but a really laid-back social scene. There are lots of opportunities to get involved with your interests and it’s also academically flexible, so you aren’t locked into any certain field/major."
Sophomore,5,"When campus was closed, all my classes moved online. My professors did a good job adapting to the situation, becoming more flexible in grading and helping students on a case by case basis. In addition, they created good content to learn from through worksheets, prerecorded lectures, and zoom meetings. Overall, they handled the situation very well given the circumstances."
Freshman,5,"Underrated school! Beautiful campus, amazing academics and campus life. Houston and rice village are amazing"
Junior,5,Friendly people. Quaint sized campus. Effective residential college system. Nice amenities. Housing and dining are relatively very good.
Freshman,5,"It is amazing Collage. As an International student ,I was tensed about how I will adapt there ? But believe me , once you attend Rice O-week you will adapt easily without any effort."
Sophomore,5,"I like that Rice is small enough that the student to faculty ratio allows you to really connect with your professors. For the most part, the professors are experienced and approachable.

As far as campus life goes, Rice students like to have fun in an unconventional manner, although lately the administration has been way too strict about events like Baker 13 and Beer Bike."
Alum,5,"Amazing school with caring students and faculty. Very safe and students are very tolerant of all races, genders, religions, etc. Lots of great resources for students to get a jump start on their career."
Freshman,5,"Rice University is committed to diversity and success of their students. It is in the center of the wonderful city of Houston, Texas and te opportunities surrounding Rice are endless."
Freshman,5,"I love the inclusion and culture of care at Rice. It was always so important for me to go to school that was diverse and small enough to feel like I mattered, but also large and prestigious enough to provide me with the opportunities to enter the work force successfully. Rice University has an excellent system in place to help you in every way possible. Mentors and many staff are trained to guide us towards the path of our self-defined success. Professors are incredibly considerate. My peers are understanding and helpful. Unlike a lot of other prestigious universities, Rice fosters a truly non-toxic environment. We students are happy and do not compete with one another, but with our own selves as to not become academically stagnant. Rice’s mission is to see growth and impact, and administration and staff provide everything you need for that to take place."
Freshman,5,"Rice University is a great place. Everyone is so friendly and helpful, especially the upperclassmen. The residential college system makes it easy to make friends because you see they same people every day."
Senior,5,"Rice is tough, but I am having the time of my life. Students are incredibly friendly, and the culture of care extends beyond weekends. Faculty are so knowledgeable, and the administration treats students like adults, not high-schoolers. I am really happy with the education I am receiving, and looking back at all of my possible choices from 4 years ago, there's nothing that could make me change my mind about choosing Rice."
Niche User,5,Rice has opportunists like no where else in the nation. The only thing I would change is for every single student in America to have the chance to experience life as a Rice college student.
Niche User,5,"The tour I experienced there was wonderful. The faculty, staff and student body was respectful. I was introduced to the environment and it felt very encouraging. The students there talked about their struggles to get to rice and how they overcame it. This gave me hope that one day I will be able to attend Rice."
Niche User,5,It is a very good and top tier university! A variety of school activities are availavle on campus along with strong commitment to core courses.
Alum,5,"Rice is an incredible place with a supportive, unified community. The university genuinely cares about undergrads and encourages students to explore anything they are interested in. Students have a lot of autonomy and authority over how the school is ran, how their college is governed, what programs/majors/events they want to see, etc. In other words, students are taken seriously as active participants in their education rather than recipients. Looking back, the professors are also phenomenal and no classroom environment is the same. Innovative, forward-thinking, and increasingly community-oriented (within and beyond the hedges), I am proud to be a part of the Rice community."
Sophomore,5,"The culture at Rice is amazing! We are a diverse community of scholars who value collaboration, not cut-throat competition. We value what known as a ""culture of care,"" and I believe this makes us unique from all other elite schools. The professors are amazing, classes push you and challenge former beliefs, and the community becomes family. Rice University is an amazing place, even with intense academics."
Junior,5,"I really enjoy the friendly and cooperative vibes of Rice University and its students. The students not only work hard individually but also help each other succeed. The campus and environment around Rice is also really nice. However, I just wish there were a couple more fun things to do in and around Houston."
Junior,5,Beautiful campus and lovely environment. There's always nice activities they have to offer for students and several clubs you can join. The area outside of campus is lively as well- there's many things to do in that area of Houston.
Sophomore,5,"I love the family atmosphere.  The classes are challenging.  Campus life is great. 
I have no regrets coming here.  The best decision I have made."
Alum,5,"The academics and the study body and professors were amazing.  I liked the ""college"" approach to housing and the diversity among the student body.  The cost of tuition and the financial aid available to lower/middle income families makes attending Rice affordable.  Rice made internships and connections possible.  The campus is small enough that a student can get very involved in all kinds of activities.  A wonderful place to study."
Freshman,5,"Rice gives you so many opportunities to challenge the way you think, approach, and solve different issues in society. Whether you are a STEM major or a Humanities major, there are lots of interdisciplinary classes/organizations so that you are able to view things from different perspectives."
Niche User,5,I had a tour around Rice University and the campus was very nice! I learned a lot about the various academic offerings Rice has and it seemed to be very impressive. The students at Rice were very engaging and friendly.
Niche User,5,Best school ever! Has amazing housing system and allows dogs in dorm rooms. Professors are greet. Location is idle for medical students.
Alum,5,"One of the truly great schools in the U.S.  Its small size provides the intimacy of a liberal arts college, but its resources provides students with the opportunities of a large university."
Freshman,5,"Rice University was the best way to start off my college experience, where I was able to work on my bachelor's degree to become an ob-gyn."
Alum,5,It was really nice and I met a lot of people. It was challenging but definitely helped me get into a good career that has helped me in life.
Niche User,5,"I love the community atmosphere. Everyone works together to expand on similar desires. Rice as a whole is a college that fuels specific passions! As a person living with a low-income, Rice is determined to help give me FULL FREE tuition to attend their campus because they see my potential. Rice is very specific in it's majors, and the one thing that may be open for improvement is the expansion of their courses to incorporate and be strong in all degree fields."
Sophomore,5,"Rice University is consistently ranked among the top 20 universities in the U.S. and the top 100 in the world. Rice has highly respected schools of Architecture, Business, Continuing Studies, Engineering, Humanities, Music, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences and is home to the Baker Institute for Public Policy.Cleaning up the large number of groundwater contamination sites is a significant and complex environmental challenge.  The environmental industry is continuously looking for remediation methods that are both effective and cost-efficient. Over the past 10 years there have been amazing, important developments in our understanding of key attenuation processes and technologies for evaluating natural attenuation processes, and a changing institutional perspective on when and where Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) may be applied."
Niche User,5,"Rice is a perfect haven in the center of Houston offering a wide range of opportunities to all.  With the wide range of cultures and diversities in Houston, you will not miss out on unique activities and foods that come with said diversity. In addition, Rice offers some of the best academic experiences in the entire state of Texas with highly trained professors and staff."
Niche User,5,I have visited several times and have been interviewed there. The campus is beautiful and the staff are very friendly. The professors are willing to work with you to achieve your goals and allow you to really focus on your education to get the most out of your time.
Freshman,5,The sense of community is astounding. People are generally nice and willing to help in any way possible. There are always faculty member on hand ready o give advice and help. The culture of care thing sounds cheesy but it’s so true.
Niche User,5,When I first got to Rice I was mind blown I had never seen something so beautiful in my life and then to find out that the classes here are amazing just made me want to come here more
Graduate Student,5,"This is an amazing university filled with friendly  and educated people around every corner. It also does not hurt that the campus is one of the most beautiful that I have ever been on. There are trees everywhere. Nearly everywhere you go, you are surrounded by nature and owls!"
Junior,5,"Wonderful student community and student-centered environment. Many classes are less than 20 students, allowing for more personalized learning."
Works Here,5,"I am intern at Rice University over the summer. The whole campus is gorgeous and has tons of things to do on it even though it is in the summer. There are so many places and things near and in side of the campus that you'll never run out of things to do. In addition, the people and environment at rice is extremely friendly and welcoming."
Sophomore,5,"The atmosphere of the school, especially in the CS courses, is super collaborative and heart-warming. The dorms are in general pretty comfortable, but more work could be done to tear down the old buildings and replace them with newer ones. Food is great for awhile but then you might get bored of it."
Freshman,5,"I am a rising college freshman and have only heard the best things regarding Rice. From the rigorous academics to the stellar student life, I could not ask for more, except maybe that it could be a little closer to home.  Regardless, I can't wait to join my future family, as well as become acquainted with the surrounding community."
Senior,5,"The campus provides the perfect environment while the academics are extremely diverse and rigorous. It is very encouraged to follow your passions and the distribution system allows you to explore courses outside your major. There are a variety of programs and plenty of advising along the way, from academic advising to peer mentorship. Student life is good although it is difficult to travel into the city without a car. Food on campus is health and delicious."
Senior,5,"When I compare my experience with friends at other schools, I can't complain. There's a lot to nitpick on, but there's a lot at other schools, too. Here's the thing: I'm getting a quality education from great professors, great students, great facilities, great opportunities. If a college can do that and do it well, then it's done its job.

I know everyone today expects more (A+ food, A+ dorms, A+ party scene, A+ happiness, A+ a**-wiping, A+ to every kid...), but these are institutions of higher learning, not resorts. That said, some places are indeed good for some types of people and others for other types. Prioritize smartly and get feedback from students/alums; then repeat for other schools.

Me, I actually came here because of Houston, based on people, housing affordability, career opportunities, quality of life, weather, etc. And Austin/Dallas. I was lucky enough to get in (with scholarship). When I did, I rechecked my priorities and pulled the trigger. Best decision ever."
Freshman,5,"Amazing opportunities, great location. The residential system is definitely what sold me to the university and it it definitely what makes the school's social scene so collaborative and encouraging."
Senior,5,"Diverse campus with various research opportunities, hardworking smart and kind students, and easily reachable professors"
Freshman,5,"I'm 3/4 the way through my freshman year at Rice, and I love it so far. Rice's shining qualities are its academic rigor and the welcoming nature of the community. Rice students work so hard and they are so happy to include you in anything they're doing. Culture of Care is real, and it's so easy to make friends."
Niche User,5,"The best university in Texas no doubt. one of the few universities that can compete with the ivy,that's why some people say that it is the southern harvard."
Niche User,5,I really enjoyed the residential college system of the college because they let the students fully enjoy and emerge in a close environment. The residential college also allows students to interact and spend more time with each other. Rice's material science and engineering also attracts me because they offer one of the best research labs in the country for studying material science.
Freshman,5,"Rice is a great place to be when it comes to academics and student life! The professors genuinely care about their students and want to see them excel. Based in Houston, the opportunities that Rice students receive are unparalleled."
Freshman,5,I love everything about my school! It was my first choice and I feel really lucky to have gotten in. It's really rigorous and the curriculum challenges me a lot but I'm still very happy with my decision to come here.
Niche User,5,"The architecture is beautiful! The housing system is such a unique and interesting system, the best kind of college for Harry Potter nerds. It is very flexible in the kinds of classes you take, and they take into account financial need. They are also very advocate for a well rounded student body, which is something I like to see in a school."
Niche User,5,The library is an excellent place to study or work if you need a quiet environment. The central restaurant has really great sandwiches and smoothies.
Junior,5,"Rice is absolutely the best place on the planet to attend university. Not only are the academics top notch, but the way people interact creates a genuine, open, and welcoming environment. I've been driven and motivated by my classes, formed relationships with my professors and other faculty that have been invaluable, and gotten to know amazing people amongst my peers."
Sophomore,5,"Rice University is a truly wonderful school with very welcoming and warm people. Everyone sort of marches to the beat of their own drum at Rice, which is inspiring and a very different experience for me. Everyone here is very smart and works very hard, but everyone (or nearly everyone) parties just as hard.  My dorm is gorgeous (I am at McMurtry college), and the food is top notch!"
Freshman,4,The online classes were very good. Professors knew how to handle the technology. I am glad I took them.
Freshman,4,"When classes were moved online, it was hard on everyone, students and teachers alike. But everyone was really good at adapting and most professors were very open to adjusting for students' needs, especially non-STEM professors. Summer courses were a bit better because profs could design them specifically to be online, instead of having to change suddenly halfway through the semester. Also, the university made profs take training programs in online instruction and pedagogy specific to virtual learning so that they will be more prepared for the upcoming semester(s), which will be heavy on  virtual learning. Additionally, the profs and the university leadership have been so communicative through these uncertain times, with the university sending out weekly updates since april on evolving covid plans, which i very much appreciate."
Freshman,4,"Rice's social scene is a bit muted compared to the big state schools but academically it's the right amount of nurturing and challenging. The weather is pretty humid in Houston and it is a small school, which doesn't fit with me super well but some students really enjoy the general lack of freezing weather and overcrowded hallways."
Sophomore,4,"I like Rice very much. I have enjoyed almost every part of being a student. The classes and faculty do an amazing job teaching and connecting with students, the other students are a wonderful network, and the social life is perfect for just about anyone. The only issues I have are with the administration. While they are usually wonderful as well, there are some issues in which they have good intentions for the students, but do not truly understand the students perfectly. In addition, the financial aid is a poor system that doesn't help people well."
Niche User,4,I like the outside appearance of it and the People on campus was pretty cool and nice to talk to and what needs to improve is the activities that's on the campus.
Junior,4,"Amazing culture, very kind and driven peers. The only thing I would be wary of is the intensity of the academics. It can be difficult to refrain from comparing yourself to others."
Niche User,4,"I  liked that Rice is a very diverse campus that focuses on fields such as stem and will display what the students have created on campus. I feel that Rice could send out more programs based on what majors they have to offer, like having a history based program or anything with english/literature."
Niche User,4,RICE is great! The expense is definitely worth it. I am so glad I decided to take a chance and go to Texas to follow my dreams.
Senior,4,"Rice is the top 1 college in the Houston area, and I located on downtown which make the college affordable ,other of the things that I like from Rice is that is not a big campus and I like that, also the diversity on the college is good"
Alum,4,"Rice University is a gorgeous, academically challenging campus. A part of the smaller architecture program, my experience was specific, but worthwhile. It provides its students with great networking opportunities and diversity."
Sophomore,4,"My first year at Rice was absolutely amazing. The people there are incredibly friendly, the social life is thriving, and the professors really care about their students. I do wish that there were more resources for Humanities and Social Science majors; at times, it feels as though STEM majors are prioritized above the others. However, on the whole, there's always something fun and exciting going on at Rice, and I had a great year."
Sophomore,4,Rice is a great college with excellent professors and intelligent students.  The campus is safe and picturesque.  Campus life is fun.  Rice village is close by with great shops and places to eat.
Sophomore,4,"I've loved my time at Rice! The people are friendly, warm, and helpful. I appreciate the collaborative environment on campus. The residential college system is great and the adults on campus are very supportive. Academics are notoriously difficult at Rice but the classes are rewarding."
Senior,4,"Rice University is special because of the people that go there as well as the professors, but the administration isn't great.  The residential college system is very unique and benefits many people, but can be stifling if you don't get along with the people in your college.  The academics can be tough, but the environment is very collaborative instead of competitive.  Houston is a great city, but can be hard to travel around in without a car."
Junior,4,"Rice is a welcoming, but competitive school that will most definitely challenge you in ways you did not think were possible. But the atmosphere, supportive school system, and social scene make up for it!"
Senior,4,"Rice University is a top-20 university that has a lot of career and academic opportunities. The campus is really beautiful, and is located right across the Texas Medical Center (TMC), the largest medical center in the world. This gives a lot of wonderful collaborative opportunities for students and faculty. In addition, Rice has a lot of ties to the political, business and engineering scenes. Computer science isn't the best at Rice when compared to UT Austin or other universities, but it's booming. 

Students emphasize academics a lot, but also take time to mingle with people in their residential colleges (a fancy term for dorms and replaces Greek life) and party. Students are usually randomly assigned into 1 of 11 residential colleges, but I was unlucky and was assigned into one that really like partying, so I moved off-campus my junior and senior years."
Niche User,4,"Rice University is a very good college to attend. The students that attend here seem to be very educated, and well mattered. If you have to opportunity to attend here, you should definitely go here."
Junior,4,"First of all, Rice is full of the kindest people that you will meet. Unlike other research universities, Rice does not promote a competitive environment, and the students often help each other in shared classes (and academics are tough, so the help is very much appreciated!!).  Professors are usually hit or miss, depending on department, but most of them are great.  And I cannot recommend the residential college system enough. It creates small, tightly-knit communities within the larger university and a home for all 4 years. Some complain that their res college can be stifling, but it's really up to you if you feel the need/desire to make friends outside (or within) your college. Like everything, it's what you make it!"
Freshman,4,"I've personally always loved my experience there. The atmosphere is so open and friendly, and the community among the student is completely accepting. You're constantly provided with opportunities to not only get to know your Owl family but also give back to the city around you. 
The campus is so much different than Houston; it's like its own little town. Regardless, they really work to make you feel like you're at home and help you explore Houston.
The professors are kind and helpful, and the classes challenge you in just the right ways. 
If you value dedication to your community along with dedication to your education, Rice is the place for you. :)"
Niche User,4,Rice University provides a welcoming environment for students as well as visitors. I believe there is no need to change anything and would prefer if the campus stays as it is.
Junior,4,"Great school, with challenging courses having the ability to prevent one from resting on their laurels. A small group of students in an urban environment for the city slickers, but beware of Houston and its humid environs."
Niche User,4,"Rice University is a very friendly place, in a quiet area. You will always see nearby residents or students walking around the campus. It is located in a centralized area, so it is about the same distance to all other major hospitals or suburbs."
Junior,4,"Great University on a beautiful campus. Challenging but worth the effort. 
Facilities are good and the professors care about their students."
Sophomore,4,An absolutely breathtaking campus that has the most caring and close-knit community that I don't think I could get anywhere else. The RA and residential college headmaster systems at Rice also creates really unique faculty-student relationships.
College Junior,4,Rice will build you up or break you down. What experience you have is up to what effort you put in.
College Junior,4,"Courses at Rice University are difficult and challenging, but it is the challenge they present that make taking classes there worth the effort. The majority of professors are diligent and open, very willing to help those students who make an active effort in class and to learn the material. The classroom environments motivates through competition with my peers, competition with the professor to prove myself, but it does not overwhelm me or put me down."
College Junior,4,Rice is truly unique and amazing.  I could not be happier at any other school.
College Freshman,4,"Looks pretty good on paper, but white and Asian students make up majority of students on campus. Politically, Rice leans liberal, although there isn't much political activity on campus."
College Freshman,4,"Alcohol is everywhere, many people drink but others do not and no one (explicitly) treats them differently. There is some pressure to drink but it's not overwhelming in my opinion. Other drugs are present on campus, but there isn't a drug culture in the same way that there is a drinking culture."
College Junior,4,The RCEL program in particular has helped me a lot with internship and job hunting.
College Junior,4,"Rice is high-stress. That's just the way it is. If you can handle it, you'll get a lot out of it. If not, you'll just have a lot of breakdowns."
College Junior,4,"It's very expensive, but living on campus, having your meals taken care of, and having your bathroom cleaned is a huge relief when you're working 14 hour days trying to keep up with everything you have going on."
College Junior,4,"I love Rice. It gives me so many opportunities. I feel like many of the bad experiences I've had at Rice are largely due to my personal failings, and I've learned a lot from them. The only thing I find myself disliking about Rice is that some of the professors are there only to do research, and it shows in their class preparation, which is generally awful."
College Junior,4,"Campus housing is quite good and facilities staff are competent, hardworking, and care about their jobs."
College Freshman,4,"Lots of opportunities. As an Electrical Engineer, I am basically guaranteed a job after graduation."
College Freshman,4,"We pay a ridiculous amount of money to share a small 12x14"" room with another person. It would be cheaper to live in a mid-scale apartment with a large living room and built in laundry facilities than to live in a dorm."
College Senior,4,There's not too much crime on campus and I feel safe walking around campus at night. There was a sexual assault at my dorm during a party and it was taken seriously for a month then forgotten about and parties that were supposed to be canceled because of the assault happened anyways.
College Senior,4,Living on campus makes it easy to leave your dorm 10 minutes before class starts and still get there on time. You get guaranteed housing every year except when you are a junior. That is the only year you have to go through a lottery with the other juniors. Athletes and students with positions in the dorm or university government also get guaranteed housing. Some dorms are directly attached to surveries so you don't even have to go outside to get food.
College Senior,4,Rice is unique because it is a small top tier school with a beautiful campus and great academics. It's a nice environment for students who are there to actually learn and not pay thousands of dollars to blow of their classes and party.
College Sophomore,4,"Academics aren't a walk in the park, but you're definitely learning. If you work hard, you'll generally do ok. Just because you got straight A's in high school does NOT mean you'll get straight A's in college (in fact, it's very uncommon to do so). However, if you're smart enough to get into this school and you put the work in you're going to do fine."
College Sophomore,4,"We're a wet campus, but this ""doesn't trump state law."" What this means is that if you're underage, you aren't ~technically~ supposed to drink/do drugs. However, as long as you're reasonable, respectful, and responsible, the administration kinda just lets us do our own thing. They definitely do punish students who clearly disobey the alcohol policy, but in general as long as you are a reasonable drinker you'll be fine. Same goes for smoking weed, though harder drugs are much more frowned upon."
College Freshman,4,"There's always room for improvement, but I feel very safe on campus."
College Freshman,4,"It's pretty expensive, but the culture and atmosphere of the dorms are amazing!"
College Junior,4,You will most likely end up with a job upon graduating/get into your desired graduate school.
College Junior,4,"We're a small school that doesn't focus on athletics as much as the majority of public schools, so our facilities for the normal student body meet our needs. For the athletes, I wouldn't know."
College Freshman,4,"Courses and professors have been fantastic. They are noted specialists in their fields, and teach courses that directly relate to their areas of interest and current research."
College Freshman,4,The campus career center is very active in reaching out to students notifying them of upcoming career fairs and workshops.
College Freshman,4,"In my opinion, the campus is quite safe and secure. The RUPD is constantly patrolling the campus either in vehicles or golfcarts. There is an email and text message alert system in place to notify students of any suspicious or criminal activity on campus. Healthwise, the student medical center is very accessible, and the university also provides mental health assistance through their Wellbeing program (for both counseling and psychiatric help)."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, I've had a fantastic experience at Rice. My program is very rigorous and structured toward gaining professional experience in academic settings. One of the unique qualities of Rice is that the university consistently leads the list of highest quality of student life in the country. I can vouch for this at both the undergraduate and graduate levels."
College Freshman,4,I personally feel safe on campus. RUPD is alway around to help and send alerts.
College Freshman,4,There are a variety of courses to choose and I encourage taking a mixture your first two semesters at Rice.  All of the professors care about their students and are very approachable; their goal is to see you succeed.
College Freshman,4,I love the residential college system. You are instantly welcomed into a family that cares and supports and helps you through all your rice endeavors.
College Freshman,4,There is a good range of courses available to choose from and the professors all really want to help students succeed.
College Freshman,4,I'm hoping that a degree from Rice will open many doors to employment as contact with employers and alumni is very good and they know how hard the students study here.
College Freshman,4,I like the College experience and it provides great housing.
College Freshman,4,"There is good security around campus. Generally very little danger is expected on campus, but on the rare occasions that this happens, the best efforts are put into preventing these. A lot of discussion and debate happens around campus with regards to sexual assault, showing a lot of interest in taking security seriously."
College Freshman,4,"The center for career development, though I haven't used it that much, brings a lot of employers from all around and provides a strong motivation for students to search for jobs. Companies especially around Texas know how good Rice students are for the jobs offered."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus makes it really easy to know what's happening around Rice. The dorms are pretty spacious. But they are also saturated. Basically every room across campus has somebody living there, and many people have to volunteer to live off campus. We just like being on campus a lot. The housing gives us a nice experience of being on campus all the time. It's all set up quite well, with private bathrooms, staff cleaning up a lot of our mess, and air conditioning always running."
College Sophomore,4,"Bathrooms can get a little nasty, but other than that, facilities are fantastic."
College Sophomore,4,Rice is a challenging but wonderful university that has really pushed me to new limits.
Alum,2,"My experience was a blur. I don’t remember much of it, just small elements.

Rice’s culture is quirky, though not in an endearing way.  To give a few examples, during my orientation we had to take a “Purity Test”, where we were asked questions about our sex history, such as whether we had ever jacked off with someone else in the room, if we were virgins, had we ever been with two or more people at once. We didn’t have to supply our answers to each specific question but were asked for total scores at the end.

There was this one tradition where students would wrap this tall tower - one of the residential colleges was in a tower - in toilet paper, which was supposed to be funny apparently because the tower looked like a condom. Or I remember this one event where students were going down the street with a giant paper mache float made to look like a penis, blocking traffic several blocks down. This stuff is funny as a brief family guy gag, not so much in real life."
Sophomore,2,"Rice University caters to a specific type of student. Students are academically limited by sparse major/minor options and limited class offerings per semester. If you know without a doubt that you'd like to be an engineer or doctor, Rice could be a good fit for you. Beyond those, you may prefer a university with more options - or less of a negative stigma toward non-STEM majors. Rice does a great job of guiding you through your undergraduate career, but this may come off as patronizing for more independent students. The college system is a good support base, but in practice limits social life to your residential college. The stereotype of students staying ""behind the hedges"" is largely based on fact - students don't typically venture beyond Rice Village (a small plaza next to campus). While they may advertise themselves as a creative, ""unconventional"" university, Rice doesn't cater to a creative student, and you definitely feel the effects of such a small undergraduate population."
Sophomore,2,"Rice is not the school for me. Students are incredibly career-orientated and most are not interesting in learning.  Until 1960, it was Rice Institue, which is a much more apt title. The school and its students care very little for disciplines that are not pre-med, comp sci, or engineering. Most people are very nice and friendly, but academics are overly-intense and there's little variety in the social scene. Still, I did really like my classes and professors."
College Junior,2,"If you are sexually assaulted and you try to bring charges on the offender, the administration will block you at every avenue possible and if the offender is found guilty, they will only be given a slap on the wrist."
College Junior,2,"At Rice, the emphasis is on quantity over quality. Students take up to 6-7 classes and this takes a huge toll on the quality of the classes: students can't read or study as much for each which takes away from the richness of discussion and engagement. In fact, the students created an uproar when the school tried to reduce the credit limit to address this problem. In that campaign, we saw the worst sides of Rice come together to reveal our more permeating issues. We have sheltered pubescent suburban kids who are pining to attach to a cause and are insecure about their intellect and think crusading to be able to take 20 credit hours will make them seem passionate and smart. 

There's a lot of rote learning here. We have too many pre-meds, engineering students, and international students who come from toxic education systems and this makes the academic environment here very difficult for someone who is learning for the sake of learning. Very rarely do I walk through the commons or servery and hear conversations that are about anything other than the petty happenings around campus. 

If you want to come here to prepare a neat portfolio of accomplishments, lab experience, and grades for medical school, come. If you want a rich campus culture of discussion and embracing of difference, don't. 

The intellectual culture of Rice is dead."
College Junior,2,"Rice is great if you 1) want to work in Houston 2) want to work in oil and gas, or, 3) want to go to medical school

Rice is not particularly respected for social sciences or humanities"
College Junior,2,"Varsity sports are largely irrelevant. It's a nerd school and most students don't even know the rules of football or baseball. Nerds also like to look down on the athletes for being less accomplished on paper, and this makes for a big divide that gets athletes to live off campus and disintegrate from campus. 

The school pines for support. It desperately sends out pathetic emails begging students to attend athletic events, giving out free t-shirts, pizza, and even has an awards app to incentivize attendance. None of this works. Hardly anyone goes to any athletic events, or even knows when they're happening."
College Freshman,2,"It is hard to get into classes some times, as Rice has decreased the amount of classes offered in order to move up in college rankings. A couple departments also have troubles with maintaining a good student-professor number as Rice doesn't feel like hiring more professors despite an overwhelming number of students wanting to major in one of the affected departments."
College Freshman,2,"All of the classes I have taken so far have been taught by professors who typically don't seem enthusiastic about teaching. None of my classes, the teacher doesn't even try to engage with the students. Also, the administration doesn't respect the student body's opinion, and is limiting the number of credits we can take, despite 87% of the student body disapproving the proposal. The administration wants to keep a facade that they care about the students, but they are just doing what is best for themselves."
College Sophomore,2,"Some people love Rice, but the people who dislike it really hate it here. The college system can come off as extremely claustrophobic. Sometimes it's nice to have a little more anonymity. Everyone knows who the 'popular kids' are within a college, and it begins to feel like high school all over again - or even worse, middle school. Academics are good, but you'll be working so hard that students frequently break down because of stress. This just wasn't the school for me."
Recent Alumnus,2,Almost everyone lives on campus.  Living off-campus is a hassle.  Rice provides information booklets that help you choose the best places to live off-campus.
College Freshman,2,"Athletics are not important at Rice, and the varsity athletics department has trouble getting students to attend athletic events. However a lot of students like to participate in intramural sports and the recreation center is really nice."
College Freshman,2,"Team performance is great, as expected of D-1 athletes. School spirit, however, is sub-par."
College Freshman,2,"I feel unsafe simply walking around campus because of the overbearing threatening presence of some people. I'm female and was completely ridiculed and basically laughed out of the rec center because I wasn't ""using heavy enough weights"". My roommate got sexually assaulted within the first week of school here. It's just very unsafe feeling overall."
College Sophomore,2,"It can be very difficult to find housing for a decent price, with a reliable landlord."
College Sophomore,2,It is fairly difficult to maintain good grades
College Freshman,2,"Lots of weed on-campus. You'll definitely find people who do that. There's definitely a harder underground drug-culture, as evidenced by the two deaths this year, but that's not noticeable at all. You'd really have to seek it out. 

The public parties are fun for people who don't drink if they like dancing, but more private parties would be pretty awkward if you don't drink. However, people who don't drink have fun if their friends don't as well."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is a frustrating endeavor, but manageable. The only real complaint is cost."
College Freshman,2,"Unless you're an upperclassman, you can't get a parking space in the lots by the dorms. Instead, you park in West Lot, which is by the stadium. It's a 5-10 minute walk, but there's a shuttle that can take you around faster. "
College Freshman,2,If you don't drink there's not much to do. 
Sophomore,1,"My experience at Rice was both good and bad.  Rice has some amazing people, however, they are very poor at having unique ideas.  The University follows the same mindset and it is assumed everyone thinks the same.  Sadly if you disagree with the majority you get placed out and feel very unwelcomed."
Sophomore,1,"There are many things I could say about Rice, but I think this one point is the most important:

Students at Rice are not happy. 

Thanks to this suffocating environment driven by grades and elitism, many students go through mental crises everyday. We have a Facebook page called ""Places I've Cried"" where only a fraction of students express their dissatisfaction  towards their student life. How does Rice affect me? It almost made me forsake my religion. It still tears at my emotions every day. Rice sucks, and I regret coming here."
Junior,1,"As a current junior at Rice, I’m here to tell you that the #1 Quality of Life rating is a lie. Many students are depressed or suffer from anxiety due to overly stressful classes, students rarely get to explore Houston (which is a shame, considering all the great restaurants and art there is in Houston), and the administration and teachers rarely listen to students’ complaints and suggestions. While there are a sizable number of students that are able to thrive in the very intense environment Rice cultivates, I would say an equally sizable number of students do not. Much of the image of Rice that is portrayed on sites like these is not real. The students, while generally a very nice group, are subvertly competitive, comparing internships and lack of sleep and number of friends and how very, very busy they are. The teaching excellence that Rice was once known for has fallen on the wayside."
Niche User,1,"This school is only a good fit for a rare type of student. Some love it, but those who hate it truly despise it and succumb to pure bitterness. The administration is trying to improve the atmosphere by limiting the maximum number of credit hours, setting up sexual assault prevention programs, etc., but the student body is hopeless. The students are nice overall but imbalanced, prone to alcoholism on this wet campus, and unable to care for themselves (poor eating/sleeping habits). Combine this immaturity with the grade deflation policies, which limit the number of students who can earn an ""A"" in certain classes to 15%, and students have breakdowns. I wish I had attended a state school with no hyper-competitiveness and normal students."
College Junior,1,"Our athletes are here because they are smart, not because they are good at sports."
College Junior,1,"Rice advertises a low class size. I know of two ways that Rice manipulates this statistic: 

Rice strictly caps class registration to 15 in the fall, preventing professors from adding even one additional student. However, spring registration is uncapped. US News runs rankings on fall statistics. 

Senior design courses in engineering are taught in a 20-30 person classroom, but students special register in ""classes"" of 5 students."
College Freshman,1,"Really, the residential college system is the Greek life. We just don't call it that. But people actually find it a great alternative. No one really wants Greek life the way the residential college system is set up."
College Freshman,1,"Yes, there are parties EVERYWHERE ALL THE TIME, but for a person who doesn't enjoy partying it's basically hell on earth. You can't escape the peer pressure and it's hard to focus on classwork because of it."
College Freshman,1,"There's not much school spirit when it comes to athletics, except for from the Marching Owl Band (the MOB)--but they're a different story.
The blunt truth is that we really don't win a lot.  It was a REALLY big deal when we beat Air Force in a bowl game this spring.

As a non-athlete, I haven't spent much time in the sports facilities, but from what I've seen, they seem well-maintained."
College Sophomore,1,"parking for commuter students is way farther than some residential students, even after you are forced to move off campus due to shortage. our parking is significantly more expensive than University of Houston, and parking enforcement looks to generate revenue. they are really inconsistent with their ticketing  "
College Senior,1,Houston Has Many Problems – The good thing about Houston is that its in the South and has therefore some Southern culture.
College Freshman,1,Parking cops watch really closely to where and how long you are parked. They are vultures!
Recent Alumnus,1,Not for those who don't appreciate the unexpected – The weather here is erratic. It rains one minute and is humid the next. We've had hurricanes hit Rice too.
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking on campus is expensive and far from the dorms. Traffic officers are extremely trigger happy when issuing tickets.
College Junior,1,"Leaves Much to Be Desired – Though it could certainly be worse, parking availability for resident students is limited to the lots on the far side of campus (about a 15 min. walk if the shuttles aren't running), and off-campus students must walk further. Additionally, there is no free parking; the lot that *was* free now charges. Even though it's only $1/day, it's inconvenient that students must adhere to the school's decisions in order to keep the community off of Rice property.
Also, parking is limited to those who can afford it; many resident students park in the ""off campus"" parking lot because $400 for different inconvenient spot does not seem worth it to them, and the closer you want to park to the colleges (dorms) the more the price increases on those spots.
It also seems unfair that what few spots students have must be relinquished to visitors and alumni during special events. Granted, it may be necessary, however the least the school could do is have it NOT be at the students' expense."

Junior,5,It is a beautiful campus and there are great teachers and classes. Feel safe during the COVID times.
Junior,5,All of my classes have been online and they have been easy to follow along. Most teachers respond to questions and emails in a timely manner.
Freshman,5,The teachers are very understanding when it comes to trying to figure out how to do certain assignments online. I personally had little to no issues.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy being at Lindenwood ! The environment is very good. The students and staff are very welcoming and kind.
Senior,5,As an online student this experience was definitely new and something to get use to but the professors and portals that are set in place make it easy to adjust. All of the courses I’ve taken was equipped with a clear syllabus and everything that was needed to succeed in the course. The work load for some courses would be a bit more but overall it was always tutoring options offered and any assistance available from the professors.
Senior,5,"Overall I feel Lindenwood is a great University, I’m a transfer student and was able to bring in majority of my credits which is a huge plus. The administrators was very hands on and clear with communication for transferring and with any questions I’ve had once I was accepted. A lot of the professors I’ve experience thus far are very helpful and available when need be, this school has been a great experience for me with transferring and as a student."
Freshman,5,I overall love the school! The small classrooms allow you to connect better with your classmates and the professors to get a better understanding of the material. The campus is beautiful and the facilities are fine! Some buildings could use an updating but nothing serious.
Junior,5,Great school for working adults with family no hiccups during the pandemic and the instructors have been superb at online teaching. Especially now because they're available now more than ever.  Awesome
Junior,5,Started out with in classroom instructions but now we're online and I personally think the pandemic has made me a better student. It's given me the time to truly focus on the course material and gain a full understanding of how each course could be beneficial to me since I'm not as busy as I was prior to the the pandemic.
Junior,5,"The professors were very willing to work with my schedule, being an essential worker and putting in the hours to fight the virus. The online classes were much easier to follow because lectures were recorded and we had more chances to rewind for a better understanding of each subject."
Freshman,5,I like that they offer a lot of diversity and the staff there are very helpful! The food is great and the atmosphere there is awesome.
Freshman,5,they were very nice and pleasant. I think I would go here again if I was a new incoming freshman! The campus is clean.
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved Lindenwood University and all that this educational institution had to offer! I studies my BFA in acting, and felt right at home within the theater program! The teaching was applicable, and helped challenge the students to grow incredibly in their time there."
Sophomore,5,The school is amazing lots of things to do on the weekends. Very welcoming staff. Lots of events and activities to get involved in. All staff is supportive and willing to work with student if the need help. Lots of resources available if needed.
Freshman,5,Lindenwood's Motto - Real Experience ; Real Success. The quality of education and a holistic approach to individual development and assessment compelled me to select Lindenwood's progressive education system. It is a diverse liberal arts college.
Freshman,5,I am actually looking to attend this school in the upcoming semester. They currently partner with my job so that I am able to attend school with a Letter of Credit as I am having issues getting federal funding. I have been waiting over 3 years to have prior student loans dismissed and they are still working with me!
Graduate Student,5,Deciding to go here for my MFA was honestly the best decision.  I love the culture here and the diversity and enjoy the fact that everyone is so friendly.  Being able to have professors who are always ready to answer questions and help is one of the things that was high on my list for school.  They want their students to grow and improve and I really appreciate the help.
Freshman,5,it is such a beautiful campus.  The classrooms and education are great.  The friends you make are awesome.  the food is delicious. the dorms provide a great amount of space and I feel very safe going to this school.
Sophomore,5,I like the atmosphere and the small class sizes. The faculty are extremely competent and they enjoy seeing their students succeed. The surrounding city has a lot of character with the historic district being a short walk down the street. The only complaint that I have is that their food court is lacking a diverse selection for meals.
Freshman,5,I have only been at lindenwood for a short time but so far it has been an amazing experience. Teachers are friendly and truly do care about you're well being. Other students are friendly and willing to help if needed. So far I can say I look forward to the rest of my time at this school.
Senior,5,"My experience at Lindenwood University has greatly exceeded any expectations I could have possibly had before attending. I knew I wanted to go to this school the second I saw the campus. The campus is gorgeous and is just a walk away from the beautiful and historic Main Street of St. Charles. I've had great experiences in the class environments and most of my professors have been highly attentive and extremely helpful. Lindenwood has also given me the opportunity to do hands-on work in my field of study and make many connections while finishing up my degree. Overall, I will always be extremely grateful for deciding to attend Lindenwood."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Lindenwood. It is the perfect size in regards to students. I see new faces everyday along with a few familiar faces as well. I love the amount of students per class too because it allows me to have strong connections with my professors. Lindenwood also has super nice facilities and is a beautiful campus.
Freshman,5,"For someone who was involved in extracurriculars, sports, spirit, and fun in high school Lindenwood are perfect for. With small classroom sizes and personalized teaching, it helps the fears that come with college go away."
Graduate Student,5,I love Lindenwood. Admin is organized and respond to inquiries in a timely manner. My professors are helpful and provided the resources their students need to succeed.
Senior,5,I really have enjoyed my transfer experience into Lindenwood. They are very welcoming and it's a good campus climate to be apart of.
Niche User,5,Lindenwood University is a very unique college. The atmosphere is great every student is kind and generous to one another. The campus is very clean and maintained. The professors help you whenever you need it. The only thing I didn't like much was there wasn't many food choices you can pick from but other than that everything is excellent.
Freshman,5,"I love how everyone is so nice, & welcoming. Everything is easy to find. Everyone that attends Lindenwood University are really nice, & always down to help whenever someone needs it."
Freshman,5,"Good experience at this university. It's a small private campus but it is pretty. Everyone kinda knows each other in a way if you are involved. The staff here is nice, but you have to make it to where they know you are trying."
Freshman,5,The school's fashion design program is really good. They have a good looking campus. They are all about helping a student receive they education they need for their future.
Junior,5,"Excellent, if you like smaller class sizes, lots of free amenities like a gym, game rooms, assistance, clinic on site, Lindenwood is for you."
Niche User,5,Lindenwood is an amazing University. The staff members are very passionate about the student's education. This University has multiple locations that make it easily accessible.
Freshman,5,I am very excited to be part of this university. The atmosphere is very relaxed and laid back. Admissions was beyond helpful. I have been able to reach out to them multiple times for the past year and they have gone above and beyond to answer all my questions. The baseball program impressed me that they gave a very high graduation rate and maintain a high gpa as a team. The dorms are nice and clean and very spacious. There are a lot of food options. I am happy that class size will actually be smaller than my high school. I feel I will get plenty of personalized attention here.
Junior,5,"I transferred to Lindenwood from a fine arts school. I am now in the BFA program here, studying with an emphasis in pre-art therapy. The campus is well-maintained, and very safe. The library is amazing, and the technology that the classrooms are equipped with is more than satisfactory. There are diverse course offerings, and many different opportunities. One of my favorite things about LU is the diversity in students. Lindenwood has made my return to school a pleasant experience, and I am looking forward to what the future holds."
Sophomore,5,"Lindenwood’s small univeristy “home-y” feel has made me so happy with my college choice.  Professors actually take the time to get to know their students and do whatever it takes to help them succeed.  With all of the clubs, sports teams and other campus activities it truly feels like home away from home."
Niche User,5,"The campus is really nice and open, everyone there is nice and friendly. The campus is really clean and all looks new! Surrounded by plenty of things to do, wonderful professors."
Graduate Student,5,I recently completed my undergraduate degree through their night program for working adults and I loved it so much I'm going back for my graduate degree. The teachers were friendly and knowledgeable and the schedule was really convenient.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love my school! I am a sophmore and when I started I was suffering from severe anxiety and depression and since I have grown so much. I have met so many amazing people and my professors aren’t so understanding and actually care about my well being and success. Everyone is so welcoming and supporting of all of my disabilities and friendly enough to encourage me to get involved around campus. My grades have never been better and I have Ana amazing gpa thanks to my professors who care about my success here at lindenwood.
Sophomore,5,"Lindenwood offers many different degree options that make it easy to find one that is best for you. Many students come from diverse backgrounds that aids in the college experience. Everyone on campus is very friendly and helpful, which is always an advantage over other schools!"
Alum,5,Lindenwood has been a great asset to working full time and completing my degree through the accelerated cluster evening program.
Freshman,5,Lindenwood University is a lovely college. It is on a beautiful campus and there are so many different opportunities.
Alum,5,"I loved Lindenwood. I was on the gymnastics team, and all the coaches are so encouraging and positive. Lindenwood has a great atmosphere and such a beautiful campus. I also love the small class size and being able to go to teachers and get help."
Freshman,5,Lindenwood University is a University were it is easy to make your new home. The atmosphere on campus make you feel safe while walking around and at home. The size of the campus is perfect because it is not too big you need a car to drive to your classes but it’s large enough that you do not see the same people everyday. The professors are interested in how you are doing personally as a student and are willing to do anything to help you achieve the grade you want.
Senior,5,Lindenwood is one of the best schools that I have attended. The instructors are very knowledgeable about the courses that they teach. They are very concern about their students and make themselves available for the student. The financial aid department works directly with the students to help them find funds available for tuition. There is diversity in the school and zero tolerence for discrimination.
Freshman,5,"As an incoming freshman my experience at Lindenwood has been excellent! From the admissions office to the financial aid office to the women's soccer coaches. The people and coaches are ready to help and are genuinely excited about me becoming a Lady Lion and student. My decision to enroll at Lindenwood was based on their beautiful and safe campus, the amazing athletic dept. and coaches and the many options I have as I'm still choosing a career. I am beyond excited to start my college experience here at Lindenwood and have no doubt it will prepare me for a successful future."
Freshman,5,"I will be an incoming freshman and I have been interested in LU since junior year. The administration has been very helpful and helped guide me throughout high school. I went to take a tour in St. Charles (I live in Baltimore MD) and the scene is gorgeous! Everything is historic and the people are so friendly. I was advise to join a sorority and it will boost my experience, which I think that I will do! My only worry is that I'm very social and very eager to make friends and go out at night, but it doesn't seem to be a school that has night life. I plan on getting my Public Health sciences degree at LU."
Senior,5,"I like that Lindenwood University has a program that helps working adults get their degree.   I don't think I would have been able to finish school without this program.   The small size classroom one one interaction with the teacher, has been a bonus for me.   And not to mention the classes are only once a week makes it even better.  As of now I'm on track to graduate next month,  and it is all because of the accelerated program."
Sophomore,5,Lindenwood is actually a great small school with a variety of students. Things that should change are visitation policies and the meal plan options.
Senior,5,I love the school and surrounding community. The professors are easy to get along with and always willing to assit you when needed.
Freshman,5,"I have not yet attended linden wood university but when i Visited there, I could not have felt more at home."
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere at Lindenwood. The classes are small so students are able to get to know their professors and other students. The professors and staff genuinely care about the students and are willing to help out. The campus is beautiful and well kept. There are always events happening on campus so there is always something to do.
Niche User,5,"What can i say the campus is huge, beautiful. the athletic stats are looking terrific. i'm hooked. i'm really impressed."
Niche User,5,The college campus is clean and spread out. The class sizes are small allowing one on one between a professor and student. The food is somewhat good but is appropriate for the college environment. The college is one of the top ranked colleges for academics and especially athletics. There are 52 athletic programs in the college itself. About less then half of the percentage of students are all attending while on a sports team. 
College Freshman,5,"Everyone involved in sports are very dedicated, and it seems as if a majority of students are on an athletic team.  Of course, I myself am I highly involved in an athletic team, so my answer may be skewed a bit."
College Freshman,5,"When you say you are going to Lindenwood people in town ask you ""What sport do you play?"". That's how big of a athletic college it is. They have everything from billards to rugby. Rugby, football and basketball are very popular. A majority of sports teams are the top in the nation here."
College Senior,5,The class sizes are absolutely perfect. Love the one on one with most professors. the quality and variety of the courses is great.
College Senior,5,It is fairly easy to get into campus housing. it's definitely the better option. Convenience and social atmosphere are great.
College Senior,5,Student involvement is amazing and team spirit is very high. The teams are at the top of their game. It's very exciting to be a part of the athletic teams.
College Senior,5,The counselors and teachers have been wonderful. very helpful and friendly.
College Junior,5,"Since Lindenwood is not a huge school, thw ampunt of students per class is perfect. There are about 20 to 30 students per class so it is very easy to seek attention from professors."
College Junior,5,Some parties but not many.
Alum,4,Lindenwood University has a beautiful campus.  My experience at Lindenwood was good.  The teachers push you to achieve your goals and stay focused.
Alum,4,"I took several online classes during my time at Lindenwood.  Overall, my experience was good.   The shorter 8 week courses would be a little overwhelming at times with the immense amount of work fit into a little learning window period."
Freshman,4,"My online classes were average. I was assigned much less homework, so online classes were much easier then in person. However, teachers did not communicate extremely well, especially the older ones. This made for some misunderstandings but it was a smooth transition overall"
Junior,4,"I love Lindenwood! Overall, I enjoy the classes, people, professors, and culture of the school. There are some professors I had have issues with in the past, but they have been resolved. I would highly recommend Lindenwood if you are a music or education major."
Freshman,4,I love how my professors really care about my successes and they want to help me achieve my goals. I have also made a ton of friends and connections through Lindenwood. Im also on the water polo team that won nationals this year which was really amazing
Freshman,4,"I love Lindenwood University because of the staff's commitment to excellence. Every single professor here will know you on a first name basis. The class sizes are very small (less than 30 students), therefore you will get the help you may need."
Junior,4,I like the campus itself and the fact that all of the professors I've had have at least a Master's in their field. The lack of parking is an issue considering how many commuters they have.
Senior,4,It has been a good experience overall. My advisor was great with helping me pick the best classes for my situation and has made several other recommendations that were good. They are changing the format of their adult classes which will cause issues for some students.
Freshman,4,"I love Lindenwood. The people are very academic and all-around fun! I gave LU 4 stars because it has its flaws, but every school does. Since it’s pretty small, there isn’t much that can be done to change dining plans or dorm residency, but I think freshmen would enjoy better visitation rules. Go Lions!"
Sophomore,4,"I am attending Lindenwood via online access.  So I can't speak on the campus or normal student life.  However, I can speak so far on the instructors I have had.  The instructors have been very knowledgable.  The only issues that I see is the technical aspects of the canvas program, and some of the classes that are designed to be taken.  A four week course online isn't logical for full time parents or employees.  Online courses are normally taken by people that are full time employees or parents who can't attend an in person class.  Dealing with work and/or kids on a daily basis doesn't leave a lot of time to read multiple pages, doing multiple papers, doing multiple quizzes, and discussion forums in a one weeks time period."
Senior,4,"This University is well connected throughout the St.Louis area. Because of that I have found jobs and internships. The professors make an effort to really show you that they care and want to see you succeed. Although, the university lacks in diversity and the on campus experience can be dull, the opportunities are endless."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed my classes at Lindenwood, but overall, it was alright. There were a lot of cliques due to the overcrowding of student athletes. The campus was pretty, but inaccessible to walkers with the hills and lack of salting during snow. The library was my favorite building on campus, and I hope eventually the rest of the buildings get updated in the same way."
Sophomore,4,Great small University with plenty of student athletes. Good mix of historic sites and modern facilities. Wide range of sport and activities.
Graduate Student,4,"Great, easy to access.  Good class selection, registration is easy.  Friendly staff.  Widely recognized degree."
Senior,4,I enjoyed how it allowed me to grow as an individual. The academics have allowed me to discover what I plan to start a career in. The student life has allowed myself become friends with many other individuals.
Alum,4,I had a great experience at LU and I miss my time there. I was a science major and the resources for science majors is limited but  I do feel like I was still able to graduate with a good foundation of knowledge.
Junior,4,I recently just started taking classes at Lindenwood and so far it is a really good experience. Every week or so I get an email talking about some events and activities that make sure a student is always involved with the campus.
Junior,4,I love how interested the professors are in actually getting to know their students and how invested they are in making sure that students do the best of their abilities to succeed in their future endeavors. Lindenwood University is a school where I feel at home and really feel accepted for who I am as a student and learner in the classroom.
Junior,4,Needs more Involvement that will actually appeal to the students going there not just the freshmen. The freshman experience is pretty dull and could be better than what it actually is.
Senior,4,"I am enrolled into the accelerated program. It took some adjusting but once I got the hang of the class structure, I don't believe I would like to go back to traditional classes."
Senior,4,"I liked the communication with my advisor and the availibility of the instructors in person and online. I love the ADP program, it allows me to continue working my FT job, go to school one night a week and complete and receive my degree."
Freshman,4,"I would really like to see policies change. It is very hard to present a case to the staff as they do not always get back in a timely manner and it is hard to obtain answers. However, the educational aspect of Lindenwood University is amazing. The teachers really know their material and are passionate about helping their students learn the material as well."
Freshman,4,Lindenwood is a fun diverse campus with plenty of activities to do. There is something going on every week so that students can get involved and show their school spirt. There is also a wide variety of sports offered for our student athletes to play. People here are very friendly and helpful. There is always something to do so that students will not be bored. The neighborhood is a very nice and welcoming neighborhood and some places offer discounts for Lindenwood students such as 10 percent discounts on food.
Sophomore,4,Lindenwood University is a small campus that offers a variety of majors. it offers a Greek life. There are many activities offered for those who choose to live on campus.  It is located close enough to large venue areas so there are activities to go to such as concerts and sporting events.
Freshman,4,"The experience has been good. It's not excellent, specially as a science major, because the installations for science related things are not so good. The academics are average, not too bad neither. Dorms are somewhat bad, the beds are not so great and they are pretty small."
Graduate Student,4,My degree program and professors were great. Especially Audra. The historical essence of the campus makes it feel more comforting.
Freshman,4,Lindenwood University provides students the smaller college experience. It provides fewer parties but quality professors and campus life.
Niche User,4,The staff was helpful and responsive.  I haven't had a lot of experience with them but I am considering attending because of the flexible scheduling of the advanced coursework.
Junior,4,"Lindenwood is a beautiful campus that offers a number of new buildings and dorms but still has a nostalgic feel. It is truly a diverse campus. You make friends with people from around the world. The classrooms are small enough to have an engaging dialogue with classmates and professors. Most professors are always accessible when  additional assistance is needed as well as tutors or resource labs. 

Lindenwood provides a number of student life activities. No matter what your interest is you will find an activity of interest."
Freshman,4,I like how Lindenwood University's campus is very small and the walk to class is only 5 minuets. If I was to change something about Lindenwood Universitys campus it would be the food that they offer. The food here is not very good and it is always the same choices everyday.
Sophomore,4,The professors I have encountered so far have really been all about the success of the students. Everyone on campus is very helpful and want to make sure the students are achieving everything they would like.
Junior,4,"I love Lindenwood because I have made an experience out of my time here. I knew I needed to get involved on campus in order to make friends, have fun, and get the college experience that I want! Overall, my Major and Minor professors (art and education) have been excellent. The Gen Ed teachers are alright, some are amazing and some should probably be fired. Campus life and party life are good for me because I am a social person. Food is alright. Spellmann is great with Sushi, Chic-fil-a, Qdoba, etc., but you never know what you're in for at Evans. It's hard to be healthy at this school. The campus is beautiful, and if you make friends easily like me, you don't have a problem with the commuter culture."
Junior,4,I have enjoyed my time at Lindenwood and have met so many great people! I would recommend this school to anyone.
Sophomore,4,"So far, I personally have had a good experience with Lindenwood University. There are a ton of different people with different ethnicities/backgrounds here so that's a bonus. However, some things that need to be changed or added that would be helpful is the addition of more school food vendors and Greek life as far as sororities go."
Sophomore,4,"I love this school. I feel perfectly at home in the environment there, however, I think their freshman program could use a lot of work."
Sophomore,4,Lindenwood University provides an excellent opportunity to engage in different subjects while learning how to adapt to an ever-changing world.
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful. The art department is below average. It is more of an exercise science based school, however, there is a wide range of diversity."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the campus and if you live on the old side every thing is close except for the buffet and gym. It's very pretty during the fall and has historic buildings. The teachers are usually understanding and helpful. Most homework is online. But, it's very difficult to find parking spots and some classes are off of campus which is a pain to get to."
Senior,4,"Going to Lindenwood University would be ideal for those that live in the area, but don't want to travel too far to go to school. My dorm is quiet for the most part, there is a large variety of food, there are many conveniences near campus, and professors and students alike are very friendly. There are also many events that occur on campus during certain parts of the year, such as the Dark Carnival in October or the Christmas Walk in December. This university has a small college feel that can be a good feeling for students that are not used to bigger schools. Going to Lindenwood University is certainly an experience within itself."
Freshman,4,The location of Lindenwood University truly is like no other. The historic setting of the surrounding community makes for a unique experience at this 1827 est. college. The professors are generally friendly and care about their students' education.
Junior,4,"I really enjoy how diverse the campus is. There is a variety of cultures from around the world. If I were to change anything, it would be to have a better variety of food. It tastes decent enough, but it is typically the same stuff everyday."
College Freshman,4,"So far I really enjoy my overall experience at this school.  I've had a lot of experiences that I wouldn't have otherwise, and the classes are fun.  Teachers are easy to talk to.  My room and room mate are definitely bearable.  The campus is gorgeous, though really hilly.  The sport I am in has already offered me so many opportunities through this school and I've only been here a month!"
College Freshman,4,"I don't mind the short visiting hours, and the room I was placed in is spacious.  My floor is loud, but great, everyone's very social and we all get along pretty well."
College Freshman,4,"I love it so far.  It's very similar difficulty-wise to the community college I was at in High School, however granted I am taking easy classes at the moment.  The teachers are easy to talk to.  Our rugby team is amazing, and is the main reason why I wanted to come here (to join the team).  Lindenwold has a beautiful campus as well, and the dorm rooms are larger then what I had expected."
College Senior,4,"I haven't used the career center, but prospects have been surprisingly good and they are impressed with the degree I am obtaining here."
College Senior,4,I feel very safe on campus. My friends and I always take precautions ourselves.
College Junior,4,There are always speakers who come to our campus and provide help and guidance towards our careers.
College Junior,4,We have security driving around constantly as well as emergency alarms around campus
College Junior,4,"Great, but really strict visitation rules"
College Junior,4,"A small school, but wouldn't trade it for amy other school because of the great people I have met."
College Junior,4,The quality of the courses are great. The professors are easy to talk to.
College Junior,4,The university holds lots of career fairs during the school year.
College Junior,4,I feel safe on campus. Security is always on campus.
College Junior,4,Athletics are big at my school. There is lots of school spirit and student involvement.
College Junior,4,"My school is unique because it's a small university with majority students being athletes. Every week there is something going on at my university. It never gets boring. They are extremely supportive when it comes to finals week! They bring puppies so students can take a break from stressing while studying. They also host a ""midnight"" breakfast during finals week. It's really a unique school."
College Junior,4,"Linnenwood is an absolutely gorgeous school. The campus is fairly small, and classes are very close. For the most part, everyone is kind and engaging. It's a lot of fun."
College Junior,4,I had many professors that were helpful and passionate about their subject. They were open to questions. I like the smaller class sizes.
College Junior,4,"I feel pretty safe on campus. Sure, I don't want to wander in the woods at night, but the crime rate is pretty low. Mostly alcohol possession or car break ins."
College Junior,4,"My old dorm used to be next to the stadium. On game nights, the bleachers and parking lots were packed. My classes are filled with student athletes and the facilities are definitely one of the reasons new students come in."
College Junior,4,"I really love my school. The campus is gorgeous and while it's a small school, it's not so small that it feels secluded. The only complaint I have is that we are watched like hawks. We are all adults. We deserve to be treated as such. Enough with the curfew. Enough with the ""leave the doors cracked"". If any one is doing something their not supposed to do, you having them sign in or out is NOT going to stop them from doing it."
Junior,2,"Great business school and academic facilities. Athletics are highly supported at the university, except for accountability within the athletic administration. Student athletes are frequently treated as just numbers to bring more financial support to the school, but overall a good university for non-athletes. Campus is small and the classes are intimate, but there is not a lot of dining options either."
Junior,2,"Lindenwood has a lot of bugs that it has to work out. Right now it functions more like a glorified high school than a college. There are a lot of rules in place that leave little freedom to both students and professors. The administration is a problem here. They say they want to make changes, and to some extent they do, but very rarely is it in the actual interest of the student body. I came here mainly for the athletic opportunities, and I love my team, but I really wish I could transplant the team to a school that I would be prouder to represent."
Junior,2,Tuition is too expensive for what students get for it. Paying insane amounts of money for the bare minimum.
Alum,2,"It is located in St. Charles area where people (including the local) are close minded and you see discrimination against minorities (i.e, racial, homosexual, people with disabilities, etc.)"
Freshman,2,"Food is subpar.  First and foremost, as you'll be eating here every day with very little variety.  The academics are not challenging at all and classes focus more on attendance than anything else, I have learned very little since arriving here.  The visitation rules are incredibly strict all over campus, and they treat students as if they are not the adults they are.  Academic and financial advisors, as well as the people who are supposed to be in charge, seem to have difficulty doing their job-advising.  Getting any paperwork through or finding out something you need to know is a frustrating and round-about process.  My first dorm room also became filled with mold, a situation that was very poorly handled in my opinion as they almost didn't let my roommate and I stay in a different room.  Just not a good experience so far.  The sports are great, though."
College Junior,2,Many professors aren't well-educated in their subject so I honestly haven't gained much knowledge. They are mostly personal and approachable though.
College Freshman,2,If you are sick they wont let you into the nurses office because you could be contagious. they are their to help yet they don't. even if it is covered under insurance.
College Freshman,2,"They do not treat us like adults we have curfews, no access to a kitchen, microwaves are terrible. The A/C and Heating system is terrible."
College Freshman,2,It's sad being around the seniors. They are so done and so ready to leave by the time their four years are up.
College Junior,2,"Living on campus is interesting. If you live in a newer dorm, it is much nicer but you are far away from the class buildings. The older dorms are close to the class buildings but are falling apart. There is also campus housing, which are dumpy houses that the university has purchased for students to live in. Mine had mold growing in it that was not addressed by the school. It also felt unsafe and dirty."
College Junior,2,"Greek life doesn't really do anything here. There are sororities and fraternities, but there is not much enthusiasm around them. We are a dry campus, so it really does not surprise me."
College Freshman,2,Not much partying here on campus
College Junior,2,"If you're looking to be a commuter student and you're from the STL area, then this school is for you. The kids looking for a school to go to for partying, meeting friends, and making crazy memories should not go here. I have never been so upset in my life. In order for me to find fun while at school, I had to wait until I was 21, and even then it was still annoying because no one is allowed to have house parties or even little get togethers. Boys are not even allowed in girls' on campus houses at any time. You could get thrown out of school if you're caught more than two times. Any interaction with the opposite sex outside of the classroom is like a sin at this school. The only reason I attended this school was because I was given a lot of money to come here, but if I could have had the opportunity to go somewhere else for more money, I would have left in a second. I feel as thought I was cheated out of the college experience when coming to this school. I was from out of state, so I was not aware that the rules were so harsh. I was definitely hoodwinked. I do not think any college should look down upon people hanging out together on the weekends. I graduated and all, but I am so jealous of all of the other people I know who loved their college experience more than words could describe."
College Freshman,2,It's college food. Not great college food from my experience.
College Junior,2,Lindenwood is a dry campus so students must leave campus in order to be in a party scene.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Dry campus and visitation hours, so you have to seriously break rules (usually get caught - isn't worth it)."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The university tends to be very ""generous"" with all scholarships and a work-and-learn program. However, you are forced to take only 1 very inflexible meal plan that kills your pocket book while offering very little pay off. I personally wrestled my way out of this one due to personal circumstances and faced about the same number of helpful and kind faculty as I did rude, bitter, and other negative moods from people who seem to look down their nose at students. It doesn't make sense to me."
College Freshman,2,St. charles is very boring and has no public transportation.
Recent Alumnus,2,"No scholarships, Im paying 100% out of my pocket and it sucks! i told my parents I can do it, by myself... well its hard when you have no financial aid"
Recent Alumnus,2,I hate greek life because they always think they are so much better than anyone else. I'm sorry you have to pay a hefty fee to make friends. Just not my thing.
College Junior,2,"The institution does not offer any individual institutional scholarships. There are work-and-learn experiences that somewhat makes up for this. I am a graduate assistant who was lucky to be hired for an assistantship, but it has been a confusing experience. It seems that the offices of Financial Aid, the Business Office, and those who are in charge of Graduate Assistantships are not at all on the same page. Further, it is not clear whether or not additional fees (such as online fees) are covered by GA work."
College Sophomore,2,"I am from Florida and am not used to the cold and the snow. I prefer warm weather , I enjoy it more. Its hard to get to classes when it snows."
College Sophomore,2,There isn't really anything healthy or close by to get food. 
College Sophomore,2,"The dinning area needs to be bigger I believe. Also, there should be more parking. Another thing that should be changed is different atmosphere in the dorms where we can have visitation at any time the student wants."
College Sophomore,2,The food option are awful especially for being an athlete. The food quality is not very good either. 
College Senior,2,parking is limited or might be far away from the building where your class is located.
College Freshman,2,I wouldnt advise anyone to go to my school.
College Freshman,2,We have a ton of diversity on this campus. The amount of international students is just unreal. 
College Freshman,2,The campus is still very young and new projects are always in the works. In  five years this school will be solid in terms of facilities.
College Freshman,2,"Jamestown is the main off campus apartments which are nothing to be praised but can be nice if you take car of your place. They are kind of strict on out door parties at night, but you can do whatever inside. You can rent houses all over the near by neighborhoods pretty easily and affordable."
College Freshman,2,"Our campus is located only about 2 to 3 miles away from downtown Belleville which is nice, if you have a car "
College Freshman,2,"Its the general Midwest, and I like the warm weather. So you can expect the the cold is really my favorite thing to feel. There's not too much rain and the wind isn't overbearing."
College Sophomore,2,"If you do not live on campus, good luck finding a place to park."
College Sophomore,2,"Really not great. Vegetarian and gluten free options are very hard to find. The food is also low quality, and the dining halls are open for a very limited amount of time."
College Sophomore,2,st.louis is know for its crazy weather. the weather is very unpredictable it can be 80 degrees one day and 62 the next day
College Sophomore,2,"many of the dining area are your average fast food resturants, but im sure someone can find a unique resturant around"
College Senior,2,"St. Louis experiences lots of weather changes, such as rain, sleet, snow, hail, extremely high temperatures, and tornados. This can cause a problem because all buildings are not near one another. Emails are sent out frequently regarding weather"
College Sophomore,2,I am a student athlete and the dining room closes at 7pm which I usually cannot make due to practice so most nights we have to go off campus to find supper. I attend lindenwood Belleville also btw...
College Senior,2,"There is no on campus transportation system, you walk everywhere or if you have a car you can drive. I'm giving it a C because walking is good and you don't really need a form of transportation."
College Freshman,2,Majors are not challenging. Only a few very engaging professors on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Student and athletic centers are updated and awesome, but campus events and activities lack. Many students go home on the weekends."
College Junior,2,"There is only fast food dining near the campus, which is not the best for me because I'm not the biggest fan of fast food"
College Freshman,2,"Students do not get involve in sports. Football, baseball, and basketball games are almost empty sometimes."
College Sophomore,2,"I live in Guffey, arguable the chillest dorm here.  The dorm life is all too quiet and very few people are here to do things.  Almost all of the partying takes place off-campus (being dry as it is).  The cost is almost reasonable if they took a bit better care of it but that is because students work to pay for loans by cleaning the dorms.  The dorms are fairly centrally located."
College Sophomore,2,"I am too smart for this school.  To keep your scholarship you must have a 2.0 which, for some people, may be great but I like to be challenged a bit more.  The work load is light, the professors are usually good (At least the few I've had are) but I don't feel challenged."
College Junior,2,I think there is a lot offered but it overshadows teachers and school work. I think that they focus more on the sports offered than academics
College Sophomore,2,"There are some pretty girls and most of them are athletes. However, They are very conservative. Nothing is going on weekends on campus and dont expect to see too many girls in the party places because if they are under 21, they just dont go out."
College Sophomore,2,"There are 2 main dining halls, Spellman and Evans. Evans is new, but has the same things everyday. Never any difference, and most of it isn't that bad, but you only get 1 entree and a side. Spellman is older and is buffet style. The food is good about 2 a week, other than that it's ""Blah"" Most of us survive on salad bar, grilled cheese, and sandwiches. You can use flex points at the lone wolf cafes around campus, but they're all closed by 9. For breakfast and lunch you can get Grab and Go, which is where you walk in, they scan your ID, and you pick and small entree (salad or sandwich) and 3 sides and you get a drink. Its alot quicker than the cafs,
At 7 all the cafs are closed so if you want to eat after that you have to spend your money. Not pleasant."
College Sophomore,2,"Dorms:
No CoEd dorms, visiting hours during the week are from 4pm till 12am. No over night guest of the opposite sex, no alcohol, all guest must be approved ahead of time.
There are new dorms and old dorms. New dorms have airconditioning, elevators, bigger rooms, and nicer furniture, Old dorms are closer to all class rooms, on the main side of campus, and are a little cozier. Some of the old dorms have Roach and Spider problems so Bug spray and killer is a must.
Getting into housing is kind of easy but really limited. This year we had people living in dorm lounges because the over booked so many people. The dorms are really strict, especially the newer dorms. The old one are more lenient depending on the RD."
College Sophomore,2,"They Put the EW in Disgusting – St. Charles is the city of the suburbs so you get that ""city"" feel. The police will forever be up and down every apartment complex you will be in. My friend and I stayed in an apartment first semester and quickly hated the quality of the apartment and also seeing the frequent chases between the police and people on the streets."
College Sophomore,2,"Urban Myths – So I see signs up saying we have a bus for our students on campus, however, I have yet to have seen this bus. I note Lindenwood is not the largest campus it is still growing, however, I have yet to see this bus. Usually students just drive to their destinations and or walk."
College Sophomore,2,"When It Rains It Pours – My freshman year it rained literally everyday and with the campus being so spread out you better have rain boots on or else your pants will be soaked for days. The hassle of getting in and out of your car with the umbrella because everythings not close together will forever haunt me. Also, snow means nothing to Lindenwood. I feel for the commuters. However, I will say whenever it is really nice outside Lindenwood is a great campus for studying, playing music, and even just taking a nap outside."
College Freshman,2,"Fast Food – There are a lot of places to eat and a good variety of food. A lot of it is fast food, if you want good restaurants you need to drive to get it."
College Junior,2,"Not All That Great – It is essential for students to have their own computers because the computer labs are not open very long past the night hours start. There isn't any wireless access in the dorm rooms, which makes it really difficult to move around the building to work on homework. The internet is fairly fast when you are hooked up through an ethernet cable, but the internet hardly moves between 4-7 PM when many other students are also online. Students have a printing account built into tuition, but it takes a very long time for the computers in the labs to load and is often more of a hassle than it's worth."
College Freshman,2,Getting Better – There are a lot of stories about girls getting raped and people getting hurt. They are now starting to put emergency poles around campus.
College Student,2,"Belleville, IL – Belleville is a smaller town that isn't the safest. Since it's new, it's not your typical college town. There are many small stores on West Main street but there isn't much around."
College Sophomore,2,"Be Prepared for Tickets – most convenient parking lots are reserved for commuters and staff. most classes are concentrated on one general area and for those of us that live on new campus it's a bit of a walk if are in a rush. i see cars with tickets and boots almost everyday. parking for the classes is very limited. the parking for the cafs are just as bad. our parking passes only cost $2 dollars for the year, well worth it thought because dorm parking is good and the ticket for not having a pass is pretty expensive. most other colleges it costs hundred of dollars to have a car on campus."
College Freshman,2,Need More Housing – At the Belleville branch of Lindenwood University there is limited housing avaliable to students.
College Freshman,2,Life in Saint Charles – Saint Charles is a nice enough city but it's very boring.  If you are a freshman or sophomore and not 21 years of age there is hardly anything to do.  The bars on mainstreet are a big attraction for the older crowd but if you're 18 like me you pretty much just have to sit in your dorm and play Xbox.
College Junior,2,"Tough Security – Campus is a non-smoking campus and there are visitation hours for the opposite sex. If you get caught, you get punished rather strictly."
Sophomore,1,"Lindenwood University Belleville coaches recruited me to play basketball on their JV squad.  When I got there, both coaches that recruited me were no longer there.  

After my first school year, I received an email stating this University would be going to an online school.  They told me I could keep my academic scholarship and attend the bigger school.  I do not want to go to the bigger school because the classroom sizes are a lot larger and there is not a spot for me on the basketball team.  

I am really upset because I will not be able to graduate with my classmates of 2022."
Works Here,1,Went to LU - Belleville and now they are closing the campus. The poor leadership from the top caused this. LU is a shady place with shady characters.
Works Here,1,"I was and employee of this place and it had too be the worst place i ever worked!! low pay upper staff looked down on us and expected you too drive your automobile and haul work supply's be it wood furniture  too do the work around the university! with no compensation as gas and mileage! also they didn't not supply are will not supply any tools what so ever! and since i worked there i found how run down this place is and fir unsafe in some buildings as of right now, no alarm's faulty alarms mold is a big problem in a lot of dorm's personal safety with chemical clean up if need be there are no PPE's equipment and lead i am sure that has too be in these old run down building not too mention the cockroaches i have seen many time's!! i could go on but i guess you all get it!! this place is a wreck."
Alum,1,"The education and experience here is an absolute joke. Money was wasted, not well spent. My peers and I taught ourselves through YouTube, we were t taught in the classroom. I am so disappointed that I was promised a great education, it wasn't even mediocre. Don't waste your time here go somewhere else worth your while"
Senior,1,"I would not even consider this a school. This is a business that has no respect for their students whatsoever. I am graduating on Saturday and the only reason for that is because of one single professor. The rest are nothing to write home about. Why did I stay all four years? Because it's cheap and they gave me a good scholarship, which I should've considered my happiness and overall college experience before signing up to save a little bit of money. Do not go to school here, I will take it to the workplace, my future career and my grave. This is the worst school for so many reasons. It's literally not worth it."
Freshman,1,"Currently go here, do not enjoy it. Too strict with housing and visitors, feels like we are under house arrest or something. Not fun unless you play a sport, or are in greek life."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I was a business major and the teachers are all experts in their field.  Most of them are retired and now teach part-time.  However, they seemed tied to a lecture plan and were forced to use online programs that they didn't always agree with.  So some assignments were mandatory even if the teacher didn't want to assign them.  This forced the teacher into lecturing over topics revolving around the assignments, instead of teaching us about his or her personal experiences in their respective field.  I wanted to hear more about what steps they took to become successful rather than what a text book says I should do."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Lindenwood is more of a business than a teaching institution.  I transferred into Lindenwood with English Composition one and two credits, which they accepted into the traditional day classes without question, but when I applied for the night/accelerated program they told me I would have to retake the classes.  I challenged this policy and was told there wasn't a difference in curriculum, but Lindenwood wanted to build camaraderie among students by putting them all into the same cluster for their first class.  Many students were forced to pay for and take these English classes twice.  The advisors are asleep at the wheel.  I graduated and walked across the stage, but a month later was told I needed to take one more class before I would receive my diploma."
College Junior,1,"There is often theft of property on campus. Cars and dorms get broken into. I know many people who have been sexually assaulted on campus. The security here is getting better, but are still not as good as they should be for working on a college campus. We had emergency phones put in around campus and I think that has been a good thing for us. Other than that, safety precautions are lacking (especially if you live in the campuses houses/apartments)"
College Freshman,1,"Lindenwood has been the worst experience of my life. I swear, it's like you pull into campus and it's instant depression. Everything is just horrible. The teachers are horrendous, and the advisors are so much worse. When I went to my advisor about transferring she said to me ""yeah, I don't know how to do that type of stuff, you'll have to figure it out"" WORD FOR WORD. It astounds me that they actually believe their run down campus and academics are actually worth the money they're charging. No one has any idea what's going on, there is zero sense of organization. Furthermore, it's not a college town, not a college experience. They're entirely too strict, I had more freedom as a 15 year old girl than I do as a 19 year old in college. If you're ever considering this place, please look into other places. I'm so glad to be transferring at semester."
College Freshman,1,There is no party scene. I hear about things but there mostly very small.
College Junior,1,"Besides the parking, the security is why I moved off campus. Everyone is treated like criminals. I can't count how many times I got a parking ticket but the nicer car next to mine didn't get one. With Lindenwood's security it's all about what you drive and what your last name is."
College Junior,1,I dread going over my financial aid each semester. Anytime I have questions I can't seem to get the same answer from any of the financial aid advisors. It's a very frustrating process.
College Freshman,1,Its the worst food I've seriously ever eaten.
College Junior,1,We definitely need more computers in the computer lab. 
College Freshman,1,"Belleville isn't really big enough to have taxis that are available in such a way that they make an impact on life. The public transportation is just that, it's public transportation and you will see some shady characters from time to time."
College Freshman,1,The only real problem is the lack of Wi-Fi capability. Then the Cisco advisor security that you have to download to access the internet through an Ethernet cable sometimes crashes and is slow. The whole internet issue at Lindenwood - Belleville is just truelly mediocre. 
College Sophomore,1,"There is a public bus stop on campus, but other than that the local transportation consists of taxis and cabs."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus is extremely nice and many of the dorms are new and kept up, but the rules as a young adult who is finally living independently are far too strict."
College Sophomore,1,They offer very little financial aid unless your an athlete or special case. I am an A student and top 5% from my high school with 27 on ACT and they only provide $9000 for me a year. Plus they do not allow outside scholarships. Its a real pain in the ass.

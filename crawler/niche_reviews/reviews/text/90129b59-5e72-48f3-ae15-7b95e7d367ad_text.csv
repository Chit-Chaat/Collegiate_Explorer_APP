Alum,5,Professors did a great job organizing courses. Each course was easy to follow along the professors were willing to help and answer any questions. Courses were able to be completed faster than face to face classes.
Sophomore,5,I have not gotten the chance to take any online classes through Iowa Wesleyan but I’m sure they’re great!
Sophomore,5,"What I liked about Iowa Wesleyan University is the fact that everyone is so friendly. Even if you just go to the store, there will still be people waving at you, or even just asking how your day is."
Sophomore,5,I love everything about Iowa Wesleyan University. A small campus and a family like feel creates the perfect environment for me as a student
Freshman,5,"I love it! Out of all the schools I have visited, Iowa Wesleyan is that one that I feel most home at."
Sophomore,5,Iowa Wesleyan University is a very good school I think . It is a small school so you can focuse on why you are there for ! Teachers are great. They are willing to teach you one on one. To help you get it and learn the information. The town is a great and friendly place to live in . Over all I’ll give Iowa Wesleyan University a thumbs up
College Freshman,5,This campus is in a small town. So there is not a whole of danger on campus or in Mount Pleasant in general
College Freshman,5,Exercise science is one of the most popular majors on campus. The professors in this field are very caring and passionate about the field.
College Freshman,5,"I love my school and the advantages of not being ""just a number"". Iowa Wesleyan University is a small community of individuals with the same ambition to succeed in life."
College Freshman,5,"its a small school so my classes are really small and i love it, it gives me more one on one time with my teachers and it makes class decusions better and more smooth."
College Sophomore,5,There have been no incidents since I have been here. The RAs are trained to know what to do in case something does happen though.
College Sophomore,5,I am very involved and have loved my experience. I can personally say that I have grown as a person and feel more at home here than I did in high school. I feel as though the staff and faculty actually care about me as an individual. I have a voice here and it is with great pride that I say I am a tiger.
College Sophomore,5,"The rooms are a lot bigger than most colleges. The RAs are the best and very easy to get along with. The bathrooms are kept clean by the staff. Although there is only AC in certain rooms (like lobby areas), it helps you make friends with your neighbors!"
College Sophomore,5,"It is very easy to get involved!!! The sports are DIII. They are fun to watch and cheer on the TIGERS!!! The Student Union Board always has student events going on and the Greek Council tries to put on at least one event a year. The Tiger Pause (snack bar) is being redone and we are excited to see what is going to be there come fall. The boys dorm has a brand new hangout area in the basement with video games, ping pong and pool. The lounge in the girl dorm has a giant sofa, flat screen, pool table, and workout equipment."
College Sophomore,5,"The school has small class sizes, so you can get one-on-one help from teachers. It is easy to get involved. The campus is small, no need to wake up an hour before class! The farthest walk is 4 mins (2 mins if you run). Every student must complete and internship (student teaching/clinicals count) before they graduate. Service Learning is a giant part of the school and how we can give back to the community."
College Sophomore,5,As an education major I spend a lot of time in the library (that's where the EDU classes are held). Some of the classes take a lot of work outside of the classroom but those are the ones in which you learn the most from. The classes are not too easy but also aren't completely terrible. The professors will always help you after class and are easy to work with.
College Sophomore,5,The education professors will work with you to help you be accepted into the Teacher Education Program. I am going to be a sophomore and will be already accepted into the program a year ahead. The program itself is great. I was able to be in a classroom the very first year. I was in a classroom for 30+ hours and will be in another one next semester. The classes I have taken so far are very educational and have helped me grow.
College Sophomore,5,It was not too difficult to get into this school but it is not super easy to get a degree. The school requires that you take certain classes to graduate and they are classes that may not pertain to your major but are great at helping you become a well rounded person and a better learner.
College Junior,5,I'm majoring in Social Work and I love it. I will have the opportunity to help those in need. The workload and curriculum is comparable to other programs. I have not been able to complete my internship yet.
College Freshman,5,I love the school. The meals and transportation is not so well but I can handle it. I have made a lot of friends and the teachers are a great help. I am so happy that I attend this school and really plan to attend next year.
Alum,4,Did not have online courses. But any electronic communications needed were simple easy to navigate.  I had no issues using any of the technology and online learning resources. Instructors were helpful with any troubles.
Alum,4,"Great education for a University. Small class sizes offered more 1:1 time or extra time with professors anytime it was needed. Small campus, easy to get from one building to the next. Friendly environment, fellow students, and staff. Helpful staff. Located in a nice area."
Alum,4,Great science department. All of the professors are willing to help and know you personally. Has lots of resources to assist students. Outside of academics there are multiple organizations that you are able to join. Endless opportunities for involvement and volunteering.
Sophomore,4,The history is very rich at this University and they are proud of where they came from. Every faculty member I’ve met has been more than willing to go above and beyond in helping me transfer.
Freshman,4,"I really liked how close knit the school was. Very family like, I felt as if everywhere I went there was someone I knew. The professors are very helpful and the small school size allowed for a lot of one on one with professors."
Alum,4,Iowa Wesleyan is a great institution that prides itself on offering a very high caliber and diverse educational curriculum. Obtaining my BS in Business Administration in my two years there was very insightful and greatly prepared me for my new career which I obtained one month after graduation and for my MBA which I am enrolled in now. Iowa Wesleyan has very strong roots and history which gives it a great foundation.
Alum,4,"Iowa Wesleyan gave me 4 years of amazing times.  You did have to ""find your own fun"" but with the right people you can have the time of your life.  I received an amazing education while being able to play a sport all 4 years of college. I was able to be a part of many different clubs and activities and build many leadership skills. There is a lot of diversity at the school, but people are either to afraid or lazy to join clubs.  If effort is put in you can have an amazing college experience."
Sophomore,4,"I love Iowa Wesleyan because it's not too big but it's not too small. Everyone is super kind and helpful. The professors are great. They will do almost anything to help you succeed. You get to know everyone around you. Also, the community is great and very supportive of our college."
Junior,4,"I love the smallness of the campus and how close the student body is with each other, staff and faculty. If you’re looking to be apart of a family instead of just a number, this is definitely the right college."
Freshman,4,I like how everyone was friendly and welcoming. The professors are amazing and make it seem like we can actually talk to them. Student life could be improved though. There's not many activities for students in Mt.Pleasant to participate in.
Junior,4,So far what i like about iowa wesleyan is the amount of help offerd. the teachers care about the students and want them to pass. the staff at this school give you their time everyday.
Senior,4,Small school but teachers know you by name and its nice seeing people you know in hallways.  Very involved with surrounding community.
Junior,4,It's a good University that is constantly growing and changing. The town is small but everyone is very nice. The school is getting to be more diverse by the year. 
College Freshman,4,Voted #1 for service learning in the nation and has a very competitive business program.
College Freshman,4,"During the recruitment process, coaches and counselors make you feel very welcome and reach out to accommodate you."
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of sports to play but not enough students really want to play.
College Freshman,4,There are a couple of frats and a few sororities on campus. Most people who are apart of them enjoy them a lot.
College Freshman,4,I play a sport here. Are teams may not be the greatest but we have a lot of dedicated athletes on campus
College Freshman,4,Iowa Wesleyan University is a very safe campus. Some people have a buddy system and some do not. I personally have not had any problems.
College Freshman,4,"The professors take the time to make sure you understand the course material. I should have token advantage of this more, but life is about learning from your mistakes."
College Freshman,4,"The professors take the time to make sure you understand the course material. I should have token advantage of this more, but life is about learning from your mistakes."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is somewhat okay. I'm a freshman, so I'm still getting use to being away from home. Overall, it's fun and comfortable, especially when you start socializing."
College Freshman,4,"Some of the neighboring people won't shut up at 02:00 at times, but it is fantastic otherwise."
College Freshman,4,We have two fraternities and around five or more sororities. They are not bad whatsoever. This is a liberal arts school.
College Freshman,4,It has a great amount of help that is offered!
College Freshman,4,I really believe that Iowa Wesleyan is the place for me. A great community and just what I was looking for.
College Junior,4,"Living on campus is actually ridiculously great. Being close to campus and having the community available from all of the students in the dorms, makes lasting friendships possible and easy - however, sometimes the housing process can be a bit strenuous since there' limited housing for students and you have to sign up quickly, it's still a wonderful atmosphere in the residence halls."
College Freshman,4,"if you know how to use the space in your room and lift your bed all the way up so that you'll have a bunch of storage underneath, and just use your chair to get in and out of your bed."
College Freshman,4,"everybody is really nice and fun, they boys have a movie theater in their campus and they let the girls come in all the time."
College Freshman,4,"the boys on the varsity male sports are really fun to be around so that makes you want to go their games, and the girls varsity sports are fun to watch sometimes the girls sports are better to watch just because you know them better because you live with most of them."
College Sophomore,4,There are lots of oppurtunities to win scholarships. They have at least 3 scholarship days a year.
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot people from different ethnic backgrounds on campus. Many of our students are from other countries around the world.
College Sophomore,4,The guys and girls get along well. There is not a lot of drama or things to worry about.
College Sophomore,4,We are getting new dining this year! The cafeteria is being gutted and redone. The hours are going to be extended so that it is more convenient for the students.
College Sophomore,4,Converting to DIII has been different and there pros and cons. Most of the team perform well and we are still growing. The support and togetherness is always high though. The turnout to all sporting events is great and student do awesome cheering on their classmates.
College Sophomore,4,"There are lots of little resturants to choose from. There aren't many chains except, McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Subway, Taco Bell, and Hardees. But Mi Pueblo is the best Mexican restaurant out there."
College Sophomore,4,"It is a small town but when you actually spend time here you come to love it. There are small shops and the movie theatre is very cheap compared to bigger cities. The people are always friendly. Once a year there is the Old Threshers Reunion. This is when this small town of 8,000 explodes to 20,000. People from all over come to see Old Threshers. It is a lot of fun to go to and a lot of the college students work to raise money for their sport/club."
College Sophomore,4,"Obviously not every professor is awesome. Most of the professors I have had will go out of their way to help you learn. One of my teachers allowed us to text her anytime about homework. The registration process is nice as long as you and your adviser are on the same schedule. But the registrar will help you find a new adviser if needed. The workload isn't too bad and lots of times you can find out that your RA or a student, who's dorm room is near by, has had the same class and can help."
College Sophomore,4,The greek life is not as big as it use to be but we are working on growing it. There are 3 sororities and a fraternity. Each one is unique in it's own way and have positives that go with each.
College Junior,4,Curriculum is 'major focused' with a normal workload that is expected in college. The professors are eager to help and encourage self exploration.
College Junior,4,The paperwork is easy to follow and the staff is available for assistance.
College Sophomore,4,We have a fairly high amount of diversity among the students on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Small class sizes allow for personal connections with professors. The psychology department is well rounded and offers a very good variety of classes each semester. There are many internship opportunities, but the most popular is with Insight Human Services. This is a mental health service business."
College Freshman,4,"The parties that we do have, people enjoy their time and it is fun. "
College Freshman,4,The weather is good. There is a lot if snow to get everyone in the Christmas spirit and its warm enough for summer and spring. 
College Freshman,4,"Since I leave on campus, I have heard the off campus housing is good. "
College Freshman,4,The atmosphere with the town is good. Everyone is friendly and sweet. I feel safe walking around but since it is a small town it is hard to get transportation. A car is well needed when attending the school.
Recent Alumnus,4,There are many different options to apply for scholarships and people to help you through the process.
Recent Alumnus,4,"All my questions were answered in a quick time frame, accommodations were made when or if classes were not offered. Many resources behind me all the time."
College Sophomore,4,The diversity at Iowa Wesleyan College is great. There is a good mixture of race and ethnicity which does not seem to be a problem at all. Students come from all sorts of economic backgrounds and students continue to pursue their dreams. Religion and sexual orientation does not seem to be a conflict at this college either. Students are accepted for who they are.
College Freshman,4,"The school as a whole is wonderful. The professors are very nice. They are well educated on the subject they are teaching. Each course is interesting, especially taking it with a good professor. At Iowa Wesleyan College each course has to relate to the life skills that the school has. The way the professors relate each subject back to life experiences makes me feel comfortable with my choice with this school. "
College Freshman,4,"Iowa Wesleyan College has the academic honor code. Every incoming student has to take the academic honor code quiz. The honor is very strict on students plagiarising and cheating. If there is evidence, the evidence is reviewed by the academic honor council and vice president of academic affairs. If there is a lack of evidence then, the case is closed. If the evidence is sufficient then there is a conference with the student. The student can either challenge the results or accepted it. If they challenge it then the case goes to the hearing board. And they construct a penalty if needed or close the case. If the student receives a penalty, they will have to serve it. If the student chooses to accept the results that were found by the academic honor council then there is a public hearing. It goes to the hearing board and they contruct a penalty if needed or close the case."
College Freshman,4,"The weather doesn't even count when it comes to Iowa Wesleyan College. During the academic school year of 2012-2013, there was a snow storm. Although there was 24 inches of snow, we still went to classes. But, rain, sleet, snow, hail or shine we still go to class because it is important to us."
College Freshman,4,"I'm a business major. I am satisfied with this major. So far my first year with the business teachers at Iowa Wesleyan College has been difficult because of their teaching styles. Overall, the teachers are very understanding. They are very striaght forward with their rules within the class. As a business major we are required to have all five certifications within Microsoft office. I feel like that is a great aspect of the business administration program. As a business major, being certified in microsoft is good because most companies that hired business students right out of college look for that on a resume."
College Junior,4,Wesleyan has a lot to offer diverse groups and nourishes the individual and many causes within the world.
College Freshman,4,"I give my school area  an A because the schooling education and professors are excellent teachers. The area has a fair ground and they host festivals there in the fall and summer. It is call Old Thrashers. The college is a D3 school, so it's not that great at sports I would say. My college is also rated one of the tops schools for Nursing Majors."
College Freshman,4,I have just started but I was very happy that even though I am a freshmen I still got a Psychology class which is my major.
College Senior,4,It's a very safe place. Small hometown atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,"There are only two Professors with degrees in my major. Although the major requires other science classes to be taken, this limits the classes that are to be taken in the major aspect. There are also only two advisors and this limits third and fourth opinions on courses and advise in the field. Internships are available and offered but I am only a freshman so I am unsure about them in specifics."
College Freshman,4,"Professors are always in class and prepared and almost never unsure of any question a student may ask. They set out to help students to their most ability and in a pleasant way. Professors even take time out of their days to meet with students personally to conversate about the class and email them constantly. There are a large variety of classes available also, but they are mostly general based."
Freshman,2,"Iowa Wesleyan is not a school I am particularly happy to be in. The school has very few things going for it. One of those things is the outstanding financial aid. The school was the most affordable for me to pay off. The only other benefits would be a small campus size that makes for easy traveling from class to class and free tutoring in the library. Other than that everything else is quite underwhelming. The food in the cafe is really bad, it can taste bland and sometimes undercooked. Even though I am here for the majority reason of expenses, I came to this school for sports also since it is the only one that guaranteed a spot on the baseball team. The problem is the teams but the football team have no funding. Leaving the sports here to be under average and lacking  financial support. The worst things are the dorms, they are tiny and lack some important properties like the boys dorm not having a kitchen."
College Sophomore,2,"For the amount we pay its bad. 2015 and no decent Wifi or A/C in rooms, and personally the heater in the room doesn't work. i don't mind the communal bathrooms."
College Sophomore,2,"The food is alright during the week, but on the weekends the selections are poor. The quality of the food is sometimes poor as well."
College Freshman,2,Greek life on campus is more of a organization or club. Everyone is more worried about their studies. Only the girls are into greek life. The boys are more into sports. They are trying to make greek life more appealing to the boys.
College Senior,2,"mt pleasant, Iowa is a great community and sweet nice poeple"
College Junior,2,"It usually snow a lot here, and I live off campus, and when weather is bad there is no excuse for missing class, the instructors would rather you risk driving to get to class than to miss."
College Senior,2,"When it snows a lot or especially when it's icy I don't feel we should have to drive to class; especially when the instructors have to drive from Mt. Pleasant to West Burlington at night to teach classes. To me, that is very dangerous."
College Junior,2,We have had so much trouble with the use of drugs on campus that we brough dogs onto campus to sniff them out.  We have had several men arrested fro the use and selling of marijuana.
College Freshman,2,I am currently undecided in my major and am disappointed in the lack of effort required for my classes.
College Freshman,2,The academics here are incredibly easy and require little to no effort. I find myself doing about a few hours of homework a week. It is disappointing to know that I am not necessarily getting what I paid for.
College Junior,2,"There are many different types of people here, mostly white, and if you arent white chances are you're here to play some sport. The faculty are nice, but the students aren't very outgoing here, though there are some individuals that are very nice. The amount of conformity going on is unreal though. People are not leaders here, nor are they open-minded."
College Junior,2,"Not Very Good – Breakfast at the College is decent, but I would not be able to eat there three meals a day.  I choose to live off-campus and either eat out or prepare my own lunch.  I think it would be best to live on campus, since i play football, and eating the meals at the College would be more convenient, but it is too repetitive and too expensive. If I were to live in the dorms, I would be forced to pay for a meal plan.  It would be nice to have Subway sandwiches and other alternatives to grab and go.  I think the College should offer a more limited meal plan, so that students aren't wasting money on food that they aren't eating."
Alum,1,"Not gonna lie, I hated it there. I'm hoping I don't have to go back. This is defiantly not a place for an international student who wants to get to know people and other cultures. People have no idea how to approach you and talk to you if you're not from there. I was mentally and emotionally exhausted at this place. I went to the counselor, but it felt like my problems were boring them. Academically it wasn't so bad for me personally, but there were complaints about teachers being rude and disrespectful to some students.  

Parties don't exist here, other than the ones in people's own dorm rooms or apartments, but that's usually only close friends. If you don't have a car, you don't have a life. I spent two years watching people go out on weekends while I had nowhere to go and nothing to do because I didn't have a car. This town is empty and there is barely anything to do to entertain yourself. My friends and I used to go to Walmart for fun.. That's how sad it was."
College Sophomore,1,"I cant eat here once without having a bowel movement as soon as im done eating. No following the food pyramid at all. Only carbs and dairy topped food which destroy your insides.. 

i only eat here because i have too.."
College Freshman,1,There is not transportation at all. You would have to walk.
College Freshman,1,"IWC's version of ""scholarship"" unless you're an A+ student or an athlete is about $50"
College Freshman,1,"The Communications department has little to no funding. There's no newspaper, radio station, or television station. Other than two film production classes (basic and advanced), you hardly get any hands-on experience."
College Freshman,1,The only sort of transportation offered at this school is a train that provides long distance travel. It is expensive and has very inconvenient stops.
College Junior,1,"I received less financial aid than originally told, and also thought I was going to receive an athletic scholarship, only to find out I would not because of a change in the school's division. lack of communication on how much I would receive until it was nearly too late."

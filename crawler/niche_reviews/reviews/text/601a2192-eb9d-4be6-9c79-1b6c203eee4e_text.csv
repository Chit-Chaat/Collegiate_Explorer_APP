Freshman,5,"I took online classes during the summer. Due to this pandemic, online classes was normal because my high school classes were also online. I adapted very well and finished my classes with excellent grades."
Freshman,5,I'm a freshman and so far I love Cleary. I received an athletic scholarship for track. I look forward to fulfilling my dreams of getting a college degree and also running track at a collegiate level.
Freshman,5,Every interaction I've had with staff has been amazing. The make each step to achieving your educational goals as dimples as possible.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Cleary so far has been nothing but good. The administration is very kind and understanding for student needs. For example, they will answer any questions or concerns you have. The students here are very accepting and kind. I don’t think I’ve met one mean person yet. Another good thing is the housing. Housing here is great. In the dorms there’s plenty of room for students and there’s something to do on every floor for students."
Freshman,5,"Very diverse, small university with very good athletics and very small, interactive classes. the campus life is very nice as the dorms are very nice and big, there are a lot of student activities and opportunities for student employment on campus. the food is very good and they serve fresh breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily. the campus is small so there is a lot to do and you don't have to go far to see anything going on, like sport games, two full basketball courts, and a full gym."
Freshman,5,I like Cleary because it is small and intamite. You receive a genuine education and a connection with all of your professors.
Junior,5,Cleary University is a college whose first priority is always their students. All of the teachers at this school are committed to helping students work towards their full potential. They all want you to succeed and will do anything and everything to make that happen.

College Junior,5,"On campus or online, campus parking is the best"
College Junior,5,Not aware of any reported drug use so no news is the best news.
College Sophomore,5,"At Cleary University I am studying a Bachelors degree of Business Management, all of my professors have experience in the field of study that they teach. The advisors are always on top of getting the best possible internship for what career you're interested in and what best fits your personality. The workload is always somewhat heavy, but not overly difficult. It is stressful at times because I work through the week to, not all teachers account for that as most students are a full time student only."
College Sophomore,5,"I came to Cleary University to challenge myself and to get the best education provided. Cleary University's professors do a wonderful job on preparing us for the real world using real world application and text book sources. The work load is stressful and many times to much, but the work we are assigned always has a purpose, its not busy work. They strive every student to reach the peak potential that they are capable of and want to see you succeed out side of the class room as well as in the class room."
Freshman,4,"I did not take any online classes, but it's available for everyone and you can do a mix of in person and online classes too for those who still want to meet their professors in person."
Junior,4,Very small business focused school ! Dorms are relatively new and very spacious compared to other dorm rooms.  New athletic fields and growing sports programs.  Class sizes are small 11-1 ratio
Junior,4,"As I have just completed my first full year at Cleary University as a transfer student I find that this school has a unique environment that I do enjoy. Cleary has small class sizes on a very small and intimate campus, I find this to be more helpful for me as I feel I am receiving a more customized and personal learning experience. Cleary also places a large focus on giving you opportunities outside of our schooling by offering career and internship services to help match you up to a position you may be interested in, as well as hosting employers at the school to speak to you face to face about open positions. Cleary University seems to have the students best interests in mind."
Junior,4,The professors are highly knowledgeable in their fields and give lots of personal examples that is beneficial in actually understanding the topics. Although it lacks a lot of extra curricular groups beside athletics.
Freshman,4,"As a new student, I like this smaller campus because it is very personable.  The dorms are new and the athletic fields are new as well.  The surround area is very nice and safe to go explore."
College Junior,4,"With the right GPA, there are quite a few endowed scholarship available."
College Sophomore,4,I rented off campus in downtown Howell. I now own my own home in howell and the drive is fine.
College Sophomore,4,The financial aid office is super helpful and have already gone above & beyond my expectations.
College Sophomore,4,I've been on campus several times and it's always a great experience.
College Senior,4,"Police presence is great, people watch for other people and each other"
College Senior,4,My major is human resource management.  This was the only school that offered the program I wanted.
College Senior,4,All is great off campus dining
College Junior,4,Ann Arbor or Howell are great places to live
College Junior,4,"Pure Michigan weather, what else can you say. No where in the world will you get 5 seasons in one day."
College Junior,4,Dining available in the area of the  school.
College Sophomore,4,I have not yet expeienced any real trouble at our school as far as how strict they enforce the policies. They do stress the obvious academic honesty and the code of conduct for athletes playing a sport. Since i commute I'm not familiar with the housing policies and how they monitor the kids that do have housing.
College Junior,4,Not Complicated – Followed the steps sent to me through the mail and sent it back in.  Wasn't complicated.
College Senior,4,"Diverse Backgrounds – As most students currently hold employment , you have different economic status'."
College Junior,2,"The food is provided by the on-site catering company. There are one or two choices per day, served banquet style. The food is not very good. There are a few tables, not many students hang around. They basically converted two classrooms into a cafeteria."
Senior,1,"Oh lord, I started going to this university when I was a P.O only because it was 50% off for law enforcement officers. Huge Mistake 
This is the absolute worst school, worst experience, worst website, slowest response times. Good luck trying to get help from Financial aid office or anyone. 
The have one counselor who responds and seems like she cares. One teacher Mr.heyes? who is a great teacher. the rest of this organization will drag you down, waste your time and money. 
If i could go back, i would rather pay tripple or 4x more to go anywhere else."
Senior,1,"I chose the accelerated classes which are 8 weeks. One teacher started responding 6 weeks in and didn't like anyone's submissions since her instructions made 0 sense and wanted us all to redo everything. NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOU OR YOUR SUCCESS HERE.
Counselors, admin, teachers do not care, you cant reach em or get help from them. 
please dont waste your life energy here."
College Senior,1,After Homework You Have No Life – Classes are 6 weeks long and consist of a lot of homework
College Senior,1,Online Classes – classes I take are online and there is no way to engage with girls and boys. No one will reach out and chat with you or message you for help or feedback.
College Senior,1,"It has been very difficult to pay for my tuition at Cleary University. I am unable to receive the amount that I need for financal aid, and the one scholarship they gave me is just not enough to make an impact on my expenses. The financial aid department in past years has not helped much either or been informative."
College Senior,1,"Cleary University's Livingston County campus is located in Howell, and therefore most of the students commute from home. Because the campus is not located in a downtown area with a college nightlife acessible partying among college students, and the bar/club scene are non-existent."

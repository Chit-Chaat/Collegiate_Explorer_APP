Senior,5,"I am a former student-athlete that transferred to Northeastern State University to complete a degree in Cell and Molecular Biology. I chose this university due the affordability and the well respected pre-health professions program that is being implemented. After visiting multiple universities and choosing to attend Northeastern, I am hard-pressed to find another university that gives you such quality academics, a very comfortable student to professor ratio, as well as a relaxed and polite community that greatly respects the university and it's students no matter the setting."
Freshman,5,"Northeastern State University has a lot of diversity in their students.  Their campus is very safe and clean and offers extra activities or you and your friends.  Me and my friends go to the NSU Fitness Center almost everyday.  The Fitness Center includes workout equipment such as treadmills, stationary bikes, ect. it also includes 2 basketball courts, volleyball, a swimming pool, a yoga/workout room, weight room, and a track."
Freshman,5,"I have not taken any classes at Northeastern State University online so I can not very well rate them.  However, I believe online classes would be just like in person.  Professors are considerate with the students abilities to learn through computers. I hope to be accepted into Northeastern State University this coming fall of 2021 and begin taking classes there myself."
Freshman,5,"Even though it is hard to learn online, most of the professors have an option to go online if a student chose to do so."
Freshman,5,"I really like the atmosphere and the students/staff have been very friendly. The professors are always there to listen if you have a problem. To NSU, you are a name and face and not just a number to them."
Freshman,5,"Overall I have loved my experience here at Northeastern State. From the fun environment around campus, to the caring teachers in the classroom. There is always a place for me here. Coming from a large highschool, it was hard to find cliques or groups that I could easily identify myself with. Here at NSU, thats a thing of the past. Everyone here is so friendly and helpful. Many different clubs have already invited me to join. This gives me a feeling of comfort and belongingness. 
I am also on the soccer team here at the University. This has given me even more of a reason to love this school. The brotherhood of me and my teammates is unmatchable. Through these rough times with COVID, Its been hard to fully complete our regularly scheduled practices and games. However, with coaches help, we have been resilient in making sure we are doing the best we can, with what we can."
Freshman,5,"I only have one online class here at NSU however, it has been handled impeccably. The professor is always on time with the link to the meeting. He stops when I have a question, and is patient when I do not understand something. I was unsure about how the transition to online learning would go, but it has proven to be just as effective."
Freshman,5,"Very cute and lovely campus with beautiful scenery. Everything is within walking distance so it is very easy to get to places. As well, everyone is so friendly and polite. Professors are really nice and easy to talk to. They seem very understandable, so just communicate with them and you'll be okay. In addition there are a lot of student resources available like tutor sessions, on-campus counselors and much more. There are tons of clubs and organizations for students to join as well. This is school just has so much to offer! Highly recommend!"
Alum,5,I am forever grateful for the professors at NSU ad how they prepared me for my successful career that that I have now.  The smaller class sizes ensure that each student will have a chance to know their classmates and their teachers.  The teachers has time to work with you and are genuinely concerned about your success.
Alum,5,"It is a beautiful and engaging campus.   It is a smaller school, which means there is much more of a personal experience in every class,"
Freshman,5,"I may have only been here for a couple of weeks but it already feels like home.
The faculty here are so nice and helpful. I can easily walk to my class and they are not too far from my dorm. Plus, the food here is absolutely delicious."
Senior,5,I love my Academic advisors and how they help every step of the way. I love the ease of getting in the school and buying books and speaking with someone when need be. I take all of my classes online and it has been a great experience. I feel like I am sitting in class with my professor and peers.
Senior,5,I have been taking all of my classes online and have had no issues. The work has been just as if I am sitting in front of the teacher. The professors are very detailed in the instructions that they give.
Senior,5,"I've had a fantastic experience at NSU because the teachers I've had make it obvious how much they care about their students. Teachers that not only care about academic success of their students but their physical, emotional and mental health as well. The college makes it as easy for students to be active and involved in their classes as possible with multiple learning platforms to accommodate individual student needs. The student advisors are very knowledgeable about the best path for a student to take to achieve their degree as quickly and successfully as possible. Smaller class sizes make it a more comfortable environment for open discussion and lively discussion of class topics which also builds rapport among classmates and with the faculty. I've enjoyed my time at NSU because I feel like I am seen by the teachers and that I matter as a student. I feel that the teachers I've had genuinely want to help me be as successful as possible and are willing to help me achieve my goals."
Senior,5,"Having online learning opportunities through NSU has been a new experience for me. I was worried about how well I would do in that dynamic. I enjoyed the online platform and class style for established online classes. When pandemic hit and we went to ALL virtual learning I struggled with the transition but the online learning set up and teacher investment made it easier to adjust. The format, the accessibility to the assignments and teachers and the flexibility of the timeline for assignments made all the difference. I knew I could reach out to my teachers and ask for help. They offered Zoom class sessions and teacher meetings. Online learning offers opportunities and experiences that would otherwise not be available to everyone, like single mothers (like me) or people who have to support their family by bringing in money. Online learning opens more doors to a successful future to more people. to non-traditional learners like me. I am forever grateful to have this opportunity."
Freshman,5,We followed along well with Google Services. The professors know the programs well so it was easy to catch along with
Alum,5,"Great school. Great value. Beautiful campus and area. Close to local restaurants, shopping and outdoor activities."
Freshman,5,"I love NSU so much! The community and campus life is not like any other and I couldn't have found a better community anywhere else. This campus is beautiful, so beautiful I have chosen to give tours on campus to visitors and I love showing off my school. It is not too big, so being able to see people on campus by chance is very big and the classroom sizes are perfect! Yet I would like to change the greek life stigma that has been created through people that are higher up, and would like for that matter to be addressed in a different way other than what is being used currently."
Niche User,5,"As an accepted applicant, I have been up to visit and tour many times. The campus is beautiful and everyone seems helpful and helps to answer any questions you may have. It's in a small little town, but it's pretty there, with  a lot of entertainment available."
Senior,5,I feel that Northeastern State College has given me a new meaning of a start over. The school has been very helpful in changing the my life for the better. Not only helping me also the people i would like to help change their lives for the better. That is the tools and policies that Northeastern State College has given me. I would recommend  this school for anyone's challenge to a new beginning.
Junior,5,"I've experienced nothing but great things. I have yet  to step foot on campus, and have had a great experience with all of their staff in each department including enrollment, financial aid, and advising team. All have been absolutely great. Cannot wait to see what the next year holds with NSU and it's team. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to complete my degree via satellite through another campus, truly is life changing."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love NSU. So far, throughout my freshmen year, I have met so many amazing instructors and students. I have declared my major and started to map out my future. I am thrilled to see how far I will go at this school!"
Junior,5,Great professors and staff.  Gorgeous  campus. I am an adult returning to recieve my bachelor's in psychology.  My advisor at NSU was a huge help in the transition back into college life.  She is always available to answer any questions and keep me on track to fulfill my graduation requirements. All of the professors I have taken from have been amazing. I do wish the Broken Arrow campus provided a larger selection of classes.
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy campus life as well as the courses offered here. There is always a ton of events going on so you're never bored on campus and the courses are very intriguing which makes attending classes easier.
Junior,5,"I love that the class sizes are small.  In each of my classes my professors know who I am personally. I also have the same professors for many classes so our relationship is stronger.  I do have to be very specific with my academic adviser on what I need from her for her to be efficient but that is my only drawback. The course work is not overwhelming and the professors have been very understanding if life happens and an assignment needs a little more time. In my education classes several assignments have been interactive or involved field experiences, which better prepare me for my career.."
Senior,5,"My experience at NSU could only be described by one word ""Innovative "".  I attended Northeastern state from 2007 too 2012 on a football scholarship and during my experience as a collegiate athlete i chose to study Environmental Health and Safety. Hopefully my luck will be better if given the chance to receive another helpful hand."
Graduate Student,5,"I have enjoyed my experience at NSU. The teachers and staff have been great. I love the flexibility in the on line program, and the foundation of the program makes is user friendly."
Niche User,5,"I really like Northeastern State University because of the people, atmosphere, and learning experience. They have lots of opportunity at this college and lots clubs and organizations to get  involved in. The people there are so welcoming and really strive to get better the college based on students opinions. This college values your opinion and continues to make you feel comfortable. The learning experience  is great as well the teacher staff the pushes you to do your best. This college brings in a lot of diversity and that is a major factor in a good college. That is how i feel about Northeastern State."
Junior,5,I love the support. My professors are extremely supportive in and outside of the classroom and the Cherokee department is more of a family than a rigid academic infrastructure.
Niche User,5,"I personally have not attended Northeastern but I have plenty of friends that are enrolled, and the campus is beautiful. It is very clean and a very respected campus. It is fairly easy to find your way around campus to your classes and the professors are very nice."
Senior,5,This college is very affordable and has great staff! The professors seem like they really care about making sure that each student gets a great education. The campus is always clean and inviting. The lab rooms are updated and kept clean.
Freshman,5,"I just began my college experience at Northeastern but I can honestly say it's been the best time of my life so far, I've met new people and connected to them through academics and through our social lives. It's a beautiful campus and the experience is overall amazing. The rich history surrounding the campus and it's land is my favorite part! Knowing the history of the ground I'm walking on and the students from the past makes the experience so much better. I'm thankful that I've been accepted and able to be a part of a campus and community as great as this."
Freshman,5,"Very nice staff, warm and welcoming environment. Good food, and even better coffee from the Starbucks located in the university center."
Junior,5,I absolutely love this college! I'm a transfer and everything went very smoothly and every one was very kind. I actually go to the Broken Arrow Campus and I really enjoy it.
Sophomore,5,I have been out of school for almost 20 years and I am going back to get my degree. I am a sophomore transfer to NSU and the university team has made this experience wonderful. NSU has a beautiful campus and all staff I have been in contact with are knowledgeable
Freshman,5,"Rich with culture and academic excellence! The professors are all willing to help you out as much as they can, with positive attitudes and open minds."
Freshman,5,NSU has been amazing. I really found myself here. It is home to me. I have come out of my shell and grown into an amazing person.  I never knew how good feeling like you belong was. I have such a diverse group of friends there. I was paired with the perfect roommate.  The professors really care about each and everyone of us. They are invested in making sure I succeed in my chosen degree program. I can not imagine finding a better fit for myself that I did here.
Freshman,5,Northeastern State is a great college to start off with for students who may not like big environments or crowds. NSU is a small but decent sized campus that allows multiple organizations for students to join or activities for students to observe or participate in. The town NSU is located in is a beautiful place and very friendly.
Senior,5,"Good school to attend. Professors are very informative, very knowledgable and very helpful. Parking is close to the doors. The buildings are well laid out for easy use."
Junior,5,"I go to the Broken Arrow Campus, and I love it! It is very close to home and is in a very convenient location. The administration is very helpful and nice. Professors are super cool and actually know what they are talking about."
Senior,5,"I love the diversity of my campus, the professors are laid back, and the advisers are always very helpful! The class sizes are smaller and personable."
Junior,5,"I initially went to the Tahlequah in 2008. I started attending the Broken Arrow campus this past fall (2018). The computer science program is small here and they don't offer every class needed to graduate but, TCC is close and they work together to find classes that are equal to the classes they don't have at NSU BA. I actually like having a smaller department. I cycle through the same 5 or 6 professors and I always know a few people in every new class I take. It's comforting in a way."
Niche User,5,I loved every thing to the History to how the college came to be and how the kids there where very nice. That gave me a tour of all of wit hand also helped me with some questions I had. I recommend on going here because it is a amazing collage that will help and guid you to whatever you are trying to be.
Freshman,5,"Some things that I like about NSU, is everyone is very polite and the classes are not very big. Knowing that I can go and ask anyone for help is something that I like because then I would not have to go to just certain people. Everyone is willing to help anyone in need. Having smaller classes gives me the chance to talk one on one with my professor if I need help."
Freshman,5,The classes are not over crowded and the professors are nice. The buildings are not that far off from each other. Walking across campus is not just a bad ordeal. This campus is very clean and quiet. I love it here.
Freshman,5,I really like how Northeastern State is diverse. I also enjoy how awesome the student and campus life is. I found Northeastern State to be one of the best colleges I have toured. I also enjoy how helpful the professors are and how engaged the students are.
Niche User,5,"Northeastern State is a great college in my opinion, it was and possibly still one of the best in this region in the country. Everyone here is just here for the same reason we are. So everyone is pretty friendly and nice, the area of it is a nice place with good food places to eat very near the school. The school just got new dorms so that's a plus."
Sophomore,5,"Northeastern State has a beautiful campus, various clubs and organizations, and a great student culture. The professors are amazing and willing to help you succeed. The food on campus is good and there are various shops and restaurants within walking distance."
Graduate Student,5,"I enjoy the beautiful campus, friendly town, and wonderful professors. I am in the Counseling Masters program on the Broken Arrow campus. I really enjoy the cohort program that allows me to connect so well with my fellow students and build professional relationships while I'm in school. The professors are more like mentors. They want us to be amazing counselors and not just great students. I feel like I am being invested in personally and that is a great feeling."
Senior,5,HSU is heavy on the academics of it's students. Each professor is invested in their students succeeding. The university has many programs to assist in helping new and current students achieve in a college setting. Their are also even programs and services to help after graduation.
Niche User,5,"So far the advisors, professors and students have been amazing! My advisors have really helped to guide me on my path and clarified a lot of the challenges."
Freshman,5,"I have had a great experience. All the staff and faculty are extremely nice. The professors are extraordinary. They are really there to help you when you're struggling in their class. Northeastern also offers a 24 hour tutor on Tutor.com which is paid for by the school which is very helpful. In the dorms, all the RA's are great. Their fun to hang around with and are there when you need a friend or just need anyone. They also have Hawkreach which is a place where they have therapist if you need one. The school itself has a great music program is what I've heard and I would recommend Northeastern State to everyone."
Niche User,5,Perfect size and class sizes. Teachers are available to speak with you and get to know you personally. Great campus life.
Junior,5,"Northeastern State is a great college. I am Indian, and it is very rich in native culture. The people here are wonderful, and very helpful!"
Freshman,5,"If your Cherokee, you can receive so much help if you just go apply for things at cherokee nation. A big reason I chose Nsu was the low cost because Nsu is one of the cheapest colleges in Oklahoma! If it wasnt for Cherokee Nation and the help of scholorships I wouldnt of been able to attend any school, but Nsu gives you an excellent education worth every penny and more! Nsu is filled with friendly faces and all the resources you could imagine! Nsu's top priority is their students, so they have services such as career services, job fairs, and other opputunities waiting for you!  There is always a solution to any problem and Nsu strives to keep their students happy, all you have to do is ask!!! I would recommend Nsu to everyone considering college! I love nsu and will start and finish my college career here!"
Junior,5,Northeastern State is a great university. They have a wonderful campus. They advisors take the time to assess our situation and find what classes would be the best for our schedule. I am an accounting major and I have been very pleased with my professor.
Freshman,5,I love NSU. The people on campus make me feel at home and I’m really excited to see what the next 3/4 years will bring!
Junior,5,Northeastern State University is the perfect place to attend. I have never had a bad experience with any of the professors and the campus is beautiful and quiet.
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere at NSU! I feel at home and I couldn't pick a better campus to be at. All of my classes are great and my professors help me in any way possible too! My academic advisor has also helped me tremendously by helping me figure out what I should do about my plans. The staff here is just overall aswesome. The food is better in the underground rather than the cafeteria. The only had thing about BUS is that there isn't a whole lot of parking.
Sophomore,5,Campus life is truly incredible and our professors are awesome!! I recommend going Greek!!! NSU is like a close knit family and I would not trade it for any other school!
Senior,4,"In my experience, the professors at Northeastern State do an excellent job of relaying typical face to face information into an online learning format that is very user friendly for all students. I have been exceptionally pleased with the knowledge gained through the online experience and I would highly recommend minimal hesitation when it comes to deciding whether or not to enroll in an online course."
Freshman,4,"Im really enjoying attending NSU. Most of the staff are helpful and friendly. I am not crazy about the food or online learning but, I am making it work. I have made some really good friends and am enjoying student life."
Freshman,4,I have a couple classes online and I want to say for the most part it has been very good. My professors are very understanding of the situations and work pretty well with us students when we have connection or internet issues.
Senior,4,I would highly recommend NSU to anyone pursuing their education. I would advise to take face to face courses rather than online if possible because it helps keep you on track better.
Freshman,4,Most of my classes are in person. Only one is online and it is not bad but it would be easier if it were in person.
Freshman,4,Very friendly small town university. A small amount of students so theres lots of help from the professors.
Sophomore,4,I have had an overall great experience so far at NSU. Most of my professors have been very understanding and helpful.
Senior,4,"I really like that NSU is a smaller school where you can get to know your peers. If one thing could be changed, I would have them make more online classes for those trying to work while they are in college."
Senior,4,"NSU has some great teachers, however some of them are very tough and do not think you should get out of their class with an A. There are only a few teachers like this, but most of the other professors I have had have been really great and really helpful. Their housing and parking could use an upgrade."
Freshman,4,I am currently in my second semester of my freshman year and I am absolutely loving my experience. Every instructor that I have had is always understanding and is willing to help in every way they can.
Alum,4,I loved Northeastern State. The class sizes are small and the teachers are very willing to help you succeed any way they can. Everyone is extremely helpful and encouraging. The teachers in the Education department are especially knowledgeable and kind. I would suggest this school to anyone.
Freshman,4,"I love NSU! I think it is the perfect size, big enough for the college experience but small enough for it to not be incredibly overwhelming. It is full of opportunities that anyone can find appealing. On top of the amazing campus, the classrooms and teachers are the best! I don't have on single teacher that I don't like."
Freshman,4,I have been going to Northeastern State University for two years now as a concurrently enrolled student and it has been quite nice. Aside from one of my professors I have had a great experience taking classes at the college and look forward to attending there as a full time student.
Freshman,4,"It's a reasonably priced university with quality classes and professors. I'm in my first semester of college at NSU and so far it's been challenging, but good. My professors are all understanding and helpful, but still give you assignments where you have to think and put effort into. The students are also very nice and welcoming. I've never felt out of place or alone while at NSU."
Freshman,4,The campus life is really focused on making friends and meeting new people and the staff are really good at getting freshman to get active on campus.
Alum,4,BA site.  Very knowledgeable professors.  Diverse teaching styles & student engagement.  Good student resources.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at NSU, go Riverhawks! So far from my experience I’ve noticed that NSU is on a come up. I like how they try to get everyone involved in as many activities as possible or to even create your own. If it wasn’t for the different sports teams here the school probably wouldn’t be slightly diverse as it is now. Everyone here is very friendly even down to faculty. Northeastern is in a very small city, but there is plenty to do if you’re creative or there’s surrounding cities. The party life is ok i guess. If you’re just now starting to do parties then it’s for u, but regular party people no it’s kind of lame unless you know how to get a party jumping. Also the food here is ok in the cafe. If you don't like it they have chick-fil-a and other food places around campus."
Graduate Student,4,"I enjoyed every bit of attending Northeastern State University-Tahlequah for all four years of my undergrad. NSU is small enough to not get an overwhelmed feeling of university life, but is big enough to feel like you can get from place to place on time. NSU offers a variety of organizations to become a part of such as Greek life, Northeastern Activity Board, SOAR, and others. Professors and other staff members are welcoming, motivated, and have their students best interests in mind."
Sophomore,4,"The professors do as much as they can to ensure that students are staying on campus, not dropping out, and actually enjoying the time they have here for the four years or graduate programs"
Junior,4,I go to the NSU BA campus and it's more of a learn and go campus but it has a nice atmosphere and good areas to study around the campus.
Graduate Student,4,Close to home. The environment was fun and loving. I attended for 4 years while playing sports and loved every minute being in Tahlequah. Professors know your name. Not too expensive compared to other schools. Many events put on through the school to involve students. Loved NSU.
Freshman,4,"My experience was overall great so far, they are very helpful when it comes to advising and there is many activities to partake in."
Freshman,4,Students are very friendly. Extremely diverse campus. Staff always willing to listen and they are very helpful. Lots of activities on campus for everyone to get involved in.
Junior,4,"I love it there, but they don't offer many scholarships to their transfer students, which make up the majority of all their students."
Junior,4,The school provides various food options and they provide many wonderful services to help further the careers of the students.
Junior,4,"I didn't take my basics at NSU so I can't very well rank them, but I can say that the science program is very challenging and difficult and forces you to push yourself to do and be better. It's perhaps the hardest in the state but is definitely worth it. Staying on top of the coursework is a must; the professors more often than not are easily accessible and do not mind to assist you in any questions you may have."
Freshman,4,The teachers are kind and helpful. It's a beautiful campus and reasonably priced. It's a great college town too. Amazing scenery nearby for all aspriing photographers.
Niche User,4,"Northeastern State University, is an all around really great campus. My brother attends NSU and I have toured the campus a few times myself. Everybody I have met from the university is really nice and well mannered. The campus itself is really beautiful."
Niche User,4,I have been concurrently enrolled in NSU for two years. They have helped me out a lot with getting credits for when I do reach college. It has great classes and great class sizes. There is always stuff to do around campus and they have good food places around. The town of Tahlequah just fits the college perfect.
Works Here,4,never been wanting to go. and succeed in all my classes. even if I have to do hard work. but if not that's cool. i want to take my basics there then make a final decision about where i want to take culinary school.
Niche User,4,My experience with NSU has been great.  As a concurrent student i get the same opportunities as a college student would.  I get treated as an adult and fairly.  My professors have been great.  They are fair and do everything they can to make sure that i am on the right track.
Junior,4,This university is great for non-traditional students such as adults going back to school after years away.
Senior,4,Great school I am a senior in business at the Broken Arrow campus and it is awesome.  I wish more of the classes were available online but other than that it is great
Junior,4,"I really enjoy being a student at NSU. I love the people, faculty, and overall college life. I sometimes wish that the students would be more serious about certain aspects of college. I am constantly surrounded by people goofing around while I am a full-time pre-med student athlete. I am one of the busiest students on campus, I do not want to hear complaining."
Sophomore,4,"I am starting my third semester at Northeastern State University in the fall and have had an overall great experience so far. My abilities have been greatly tested through various learning activities and assignments. My college experience has inspired me to make new friends,  join clubs and participate in campus activities. My only complaint is I would love to see professors be more helpful to students in the future. I think this would help students feel more comfortable and have more belief in their own abilities."
Freshman,4,"This college has honestly changed my life. When applying to colleges I thought I wanted to go to a big university, but now that I am here I couldnt picture myself anywhere else."
Freshman,4,"My family went through this local college, and I figured I would do the same. It was close to home, but far enough for me to do my own thing. It is on the more affordable side of college, and still offers good majors and minors and plenty of extra things to do outside of school. For me that is the speech team and working in the IT department on campus, both of which I really enjoy."
Freshman,4,"It is a great campus! I love going here because it is not too big, but it is not to small either. The staff on campus are overall helpful and they will try to help you the best they can. Safety on campus is awesome! If you do not feel comfortable walking at night to your dorm or the library, you can call campus police and they will give you a ride. I would change about the campus would be the dorms, they just built new dorms, but they have old ones that they do not use, and I think that is a waste of money and space."
Sophomore,4,"I loved Northeastern State from the moment I arrived here. The environment is friendly and being involved in clubs and organizations is easy and not stressful or pressuring. The only downside to the university is that it is slightly more difficult to find an area of academic interest because there are less options in academic studies here as a result of it being a smaller school. However, it is very easy to feel comfortable as this school, find friends, and get to know your professors and overall this university is an excellent place to begin your college journey."
Freshman,4,Northeaster State University so far has been a fairly pleasant experience. All the faculty have been nice and so far neither of the class enrollment processes I've been through have been complicated.
Junior,4,"Northeastern State University has offered me many experiences to learn and grow from. At this campus I have become a local leader, a valued member of the community, and I have learned real world skills like networking and professional employment."
Freshman,4,I like that the university is a smaller community and the people are great and the professors are easy to get ahold of. I think the thing that could improve is the food options.
Sophomore,4,"I love Northeastern State University. I like that the school is not a huge university. It is the perfect size. People here are very nice and the staff is always their to help. 
Somethings I would like to change is the parking, with out a doubt. Also, I would set up more activities to bring people together."
Freshman,4,i like nsu it makes things pretty easy and the campus is easy to get around in  i have one complaint but only with the parking its pretty hard to find a spot.
Junior,4,"The advisors are extremely helpful, particularly in helping me transfer from  another University! Everything was fully explained from degree programs, to enrolling in classes as well as various other student aids they have available (which includes a food and clothing pantry, on- campus family housing, counseling/ grievances services and a great deal more). My professors have been top notch- intelligence, expertise and empathetic to their students. My only complaint is their narrow selection of graduate programs."
Sophomore,4,A  average college with a good background and history. Really strict with  their school rules. Professors are easy to get a  hold of during their office hours.
Junior,4,I like the welcoming atmosphere NSU has created and maintained. It has a variety of student organizations to fit different students like amd hobbies. The surrounding area is beautiful and I would like to see it embraced more.
Freshman,4,Very good teachers and very good staff. There is a wide variety of fields of study and there are many people to help you decide on what you want to do. There are many different fraternities and sororities here as well. There is always something going on on the campus as well. Most of the dorms are very nice too.
Freshman,4,I love NSU! The campus is so evolving and welcoming to anyone. The NSU Greek life is definitely the way to go when you join NSU. The NSU Tahlequah campus is so beautiful. Every week the NAB organization puts on an event that anyone that attends NSU can go!
Freshman,4,"This is my second semester at Northeastern State University, and I love it. I love the small and close-knit family type feel it has to it. I have made many friends, very easily, and that has got me so many valuable life connections. NSU's Rookie Bridge Camp is also an amazing thing about this school and I am so glad they have it. This camp really bridges the awkward gap when transitioning from high school to college. This school has many clubs, and places to get involved in as well. I would not change much about this school, but if I had to pick a couple areas that could use some improvement- I would say the dorms should be worked on as well as I think there should be more food options. Some of the dorm room have big issues, such as power outages, and broken items and walls even. Overall, I love this college."
Junior,4,"I would honestly give it five stars but there is always room for improvement. I enjoy that the college feels like a family. It is the perfect size, big enough that you don't have to see someone if you don't want to but small enough to feel connected."
Sophomore,4,"I love NSU, the education I received here is amazing, but the housing sucks. Do not live in Leoser you will get cockroaches. I like living in Cobb Hall, but it has its ups and downs. The majority of the professors are amazing, but NEVER take stats with Dr. Roberts, she is horrible. The caf food is terrible, I get diarrhea just about every time, but the underground with WOW and Chick-fil-A is amazing."
Sophomore,4,"I have had an overall, pleasant experience at Northeastern State University. I am seeking a Bachelor's degree in Secondary Education focused in Earth and Space Science. I have enjoyed the courses that I have taken in the science department at NSU. I continue to be challenged in my academics. I have had amazing professors who have impacted my views on education, and have given me a vision of the kind of teacher I want to be when I graduate and am given the opportunity to have my turn in the classroom."
Sophomore,4, Northeastern State university has a very small town home feel to it. I like the positive atmosphere and size of the school. I would like to improve the sports and student involvement in school.  
College Freshman,4,So far my experience at NSU has been a good one.
College Sophomore,4,There are plenty of job opportunities on the campus as well as a great career service program.
College Sophomore,4,"The campus police do a great job of giving a safe atmosphere to the campus. On the rare occasion that something does happen, the counseling services are excellent."
College Sophomore,4,All the Greeks I've met are like anyone else. There is no stigma between Greeks and non-Greeks. The frats and sorority on campus frequently hold entertaining events for leisure and charity. I respect them.
College Sophomore,4,There are multiple services on-campus to help students feel safe. I don't think I've ever heard of anyone having a major problem on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I've had a great time here, the people are friendly, the campus is beautiful, and the classes are enjoyable."
Freshman,2,Northeastern State University is a small town college with the resources to match. The town has almost nothing to do and there is very little activity on campus. On the weekends the campus becomes deserted because everyone goes home. Most of the students struggle academically even though the classes are easy.
College Freshman,2,I think a lot of people that are in Greek at my school don't go in for the right reason. A to of partying takes place.
College Junior,2,Not many career prospects here at the campus since it is a small city so there is not much to go by. I'm not even sure if I am able to get a local job once I get my degree. I most likely have to search in another city.
College Freshman,2,If winning seasons is what you want go somewhere else.
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you want to live near the campus, it's bad. It's in broken arrow and most places in this area are very pricey. There is no housing options on campus so you have to live off campus. I drive an hour to school everyday. If something was affordable for a college student near the campus that would be great, but so far I haven't found anything."
College Sophomore,2,"My dorm, which I share with another girl, is very small. We also often have issues with heating and water."
College Senior,2,the nurse doesn't know what she's doing and the counseling is decent
College Senior,2,I loved the community but the environment was gross
College Senior,2,The teams don't normally do that well so there isn't as much support.
College Freshman,2,There are cockroaches throughout our housing hall.
College Junior,2,It's all very low income areas. Not in safe areas.
College Student,2,"There are three Mexican restaurants, one Chinese restaurant, and one Italian place. The others are either fast food or catered towards those who love their meat. There are really no vegan/vegetarian options and as far as I know, only Taco Bells offers a student discount, which is 10%."
College Senior,2,It would be really nice if there were more options available to students at the financial aid office - but its mostly focused on FAFSA and loans.
College Senior,2,"Personally I live off campus, but I've worked nights at the library. It's really uncomfortable walking on campus at night, even just to get to your car, mostly because the lighting is so poor. However, aside from some stalking issues a friend had, I haven't heard of anything close to sexual assault happening on campus or near campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,have to live off campus and not may affordable housing
Recent Alumnus,2,It is difficult. having to graduate a yr later because the classes would not fit with my work schedule and having to pay for classes that financial aid should pay for
Recent Alumnus,2,either by the book or dont care
Recent Alumnus,2,Not much help and the rules change at a drop of a hat
College Senior,2,The only place to eat on campus is the book store snack shop or a snack machine
College Senior,2,"There is no public transportation to or from NSU Broken Arrow campus, you must have a car"
College Sophomore,2,There aren't enough residence hall parking spots.
College Freshman,2,The rooms are so old and so small. it feels like you're living in a closet.
College Sophomore,2,There are four sororities and six fraternities. The fraternities for the most part do not care about grades. They drink. The girls do not do a good job of interacting with other sororities. Most do not care about philanthropy
College Junior,2,Your options (other then hitching a ride from friend or family) is the KATS bus which only runs til 5 and could arrive anywhere between five mintues to two hours after you call or the taxi which is pretty expensive.
College Junior,2,No transportation after dark (unless you can afford the taxi) and only one actual club in town. So if you are looking for a nightlife you are likely going out of town into Tulsa or Muskogee.
College Sophomore,2,"Many of the school policies, especially attendance, are fairly lenient.  Most of the teachers simply give bonus points for attending instead of making it a part of the grade.  Noise violations are rarely enforced but also there are not very many noise violations that occur.  The most strict would be parking.  If you park in the wrong spot from 9-5 expect a ticket, but after that you are pretty much in the clear."
College Senior,2,Its only bad because the parking lot is so far from the actual buildings and also because this is Oklahoma... the weather sucks regardless.
College Junior,2,"Again, this is not an area I have experience with."
College Junior,2,"There are no tunnels to connect all the buildings. They close the doors at 8pm, so if you have to move from building to building that late, you are stuck outside in the weather."
College Freshman,2,It doesn't have a graduate program.
College Junior,2,"Parking of campus can be impossible.  I have found it's easier to bring a bike to school to get to class or to get to school early enough so that parking isn't an issue.  However, a bike in the car or biking from the dorm is the best."
College Junior,2,"There are a few bars and clubs, bowling and movies, for summer there is the lake and river to go floating."
College Junior,2,"I had a horrible roommate, which made it awful, but the people I met there were fun. I wish I could have lived in the suites or hastings. At night it can be ridiculous, either you get some creeper guys or some drunk people, all of the time. The rooms and showers in ross are tiny, but all the other dorms are bigger. It is inexpensive to live there and the Resident Assistants are great! 
Also the school started a zombie/human game, it is amazingly fun, it gets the whole campus involved, even if you don't participate in it, it is fun to watch them for a few days."
College Sophomore,2,non traditional students at the Broken Arrow Campus
College Junior,2,"Unfortunately, years ago I had fallen into a default status during a period of my life. Even though I had paid it off, the infraction still remains on my record. So now I dread having to apply each year because I know what it will entail and the hassle is stressful! This is no fault of NSU, but if they would check the records to see that I had been awarded the previous year it would make life easier!"
College Sophomore,2,some professors are very hard on the students you almost have to have a degree to pass their classes.
College Sophomore,2,"They enforce no drugs, alcohol, and nicotine, yet it is still used constantly in mass amounts all over campus. I students suites, dorms, etc. People do these things because they know there is a 90% chance they won't get caught."
College Junior,2,The computers are out dated and very slow. The network is very fast and reliable and the printers are easy to use. The library and computer lab are all very accessible.
College Sophomore,2,You should get a scholarship if you major in business or you're Greek. Anything else pickings are slim to non existent. I receive decent amount of Aid until I have to get books....then I'm paying over 500 bucks out of pocket that I don't have. The Aid office is pretty rude too. They can't do anything its all online...then what is the point of you sitting at a desk where people can come ask you questions? Waste of time and effort.
College Sophomore,2,Could of Been Easier – To find out anything about the financial aid you have to talk to about 3 or 4 different people. Then they ask you to just fill out some forms. Then they like to tell you that you have to do it online.
College Senior,1,Tahlequah is a very unfortunate location for a college due to the lack of safety in the area.
College Sophomore,1,Haha it's Oklahoma. Expect the worst
College Freshman,1,We have no on campus transportation
College Sophomore,1,There is no public transportation that I know of that comes on campus.
College Senior,1,Its non existent in Broken Arrow... Ive heard other things about the Talequah campus.
College Freshman,1,I don't partake in the Nightlife.
College Sophomore,1,The only public transportation is the taxi or two shuttle buses. The fares for the buses are relatively cheap but they do not run after five in the evening and are not often dependable.
College Junior,1,I was very disappointed with how little Northeastern State offered major wise. I wanted to major in Environmental Sciences and was given the run around by several staff.
College Junior,1,"Northeastern State campus life is fairly boring, the only events that happen are soroity and fratnerity based. The campus is barely bike friendly and the are cutting down more and more trees and destroying the side walks and making it extremely dirty to walk through all the dirt. I miss all the trees that use to be on campus."
College Junior,1,"MY specific major i acutally want to major in, is not even available anymore at NSU. I was told due to unpopularity it was taken out. I have been able to take some environmental classes because my intended major is Natural Resources Management and Conservation. So far im running of options for classes i can take here at NSU. It has been very very discouraging and has almost made me want to give up but I want to be educated in this field so much i refuse to give up."
College Junior,1,"There is no transportation provided by the school. You either walk, drive your own car, or call a public transportation business from the city."
College Junior,1,"Financial Aid is pretty much obsolete here.  There isn't even a financial aid department around, I have to go an hour and a half to the nearest campus or call them with any questions because the campus I attend doesn't want to answer my questions."
College Junior,1,"At Northeastern State University they dont have any Environmental Based majors anymore. They took out their Environmental Science BA  due to ""not much interest"" and told me i could do a Environmental Mangagment Major instead. It was really disappointing to find out i cant achieve my goals of having a speciality in Natural Resources Conservation. If i continued my education here i would not be able to get the education i need to achieve my goals or have a proper internship or job in the state of oklahoma."
College Junior,1,Tahlequah Oklahoma is not big enough for transportation. You can barely ride your bike through campus or town without dodging cars!
College Junior,1,the one i wanted is not offered and that is preparation to pass the substance and alcohol counselor test.
College Junior,1,i dont like the program because i dont believe i am learning anything so far that i have not already learned.
College Junior,1,have more selection of classes that people can choose from to work around their work schedule and have fast track classes.
College Freshman,1,"You get tickets for everything! The faculty parking is great, the students'... not so much."
College Junior,1,Northeastern State University Broken Arrow campus does not cater to Greek students in any way. They have no establishments that reflect their acknowledgement of this culture.
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid staff seems very uneducated in their service delivery.They are also rude and they seem unwilling to take out time with students to explain information to them.

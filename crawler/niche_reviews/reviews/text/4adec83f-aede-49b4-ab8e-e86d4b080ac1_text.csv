Freshman,5,The online experience has been awesome. I enjoy not having to walk to my classes every morning. The classes aren’t too long and the teachers sometime even let us out early. Very nice online classes and hopefully it stays that way.
Junior,5,"Adjusting to online classes was a bit of a challenge at the beginning of the pandemic, considering the fact that  we did not have a choice but to do online courses. Now that I have been in introduced to online learning/classes I have the hang of it, I enjoy it but I still miss being in the class room.Most of the  Instructors  at my school incorporated online learning and communication whether it was with online test or quizzes or group discussions and or emails."
Freshman,5,"I love the environment that TSU has created for me. I loved how the teachers would be engaged with the classes I have taken. If I could change anything at TSU I would change Gentry Center. If we fix the track we will be able to host more track meet and therefore will be able to produce more money and with that money, it can help with the up and coming building that is in the making."
Niche User,5,I liked how friendly and helpful your classmate are. I wouldn't change nothing about Tennessee State University.

Freshman,5,"Tennessee State feels like the perfect place for as a new student. The dorms aren't spacious but i could totally get work done. A very vibrant student life and community. I feel like i won't have to worry about bullying or anything like that.
Also, they have top tier safety with the Nashville Police Department. They have their own precinct within jurisdiction of the campus so response time is super quick. The party scene seems like it can be a lot of fun. Of course I still have to watch out for ""party poopers "" but still I can't to get my party on but still can't wait to attend Tennssee State."
Sophomore,5,I love the atmosphere. The way the upperclassman have showed me the way of college life. I've enjoyed being a part of the NSBE and Young Life organizations while there.

Sophomore,5,Everyone is friendly and motivating. It's refreshing to be around so many people working towards their goals.
Junior,5,"It’s a very fun school , it’s up to you to make the most out of your experience. Students and staff are very supporting of whatever you want to do , it will always be a push behind you ."

TSU also has wonderful resources on campus and mentors that will help you along the way, even when you feel like there's nobody there. I made a perfect choice with picking Tennessee State University, because the people on campus want to help and make sure that your college career can be the smoothest process and that getting a job/internship won't be a problem either. I wouldn't change anything about my major or school."
Niche User,5,"I feel it is a great experience. Coming from someone who has seen a vast majority of people graduate from Tennessee State University and become so successful only motivates me to do just that. Between the academic environment covering all aspects of what you need to know with in that specific major and staying on task not only from myself but with the help of others such as counseling and friends. This school is a great selection not only for me but for everyone, here is where you can have a straight and successful path in reaching your goals in life."
Niche User,5,I am a incoming freshman. I'm super excited for the things coming my way from the school. It is very nice and well put together. I can't wait to see where tsu will take me.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Tennessee state university over all is a magnificent one. I feel safe at all times and my classes are wonderful. TSU is a diverse campus, and the organizations are professional and hardworking. I would like to see new and healthier food at TSU because the food we eat is most likely cheap and processed.

Junior,5,Tn State offers dynamic professors who genuinely care about the students receiving a quality education
Niche User,5,"Tennessee State is one of the best HBCU in the nation. Everything about Tennessee State I love. I visited Tennessee State during my senior year. On my visit, I knew Tennessee State would be the place I called ""home"" for the next 4 years. The students at Tennessee State are very nice and easy to make friends. During my visit, random students would have a conversation with me or give me  a greeting on their way to class."
Niche User,5,"Over the summer I visited multiple HBCU’s, one happened to be TSU and I fell in love! The campus was so open offering a nice scene of trees. The tour was great to we had a tour of the whole campus besides the dorms that’s something I wish we would’ve seen. After my visit to Tennessee State University it’s one of my top choices and may be going there in Fall of 2019."
Junior,5,I'm so glad that I attend Tennessee State. This university may not be perfect but it has been a great experience. This school makes an effort to keep students coming back each semester. I am an out of state student and this school is very affordable to attend. This school holds everyone accountable when it comes to grades and behavior.  They strive themselves in ensuring students graduates in 4 yrs and are able to attend  graduate school and being marketable in the workforce.
Freshman,5,Tennessee State University is one of the best HBCU experiences ever. The professors  genuinely care about you . The students are extremely nice .You’ll feel super safe while you’re here
Sophomore,5,"First starting with my personal opinion Tennessee state university feels like home to me if you ask me why I will tell you because it’s a great university that makes all her students more than families , to me this university is a safe place I always want to be in I just finished my freshman year but so far I love it it’s fantastic in and out . One thing that I would like to share with others about Tennessee state is that you will hear so much bad rumors about the university and it will make you change your mind and you will not feel safe but don’t judge the college until you try it because it’s a great place to learn and not just that it’s an amazing place that gathers friends together. Last one thing I would want to change about the university would be that people just need to stop talking bad about the college because it’s not what people think it is TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY is a great place to go college and to be proud."
Sophomore,5,"I loved TSU. Everybody is so friendly and we still had fun while we did academics The food was good, and the campus is beautiful. The dorms were ok, could be better. Party scene was amazing, we just needed to invest in some air conditioners. Everybody got a long for the most part. We support one another and w are big on sports."
Freshman,5,This school is excellent. There are so many great things that it has to offer and an amazing Business School!
Sophomore,5,Tennessee State University is a very great school and the academics are even better. The staff are very helpful as long as you are willing to help yourself. There are always activities that are being held to keep us as a school together and that is what I love about TSU. The only thing I would like to see improve is the staffs attitudes as well as different departments answering the phone and being more helpful.
Sophomore,5,I would change the way that people see tsu because of its area of choose and the students that we have at the school . Tennessee State University is a place where you can truly find yourself and understand what your future holds and how to strive to stay focused get to get to that point . I’m so glad I go to tsu cause I love my big blue . It is a place of differ diversities you can meet different people in our eyes we’re all the same even if we  have different skin tones or talk a certain way.
Senior,5,It’s a great public college. Professors are very helpful and knowledgeable. I made it to medical school not without their help. Their labs needs serious upgrades. I enjoyed my time here. I highly suggest to attend especially if you are minority other than black. Neighborhood is average but downtown Nashville is less than 5 minutes drive. Let’s go TSU.
Junior,5,I WOULD RATE TSU 5STARS I AM A SPECIAL NEED STUDENT AND UNLIKE HIGHSCHOOL IWAS ABLE TO FIT RIGHT IN I WAS IN MARCHING BAND AND MY MAJOR WAS ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING A REAL HARD CHALLENGE BECAUSE OF MY DISABILITY IT TAKE A LITTLE LONGER FOR ME TO CONNECT AND ONCE MY PROF WERE MADE AWARE THEY HAD NO PROBLEM WORKING WITH ME MY BEST EXPERIENCE WAS BEING PART OF BEST COLLEGE  MARCHING BAND  TRAVEL BEING ACCEPTED CAMPUS LIFE AT TSU IS EXTRAORDINARY IN A GOOD WAY PEOPLE FROM ALL WALK OF LIFE ATTEND NO HAS REGRETS

Niche User,5,It was very welcoming and it just feels like being at home. Everyone is very kind and they speak which is rare when being around kids sometimes.
Sophomore,5,i went there for my first 2 semesters and i trasferred to fisk to play soccer for their team but now am going back to tsu because i feel good there and its better
Freshman,5,TSU is a very diverse school and they focus on bettering their students and getting them ready for the real world.

Sophomore,5,I'm from Kansas City Kansas and I love TSU this is my second year and I'm studying criminal justice.
Freshman,5,"My over all  experience at TSU has been great. I am an out of state student so the biggest thing I enjoyed is the feeling of a ""family community"". The professors are helpful they care about you. You can go to them for help and they have time for you. The overall feeling of family helps to focus on my studies and not worry about the little things."
Graduate Student,5,"Several undergraduate majors and minors to choose from. Graduate degrees (up to doctorate levels) are available also, with dedicated faculty members and staff. An overall great learning environment. Situated in the heart of Nashville, the music city."

Freshman,5,Tennessee is an excellent College for me. Academics is great. The professor care about you. They have a lot of activities on campus. All and all it a excellent college.
Freshman,5,My time at the University was great. So may different people. Professors are very kind and work well with the students.  The RAs are very helpful and the school has maybe groups and clubs to join. Thw one thing that i would change about the school is dorms or residents halls. They need some updates.
Graduate Student,5,I love how supportive and encouraging the staff and faculty are.  Always available and ready to help
Junior,5,I really enjoy the determination the students have toward each other. Also the faculty and staff's willingness to help the students.
Freshman,5,The teacher here are really passionate about what they teach. I've been here a few months and have learned so much. The advisers are extremely helpful and guide you down the right path. My experience has been great thus far.
Freshman,5,My experience with Tennessee state. I came here as a freshman. I didn't know any one. I was afraid and didn't know what to expect. They were warm and made me feel welcome. Sent I been here it make me feel like a home away from home. What I like about T.S.U. They have Excellent Professors and plenty of activities on campus for the students. I don't know what I like to change as of yet because I haven't been here long enough.
Freshman,5,I’ve had a great experience at school. The staff there show you that they are not just there for the job but that they care about the well-being of the students. I didn’t have enough money to pay for school and they helped me find resources to allow me to be able to stay. I definitely feel at home and the education being provided will definitely help me advance in life.
Freshman,5,"I like administration that they have on campus and the support from the peers. The dorm are great to stay in, I love the fact that theirs a officer always on duty at all time know matter what time of day it is in case you need help with any type of problems that might on"
Niche User,5,When I visited the campus this summer it was amazing. The students who were our tour guides were friendly and made the campus feel like it's home.  The environment was relaxing and it felt like a place anyone could be able to be themselves at.
Junior,5,I really like this school because we always work as family and the teachers are amazing. Maybe renew the building...
Senior,4,"reliable technology services. Instructors are well prepared to adapt to changes during the pandemic. They have handled structuring the curriculum to remain flexible with the uncertainty of the current state of the nation, adhering to local and state laws and policies."
Senior,4,Great culture and class environment. All staff and professors have a genuine interest in making sure you have the tools and resources necessary to succeed.
Freshman,4,My experience so far at Tennessee State University has been absolutely great. Even during this pandemic I have met plenty of nice people and my professors are very caring and want me to succeed. The campus is decent size and the facilities are awesome. I am excited to see what the rest of the year has in store for me. I recommend this school 100%. Only problem with the school is the freshman dorms. They’re not the greatest but they’re okay. Also the office takes a little too long to update and get back to you but it might be due to this pandemic we’re in. Other than that this school is awesome.
Niche User,4,"The online classes were decent , and easy to understand . Some of the professors were extremely helpful ."
Niche User,4,"The online course structure includes scheduled lectures via Zoom, and tests on lockdown . The professors take an extra effort to ensure their students are learning for real world sucess. Just beware regarding high out-of-state tuition costs."
Niche User,4,"This University is a great one, with great online course structure. The upside is the education, the downside is high price if you are an out-of-state student on th graduate level."
Freshman,4,The online classes that I have taken have been very interactive. The teachers have great. The information was very clear. I enjoyed the online classes the teacher were helpful
Freshman,4,This my first year attending TSU.  Since COVID-19 the school has been trying to keep in touch with us and helping with the transition from high school to college with ease. I can say they are working hard and coming up with plans to make sure we are able to attend the college in the fall. Overall the school is trying it best to be pro-active.
Senior,4,"I like the experience at Tennessee State University. Ive made friends and learned more than I did in high school. I would say the food, room and board could be better for the price. I wish the TSU and other HBCU's had an actual class offered or required for seniors to display opportunities and wisdom on what is available after graduation. No one gives you actual insight on what it is like to graduate and have absolutely no idea on what's to come next or options on what do next for the next chapter of your life. How are students suppose to be financially stable coming out college? How are students being successfully prepared for the future if not given guidance. TSU is a great school to attend overall for many different reasons.Of course there are several things that should be fixed like any other college, but overall I couldn't have picked a better university to attend."
Junior,4,"I enjoy my university very much its so much fun there is always something to do on campus from clubs, organization etc.  its super diverse and is cultured as well I absolutely love that about my school, especially being long ways from home ts nice that I feel as if I belong since I was a Freshman. Things about my school that I would like to see a change and improvement  is the urgency to get things done through the admission department,services specifically for students to be successful on campus as well as in the classroom."
Senior,4,"Diversity. I love the diversity of the students on campus, the faculty, and the professors. Every individuals bring something unique to the table, and the faculty is always willing to assist you in achieving your goals."

Senior,4,"Tennessee State is a great school. If you properly use your resources provided, getting through your desired program will be easier."
Sophomore,4,My overall experience with TSU is pretty good. The teachers I've had were helpful and understanding to my problems and the work load is just enough to keep me thinking.
Sophomore,4,We had a good time when they provide events for the students and the teachers are helpful when you need help.
Sophomore,4,It’s simply and not difficult at all. You Professor will have days where he/she have one on ones so you can understand the lesson.
Freshman,4,I am not the best online learner so switching from on campus to online was a dramatic change for me. Learning online a TSU was fairly easy and the instructors make it to were everyone can understand
Freshman,4,"Tennessee State has a wonderful law enforcement program and this is right down my career path. They also have a variety of internships I can apply for to help me better my future career. Tennessee State also have great communication skills they always reach out to me when somethings needs to be either looked at or corrected. Tennessee stays on top of their students students success, grades, and outside life. The University also offers multiple opportunities to grow as an individual and be more independent. Tennessee is and excellent school and I highly recommend it."
Freshman,4,"Best HBCU in the land! Just like all colleges it has its ups and downs and a lot can be improved. Getting in contact with admissions can be very difficult and I did not know I was accepted until months later, but after that mistake all was great. They make you feel very welcome as you adjust to college life and the upperclassmen are very welcoming. Everyone wants you to succeed which makes it a great atmosphere. The athletics are great and no game or party is dull."
Freshman,4,"Tennessee State University has a family atmosphere. As an African-American student, I feel at home, since this is an HBCU. However, I wish that the female housing was more suitable to average living conditions."
Niche User,4,"Its a HBCU that has all the traditional majors and programs, and is fairly priced based on other schools.  Its also located next to Meharry Medical College so if you want to pursue a career that requires more than an undergraduate degree, you won't have to move far."
Graduate Student,4,"Tennessee State University was a great experience for me, I was a transfer student from a different college and earned my Bachelor's degree in Child and Family Consumer Sciences. I made lots of friends with people of different backgrounds whether it be the professors or my fellow peers. Some of the professors, to this day, I'm still close with and like to check in with. I learned a lot from their courses and course materials. They have a lot of diversity that one can see when walking on campus and sitting in class. If there was something I would want to change, it would probably be renovating the buildings and having younger, fresh professors who aren't as worn out and can bring new ideas into the classroom."
Freshman,4,Tennessee State University is an amazing college. Being an historically black college it has opened up my eyes to cultural diversity. The atmosphere of thethe school is warm and safe.
Niche User,4,"I have been to TSU plenty of times for homecoming events. I love it although it is not pretty safe because something is always happening, being around fun people the college experience is fun. I would honestly love to attend TSU considering that it is my first choice along with Spelman College. I like HBCUs and TSU is an open school meaning that it is easy to get into. The admissions office is unorganized so it will take a while to be admitted or even know your admission status. You will constantly get emails about how something is missing when in reality, they have not got them yet or they have been lost. A lot of papers are everywhere in the office."
Freshman,4,"I love how the school feels like a home. College is a huge transition & the students, the president & professors are extremely welcoming. Maybe it’s the southern hospitality! :)"
Freshman,4,I like the idea of the small classrooms. You get to ask as many questions as you want to. Having the chance to experience so much as a freshman is very important. There is freshman week that everyone gets to know everyone. The freshman dorms could be updated and exterminated. In the Wilson dorm there are cockroaches and rats. I would just keep your dorm clean and bring cleaning supplies with you.
Niche User,4,"The campus was very beautiful and because of its's location in the city, it is very convenient to find fun things to do with your friends. The location in the inner city also allows students attending the college to easily find internships to gain experience in their desired career field."
Sophomore,4,"The faculty are very nice, they will go out of their way to help you even if it has nothing to do with their class. They will help you find internships and fill out scholarships and can also find jobs for you or give you recommendation letters. The alumni presence is very strong here as well, they love their school and anybody who attends. Many times the alumni have came together to help pay for people to stay here when they couldn't afford it. It's a wonderful experience to be a part of, I love my HBCU.The academics, the opportunities, and the spirit are the top three reasons one should attend Tennessee State University."
Freshman,4,"I am going to be a freshman in the fall and my sister is going to be a junior.  Before she left for school we she went to orientation and I had the opportunity to be able to attend that with her. While there we explored the beautiful campus and seen what the school could possibly offer. This year recently, I've had the opportunity to go and get a feel and look for myself. At TSU there is a family environment and that is what i will need being away from my home for the first time on my own. They let you know that you have nothing to worry about as long as you stay focus and maintain a good GPA. The party life is also going to be fun because they ""TURN UP THERE"", I can't wait. My sister told me the moments that I will make here will last me for a lifetime,  Although I've only been to the school a couple times I have a great feeling about this and I am looking forward to it."
Sophomore,4,"Tennessee State is one of the best Historically Black colleges there is to offer. The community, environment and the city itself offers many opportunities and is also very comforting. Once you get the hang of everything, you will feel just like you are at home. Tennessee State University is a home away from home."
Sophomore,4,Tennessee State University has taught me not only academics but life lessons as well. The professors really care about the well being of their students and they want us to succeed. I love my HBCU!
Junior,4,"Tennessee State University is a great school , It's a HBCU school that makes you feel like you're a family. The teachers are great and I love the campus and environment. If I would have to change something I would change the cafeteria food and the financial aid staff. The dorms could be better , the dorms need a lot of work done on them."
Senior,4,"I like the opportunities, environment, and professors here. The professors try to engage students in learning and care about if we are able to master the material. Professors give constant feedback and inform us about connections and work opportunities. The environment is welcoming and the weather is stable. There is not that much diversity, but people are friendly."
Senior,4,"I love the academic opportunities here at the university. However, the general campus area is not very safe."
Sophomore,4,I liked the diversity of the campus and how so many people get engaged next i like how you get to know your proffers more then what other campus do because that help you understand your work even more
Freshman,4,I like the diversity between the campus and how you can get engaged in so many things  next i like the professors how they teach and get to build a bond with you on the side so you can stay connected
Sophomore,4,"I sincerely love Tennessee State University with all my might. If I wouldn't have gone to TSU, I wouldn't have gotten the full college experience. We have a huge free tutoring program in our school involving almost all fields of study. We also have many student tutors to help each other go through our journey. TSU has so many organizations on campus that you will always be apart of something and find your group of friends. I hope that many students realize how good Tennessee State University is so that  they may have the best four years of learning they can have."
Niche User,4,When I went to visit Tennessee state University it was a good experience because the environment was so open and welcoming. Being a Senior in High School and traveling to different colleges TSU was the college that had the best environment and offered the best classes to take for my career which is Mechanical Engineering. But I believe that I would like to attention TSU for my freshman year of college.
Senior,4,Tennessee state university is a historical black college that is big on makin she the student life feels welcome. Everyone makes the environment so warm and open to get to know so many people . I have had my best and worst moments at Tennessee state university and I would not change the path this institution has taken me on.
Senior,4,"Overall, Tennessee State University is a great school. There are so many resources and ways to become active and involved on campus. Although, some things could be better, there are plenty of staff members and professors who advocate for the well being of the students and the University as a whole."
Freshman,4,"Being so far away from my mom and not knowing anyone was a big adjustment.. Not being able to drive around and do things lelft me bored. My mom always told me things will happen for you when you get out and make them happen get involved. That’s what I did, made friends and joined a club. The first half of my freshman year has been a learning experience. When I return for the spring semester I will know what to expect and have a better idea of what I have to do to make college not only a learning experience but fun as well."
Alum,4,TSU was a great place for me to obtain my undergraduate education. I was given many opportunities that shaped where I am today. Very family oriented. Go Big Blue!
Graduate Student,4,"If you are looking for an HBCU experience in Tennessee this is definitely the school that you want to be a part of. You can become a part of various excelling  academic base organizations, and some spectacular extracurricular activities such as the marching band which is the heart of the school. Most classes are small-medium which can give you an intimate class and setting to better connect with your teacher in other classmates."
Sophomore,4,I like the comforting environment that Tennessee State University gives. There are plenty ways to get involved and I love that they hold a student fair every Wednesday. One change I would like to see is overall building improvements. The library only provides several working computers and some buildings are outdated.
Junior,4,My three years attending TSU has been a good experience.  The main problem I do have with TSU is the dorms needs to be updated.  Other than that I am very happy that I chose TSU.
Senior,4,I love the campus. The only thing i have a continuous problem with is the financial aid department. Dealing with them I’ve had to quit school twice because of horrible policy and bad communication skills on their part. Dorms are also horrible. At least the freshmen ones are. I refused to live in the women’s freshmen dorm my first year and moved into the better upper class one.
Junior,4,"I enjoy Tennessee state university, but there are a lot of things that needs improvements. Its a very fun school to attend but there are always issues with the housing, financial aid department and the food is really bad. The people are what makes TSU a great school to attend. They also have a great engineering and computer science department."
Sophomore,4,"With Complete Honesty, I originally didn’t choose this HBCU due to rumors I heard. But once I got to the campus it was like rumors never existed because culturally speaking it’s truly like a family connection with whomever you come in contact with. Staff and administration included and I love that about TSU. I had a plan before for when I went in but after my freshman year I definitely knew I was going to stay at TSU all 4 years of my college career and I’m happy with my decision and no one will ever change that! #GOBIGBLUE"
Alum,4,"TSU gets a bit of an unfair reputation.  The academics are good, if you put the time in and use the resources available to you while you're there.  I went through the Political Science Dept. and there are some genuinely outstanding staff and faculty there."
Freshman,4,What I like about TSU is the ability to feel at home and that everyone cares. If there’s an issue it is always somewhere to go and someone who cares. It is also more diverse than one would think and through that it is possible to meet new people from all different backgrounds.
Graduate Student,4,I love my school did graduate and undergraduate here! This is the only public university in Nashville so prices are really inexpensive compared to elsewhere! Super diverse and wonderful well knit community!
Junior,4,"Great HBCU! Athletics are good. Campus life is good during the week but dead on the weekends. In order to succeed, you have to put in the work."
Freshman,4,"Tennessee Stare University is a great school. I like that they always email you about what’s going on, on campus. Something I would like to see a change in is in the food varieties and the dorm living arrangements."
Freshman,4,It is a good school to go to you'll learn a lot by going here.  There is a lot to do so there will never be a dull moment while you attend this college
Freshman,4,I like all the diversity on the campus. You get to meet someone new everyday. I don't think there is anything that needs to be changed right now.
Freshman,4,"Tennessee State is a great place for kids to come and feel welcomed. They take  education serious, and want everyone to succeed. I would like them to change the way the conduct business."
Freshman,4,I love the fact that Tennessee State University is close to Nashville and the people at the school are very friendly
Niche User,4,"The staff is extremely helpful, I call with any problems I have and they work to assure that the issue is fixed with ease. Some schools have poor over the phone customer service but whenever I call Tennessee State Admissions, I am always satisfied with my call."
Freshman,4,"I Love the sense of having what seems as family away from home, a welcoming bond that we all share. I was disappointed with the few number of electric outlets in my dorm room."
Junior,4,"My year there was great, the teachers were thoughtful and friendly. I was encourage to be better and be greater"
Alum,2,"I received two Masters Degrees from TSU. My first in Administration and Supervision, my second in Speech Pathology. I had great experiences with my first Masters and enjoyed working with the Education department. However, my second Master's degree the experience was completely different.  Mary Dale Fitzgerald was very condescending to me and even accused me of plagiarism.  The online professors were not prepared, and classes were canceled or not held a majority of the time. Because of this, I was not prepared to take my Praxis exam, resulting in me not passing the test by just a few points. 

Knowing what I know now, I wish I had filed complaints. I do not want any others to experience what I had experienced. Since then I have earned an Ed.S degree from a different University. When you attend a University with competent and professional instructors  it is a reminder of how unprofessional the Speech Path department is at TSU."
Sophomore,2,"My experience at this school has not been great. The school is very unorganized, and it feels as if the different departments are working independently. The departments don't know anything about each other, and they don't want to help you. Trying to get anything done is impossible. The dorms have not been renovated in years, and you can tell. The overall experience in the classroom felt more like high school than college."
Sophomore,2,"My online experience wasn't the greatest experience I've had, but that wasn't necessarily the school's fault, it was just to much work for doing an Engineering class at home."
Freshman,2,"I’m experience here has been on and off good and bad. Honestly I wouldn’t recommend this school because, the school is not really helpful, dorms living is terrible, doesn’t answer the phone, doesn’t help you when you ask for help in whatever you need help in, and will leave you in the dark about Hingis you need to know."
Freshman,2,"In my opinion, Tennessee State is a college that make sure everyone is connected in some way. There is always things going on with our student body and I love it. But, the housing wasn't really good. We went through more than two power outages as a school and I feel like we shouldn't have been through one. We pay way too much to go through anything like it."
Freshman,2,"Well the professors, academics, and scenery of the campus are all decent. I rated the school, overall, 2 stars because of how disgusting it it. Eppse, Boyd, Wilson, and Watson Hall are all dorm halls that are infested with roaches and other disgusting bugs. On my first night here (staying in Eppse) me and my roomate had to kill a brown recluse spider we had seen on the ceiling. The only decent resident halls on campus are Rudolph and Hale so, try your best to get in either of those. Another thing thats nasty is the cafeteria food. A video went viral (on campus) of maggots being found in the stir fry. There were also reports of a rat being loose in the cafeteria last year. The final bad thing I'd like to mention about the campus is how theirs nothing to do around campus, except party. If you do not have a car, there is a free public bus that can take you to and from downtown Nashville."
Niche User,2,"I went to TSU for AFROTC.  The Cadre is outstanding!! Most of the recruits come from other schools, it was awesome to talk to other people from other schools and learn about their school. They really want you to succeed and are there for you.  Det. 790 really is outstanding!! I really enjoyed my time there, even though it was cut short. 

The school itself........ I had some really great teachers and made some really awesome friends, but the administration and some of the teaching staff need some work.  The President of the school really is trying her best to make it better! 


School - 2 stars
AFROTC - 5 stars and to infinity beyond!


I would recommend this school for its AFROTC program!"
Freshman,2,"Overall TSU is a great school academically! great professors willing to help and work with you. Horrible financial aid office, no assistance when needed and they don't keep you up to date about your financial issues."
Junior,2,This university is very behind on the times. I have experienced terrible situations already and I haven't even began the semester. The staff is unfriendly and useless. They don't make you feel as a student that they want to help you. They just want to be right. It is also not in a very good part of town.
College Junior,2,"Firstly, some of them are very dirty. I lived in two different dorms and one of them was very dirty, like no one cleaned for ages. Sometimes I could not use restroom. My door was not closing from inside and no one fixed it for a whole year. I talked with them several times but no one came."
College Junior,2,They are only few kinds of greek housing available. They cheer the atmosphere up. They do some performances which are very nice and students enjoy them.
College Freshman,2,professors need to care more.
College Sophomore,2,They need a complete renovation
College Junior,2,I hateeee housing.  The dorms are nasty!
College Freshman,2,"I believe almost every dorm needs to be updated. Especially the freshmen dorms, this year i did not have the best experience in the dorms and I would hate for the next class to experience what I did. We are also being treated like children here at the dorms unlike other HBCU's"
College Freshman,2,I honestly feel that TSU need a better greek life. Its very rare that you do see all of the sororities or fraternities out on campus or pretty much anywhere.
College Freshman,2,"Living in Wilson Hall is frustrating because the girls in this building do not know how to clean up after themselves. They leave trash everywhere, they never flush the toilet, and they are loud at crazy hours of the night. They especially never follow the rules. For example our quiet hours are from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. you don't have to be extremely quiet but quiet enough where the other girls can't hear you, but here they do not care what time it is they scream down the hallway and slam doors, play music real loud. They don't have respect for anyone else that lives here and it is very irritating especially for people that go to sleep or are studying. Another rule we have is to make sure when you take your trash out put it in the dumpster outside the basement. The girls can't even do that! They put it by there basement door, knowing that could bring bugs and rodents into the building. They would also put their personal trash in the bathroom trash can, when on the door it clearly says not to put it in there because the cleaning people won't take it out. It makes sense because the cleaning people are not responsible for throwing our trash away we are! The last rule is not to smoke in the building. First marijuana is illegal in Tennessee so they shouldn't be smoking it anyway, but of course they do. I'm not sure why because the smell of it is strong so it's easy to smell. All the rules that these girls break are affecting our visitation and the girls that deserve visitation don't get it because of the girls that break all the rules everyday."
College Freshman,2,We have toughen up the security on campus. Near the campus shootings have occurred and we  were not sure we were safe but its better now.
College Freshman,2,"I am fortunate to live in Rudolph so Im lucky, but if your dont live in Rudolph or Hale you'll hate it"
College Freshman,2,I don't see any recruits for my major on my major. I barely see anything for my major. This school is trying to hold onto their nursing accreditation
College Freshman,2,I don't see any recruits for my major on my major. I barely see anything for my major. This school is trying to hold onto their nursing accreditation
College Freshman,2,"I feel like I'm cheated out of 35,000 a year. This place sucks and the math department is terrible. Majority of freshmen almost failed for the semester. I'm too old for visitation. The food is disgusting. The halls are old and we can live off campus until our junior year."
College Sophomore,2,The process with the financial aid office was a hassle to deal with.
College Junior,2,I don't feel like they try to help as much as they can. It takes a while for them to process your aid.
College Freshman,2,"When you call for assistance the workers are either not available, on an attitude, or just plane rude and not helpful."
College Freshman,2,The food is not well prepared and its the same thing everyday.
College Freshman,2,There's pizza everyday. The salad bar sucks because everything is wilted and its been sitting out since breakfast. The Asian station is the best thing but they only have like two people working it so there's always a long line. They have a waffle maker on all day until dinner and there is little to no variety. we pretty much have the same thing everyday and its usually gross.
College Sophomore,2,"It's not the worst but it could be better. Service is only bad because they never have all of the correct documentation in a timely manner. It takes weeks for financial aid to be awarded, and that's only after you have hassled them constantly."
College Freshman,2,"There is little to no variation in menu choices, the hours for the main cafeteria are terrible, and there are not enough ways to use the meal plan."
College Freshman,2,"I've seen plenty of party flyers around campus. I've been to a few and I've hated them. One was only bearable thanks to some friends. But everyone else seems to like the parties, but clubs with rap music and grinding is not my scene."
College Freshman,2,"They try to be strict with some things but it just doesn't work. You will literally see people smoking next to a no smoking sign, including teachers. The when it comes to simple things like just having visitors in the lounge of a dorm it's totally restricted. Also cigarette smoke and weed can be smelled inside the dorms at times and no one does anything about it even though it's supposed to be prohibited."
College Freshman,2,I do not live in dorms but I have visited inside and some do need maintenance
College Freshman,2,Its better to live in state if you want any money through refunds.
College Freshman,2,There are many fights and shooting going around.
College Freshman,2,"They're trying to make changes, but it's not working."
College Senior,2,"I had to visit the financial aid office several times, before getting a portion of aid to help pay for my classes. I had to pay the rest, which was a great financial burden. My only hope is that it will pay off in the near future."
College Freshman,2,"There's a lot to do on campus with the students. They have a lot of fashion shows, talent shows, Greek events, and  parties. On campus is okay if you join the right club, and enter the right social settings. This year it hasn't been as safe as it should be, but, the activities make you kind of forget about it. If you think about doing anything off campus and you don't have a car, prepare yourself to spend hundreds of dollars on Uber rides and Lyfts"
College Freshman,2,security and police officers are very limited on campus. there needs to be more lights around the area. campus crime is very high due to the lack of security.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I ALWAYS had an issue with financial aid. The painful experience with them losing my information, the waiting, etc. I think this was the worst part of my experience as a student at TSU."
College Freshman,2,My experience with financial aid wasn't a good one being that I got chose for the verification. Which meant sending in extra paper work on top of the paper work I had to already sent in. Then there is like a million steps before you are ACTUALLY done. Every time I thought I was done I was getting another email about something missing. Then it would kill me to call actually call financial aid because they would have me on hold forever. But when it was all set and done I got my money on time which is all that matters to me.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I always hear things around campus, but I don't live on campus."
College Senior,2,"The school is known for their disorganization. Most offices you feel like a burden, staff isn't very helpful."
College Junior,2,"Our school is in the middle of a debatable area. It's not really bad & not much happens on our campus yet, they try to link a lot of things that do happen in the area just based on the close proximity to our school."
College Junior,2,I just wish there were at lease some more or better options. We can't use our meal plan off campus like other near by schools so our choices are very slim.
College Sophomore,2,like any other school. it moves very slow and you have to constantly call.
College Senior,2,"Athletics are not a big part of campus life. Sororities and fraternities are where most students dedicate their time. However, homecoming week gathers a lot of support for the football team and is an exciting week to be a part of."
College Sophomore,2,It isn't really strict until a person is caught under the influence. Which isn't common.
College Sophomore,2,Most people at TSU partake in marijuana.
College Sophomore,2,"Compared to other universities, their computers are bad."
College Junior,2,I dont got out to clubs.
College Junior,2,I have heard students complain  about have rats in their dorm room but I have never seen none while on campus.
College Junior,2,"It seems like it's too strict for its own good, but I have realized it is an HBCU thing as far as visitation rules go."
College Freshman,2,"It is an HBCU, so it is mostly African American students. However, there are other races on campus."
College Freshman,2,"The housing near my school is not ideal. The apartments are not very nice, and the neighborhood isn't exactly the nicest or safest place in the city. The cost isn't bad, and it is extremely close to the school, but sometimes that isn't always a good thing."
College Freshman,2,"I do not use the transportation much. But the few times that I did ride the bus to the Avon-Williams campus, I had to wait awhile for the bus to come. It doesn't really run at the scheduled times."
College Junior,2,"The professors have been hit or miss, for every good professor I've had, I've had two bad.  The curriculum is not rigorous although you'd think it was by how difficult most of the students make it out to be.  The registration process is a pain every semester for me personally but it might be unique to my personal situation.  It being TSU I wouldn't be suprised if it were like that for everyone."
College Junior,2,"Dont try to contact Financial Aid during registration by phone. I sat on hold for 2 and 1/2 hours and never got through to a person. Went to see them in person and still had to wait an hour. My question was hardly answered. Applying for financial aid is not bad and even after it is applied to the account it is good, however, trying to get them to apply it before getting ""purged"" is practically a never!"
College Senior,2,they need to revamp everything about housing
College Freshman,2,Were by so much poverty its hard to go out at night by yourself its unsafe.
College Freshman,2,Same thing everyday and some things will make you sick.
Junior,1,"It's horribly ran, no one cares about the students. The faculty are hard to understand and don't give clear directions as to what is expected in the course. The people who are hired to get help for courses should be fired cause they don't give any help when the students brings it to their attention. Please go somewhere else for college these are the worst years of my life and I hope never to relive them as I regret everyday that I went to Tennessee State University. This university has not only failed me as a student but as a person trying to find a once in a lifetime experience. I can't stress this enough, please consider going somewhere else near you and not Tennessee State University, you won't regret."

Niche User,1,Administration and admissions are extremely unorganized. Had to wait nearly a weeks before receiving her classes . They never answer the phone in an department . But that doesn’t matter because apparently the parties are fun . Would not recommend .
Alum,1,"I received two Masters Degrees from TSU. My first in Administration and Supervision, my second in Speech Pathology. I had great experiences with my first Masters and enjoyed working with the Education department. However, my second Master's degree the experience was completely different.

When you attend a University with competent and professional instructors  it is a reminder of how unprofessional the Speech Path department is at TSU."
Graduate Student,1,"TSU staff and professors are grossly incompetent.  My immediate family has 2 Masters degrees, 4 Bachelor's degrees, and 1 Associate's degree and have taken classes at 11 different Universities, including APSU, UT Knoxville, and MTSU.  TSU is by far the worst institution of higher learning we have had the misfortune of having to deal with.  Stay away, STAY FAR AWAY."

TSU is by far the worst institution of higher learning we have had the misfortune of having to deal with.  Stay away, STAY FAR AWAY."
Senior,1,It is the worst school I have ever attended. I have never met people who have never wanted to do their job like at TSU. The staff is extremely rude and they have no sense of urgency. I have attended 3 other universities and nothing compares to the lack of professionalism that this school has.
Alum,1,Just as any university it all depends on the specific professor. Some professors were great and took their job seriously and others did not.
Freshman,1,"They literally lose everything. Most of the teachers are racist and don't actually teach instead they''l either give you the answers or just give you busy work and put grades based on you ethnicity. Also, they had maggots in the food they were trying to sell. I absolutely would not recommend this college to anyone. I'm transferring to Middle Tennessee State University."
Senior,1,"Could be better if half of the staff in the admissions, Bursar’s, financial aid, and records office showed more respect and spoke with students in a respectful tone and if teachers showed more enthusiasm in a students willingness to learn"
Freshman,1,"Not sure who’s giving these so called good reviews. TSU was horrible the only thing I could overlook was the dirty campus and trash everywhere. My sons room flooded and he waited nearly a week to have it resolved. The RAs were a joke! The constant smell of weed in the dorms and on campus should not be tolerated. The rats in the kitchen and dorm rooms carrying disease is enough to make you sick. The campus was unsafe. Any and everyone could walk around freely on the campus and dorms. The shootings were not properly dealt with, kidnappings and robberies either. I plan on seeking legal advice to regain some or all of my money!"
Niche User,1,"Terrible school. The chemistry building is nasty. There were cockroaches all over, the bathrooms were always dirty and some of them didn't even have soap, the labs were disgusting. I always felt like I needed to shower immediately after leaving class/lab. The teachers were crazy."
Niche User,1,"I have been having a problem with my financial add and no one will return to my calls so I can get it straight . I have been calling everyday all at different times even my mom have been trying to call no one will answer. You'll think they'll answer since it's dealing with money . This is bad business, I really want to go here but I can't get in touch with no one . Bad business"
College Junior,1,"The athletes are spoiled. Constantly cheat. And nothing is said to them. The fact that they attend school and don't even apply themselves is more than frustrating to the average student, and the fact that the teachers know it is going on and don't bother to do anything about it screams injustice for us non college athlete students."
College Freshman,1,"wilson hall is where most freshman live unless you come in as an honor student but wilson is terrible with many incidnets from rats, to raoches, to stinky females ."
College Junior,1,I hate living on campus
College Freshman,1,The professors have crappy attitudes
College Freshman,1,"Wilson hall is the worst hall to live in. It stinks, the rooms are small and our plumbing sucks, we have roaches, ants, mice and beetles"
College Freshman,1,I feel unsafe on campus. There are security guards only at certain entrances.
College Junior,1,The athletic facilities really need to be updated. The quality of the equipment is very poor.
College Freshman,1,We have no where around campus to eat except Wendys and its regular price
College Sophomore,1,"It takes an arm and leg to get all your admission things in line. Staff is very rude and not understandable. Wish they understood, that it's students like us that they even have a job. Once you get pass the whole process, I've heard the professors are not bad at all. So keep bugging them until you don't need them anymore. They tend to lose lots of documents!!!!"
College Sophomore,1,"Everything is extremely expensive and there is not many livable options around campus, most are at least 20 mins away."
College Sophomore,1,Security is never where they need to be and always seems to arrive after trouble has fled.
College Sophomore,1,It's like being in a military school...horrible.
College Sophomore,1,It's definitely not the party school it was when I first began my journey here in 2006.
College Sophomore,1,A group of kids picking their friends and looking over anyone they didn't like for any miscellaneous reason.
College Sophomore,1,"Housing, if there is any available, is definitely a headache waiting to happen. Over priced and under privilaged would be my best description of the situation."
College Freshman,1,I did not get nothing but two grants and the rest loans. I do not want to owe the government for the rest of my life.
College Freshman,1,The school is in the middle of an particular area where the crime rate is high. My friend was walking back from Wendy's when she got approached and shot because she wouldn't give up her back pack.
College Freshman,1,"TSU literally has a Wendy's and subway for our off-campus dining. They have a couple of places that deliver like Roma's or Express , but, you'll eventually go broke trying to eat. If you go to Vanderbilt University's area they have a lot more options and restaurants that satisfy all needs."
Recent Alumnus,1,There are not any healthy choices like there are in the Caucasian neighborhoods and cost are expensive.
College Junior,1,the office has rude service and it is difficult to get a meeting before a set deadline
College Sophomore,1,This is one of the worst parts of Tennessee State. Administration often leaves people confused and have to duplicate everything that has been once processed.
College Freshman,1,The strictness is very extreme at my school. Sometimes I feel like we cannot do anything. The fairest rule we have is no curfew in the dorms.
College Freshman,1,They sell drugs out the dorm. There's always people getting jumped.
College Freshman,1,THE FOOD IS HORRIFIC AND IS NOT PLANNED TO ACCOMMODATE A HEALTHY MEALPLAN
College Sophomore,1,"The computer labs are always packed and the computers run the older Windows xp operating system and tend to be mind-numbingly slow. Printing on campus is easy and accessible, when the printers work and have paper, and the charge is included in tuition. The network is absolutely atrocious, professors are constantly extending deadlines for online assignments due to the network being down or extremely slow. Wifi blankets the immediate campus, but speeds are abysmal in certain buildings. A laptop and printer are an absolute must if you plan on getting your work done on time."
College Sophomore,1,I really regret choosing an HBCU. In my opinion they are OVERRATED!!!
College Sophomore,1,there isn't really any campus transportation. only buses that take you to and from the campus apartments
College Sophomore,1,"The process of getting into my major was simple but the counselors made it difficult when it wasn't. I had to register for my classes which the counselor guided me with the wrong classes. I paid for classes I didn't need to take. Then the classes I did need they weren't putting them down for me. The process at Tennessee State University is horrible I would not wish that much stress on my worse enemy. The only reason why I did not give them a F was because only two guidance counselors really helped and guided me like they were supposed, these did their job. If it wasn't for them I would probably still be paying for classes that I don't need. The most important part of admission is to stay on top of everything your hours, grades, and them. My tips for admission is to make sure you are accepted, then get on top of them immediately."
College Senior,1,"The police make sure that they do their job, but they are not doing daily searches for drugs or alcohol.  If you are going to drink or do drugs just make sure that you are not obvious about it.  TSU Police have a TSU Alert system you can sign up for to notify you when there is an incident on or around campus."
College Senior,1,"Parking is a nightmare, especially at the Avon Williams downtown location you have to circle the parking lot at leat two or three times and still do not find a park."
College Senior,1,"I hardly ever see an officer except at the gate in the mornings. The few times ive needed help, the responses are lazy and unconcerne. I once locked my keys in my car late at night and no one would come to help me, the officer just gave me a locksmiths number but wouldnt come wait with me."
College Senior,1,"My school is in a very poor, ethnic neighborhood. There are very few restaurants in the area; none that are geared for students. The options on campus are all fast food franchises, with few healthy choices."
College Junior,1,"I chose to give the strictness of the campus a D, because I feel like I don't have any freedom on campus. There are police everywhere, which makes the environment uncomfortable at times. Also, the surrounding area is a little harsh and lets in bad characters that don't live on campus. I feel that since we are in college, there should be more freedom given to us, instead of making the students feel as if they're being locked inside a cage all day and night."
College Junior,1,It is definitely an HBCU. The guys there often make females feel uncomfortable. The girls dress as if they are going out a night club and are very inappropriate and disrespectful. They are very stand-offish and are clear on who they do or do not want to interact with.
College Senior,1,"Parking at the Avon Williams building is a nightmare, you have to leave as soon as you get off work to get a good parking space. I don't go on main campus or any parties that may happen, but I do attend TSU Homecoming Parade."
College Freshman,1,Drugs have a negative effect on the Tennessee State University's campus. Everyday students are being constantly peer pressured into participating in drug use. Drug use is one of the reason why most freshmen leave the campus in there first semester because they allowed drugs to lead them in the wrong path causing them to flunk out of classes.
College Freshman,1,"The weather is very unpredictable at times. One minute its sunny and the next its cold, then it maybe snowing. You have to be prepared because sometimes you really don't know what to expect especially around end of February and March."
College Sophomore,1,The girls here mostly seem more interested in looking good than getting an education but I don't know who their trying to impress because there isn't any good looking guys here. There is more girls than guys anyways.
College Freshman,1,The off campus apparments are close to campus. But the apparments are a little small and you have to share with three other people. The.dorms on campus are much better.
College Student,1,"Just like every where else, Tennessee State University has drugs.There are so many drugs being passed around the campus. Being passed from locals that stay around the campus to students selling in buildings. So be aware."
College Junior,1,"I think it is ridiculous to be fined when you first start school and had not gotten permit to park.,  I think parking should be free not taken out of your financial aid.  Lastly, I go on the Avon Campus at night and there is never any parking and it can be dangerous getting out of class late and walking across the street to your car alone."
College Sophomore,1,my tip is to continually call at least every two weeks to find out what is needed. they will not call you and your counselor will not either. I f you are serious about the school then you have to stay on them.
College Student,1,"Disgusting!  The first day in anatomy lab, I opened a drawer and there were food wrappers, handfuls of hair, and paper scraps.  In the lecture hall where I have anatomy lecture, the in-desk plugs for charging your laptop/phone either don't function or are missing.  In their place, are food particles and pieces of paper...no one has cleaned it all semester.  There are also black streaks running down the wall and marker marks on the overhead projection screen.  In my chemistry lecture hall, a fair number of desks are broken and there is an ant problem.  In the restrooms, they have removed all but 1 soap dispenser, which only sometimes has soap in it.  GROSS!"
College Student,1,"Safety, I've heard is getting better and I do see security frequently during the day.  However, it would be nice to see security when I leave class at 8pm!  As far as health...they have taken all but 1 soap dispenser out of the restroom and you will be lucky if that one soap dispenser has soap.  What a way to save money!"
College Student,1,"If you are looking for easy grades and no education, this is the school for you!  This semester in anatomy lab, we didn't dissect anything and only touched a microscope once.  In anatomy lecture, my professor started class 20 minutes late everyday, read straight from the book, and I'm going to have to read 7 chapters over Christmas break to make up for what we didn't cover in class to be prepared for A&P 2.  I have 3 different websites to check for online homework/class updates.  My Chemistry lab professor/ta rush us through experiments because they tell us they ""don't want to be there.""  The professors, seemingly, want to put in as little outside classroom time into preparing for classes.  Everytime you take a class, think about what you are missing out on, what your peers at other institutions will be learning/experiencing, and then think about how that difference will impact your future career opportunities."
College Student,1,"The Greeks are a big deal at TSU, but they do not do anything to help freshman. Greeks think they are too good to do anything."
College Student,1,"Campus Life – The dorms at Tennessee State Univerity are HORRIBLE, especially the freshman female dorm, Mary Wilson Hall. It is infested with mold and mice. It has been reported to the president, and there are no changes being made. Students shouldn't have to wake up every morning to take a cold shower. Tennessee State University needs to rebuild all the dorms. They are old and unsafe."

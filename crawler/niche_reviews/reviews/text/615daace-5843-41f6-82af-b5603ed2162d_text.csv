Freshman,5,"I always had my question answered immediately, and I never had technical issues. The online courses are also really easy to navigate and use."
Sophomore,5,"I’m a rising-sophomore at Oxford College and so far I have LOVED the experience so far. Many people tell me how freshman year could be tough, but with the supportive community here I really felt like I could challenge myself and do the things I’ve always wanted to do. The town is subpar but it’s close enough to Atlanta to go in for good food, shopping, and parties. Everyone is so chill, easygoing, yet talented and smart. The campus is definitely as grand but the buildings are nice, clean, and the dorms overall are definitely very nice. If you want the perfect combination of small liberal arts + big university, Oxford is perfect for you!"
Freshman,5,"Have heard from current students that online learning at Emory has been supportive, and while it's not the ideal situation, the university has been responsible and receptive to their feedback. Not too sure on other details as I am an incoming freshman and haven't had classes yet."
Freshman,5,"I am an incoming freshman. So far, my experience with Emory has been great - like many colleges, they are undecided about the Fall semester learning situation due to COVID-19, but the administration has kept us updated and given us insight into their decision-making processes, which I appreciate."
Junior,5,"After finishing up my second year at Emory University, I could not be more satisfied with my experience so far. Emory is truly a phenomenal school with great professors, staff, and students. My professors have been amazing mentors to me and some even knew me by name before I got to campus on the first day. Professors truly want to see you succeed, and they strongly encourage students to talk to them outside of class. The student body is full of a diverse group of very intelligent students. Both campuses (Oxford and Emory campuses) are very beautiful, and I love walking around outside just taking in the nice weather. When applying for college over two years  ago I was really unsure about going to the South, but Atlanta has become my new home, and I truly could not imagine a school that would be a better fit for me!"
Junior,5,"Although online learning is definitely not ideal, my professors made sure that we were all accommodated and definitely modified their classes to make them easier for remote learning. Many of my professors scheduled calls with their students just to check up and say ""hi,"" which really went to show how much they care about the well-being of their students. I really appreciated my professors effort to help us out during the COVID-19 pandemic."
Freshman,5,"The school is amazing, location, academics, and research is amazing. Would definitely recommend to anyone into visiting and look into applying"
Freshman,5,Emory is a phenomenal program. They have so much resources and are very organized when it comes to the online portal Canvas we used. I love how lectures can even be recorded live. Emory is a great institution and provide great education to students and faculty
Freshman,5,"I'm finishing up my first year at Oxford College of Emory University, and I've loved it! There's a strong sense of community that I've never felt anywhere else, and all the people are really nice. The student body is incredibly smart, while also being down-to-earth, laidback, and cooperative rather than competitive. The education I receive is second to none, and my professors have been extremely insightful, personable, and accommodating.  The campus itself is beautiful, with the tree-filled quad, the nature trail, and the new student center. The main drawback is the food, as, even though the quality is great, there are only really 2 food options on campus and they get repetitive fast. UberEats and DoorDash are lifesavers. Oxford College of Emory University has become my new home, and I can't wait to go back next year."
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy being here. The academics and teachers are amazing. The school spirt is kinda low due to not having a football team but they try to make up for it. Greek life is great with options for everyone. And there are a lot of clubs on campus for any interests
Niche User,5,I loved the sense of community I felt. The people were so warm and welcoming and wanted you to enjoy the atmosphere and campus as much as they do.
Graduate Student,5,Emory University is a high class university that allows for me to learn and grow in an enriching environment. I know at Emory that I will be challenged in my major and learn from the best mentors and professors. Everyone at Emory's goal is to see there students succeed in a a diverse environment.
Niche User,5,"Visiting was an amazing experience, and hopefully i can go back very soon and this time not jut to visit."
Niche User,5,"I went to Emory because a College tour, and I love the experience and the people that was there. I love the campus and the dorms, the person who was giving us the tour was very friendly and we talk about how is it be a latina girl in that University and she told me that it was great."
Senior,5,"A tight-knit community, small and beautiful campus, beautiful warm weather, fun on-campus recreational activities during Wonderful Wednesday or Dooley After Dark, and most importantly great people"
Freshman,5,"Attending Oxford College of Emory University has been a pretty good experience so far. If you are looking for a liberal arts campus that's small then you'll be a great fit. It's definitely a unique school and not for everyone. But if you like what it has to offer you will not be disappointed. I'm glad to have gone to the Oxford campus for my first two years and would not change it. The only disappointment is that Oxford, GA is not really a college town. Some professors are great, some are mediocre. Also, don't think that Oxford is lesser than the Atlanta campus. Make the most of your time because there is truly no other place like it."
Freshman,5,"I'm a freshman of Oxford College of Emory University and I have to say my transition into college was great. Emory has a safe environment where one can make valuable friends through just roommates, study groups, clubs or even in the dining hall. The professors are wonderful and passionate about teaching. They want to see you excel. Emory also has a beautiful campus! If your looking for somewhere small to start off your college experience go to Oxford College which is also a liberal arts college or if you want something big go to Emory College  Arts & Science."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Emory can be summarized by three words: Totally worth it. Every dollar spent from applying to enrolling to attending was worth the experience I got at Emory. The professors are incredible people, the student body is diverse and welcoming, and most importantly, they feed you well."
Senior,5,"Coming from an international high school, I was amazed at the diversity of the student body at this program. My peers were academically gifted, artistically talented, and athletically skilled. It is the culmination of these experiences that will make you love Emory. The experiences I shared with fellow students and the Emory faculty have propelled me as well as some other seniors to apply early decision to Emory! I remain in contact with my professor and the friends."
Niche User,5,"It's very nice, If you've ever been to a private school it seems like a continuation of that. I think that if you value the overall school experience over the typical college party scene, this is the place for you. It's very nice, If you've ever been to a private school it seems like a continuation of that.

It's very nice, If you've ever been to a private school it seems like a continuation of that. I think that if you value the overall school experience over the typical college party scene, this is the place for you."
Niche User,5,"amazing campus! I loved the chemistry department and that made me fall in love with this school. Moreover, the tour guides were extremely intricate in explaining the information. The new student center had amazing food and really nice workers."
Sophomore,5,"Emory is a wonderful campus with an amazing scenery. A new student center was just constructed, and it has so many cool places to study and relax. Everyone is super kind and open to meeting new people. There are tons of events for students to de-stress, relax, have fun, and experience new things. The dining hall has great food, and all kinds of food for everyone (vegan and vegetarian stations)."
Niche User,5,"My close friend of mine Nathaniel Smith told about this wonderful but yet competitive university, one of the top prestigious colleges among the Private Christian universities."
Junior,5,Emory University Nell Hodgson Woodruff Nursing School is an excellent school with rich resources for students. Teachers are very enthusiastic and experienced. The school is more impressive than I expected before I officially entered the school.
Sophomore,5,"I'm currently a sophomore at Oxford College. During my freshman year, I was very easily able to get involved on campus, and since the first day, I found it incredibly easy to make friends! That's one of the nice aspects of the small campus. My professors so far have all been so passionate, caring, and overall great. I think the dining hall is pretty good, and the dorm that I live in is really nice. As for the social/party scene, it depends on what you choose to involve yourself in; if there's a will, there's a way, so I've personally had a ton of fun during my time here."
Junior,5,"If you're looking for a university & institution that deeply cares and supports their students, Emory is the best school for you. Every professor I've had is passionate about their work and wants to fully lean into who you are, what you have to offer, and who you aspire to be. The students are hard-working, dedicated, and inclusive. Everyone on campus is empowered by social justice, while still being open-minded. It is one of the most diverse universities, with a large percentage being international students. The campus is breathtaking, the dorms feel like hotels, and the student organizations are plentiful. It is easy to fall in love with Emory and make it your home."
Graduate Student,5,emory university offered me all of the graduate studies that I could ask for! I am so happy that I chose to go to graduate school here. Atlanta is an amazing town to live in as well!
Sophomore,5,"Emory University is an excellent choice, because it offers a diverse community filled with hard-working, motivating, and hospitable students. Emory prioritizes student life, as a student best succeeds when they are most comfortable. The number of offices related to health, diversity, academics, and athletics are endless. A student can find what they need on Emory's campus. Additionally, Emory emphasizes the fact that we do not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment. Emory maintains an open and loving community where students can excel under the guidance of world-class professors and administration. Lastly, parents/family members should be less concerned when sending their loved ones to a school like Emory. Our campus is surrounded by Emory Hospitals, Emory Police, and other local safety resources. The crime rate within campus tends to be non-existent. I don't know what more a student can ask for. Emory seems to have it all."
Sophomore,5,"I loved Emory, my first year was amazing there were such a diverse group of people everywhere and everyone was super kind and friendly unlike most prestigious schools in the country and there were always different things to try and clubs to join"
Sophomore,5,"Incredible faculty, students, and campus. There's huge international student population and caring faculty. Gorgeous place to live, dorms are excellent (maybe not Dobbs or Complex, but even then they aren't too shabby)
Atlanta has a lot to offer"
Sophomore,5,"I'm currently a sophomore at Oxford College. Overall, the university is amazing. However, if you are looking for the stereotypical, television college experience then Emory University is not your place. You would do better at your local state institution. However, if you are looking to surround yourself with some of the world's greatest intellectuals, and some who are lacking, then Emory is your place. Beautiful Campus, amazing professors and staff,  and amazing students. Part scene here is below average. Honestly, just like anywhere, you get whatever you put in. If your seek then you shall find."
Niche User,5,Just excellent I have heard nothing but good things about Emory and I personally feel that you are prepared for the real world.
Freshman,5,"No matter where in the country or world you come from, you will probably love it here. It by no means is easy. Classes require constant attention, but it's up to how much you want to put into it. One thing I didn't really know before coming to Emory was that Greek life is huge. It's not the end of the world if you don't join a frat/sorority but a large chunk of people do, so during the spring semester, sometimes night life will be a little lacking because srats have closed events. One thing that irks me about Emory is that they talk a lot, but rarely follow through with action. I can't tell you the number of statements I've received over email. Rarely do I ever see changes. Emory pretends to care about a lot of big issues, for example, student's mental health. Anytime you mention anything about MH, they're like HAVE YOU HEARD OF CAPS? I have, and I used up my 7 FREE sessions in my first semester, after waiting A MONTH to see someone for an initial assessment. Do better, Emory."
Graduate Student,5,"Emory University delivers excellent academics combined with rich cultural diversity. Emory is dedicated to the innovation and advancement of the medical community. With several hospitals/clinics located directly on campus, there are great opportunities to make career connections, develop, and grow as a healthcare professional. Emory university is definitely one of the top tier universities in the country for students choosing to pursue a career in any of the healthcare fields (nursing, NP, PA, or MD)."
Works Here,5,I love Emory. It really lives up to its name. Emory is known to give students the education they need to get them to grad school or to the next step in their furthered journey. I fully believe it sets students up for success. There is a reason it is so well known.
Niche User,5,I really love how everyone at Emory is happy to be there and has a passion for whatever they are studying!
Sophomore,5,Emory University has changed my life. It is the place where I found the people who I love and the field that I want to do for the rest of my life. The classes are wonderful and full of people who really care about you and your career. The campus is absolutely breathtaking and offers so many opportunities to get involved and really make a difference. I love it at Emory and I wouldn't trade it for the world.
Niche User,5,I like the closeness to Atlanta's business hub. It makes opportunity seem very plausible and the chance to get out into the real world. Many of the professors are very qualified for the particular subject they teach.
Graduate Student,5,"Emory is a superb academic institution. From high-class research, to excellent athletics, from high diversity to excellent academics, Emory has it all. The campus is always buzzing with activity and competition. It is highly recommended for a variety of disciplines from medicine, nursing, law to business school."
Alum,5,"I loved and enjoyed my experience as a student of Emory University. While there were some challenges, I had numerous resources available allowing me to successfully complete my program and earn my degree,"
Niche User,5,I plan to go there I have not physically attended the schools but it seems like a prestigious school. I'm excited to attend.
Freshman,5,"Emory is great. At emory, you get the oppurtunity to change yourselves, to be a better person, better student, better friend. The professors are wonderful and always be there when the students need them. I love every moment in emory. Every day I leave home and know that I get to learn a new thing in emory. And the food here is great too!"
Sophomore,5,As a sophomore at Emory I can say I am proud to be a student at such an elite institution. I am more than satisfied with the school's challenging academics yet friendly environment.
Alum,5,Amazing professors. The school of nursing provides excellent clinical experiences for students. The food on campus is delicious and caters to many specialized diets.
Sophomore,5,"I didn't visit the campus until move-in day, but the first day felt like home. I love the conversations I can have with anyone. Emory is an elite school, but it is not competitive; everyone is willing to help each other grow. I cannot imagine myself anywhere else."
Senior,5,"If I could go back to undergrad and decide again where to go to college, I would absolutely choose Emory again. I was very fortunate to learn from great professors who clearly were very interested both in the subjects they taught as well as their students."
Senior,5,Emory offers a challenging environment to help students learn and grow. There are many fun and interesting classes to take such as a theater class with Mr. Adam Fristoe from vampire diaries! Being in such a fun city as Atlanta also offers a fun environment.
Sophomore,5,Emory University has great professors and the school itself is amazing. Two things that Emory could definitely work on would be teaching students how to use the shuttles and providing better food to the students.
Sophomore,5,"I am so gracious to have the opportunity to attend Emory University. With the amazing faculty and staff, research opportunities, and course variety, I have been throughly pleased with my choice to attend. Emory is a great balance between being a research institution and providing a liberal arts education. If you want a primarily liberal arts education, this is not the place to be. I do think that you can make a schedule that explores education and fulfills your general education requirements."
Freshman,5,"Such a great community on campus including students, professors and the other staff around campus. Wouldn't want to spend my four years any where else."
Senior,5,"Because of the campus, people, and opportunities, Emory is truly an incredible university! The campus is definitely one of the most beautiful and safest campuses I have seen. New buildings are constantly being built and old buildings are being remolded. The people are truly the heart of the institution. Students and faculty provide a welcoming and intellectually stimulating environment."
Alum,5,"Emory University provides excellent academics to its diverse student body. Being part of Emory, it is both competitive and rewarding. It provides great resources and benefits to all its students, faculty, and staff members."
Niche User,5,I did like that it was close to my home and the school was very close as well as i felt that the teachers were connected to me more than other collages with up to 200 students in one class.
Niche User,5,"It is a great experience for four years. I enjoyed my classes, the campus, and the people that I came in contact with. I can't wait to experience the rest of my college years!"
Graduate Student,5,"I visited multiple universities during interviews for the Physician Assistant program. Emory University was hands down the most impressive program I visited. The facilities are top-notch, but honestly it was the faculty and staff that sold me. I could tell that they genuinely cared about selecting the best overall ""person"" for their program. What I mean by this, is that may places I visited only saw me as numbers and figures of GPA's and test scores, they didn't really look past that. Emory wanted to really get to know what type of a human being I was, and asked questions that indicated what type of character I possessed."
Senior,5,"Overall, my experience at Emory University has been a positive one. The academic rigor exceeded my expectations. Emory has Atlanta for a background neighborhood. I have had incredible conversations with people across the world. As a university, it is one of the best in the US."
Senior,5,Love the area and professors are very knowledgeable in their fields. Academically challenging but great choice for school!
Niche User,5,"Its one of the best schools to go to. I want to go here because of the BSN program they have but, my cousin goes there ."
Niche User,5,"Beautiful campus. Amazingly kind and interesting tour guides. Amazing pre-med opportunities. CDC near campus, and they have their own hospital."
Niche User,5,"A viable alternative to the Ivy League schools that have drifted away from their core educational values.  A rich and inclusive cultural environment where students can grow and thrive.  

You can keep your jaded Northeast colleges that take and refuse to give back.  I'll take Emory and Atlanta; the city too busy to hate."
Freshman,4,I like my school lot but I dont think they are handling covid well because they arent doing anything to keep the students engaged.
Sophomore,4,The professors have so far been very accommodating and understanding about various situations. Online learning is difficult for me to begin with but I honestly think Emory is coping with it as best as they can.
Senior,4,"my spring semester was online. my summer classes are also online. it did make it much easier to do well in classes, but also professors are out to get you and label you as a violator of the honor code even if you did nothing wrong because they just assume everyone’s cheating."
Freshman,4,Professors work with you and are welcoming.  Would definitely recommend to anyone into visiting and look into applying
Senior,4,Excellent school with many resources and research opportunities. I felt supported by the school and have made many great friends.
Freshman,4,"Emory University is a very welcoming university and they truly try their best to make sure you feel like you belong on campus. There are many different organizations to join and so many departments to involve yourself in. The campus is beautiful and mostly each building is renovated/being renovated. Academically, it is a challenging place and this can be seen as the semesters progress and less and less students are roaming around and more can be found staying overnight at the library. While there are ways to receive extra help, it can sometimes be difficult to attend these due to scheduling issues, especially for more ambitious students taking a heavier course load and higher level classes. Most students are definitely interested in STEM, especially natural sciences, pre-med, and business. Less so are interested in the social sciences and even fewer in the liberal arts but you do find some every now and then."
Freshman,4,"Emory is a community of leaders and high-achievers that really know how to hit the books. As a result, conversation is always stimulating and there is always someone willing to help you out whenever you need it. As consequential drawbacks, clubs have small member sizes because everyone is creating their own club, school spirit is lacking because everyone prioritizes academic work, and diversity is not representative of the Atlanta-metro area. The professors are generally amazing and are there because they want to teach and campus is absolutely beautiful."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at Emory, but it was pretty academically challenging and I don't find professors to be very invested in their students' individual success. The campus is beautiful, the technology is always current, and the food is great."
Freshman,4,"I go to Emory Oxford College, I find that the small setting creates a very tight-knit community. However, as it is located in the middle of nowhere, the party scene can be limited. Atlanta city is around 45 minutes away which is not that far away, but you'll need a car or find a friend who has one. The professors there are mostly engaged as classes rarely exceeds 20 students."
Sophomore,4,"Renowned and knowledgeable professors, many resources, great financial aid, but classes are hard. there could be more diversity."
Junior,4,"I am a third year varsity student athlete at Emory University, and I am glad I chose Emory. The campus is great, the academics and athletic programs are amazing as well. However, Emory is not the place to come if you want football and school spirit. This is a highly academic school and whatever you choose to study will be a challenge. Campus life is easy to get involved in, however since it is a small campus, a lot of the activities get old after freshman year. The Atlanta area around campus and night life is great if Emory parties start getting old. Definitely consider what your priorities are before choosing Emory. If challenging academics and quality professors are important, then this is the school for you. However, if football, school spirit, and other aspects of college life are important, then take this all into consideration before committing to Emory! If you are unsure, then I definitely recommend taking a tour of our campus!"
Freshman,4,"I have only been here a semester, but so far I believe it is my place. I attend the Oxford college and though it is quiet, you can still find many things to do. As for parties, where there's a will, there is a way. If athletics and big school feeling is what you're searching for, this is not the school, but if you do enjoy a tight knit sense of community, this is your place."
Junior,4,"Emory is a great school with tons of smart people, and the classes, professors, and facilities are all great. My main issues with Emory are that although the campus has tons of resources, it seems to be lacking things that you'd expect from paying $50,000 a year. First of all, there's not enough majors. If you wanna do biology, you do the biology major. There's no other options or concentrations, no cell bio or molecular bio, so you have to take classes you may not actually care about. Second, the social life and school culture here are almost non existent compared to other schools like GA tech or Harvard. Everyone is antisocial and focusing on their own lives instead of making meaningful interactions. The shuttle rides here are depressing. You don't come to Emory to have fun. I'm not sure why it's this way, but it is. Another thing is that the Wifi here is atrociously inconsistent. It always takes a minute to connect to it, and sometimes it just completely stops working."
Freshman,4,"Oxford College of Emory University is a great place to be. I like the ability to have both a close-knit liberal arts school and large research university experience. There is almost always something going on, and everyone here is committed to being a leader and pursuing their passions. Not to mention, we have shuttles that take us to Emory University in Atlanta for the weekends (if you want, of course). The only downside is that you need to drive/uber anywhere so be aware of that."
Niche User,4,My mom and I would go to Emory Hospital for check-ups and I was always fascinated with the University and Hospital. When I was younger it was my dream school even until now where I am getting ready to apply to college. It’s close to home and has the major I am interested in. Overall great experience visiting Emory University.
Freshman,4,"Great school; lot of good professors.  Student dorms are nice. Food is alright, better than a lot of schools.  Only negatives I experienced were RAs/admin that treat you like children and extremely unhelpful financial aid office."
Alum,4,The course material was rigorous but there were support tools inlace such as tutoring and group study rooms. There were many events and opportunities to get involves. The homecoming concerts were also really entertaining.
Sophomore,4,"While there are programs in place to educate students on resources provided at the school, they are not truly educational nor do they go in depth. Moreover, many insurances are not accepted by Emory Student Health or the Emory healthcare system, which means that if you or your child gets sick or injured, you will either have to travel far off campus (as everything is owned by Emory in the near vicinity) or pay a hefty bill. The academics, however, are extremely renowned but are rigorous. Also, they give out amazing financial aid, which has helped many students (including myself) with the cost of attendance."
Freshman,4,I love Emory because of its diverse student body and challenging academics. The professors are also very helpful and most of them have an open door policy.  Social life is also exciting because of it's location right in the heart of Atlanta.
Alum,4,"Oxford College of Emory University is an incredible, inclusive, intellectual haven! Emory College is full of spoiled rich kids."
Senior,4,I have been a student at Emory University since the fall of 2015 and would not have changed my experience for the world.
Freshman,4,"Emory University is a liberal arts school and therefore encourages an open mind to learn. Being at this school so far has allowed me to take courses that are not geared towards my major, but has educated me in ways I did not expect when entering college. The environment on campus is incredibly accepting of other cultures or religions, and just simply supports inclusivity. I have made friends with a variety of people and joined clubs that I felt were personal to my beliefs. My overall experience with Emory University thus far is very positive, and I look forward to the coming years."
Senior,4,"Emory University happened to fit very well with my personal educational goals, and-while it wasn't a perfect experience-I am still happy with my time here in retrospect."
Junior,4,"Emory is an interesting place that provides a wide array of experiences, mostly positive. It is a prestigious school which people don't really know about and have some very strong programs. However, the school can also be questionable at times as to the little things that really make you think why this is a top 20(21) school in the country."
Alum,4,Emory was amazing and really provided me with a great college experience. Emory has a lot of great resources and opportunities to branch out into different interests and obtain sound advice for career advancement.
Junior,4,"The education is phenomenal and the students here are very interesting and exciting to be around. The party scene and athletics however, are not good. It is in a great location and is a beautiful area."
Sophomore,4,"Emory University has a beautiful campus full of amazing professors and friendly students. The food options are a bit limited and there is heavy construction going on so the dining hall is a temporary one. It is not a party school but there are parties on weekends and places to go to in nearby Midtown Atlanta. The school is heavily diverse, which I love, and there is always some event to go to either on campus, or through a campus shuttle in the city."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the extensive diversity of the student body and the determination of the faculty to make the students successful. Especially the financial aid is very useful when they can offer $60K+ to allow people to attend their university.
Sophomore,4,"I was delightfully surprised by the diversity at Emory, especially coming from NYC to the South. The campus is gorgeous and the students are very active in many of the activities on campus; I was happy to find a strong student activism scene as well. I'm disappointed by how the student organizations work at the school, though, as most clubs don't have regularly scheduled meetings. It's difficult to find a community in the beginning of the year because of this, but as the year goes on, it becomes easier to befriend others, especially the ones in the residence halls."
Junior,4,"Emory has been a fun and challenging school to attend. I have learned a lot from my professors and have made meaningful relationships with my faculty. The campus administration works hard to create an educational environment that suits all students. The campus life is great for a DIII school. There are SO MANY student organizations and clubs to join, and Greek Life is vibrant on campus. Almost every student is involved in 2-3 activities. Overall, Emory has been a wonderful school where I have been challenged academically and socially, and have had fun along the way."
Niche User,4,"A great school with lots of faculty support, student resources, and friendly staff! This is the place to be if you value healthy, long-lasting friendships and a fair beginning to a new chapter in your life."
Sophomore,4,"I found Emory University to be rigorous in terms of academics. The professors are readily available, supportive, and they encouraged meetings during office hours. I like the fact that there are a lot of student-run organizations. There are also a lot of on-campus events that make weekends and even finals week more enjoyable."
Senior,4,Emory's atmosphere is very welcoming and uplifting. I have never felt unsafe at campus and have always been able to find help or someone to talk to. I'm glad to have chosen to come here and the professors and academic life is definitely worth it.
Alum,4,"During my time at Emory University, I enjoyed the diversity in the student population, relatively small class size with helpful professor office hours, and significant financial aid coverage throughout my four years. A major drawback at this institution was that some professors were unable to clearly explain concepts in upper level chemistry courses."
Graduate Student,4,"Very accessible professors with a lot of research opportunities, especially for those interested in medicine and public health. Atlanta is a great place to live and to learn with a lot of local history and close access to nature"
Sophomore,4,"I've found that Emory has a lot of great resources to offer in terms of classes as well as business connections, but I was underwhelmed by it diversity and culture. Though it strives to be inclusive, I have often found myself disillusioned by the lack of variety of different types of people I meet."
Freshman,4,"Emory University is a great place if you are looking for community, no matter your background. Everyone is welcome here. There is a club for anything you might be interested in. Most of all, the surrounding area is loaded with numerous activities and opportunities for students when exploring off campus."
Freshman,4,"Emory is a very large campus with some very good aspects to it (professor availability, student involvement, etc), but it also has some drawbacks. You can definitely feel the ""Ivy-wannabe"" vibe from a lot of the students here, and there aren't a lot of opportunities to actually do research. The vast majority of research is conducted by graduate students and some professors, which is understandable, but they don't really give any opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in research other than being a research participant."
Graduate Student,4,Emory University is a well-renown college with high rate academic excellence and leading healthcare initiatives. I would like to see more diversity initiatives.
Niche User,4,"It has a very nice campus, and does not seem like it is located the middle of Atlanta. Emory offers many opportunities to its students and believes in putting the students first."
Freshman,4,"The main complaint I hear around campus is that the food just isn't good. OF course there are alternative dining options to the main hall, but if you have to use your meal swipes, you're kind of stuck. 
Professors are hit or miss in that a good one is really really good and a bad one...yikes. Most students here are pre-med and struggle through many large and sometimes not at well taught classes in chemistry and math. Outside of the great resources for pre med students in the area, I don't think the actual education they get is all that different from one you could get at a much more affordable state school. 
If you're like me and you stick to smaller programs like psychology and creative writing, the professors tend to be much better."
Alum,4,"I attended Emory University from Fall 2013 to Spring 2017. My major was Neuroscience & Behavioral Biology, and I was very involved on and off campus during my time there in various extracurricular activities and student organizations. The school is great and filled with students who are pursuing graduate school degrees, whether that be in medicine or law, and the business school also has great connections and job placements after graduation.

My experience at Emory was very positive; the academic environment is challenging, but fair, and you always feel like you have the resources to do well. The one aspect of Emory that I would like to see improved is the student body and school spirit. There are great benefits of interracial dialogue and activism on campus, but students can tend to form groups and 'bubbles' on campus because of this as well. It doesn't help that Emory doesn't have a football team or prominent sports team either, but overall, Emory was a great academic experience."
Freshman,4,"The academics are very good, all the professors I've had have been easy to understand, communicate with, and incredibly insightful. The food is definitely below par, but the campus overall is good."
Freshman,4,"Oxford College of Emory University has professors that are engaging and compassionate. However, Oxford College is very small and secluded. There are not a lot of activities at or around Oxford, so it can be pretty mundane and lonely. Moving to the main campus in Atlanta will be very refreshing to have more access to restaurants, people, activities, etc."
Junior,4,"I like the professors at Emory because I feel that they are dedicated to ensuring that the students learn the materials versus a bigger state school where there is not as much focus on every student. I also like the campus when it isn't under so much construction, and I think having access to Atlanta is a bonus. I think the campus food could be improved, as well as some of the older dorms."
Freshman,4,"Being in Emory University, I've enjoyed the close  yet large community this school has to offer. As it is a medium sized school, there is the closeness you can have within a community but also enough space to choose what type of community you want to place yourself in."
Freshman,4,"I'm on the Oxford campus right now, and while it is very small, it is beautiful. The academics are rigorous. I feel very safe and comfortable. The dining options are mediocre, as Oxford is rather isolated, but this isn't such a problem at the main campus. However, Emory is not the place to be if your parents make a lot of money but won't help you pay for college; I'm in a financial rut, and I know others who are also going to have trouble affording Emory in the coming years."
Alum,4,"Emory has a wonderful learning environment, perfect for students who want to study and go on to better opportunities. The Atlanta area has many companies that come frequently to find talent, so there are few reasons for not making use of Emory's reputation and location. The professors are wonderful, and the curriculum adequately prepares you for success, no matter where you end up."
Freshman,4,"Emory is great in academics and resources. There is so much to explore and experience, so many different people with different backgrounds, and great support for classes. The academics are the best part of Emory. The campus is beautiful but the culture is suitable for certain types of people. However, the fact that Atlanta is so close makes it easy to get off campus and see a completely different culture. The campus is safe and comfortable. The only thing that takes away from Emory really is the crazy tuition."
Sophomore,4,"Emory is definitely a place that encourages academic excellence and engagement. Students often are involved with several clubs, organizations, or other community activities, which makes it seem so that everyone is constantly busy changing the world. Unfortunately, because it is a smaller school located in a fairly suburban area, you can often feel disconnected from the larger Atlanta community. Overall, Emory is a great place to live and learn."
Freshman,4,"Overall a great university. However, the party scene and food could be better. I went to Oxford which is the Liberal Arts school of Emory and loved it. The people here absolutely create a great tightly bound community."
Junior,4,Emory has an amazing atmosphere and a huge supportive campus. It is a place that truly cares for its students.
Sophomore,4,"Emory is known as the Ivy league of the South and it definietly lives up to the name! It is a very good (yet expesnive school), but offers many oppurtunities, much financial aid, and is very diverse. The food is not that great, and can be a bit isolating if you are a minority, but other than that it is a very good school!"
Niche User,4,Emory University is a beautiful school in Atlanta Georgia that has a Southern yet modern and innovative feel. The people on campus are extremely friendly.
Freshman,4,"Overall Emory has been a fantastic school in every way: academics are excellent, campus is breathtaking, professors are friendly and want to get to know students, etc. The atmosphere is very competitive which, for the most part, is beneficial and encourages students to work their hardest. However, this competitive atmosphere also produces extreme amounts of stress for students, making testing weeks somewhat miserable. However, Emory's stellar reputation along with its Atlanta location makes it one spectacular university."
Niche User,4,"I visited Emory University last summer and fell in love. Although the campus isn't huge, it feels homey and cozy. The small class size, I would think, is wonderful because you get to interact with the professors easier."
Sophomore,4,Emory is such a great place to meet new people. Professors are amazing and really care about their students. The campus is also really nice and they're are a lot of study spots.
Freshman,4,"Emory is a great school, however, the athletics scene is horrible since we do not have a intercollegiate football team. The dinning options are mediocre, it is very obvious you are not eating a home cooked meal and is comparable to the food I was served at my public high-school. The professors are great and are really there to help you, everyone is aiming for your success. Fortunately, Emory does not have that cut throat, aggressive academic environment that is typical of most top schools. Emory has one of the most beautiful campuses I've ever seen, but we are secluded from a lot of the city life. The campus is super safe, but you can get stuck in the ""Emory Bubble""and not explore much off campus, however, there are shuttles that take you to different parts around town. Overall, Emory is an excellent institution and is worth your dollar. "
Freshman,4,"Average, many students are either here on ED 1 or 2, or as a last choice/couldn't get into or couldn't afford their top choice universities. A surprising amount of the student body regularly talks about how much they dislike Emory and how they feel that they don't belong here. There are some great professors, but also some incredibly incompetent ones, as is expected from any university. Definite lack of an ""intellectual vibe,"" which could be perceived as a positive or negative thing. Food is abysmal (I know multiple people who have gotten food poisoning from the DUC), and many workers are rude."
Sophomore,4,"It could be a lot better. The tuition seems way overpriced with prices hitches every year. Financial aid hardly keeps up. Merit Scholarships are mainly intended for those in the know. Most applicants do not know that they were disqualified from receiving Merit Scholarships because they did not apply by Nov 15. Profs are alright, but there are a few oddballs who go out of their way to be incompetent."
Sophomore,2,"Professors do try their best to help the students out, are pretty flexible. Obviously lots of cheating by the Emory students, but that's to be expected from a school like Emory"
Sophomore,2,"I am transferring from Emory University. The great parts about the school are that it has a lot of diversity which creates an awesome learning environment, and Atlanta is a cool city to live in. However, Emory is not actually in Atlanta proper which is a huge let down because you have to take a ~20 minute uber to get anywhere cool. The dorms are big for freshman, but you are not guaranteed housing all four years and sophomore housing is much worse. The campus is beautiful except that for all of my freshman year it was under construction. The party scene revolves around greek life or going to Mags, so if you're not into that you don't have many other options until you have your own home to host things at. The academics are heavily centered around pre-professionalism so if you want to do anything other than that prepare to feel vaguely marginalized. Other people have had a great time here, just not for me."
Sophomore,2,"The professors and education at this school are great, but as for everything else... its pretty terrible.
There is no school spirit on this campus. Initially, I thought this wouldn't be an issue because I wasn't looking for a party school, and I really have no interest in going out to parties. However, without a sports team, and a central hangout spot on campus, there is no sense of unity between the students. Any sort of social life is centered around Greek life because that's the only thing there is.

The food on campus is absolutely terrible. Have you heard about the health inspections done on the dining halls and cafes on campus? Yeah, they failed health inspections. Also, the chicken is always severely undercooked; its always pink.

There's always construction on campus which makes it hard to get around and enjoy the campus without noise."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I majored in Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology and my degree means diddly squat. I cannot get any jobs with this degree. I have to get a masters in Neuroscience to get a decent 6 figure job. After I graduated, I had to settle for a job as a medical scribe, but I am going back to school to get my Masters in Global Public Health."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Do not go to Oxford first, its basically not a part of Emory. For the most part the teachers are not as thorough in teaching material as on main campus, there is zero social life (you are in a low income neighborhood in the middle of nowhere Georgia), and teachers assign absurd amounts of busy work (I had less work in 400 level courses at Emory than here). In addition the classes are significantly harder for no reason. I signed up for calc 1 at oxford and had to drop it, luckily still during add/drop period. When I proceeded to the main campus I signed up for cal 1 again and received an A in the course. I then took calc 2 the following semester and received an A. Oxford is significantly harder and your GPA will be lower than the main campus students, which can hurt after college job options.

As an econ major at Emory there are a couple amazing teachers but for the most part the teachers are sub-par, whether it be due to poor teaching style or just clearly not caring caring about students (I had a teacher who refused to meet with students who couldnt come to her office hours because they were in class during them). 

Social experience is repetitive, all about Greek life (I was in Greek life too and I got tired of it). Feels like 70% of people you meet are from long island. 

If I had not received good opportunities upon graduation I would be very disappointed by experience. Now work with people who went to ivies and had to overcome steep learning curve between our difference in knowledge, but at least Emory got me through the door."
Recent Alumnus,2,On campus parties are lame. Better to go off-campus.
College Sophomore,2,It's somewhat annoying that financial aid amounts are not as large as they should be
College Freshman,2,No matter what they say it's not guaranteed that 100% of your need will be met. If the original package they offer isn't enough you have to go to the office a thousand times before they finally find another loan for you.
College Freshman,2,Not enough fun parties around here.
College Senior,2,I honestly feel like no one cares about any sports here.
College Sophomore,2,There needs to be a football team.
College Sophomore,2,Haven't received much financial aid whatsoever.
College Sophomore,2,Not very active at all as far as parties.
College Freshman,2,I did not receive any financial aid from the school and I need some
College Junior,2,"Not having a football team limits our school spirit. But we have basketball, baseball, etc."
Recent Alumnus,2,I do not eat in the dining hall.......bad.
College Sophomore,2,They do not give you enough aid.
College Sophomore,2,I don't like the food here.
College Sophomore,2,"The policies that this school have bordered on the outrageous at times, where oftentimes even the slightest amounts of noise can get you in trouble."
College Sophomore,2,"The biggest complaints most people have towards the internet is how slow it can become and how frequently it drops. This kind of stuff should not be happening at a major university, especially one of this magnitude."
College Sophomore,2,Parking passes themselves are expensive and beyond that it's difficult to even find a parking spot near where you want to go.
College Senior,2,"Transportation on campus is awesome but to go anywhere, you might as well be stuck on a desert. parking is 600$ a year and so no one wants to have cars and then you can't go anywhere"
College Freshman,2,"Parking on campus is expensive and not very convenient.  However, you need a car for Atlanta!"
College Freshman,2,"Sports aren't very big here. There's no football team, which is one of the biggest sports in colleges. Without that, students don't show much support for the other sports. "
College Freshman,2,Emory Wireless shuts down during registration because too many people are online. this makes registration a pain. 
College Freshman,2,I honestly think that Emory could be so much better. 
College Freshman,2,"It's pretty limited. If you don't have money for a cab, you're out of luck. "
College Freshman,2,"You will find a large portion of the student body to be white or Asian, and Christians or Jews. If you are not in these categories it is very hard to feel at home or welcome."
College Freshman,2,"The weather always changes, you never know what to expect."
College Sophomore,2,Most people at least smoke weed.  You can smell it in the dorms if you just walk around.  Seems like weed is very accessible.  
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot of school spirit. 
College Freshman,2,"There isn't a football team, the basketball team is mediocre, the soccer team is great volleyball is great, but they don't recruit players. "
College Sophomore,2,"Emory Advantage is a huge joke. I don’t know about the Loan Replacement program, but the Loan Cap program is a sham. This program caps it at $15000 of Subsidized Stafford Loan, not unsubsidized Stafford loans or private loans that you will also have to get to pay the cost. They also limit the amount of subsidized loans you can receive a year, so you basically won’t hit the 15k cap until senior year. The grants are pretty good, but do not expect to leave Emory only $15000 in debt. More like $40000"
College Sophomore,2,"I have had to fight for the correct financial aid both years so far. They sometimes change it if people call and say they do so much for the school, but some still don't get enough. It's a $60,000 school, and some can pay four times that amount, and others can't pay a dime. Overall, the financial aid department will listen to appeals and carefully analyze them."
College Sophomore,2,"Freshmen cannot have cars on campus. Second years and up can park, but the prices are outrageous."
College Sophomore,2,Any one with a fake ID is allowed to buy alcohol. Alcohol is allowed in upper classmen dorms and housing. And often times upper classmen offer drinks to students who are underage.
College Sophomore,2,"There are people of many different races, but they don't make up that much of the student body. The campus is predominately caucasian and asian pacific islander."
College Freshman,2,"The DUC is kinda bad, lost 25 lbs (6'2 185-->160lbs) my first semester (not even the full year mind you) because the lines are too long, food isn't good (I'm picky but not THAT picky), or its inconvenient (HAVE to eat at the cafeteria, can't take it back)
COX = good, good food, able to take back, etc. 

If you get the chance definitely buy swipes and not unlimited swipes instead."
College Sophomore,2,"I feel pretty safe on Emory's campus, but over the course of the last month I have heard about two 'reported' rapes and apparently one was a date rape. The fact that I could potentially go to school with a rapist frightens me. Also my bike and about 10 other people's bikes were stolen about 2 months ago. There were no cameras where my bike was locked. Also there were hardly any street lights where I locked my bike, and I would have to squint to put the key in the lock. Finally, the escort system at Emory is unacceptable. It often takes 30 minutes for a bus to come and there should be a bus at least every 5 minutes. I often just end up walking to my destination to save time. And the bus drivers aren't well mannered at all. You can tell they don't like their job."
College Sophomore,2,I received many scholarships but they were absorbed into my financial aid and I ended up not receiving any of the money. Very frustrating
College Sophomore,2,"When you're a freshman, everything is super fun. Frat row, clubs, other colleges, etc. However, I feel that upperclassmen have been through it all already. Frat row becomes kind of dull if you're not in greek life"
College Junior,2,"There is limited parking provided. For a school that as so many students I would expect them to invest in that. If parking is not available  in the parking deck behind the school, then you'd have to pay an expensive fee to park at areas like Egleston Children's Hospital."
College Junior,2,"I do not think that the campus is too strict about drinking. Even though they know hazing and other frat parties go on, they don't seem to do much about it."
College Senior,2,"Typical but Frustrating – You must be diligent in following up about your financial aid and the required documentation. I have had issues with my financial aid almost every semester and I have had to call the Finanical Aid Office and speak to several different people before the issues were resolved. The process is frustrating, but financial aid at any college/university is not any better."
College Junior,2,"SO EXPENSIVE – you can not have a car until your sophomore year. When you do bring a car you are assigned a certain parking deck, and only one of them is to convenient, and only seniors get that deck. Additionally it costs $660 a year for a parking pass!"
College Freshman,2,Parking and price of a parking spot is ridiculous.
College Freshman,2,"Dining Is Eh. The workers hate their jobs at the Dobbs Univeristy Center (DUC), which obviously reflects in the food. Food runs out, it never gets replaced, and is extremely repetitive."
College Freshman,2,The Town of Covington (Surrounding Oxford College) – There are two actual restaurants here: LongHorn Steakhouse and Apple-bee's. To get a really good meal you have to drive about 25 minutes up the highway to a town called Conyers. We've even been known to drive as far as 40 minutes to Decatur for a good meal. There are plenty of fast food places around but none are walking distance so having a car is essential.
College Junior,2,"No One Cares – At Emory, the only ones who care at all are those in greek life. the rest of the campus either looks down of how them or just uses them for their parties."
College Junior,2,"The dining hall has food that is not cooked properly and the selection has no variety at all. Places around the school are too far for walking and thus you need a car. Overall, I have trouble finding food that satisfies me."
College Sophomore,2,"While currently Oxford offers enough spaces to satisfy student's needs, they plan on reducing the number in order to expand the quadrangle and science building. Currently, it is very convenient and located close to all the dorms so there is not worrying about safety issues even late at night."
College Junior,2,"What Exactly Is Around? If you want to do something within walking distance of campus, good luck. There are about 6 local shops, although there are a lot more food places. Atlanta itself as some amazing places to visit, but unless you have a car or dare to take the untimely and uncertain public transportation then you really can't take advantage of the city."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a great selection. Either your typical nerd, or hot and arrogant spoiled kids. Few in between."
College Sophomore,2,"School Spirit – The school spirit at emory is decent when involving songfest for the freshman at the beginning of the year, however regarding sports it doesn't seem like many students care."
College Sophomore,2,"Housing Process – The housing process is a lot of hassle, and it's very confusing with who is going to live with whom, pulling people in, housing selection times, etc."
College Sophomore,2,"Nothing Nice Close by – Emory village is a pit, but you'll need to hit that 24-hour CVS, especially freshmen, who can't have cars.  You're pretty fa away from the real Atlanta."
College Sophomore,2,"At Emory University, I would say there is more cultural diversity than race alone. I have to say that the major racial groups would be koreans, jewish caucasions and indian people. Many people at Emory are of the the jewish religion and are economoically wealthy. There seems only a small group of LGBT persons."
College Senior,2,"Dining at Dobbs University Center – First and second year students have dining plans at the Dobbs University Center. There is not a lot of variety in the food and its cleanliness is not at the level that it should be. Those who serve food at DUC have also not treated me in the manner that someone paying $4000 a year for the food deserves. However, the facility where the students eat is top-notch. The service, quality and variety of the food is not."
College Junior,2,Frat Row Policy – Freshmen were not allowed to attend fraternity parties for the entire first semester this year.
College Sophomore,2,"Love It or Hate It – Those who aren't in the Greek system tend to dislike it, as it's a self-contained community that parties with those in it. Those in the system are sometimes obsessed with it, and are disconnected from the other 2/3 of Emory students. Frat parties are terrible if you don't have many friends in the frat."
Sophomore,1,"Extremely overrated and overpriced school. Academics were really easy, student body couldn't care less about school - all anyone focused on was the party scene, which frankly was embarrassing as well. Job placement is weak, but not surprised given the quality of the students that come here. Pretty standard university life with people that simply coast through life. Absolutely not worth the absurd price tag!"
Sophomore,1,For a college that supposedly celebrates diversity I was appalled at how the university sanctioned an instance of bigotry and Claimed cheating on several students who were doing too well in a class!! University needs to do some self reflection
Freshman,1,"Unfortunately, I felt very unwelcome here. As someone who is Jewish I experienced anti-semitism (emory sanctioned) when fliers were taped to our doors telling us to leave our “occupied” rooms. I respect everyone’s views and am not interested in challenging others beliefs. It is horrible to not feel safe at your school."
Senior,1,"Very cliquey for a university that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. The only university I know of where you have to carry around a blue water bottle for people to even know they're an athlete. I transferred from a D1 school where athletes were famous and had to hide. So perhaps I am a little bit biased about the clear pretentiousness of a lot of the Emory students. Same thing with greek life. They are wanna-be greats but have no clue about the reality of the lameness of their chapter relative to what's out there. Most saddening is the way that the school does almost nothing to help you out. My initial estimate for financial aid was $25k. Now, as a senior, I receive HOPE scholarship (about 4K) and that is it. If it weren't too late in the game, I would have transferred out as soon as they cut my financial aid. The worst part is, even after appealing and calling multiple times, they won't hear me out/budge. I will not be sending my kids here, thats for sure."
College Sophomore,1,"REGISTERING TO CLASSES IS IMPOSSIBLE! YOU WILL NEVER EB ABLE TO TAKE A CLASS YOU WANT AND ALWAYS BE STUCK WITH THE CLASSES THAT NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE. EMORY IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY, DONT COME! IT WILL BE THE WORSE MISTAKE OF YOUR LIFE. FORGET GRADUATING IN 4 YEARS, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE"
College Sophomore,1,"I'm at the Oxford campus, and it is not at all what I wanted out of college. The student body, is almost without exception comprised of very nice and intelligent people, but the school itself is awful from the absurd workload and lack of anything to do on or off campus."
College Freshman,1,"There are only a handful of varsity sports teams at Emory and no one pays attention to them. The majority of Emory students graduate having never attended a sporting event. The intramurals are relatively well participated in, especially considering how anti-athletics Emory is. There's no football team which really is sad. The lack of interest in sports makes for a absence of school spirit on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"After being here for 2 years, the administration has taken all the fun out of being in a fraternity, from restricting beer pong, to basically doing anything that would be deemed fun. It is sad to see the social culture of Emory go downhill because of restrictions by the university. The only thing that makes Greek Life worth it is the people, but without the ability to express yourself and do things in your own house, the entire idea of being in a fraternity becomes pointless. Emory Administration get that stick out your a$$"
College Freshman,1,It changes frequently without any warning. 
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking is a pain. The yearly pass is well over 700 at this point, parking in some ""unmarked"" spot is risky, there are boot-ers all over the place and common areas- even local restaurants. Your best bet though is to pay for the parking, or leave your car off campus and use the emory shuttles. "
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking is horrible...you must get there 30-45 minutes early because you have to take a shuttle ariund campus
College Sophomore,1,"I received much less financial aid than expected this year. My expected family contribution increased by $12,000 and my financial aid adviser was hard to get in touch with and extremely unhelpful."
College Senior,1,way too expensive. Should be free considering how much we pay for everything else!
College Freshman,1,"Emory's cuts this year are ridiculous. They've cut majors lots of people were interested in like journalism, educational studies, visual arts, etc... There's so much focus on science and business here. Be careful if you're looking for anything else"
College Freshman,1,Emory students have license do whatever they please.
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is ridiculously expensive on top of the total expense to go to Emory. It is also very limited, so you can end up with a parking space on the Clairmont campus even if you don't live on Clairmont, causing you to have to park and take a shuttle back to main campus."
College Sophomore,1,Why So Expensive – Emory is expensive enough as it is.  Freshman year you cannot even have your car on campus.  Parking is 660 per year and sometimes you cannot even find a parking spot.
College Sophomore,1,WAY overpriced. I feel taken advantage of. When costs are this high it does not seem fair that so many people seem to get away with parking in lots where they are not permitted to do so.
College Sophomore,1,No Football – Absolutely no school spirit because we have no football team.
College Junior,1,"Diplomat Mill – The courses here are a joke. They give everyone an A, regardless of effort."

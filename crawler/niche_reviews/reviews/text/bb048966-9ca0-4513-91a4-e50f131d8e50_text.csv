Sophomore,5,Oklahoma Wesleyan is a fantastic school! The professors are all really nice and personable and they take time to get to know you and they help you if you need it. Dr. Turner is by far my favorite teacher. The campus is lovely as well and all the buildings are very neat and clean.
Graduate Student,5,My overall experience at Oklahoma Wesleyan University was one I will always remember and look back on for the rest of my life. From all of the great friends I have made to all of the things I have learned in and out of the classroom. they have some of the most helpful and selfless professors I have ever seen. Oklahoma Wesleyan has gave me so many opportunities to become a better follower of Christ as well as becoming a better all around individual. I think one thing I would say about Oklahoma Wesleyan is it is a very athletics oriented school in which teams tend to stay with and hang around with one another. I would have liked to seen more activity between the students and the different athletic groups.
Graduate Student,5,My online learning experience at Oklahoma Wesleyan was great. When it comes to online classes there was a lot of class discussion in which we were able to connect with one another and hear different thoughts from others in the class. I was also able to take a economics class in which we used a online program and our first classier professor took us step by step on how the class would work with was really helpful.
Junior,5,Remote classes were easier to learn in for me. Teachers were also available to me 24/7 which was excellent.
Freshman,5,I did not take any online classes therefore I do not know how the online class scene really is. But it’s probably worth more money than being on campus
Niche User,5,I am in the process of applying to nursing school following my retirement from the Army.    I am from Bartlesville but have never attended Oklahoma Wesleyan.  They have been very friendly and helpful with the entire process.
Junior,5,I attended a private high school so OKWU has been a blessing for me. It has given me an excellent education where the staff are very caring and get to know each student individually.
Freshman,5,"Oklahoma Wesleyan University is a great college for young Christians who are unsure of their faith, or just want to grow in their spirit and relationship with God. Everyone is cordial with one another. You can talk to a stranger about anything and they genuinely care about you and your situation. The campus is fairly small, which makes everyone so close. Most teachers find a way to make a hard class like Biochem for and example fun and enjoyable, while also teaching and educating students in a high capacity."
Sophomore,5,"Oklahoma Wesleyan is wonderful! They are committed to making things work for their students, in the best and most efficient way possible. The professors are well-educated and kind, and the student services work hard to ensure that you are taken care of."
Sophomore,5,"My experience has been good at okwu, but i was actually short on money this year because okwu is one of the most expensive schools but it is a great school and i love it and the people and the basketball program, i didn’t receive the Perkins loan this year because it is no longer available to private Christian schools so i had to find a co-signer and get co-signed, and i have all the money i had to him as collateral to do it until i pay it back so i am currently really broke and could use the extra money for books and school stuff, food, etc, i can’t really work much at the moment because i am really busy with school and basketball so i don’t have much time to work, it would be a really big blessing if i was to receive this, thank you for listening!"
Senior,5,Very convenient to complete a 4-year degree online. The professors are very engaging and sincerely care about your success.
Freshman,5,"OKWU is an amazing place to find forever friends and learn about your Christian faith. I myself have learned to grow not only in the classroom as a student but i have learned that you must get out of your comfort zone to get comfortable being on campus and finding out how your classes work. The professor here are extremely friendly and work with students one on one when they are asked, which is a big help to all the collegiate athletes on campus."
Niche User,5,"I went on a tour to oklahoma wesleyan university, the campus looked very nice. The professors introduced themselves, all of them seemed to be pretty nice. Plus there was a lot a diversity on campus, which I seemed to be impressed by."
Alum,5,I went to complete a degree in ministry. The ministry department is awesome. The team working in that department is excellent and made my time there well planned and efficient. I could not have had better professors. I am glad they were the atmosphere I was a part of on the campus.
Niche User,5,"In early October, I went on a campus visit to Oklahoma Wesleyan University. When I got there, the campus is really pretty and I can see myself grow in my faith. They are very Godly over there. I really like how religious they are. I know for a fact that my relationship with the Lord will grow."
Niche User,5,The school is amazing. Everyone there is very welcoming and actually cares about the people who visit. The teachers are very close to the students and really try to help them learn.
College Freshman,5,My overall experience at Oklahoma Wesleyan University is great school is very nice the teachers are helpful. I would go back to the school
College Sophomore,5,Helpful advisors and staff and easy to access online tools.
College Freshman,5,The school is very strict and to my knowledge there have yet to be any assaults.
College Freshman,5,"I love that the school does not contain any relation to the ""Greek Life""."
College Freshman,5,The athletic department includes all students in many ways. For example by having classes in the athletic department it does not seem as exclusive.
College Freshman,5,"Going off to college is a change with new experiences and obstacles. However, the faculty helps all students overcome the challenges at Oklahoma Wesleyan University. The classes can be difficult but you walk out of every class having learned something new."
College Student,5,Its very good to use .
College Sophomore,5,"At Oklahoma Wesleyan University, you can be proud to say you play varsity athletics with 80% of all students on campus playing a varsity sport. In our Mueller Sports Center, athletes of every trade can be found working out together in our fitness center or playing basketball on the varsity court after hours. As of the 2014-2015 school year, the already shining Mueller Sports Center is under construction to update its facilities to be both convenient and complimentary to every single athlete and visitor."
College Freshman,5,A lot of the upperclassman had nice houses off campus
College Freshman,5,"There are no party scenes at OKWU and it makes it the best campus in terms of studying and staying out of trouble with the law. However, the campus is still a lot of fun with a lot of activities"
College Freshman,5,The professors were absolutely amazing!
College Freshman,5,The personal safety is very safe. Teachers and students look out for each other and care for one another.
College Freshman,5,"Most popular study areas are the fountain, library, and personal dorm rooms."
College Junior,5,"I don't know of any crimes that have happened on campus, except maybe with laundry ending up in other peoples' baskets. I feel really safe on campus, I don't know of any reason to not feel safe."
College Junior,5,"Our school is unapologetic about its' beliefs. We are centered around the primacy of Jesus Christ, the priority of scripture, the pursuit of truth, and the practice of wisdom. So if a student is looking for an atmosphere to grow their faith in Christ and grow relationships with others."
College Junior,5,"We have great weather the whole year. I like all weather, so I'm probably bias about that."
College Junior,5,"The athletes and non-athletic students are so good at supporting each other. This year more than any other year, I really feel like the school has been more of a community instead of different sectors of students."
College Junior,5,"We have a strict zero tolerance to drugs and alcohol. Obviously there are going to be people that break that rule and choose to partake, but there isn't any pressure to partake in substances and those who do are easily and quickly caught and disciplined. There is forgiveness if a person is willing to go through the steps, but if not they are kicked out."
College Junior,5,There is this awesome coffee shop.
College Junior,5,The campus is very well lite and very secure!
College Junior,5,The university has adult program classes where you the student is still able to keep a full time job and go to school. In the adult program it is focused on students learning the materials from actually professor in the business atmosphere.
College Junior,5,The financial aid process went really smoothly. I handed over the documents they needed and the financial aid advisors did the rest.
College Junior,5,There is always someone there to help you if you have trouble with any problems.
College Junior,5,"This is a Christian university, so there is zero tolerance towards drugs and alcohol"
College Junior,5,"This is a Christian University, they go by Christian standards."
College Junior,5,"They have really good quality in computers, in the library they let you borrow macs, hp and lenovo."
College Junior,5,Especially in the collegiate sports programs there is a very diverse group of students! Many students from Asia as well as Mexico and South American countries.
College Sophomore,5,"The campus is very strict about drinking, drugs and sex before marriage. They do not allow boy and girls to go into each others rooms and there is a curfew implemented that is enforced. It does limit social time late at night but it also helps students to get in their rooms so they can get more sleep for the next day. Character is very important to Oklahoma Wesleyan and their drive is to make you and better person for society."
College Sophomore,5,"I love my program. Although there is a lot of work involved in a biology major it is worth it to due be able to learn some of the most interesting facts about life. The facilities are nice, and the technology is up to date with the present field and the professors are more than willing to share advice on high to succeed in their field."
College Sophomore,5,The academic program is great. The professors want you to succeed and are willing to help you get there. The curriculum is set for you to succeed although that brings a heavy workload. The most popular study option is the library or the mansion where students can get peace and quiet and be comfortable enough to get there studying done without any distractions.
College Sophomore,5,"My major is biology. The program is semi-small so I get more one on one with my professor to better understand the material. The professors are all well equip to teach their field of study. The workload is a lot but it teaches you to balance life and school. The curriculum is geared to succeeding any profession you choose to join and professors are ready to help you if you are struggling to understand any of the material. The facilities are a little old, but are still update on the technologies used in the field today."
College Senior,5,There is zero tolerance to drugs and alcohol at Oklahoma Wesleyan University. Most of the students follow the rules.
College Senior,5,"There is always something for many different tastes.  Sometimes it gets old, but in those times one always has the option to grill up something unique on the skillet."
College Freshman,5,Due to most of the students at OKWU are athletes the student involvement is great. The coaches are great and each sport supports each other when necessary.
College Junior,5,It is a Christian campus and I always feel very safe! I have never seen or heard of anyone talking about crime on the campus.
College Freshman,5,Okwu is very good at getting young people to come by giving them good scholarships.Okwu wants many students to attend and are very good at providing scholarships to kids who don't have very much money or have had hard lives. I am very thankful and blessed they were very good to me when it came to providing scholarships. The school was very sympathetic to some hardships I faced in my life and put in a lot of effort in providing good scholarships for me to go here.
College Freshman,5,"Small community with a shopping mall, delicious restaurants, very little nightclubs or bars . Having very little night clubs is good because students are less likely to leave the college campus and party. Basically this aspect of the town keeps students out of trouble . Overall , the town is very safe and small ."
College Freshman,5,"The rules at Oklahoma University are very Christian centered and help the students to practice good morals. The rules really illustrate that the university is very serious about their Christian beliefs, in contrast to a secular university."
College Freshman,5,All Christian Denominations are allowed to attend Oklahoma Wesleyan and the university is very friendly and welcoming to all.
College Sophomore,5,It pretty fun being a music major if you don't love music then this is not the program for you it is pretty hard but it is enjoyable
College Senior,5,"The program is excellent. Students are inspired and challenged through the course work. The professors are well educated and involved with the students. I like that the work is challenging, and this is a Christian based school which integrates religion into learning."
College Junior,5,"More Than Just a College Campus – Every school has its strengths and weaknesses but if I were to choose my school's biggest strength, it would be the campus life. I have the privilege of being part of a big dysfunctional family at my school, and I don't mean just my group of friends, I mean my professors and faculty members as well. One day when I was working in the financial aid office checking e-mails, I stumbled upon one sent from a science professor. His e-mail was sent to all faculty members concerning his wife who was ill and requested for everyone to pray for her. He ended his e-mail with something I will never forget- He asked for everyone to pray for his students who do not know Jesus Christ as their Lord and personal Savior. As he asked for others to pray that his students would come to know Him and live a life of pure love and joy, I could sense the sincerity and heartache from his writing and I was honored. I am honored to have professors who care about my life. I cannot think of any other school where my professors not invest time into my success but ones who pray for me!"
College Senior,5,Oklahoma Wesleyan provides two computer labs that have about 30 Desktop Mac computers in them each. The Library also provides students who dont have lap tops or computers with computers that they can rent for the day.( by renting i mean for free) The school also provides a free printer for all students!
College Senior,5,The weather at Oklahoma Wesleyan is wonderful. We get all 4 seasons. Winter when the snow is on the ground it absolutely beautiful. Theres a hill that kids will take their sleds up and slide down it. The spring and fall are so nice. The temperature is just right to wear shorts and sit outside and enjoy the environment.
Sophomore,4,"I have taken two classes online so far. I do not like doing online classes, but the professors I had, make it really fun and enjoyable."
Junior,4,"This semester with the recent pandemic, most classes were transferred online, but not every class transferred well. Some professors took this as an opportunity to better themselves and have a better understanding as to what resources they could implement later in other classes, others became stagnant and the quality of their teaching suffered because of it."
Junior,4,"I enjoyed how most of the staff take a Christian outlook into most of the things they do. It is a great place to gain friends that will help you out throughout life. However, the cost of the college is a bit high, but it is a non-profit private college, so that isn't too hard to imagine."
Alum,4,This school is amazing and I was so blessed to have my faith intertwined into every subject.  By placing God into my studies allowed for me to grow both spiritually and faithfully.  The professors are supportive and available to help you learn the material while they push you to be better.  Some professors were better than others as most schools are but this makes for a well rounded education.  Online classes are very much doable as you work full-time.
Sophomore,4,My son loves it it and feels like they really care about you.  The only down side is how expensive it is to attend.
Junior,4,"Overall, Oklahoma Wesleyan is a good school to attend that values Christian morals. The smaller classroom sizes allow professors to know students by name. It is easy to get to know people and build friendships. Although the first-year accommodations aren't the best for first-year students, there are some decent dorms available to most from sophomore to senior year. The school has successful soccer and baseball programs which bring a spirit of competition to the school. The city of Bartlesville is also a very safe place to live in with a very low crime rate. Although since the city is small and quiet, the typical college party life suffers because of it."
Senior,4,"Oklahoma Wesleyan is a great university. It is  smaller close nit community, and your professors really care about your success. it is a place where you have true liberty to seek life truths."
Freshman,4,It was a great experience I was able to get closer to God and further my education. All while meeting new and amazing people
Niche User,4,"OKWU shines brightest with it's faculty. The professors show genuine care that is rarely found elsewhere. They will walk with you through any difficulty that you are having. I was struggling in a couple of my classes due to my crazy life schedule, and my professors were willing to meet with me and find a way to help me succeed. As far as culture goes, there isn't a great representation of personalities. It is heavy on white conservatives, unless you're in sports. But the people have strong character and integrity, as it is a solid value within the school's doctrine. If you want to be in an environment filled with high quality individuals, Oklahoma Wesleyan University may be the place for you!"
Junior,4,"Great christian school! Has its pros and cons, but overall a great learning and community experience."
Junior,4,"Good school, great professors, I attend here online and I like it although it is expensive, currently trying to find scholarships to offset cost of attendance"
College Freshman,4,The athletic department is very good team that we have there are very good and very talented
College Sophomore,4,Not a lot of information on this as I am an adult student.
College Sophomore,4,Great Athletic facilities and participation!
College Junior,4,"Almost every student on the campus is an athlete. Sports are what draw people to the school. We have great programs and coaches. School spirit is a little lacking because most teams are practicing when another team is playing or they all have games on the same day. However, when every teams are free they will show up to support each other. The facilities are average and need to be improved."
College Junior,4,"The faculty is amazing. They are helpful, kind, and intelligent. They want to help every student in anyway possible. It is a private Christain school and they make sure to incoporate religion into every class. The campus is beautiful and you feel safe when you are on it. The school has multiple resources avaliable to every student to make sure they have the best chance at succeeding. The School truley cares about every single one of the students on campus, we are not just another number. I would definitely choose my school again. I love the atmosphere here and my professors are amazing."
College Freshman,4,Oklahoma Wesleyan is a great school to be involved in. You have to watch out for the cliques in the school and the rumors that go around. You have to be cautious of the people you hang around also. The professors are exceptional and they do everything in their power to help you succeed. I like how Biblical the school is and how they make sure that everything said comes straight from the Bible
College Sophomore,4,"The financial aid process at Oklahoma Wesleyan was extremely easy and convenient. With a tuition at about $30,000 per school year, 98% of the students are on financial aid. The staff was very kind, and was willing to work with my parents to help me find grants and loans that I qualified for, along with the coaches who are willing to adjust athletic scholarships to help meet your financial needs."
College Freshman,4,"there were a couple scholarships I was available for; however, I will still owe back quite a bit of money after my four years."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The individual people are extremely nice but I think a lot of the rules are ridiculous even for a christian school. Open dorms should be longer hours or on the weekends not Thursday and Sunday. You shouldn't be allowed to get in trouble for what you do OFF campus. I should be allowed to live campus after freshman year and not forced to be married, 22, or have 90 credit hours. Ridiculous."
College Sophomore,4,Close enough to school where you can walk if you wanted to
College Sophomore,4,You can walk around the whole campus without any problems
College Sophomore,4,The Library is always full
College Sophomore,4,Its better if you play a sport
College Sophomore,4,Small classes  are better for me. It helps each student find there own way into the real world with ease.
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone here is super friendly sand its real easy to make friends, plus the soccer team is real easy on the eyes."
College Junior,4,"Like all campuses, we have our lower quality dorms. These are reserved mostly for freshmen which creates a good incentive for bringing upper classmen back to school. We are expanding so there are new dorms that have been built. The school has a good process for signing up for housing and is fair to students. People in the dorms become very good friends and share a connection that is special around campus."
College Junior,4,We have multiple national championships and even more appearances at national tournaments. Our school succeeds in many different sports every year and has great support. Not too many events are held on campus so the games are a great attraction to students as well as locals.
College Junior,4,"Not many people would choose this location for a vacation. However, after living here, you get to noticing all of the attractions the town has. The safety, which is most important, is as high as any other town. They have provided a caring culture here. There are parks all around town that host great events to bring the citizens together. The locals are very accepting and kind towards students. They show great support by attending many sports games and donating generously to the school."
College Junior,4,"What makes my school unique is the community. I didn't expect to like a small campus and I have fallen in love with this one. Just about everybody is outgoing and caring. It has been easy to build meaningful relationships. Also, being surrounded by so much support everyday has been uplifting and encouraging in class, sports, and life outside of school."
College Junior,4,The class size was even smaller than I expected. This did not end up being a bad thing. The small size helps professors learn each student personally. This deeper relationship helps students that may struggle in the classroom. The same goes with peers. Many people are willing to help other students in or out of the classroom.
College Freshman,4,"The campus is very strict on drinking and partying in dorms. In fact, our school has a curfew that applies to everyone."
College Freshman,4,Campus life is very fun and loving; everyone gets involved in the student center and really come together.
College Freshman,4,The girls and boys on campus have a close social life with one another. Everyone knows each other and loves to have a personal relationship.
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is very small, unlike most schools their aren't many people to join a greek life."
College Freshman,4,My major is Biology and the school has wide varieties of studies and professions that help you achieve your major.
College Freshman,4,I know of people who love to live of campus and get the feel of being by themselves.
College Freshman,4,It's a small community which everyone knows each other and their is multiple things to do everywhere you go.
College Freshman,4,Diversity is accepted and most of your friends are from all over the world.
College Freshman,4,Living on campus is a better experience since you are close with your classes and friends.
College Junior,4,The rules are set out to all students when they get there and before they come. I feel like our school has a good balance between grace and strictness in upholding our standards for the student body.
College Junior,4,We have a relatively new library which is central to people hanging out. We essentially have 2 full-size gyms and racquetball courts. They recently did up a new game room for the students too.
College Junior,4,It has small town charm. It's close to bigger cities though so it has the best of both atmospheres for all types of people.
College Junior,4,I think the dorms are just as good as you'll get anywhere else. If you average it out most girls are 3-5 on a bathroom which isn't that bad at all when everyone has different schedules. There's free laundry and tvs in the lobbies. Smaller kitchens are available for use for everyone. Most people enjoy living on campus and the friendships that are developed there.
College Junior,4,"There are options for those who are looking for them. A lot of people end up at the same places over and over again, but that's their choice. They aren't deciding to take advantage of what there is."
College Freshman,4,Most of the dorms here are nice and spacious except it may be a bit small in the freshman dorms. It is kept very clean and everyone is friendly to each other. It is mostly quiet so it is easy to study and sleep.
College Freshman,4,There is a large variety of diversity on campus that mostly includes ethnic groups. Sexual orientation is highly scrutinized so if other than heterosexual it is kept quiet.
College Freshman,4,There are plenty of places to go eat or shop and there is a mall with a movie theater and also bowling is another fun thing to do.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe to be able to walk on campus at night alone. Nothing ever happens but one concern may be that there isa lack of cameras around the campus dorms.
College Freshman,4,Here on campus you practically end up knowing everybody because it is such a small school. It's very easy to make friends because everyone is generally very nice and like to do fun sports and do bible studies or study groups.
College Freshman,4,"This is a Christian university, so many of the campus rules are rather strict including alcohol use, drugs, and going to casinos. You cannot do any of these things on or off campus if you are enrolled even if it is on breaks. The dorms are separated boys and girls so visitation is only twice a week for about 8 hours each of those days. Curfew is until 2:00 am every day of the week."
College Freshman,4,"The academics here are really good and that is thanks to the help of the professors. They are always there to help you whenever you want, you don't even need an appointment to see them. Many of the classes here prepare the students for real life situations and show how the job really will be. There is also free tutoring everyday of the week including the weekends. Registration can be rather complicated if you haven't asked someone what to do."
College Junior,4,There is great debates between students and professors about diversity.
College Junior,4,I am happy so far with the Rn to Bsn program and glad I am able to take classes online to further my education.
College Junior,4,The facilities are up to date and look great.
College Junior,4,I have only had postive experiences so far with this school.
College Junior,4,I have yet to have an internship. In my field you must get beyond certain classes in order to get an internship. I do plan to have one as it will give me some great hands-on experience without any safety net to catch me if I mess up.
College Junior,4,"There have been a lot of changes within my major since I've been here. I would still choose the same school if I were to do it all over again, but I would want a bit more consistency within the program. I don't have any concerns about finding a job after I graduate."
College Junior,4,"The specific programs at OKWU are set up so that each student has the opportunity to do their absolute best. The workload within each program is such that you will know what you are doing once you graduate and step into the ""real world"" of jobs."
College Junior,4,"The food is good and you can always find something that you like. The dining hall is being completely renovated, so it will be very exciting to see what all they have planned for this next year."
College Sophomore,2,"At Oklahoma Wesleyan University, students may not live off of campus grounds until earning a total on ninety credit hours. The ""off-campus"" options are across the street from the campus, have RA's on duty at all times, and the same curfew hours as those students who live in dorms."
College Sophomore,2,"The party scene at Oklahoma Wesleyan is completely non-existent and contains a strict no-tolerance policy unless thrown on campus by campus staff. At these parties, there is to be no dancing, profanity, and all students must be back in their dorms by curfew."
College Sophomore,2,"For students looking to attend Oklahoma Wesleyan University, it should be understood that the school is located in the small city of Bartlesville, Oklahoma. If you are looking for vegan, vegetarian, or higher quality options most of the students here will make the forty minute drive to Tulsa, Oklahoma to find what they are looking for. As well as late night options, because Bartlesville is so small, the fast food options here are both scarce and close before midnight. Unless you are a fan of Taco Bell, Taco Bueno, McDonald's, Burger King or Sonic, you will find yourself having to make a trip to Walmart to satisfy your late night study cravings."
College Sophomore,2,"While I can appreciate the Christian values at Oklahoma Wesleyan, not all of the policies are viewed as reasonable. Policies regarding social life do not allow of-age drinking or tobacco use off of campus, students at the age of 21 consuming alcohol off of campus will still face consequences of suspension or removal from the university. As well, for students of opposing genders, any sort of visitation outside of the given two hours a week will face the same consequences. In short, for those students who have grown up in homes outside of the Wesleyan church, the new policies can be difficult to adjust to."
Recent Alumnus,2,Its very good some days and will make you sick the next. Pretty sure they re-use food for weeks until its gone. Reheating and cooling it everyday. Not many options and not many healthy choices for athletes.
Recent Alumnus,2,The rooms in Susana Wesley hall are too small for two people.The bathrooms are disgusting and aren't cleaned properly when they ARE cleaned. The smell is awful. Quiet hours aren't enforced.
College Junior,2,Our private university is not approving of parties. I think this has a positive impact because it keeps most students out of trouble. It also helps the students focus on class and what's more important. The town doesn't have much of a nightlife since most stores and restaurants are closed by 10 pm during the week. It is frustrating at times but has a lot of good results.
College Sophomore,2,People are loud at night people generally do not observe quiet hours
College Sophomore,2,"I have lived on campus my whole time being at Oklahoma Wesleyan. However, I have heard from other students and friends of mine that the cost of a lot of the places here in Bartlesville is a little expensive. They are all about 10 minutes or more away from campus. I also here that it is hard to find one as well. Therefore, teh availability is bad."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Have Your Own Car or a Friend With a Car – There aren't really any buses or anything in Bartlesville. You can ride your bike if the weather is good, but there aren't many bike paths and it can be a few miles to get to Walmart or whereever you may want to go. Your best option is to have your own car."
College Junior,2,"There is not enough parking, especially for special events.  It has gotten better, but we still have problems."
College Junior,2,"One Cafeteria With No Variety – We have one cafeteria for everyone with no other places to eat.  The food isn't bad, but it is the same food nearly every day and week, and it is not healthy."
Freshman,1,"Nothing fun to do in town, not a college town... and not worth the price. Dorms are filthy and small. You pay $30,000-$40,000 per year. For a college worth $5,000"
Freshman,1,"STAY AWAY!!! It’s terrible. Most freshmen transfer away after the first semester, as did I. They pride themselves on being a “Christian” school yet they lured me in with lies and deceit. This place is an absolute joke."
Freshman,1,"If I could give it 0 stars, I would. Went here my freshman year and half of the kids transferred out. Not a college experience at all. & I questioned the education I was receiving: it o graduate from here will I be prepared for my career."
College Junior,1,We do not have Greek Life on campus. I like that we do not. We have strict rules and the reputation of Greek life does not fit under those rules. At most campuses Greeks seem to be at the center of all the events. Here we do not have that so everyone is equal.
College Freshman,1,The only set back to the school literally!
Recent Alumnus,1,All we have is taco bell. Nothing is open after 10 but that.
Recent Alumnus,1,Christian school so there are no parties unless they are secret. You can get kicked out if they find out about them.
College Sophomore,1,It is horrible if you are an out of state kid such as myself it was very difficult to get anything if your not from Oklahoma it is very challenging
College Senior,1,"Mob Mentality and Little Tolerance – Essentially if you do not rat yourself out on something that you did wrong, expect the worst. If someone rats you out, there is a tendency for harsh consequences. Essentially, if you want to skirt around the school rules, you don't tell anyone you did so, or you will find yourself kicked out"
College Junior,1,"No Parties – There is a no drinking/smoking rule here on the campus and this stops any kind of alcohol consumption by the students. This leads to a huge underground movement of nightlife, rather than the parties every weekend that are campus wide and known."
College Freshman,1,This place is awful most transfer away after first year.
Recent Alumnus,1,"If I had to do it over again, I would not pick OWU. The academics are not very good. There aren't enough professors and you get a lot of professors who don't really have authority in their department. If you have a handicap, it is really difficult to work with faculty and staff. The whole school isn't very organized and if you ever need anything, you are sent from office to office because no one really knows how to answer any questions. The whole school is very disorganized and poorly run. The only positives are that the students are generally nice and they just built a nice new library."

Freshman,5,"I really like ABAC, the people that are there make it seem just like home and they offer help for many students. All around ABAC is a great college to go-to for any degree, I defiantly recommend this college to anyone and everyone."
Freshman,5,I have most of my classes online. I enjoy all of the classes online. Most of my work is online for the in-person classes as well. I find it easier and better this way. I also find it more safer due to the pandemic going on. The teachers are mostly fair on the online classes and tend to reply fast through email.
Sophomore,5,ABAC is a fantastic school with staff that care about the students.  The dining hall is a nice place to eat with delicious food. The only thing I’d change is have a more variety of food.
Sophomore,5,"ABAC is an amazing school! I love it. The instructors are very well informed, work with you, offer you every opportunity to ensure that you know the information needed for your program. The campus is gorgeous, and there is always something you can do!"
Sophomore,5,Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College is a wonderful college were the teachers really try to help you make the best grades possibly regardless of the situation.
Sophomore,5,The transition to online learning was a lot easier than I thought it would be because the teachers still responding to emails and helped in any way the needed to.
Sophomore,5,"I like how it’s a small school and everyone there knows each other. At a higher school it can be hard for a teacher to remember your name. However, I think they should update the Dorms."
Freshman,5,I really loved how small and accessible the classes are on campus. A student can find different ways to connect with a teacher as well as with other students. It was a great freshman experience because the college itself was not overwhelming. The faculty made you feel welcome and the institution always appreciated their students and clubs/organizations. I hope to see a bit more diversity at ABAC in the future because it is a great college.
Freshman,5,"I love this school! It has a beautiful campus, nice housing and pretty good food.  The teachers are not rude or overworked with to many student per class.  There is amazing tutoring programs that are free and and always open.  The internet is great because if you live on campus you basically get you own wifi for just your dorm room.  Housing is quick to help with any issues you might have with your roommates or room itself."
Freshman,5,Small class size and one on one help. I love that all the teachers know your name. Along with them always updating.
Freshman,5,the teachers are very helpful. class size are small which teachers have more time to help you out. professor are willing to help you when you need help.
Niche User,5,I have visited there and it is very nice and not too far from my home. The food was great and the staff were beyond helpful. I have been accepted here and the process was fast and easy. I highly recommend it!
Alum,5,"ABAC is a growing school with a strong initiative. In the last few years, they have upgraded many programs from associates to bachelors programs. Gone are the days where students would come here before moving on to a another. A record number of students from ABAC are being accepted into graduate and professional schools. Staff is growing each year to accommodate the record number of enrolled students. Because of this and more, I am glad to have graduated from ABAC as I felt I was taught very well and guided towards a path of success."
Freshman,5,"I like Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College because of its size. By that I mean, since that it is smaller school,  you get to know your peers as well as you professors, better than you would at a larger school."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at ABAC has been fantastic! Some classes are tough, but that is how some college classes are. The staff, professors, and coaches are very helpful and polite. The campus has a police academy program so the campus is very safe. The grounds team keeps the campus looking very clean and well maintained. All of the students who stay on-campus never complain about the food, so it must be good. I don't eat on campus because I'm always on the go and don't have time to eat."
Sophomore,5,"I love absolutely everything about ABAC. It has so much diversity, endless opportunities, and it is a great school overall."
Works Here,5,"Great teachers, personal learning, extremely affordable, great campus life, wonderful BCM. The campus may not be the largest, but it feels like home."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at ABAC is great. I attend the campus in Bainbridge, GA and had no problems. Advisors and Professors always emailed me in a reasonable time. If I needed help , I knew I could depend on the tutors working there. Even with online classes it wasn't hard to reach out if you was having any problems. Setting up meeting wasn't default. In Fall 2019, I will be transferring to the Main campus in Tifton. Hopefully I experience the same thing."
Sophomore,5,"I have been a student here for almost a year now, and have had no trouble being successful academically. I wouldn’t change a thing about this place."
Sophomore,5,"I have only attended Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College for a year now, but it was the best choice i could have made. The classes don't put you to sleep and they are very informative on the subject that you are attending. i have made a big handful of friends at college already that it makes me want to attend college year round.  The environment that the teachers and other students give makes it so much easier to know that you have made the best decision you could have made at 18 years old."
Sophomore,5,"ABAC is a small college with a beautiful campus.  You can get a 2 year or 4 year degree, even though it is a junior college.  Tifton has a lot to offer as far as places to eat, get supplies for both school and dorm, and see a movie.  ABAC makes you feel right at home.  Class sizes are not too large.  Dorms are pretty decent.  D-hall has great food plus there is a Surcheros on campus.  You can easily get from one class to another.  Pool and gym facilities are great. At ABAC you gain some of the best friends and you get an excellent education!"
Graduate Student,5,Love the atmosphere and the instructors there. Excellent programs and students are from all over the world there.  Nursing program is in the top 10 of colleges.
Sophomore,5,"staff always willing to help out, including professors! i think the housing should be upgraded. Everyone I have met there is always friendly and welcoming."
Freshman,5,Abac is a very good college where kids can meet and grow with new people daily. The professors are nice and will try to help people any way they can. The little town gives off a homie feeling that you might miss being away from home. All the workers at the school are nice and polite.
Freshman,5,ABAC is quite possibly the best college I have attended. I know what it is like to attend a school that doesn't look out for your best interests. During orientation I had several Deans introduce themselves and even pass on their card stating that if I were to need anything during my time at ABAC that I could ask them for help. They also have an amazing tutoring set up. During finals they have people working until 12:00 AM. Everyone that is employed at ABAC are there for every students needs.
Junior,5,Great school. They have a beautiful campus with great facilities. The facility is amazing and really devote themselves to the education of their students and are willing to work one on one with students outside of the classroom. This is a really good school and I couldn't imagine picking a better place to start my college career!
Alum,5,"The campus is beautifully manicured, the apartments and dorms are comfortable and homey. ABAC is a second home to me."
Freshman,5,I love the closer feel of this small school. Makes it more homey and all the professors and people make this school the best school to attend.
Freshman,5,"I love the support that all students receive from the faculty and staff. They seek to ensure that every student succeed by giving us the resources and helping us find the connections that we need in order to advance our careers goals. ABAC really does provide a very unique and rich education t every single one of it’s students, and I am so glad that I made the choice to attend. We have a beautiful campus and a very calming environment that makes every student feel like they can truly achieve any goal that they put their mind to."
Freshman,5,Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College is a small school in a small town. It has some of the best programs around with some of the best staff. Everyone is willing to help in any way they can.
Niche User,5,"My experience was very welcoming and like home feeling. the whole high school career I was told you will actually experience life when I get to college, and the two-week visit I did was amazing. The food, amazing. The professors taught to where you could actually understand what was going on."
Niche User,5,it is  a great school and has good professors to help you along the way to your  degree.  and unlike most universities they are small and you can travel the campus in as easy as 10 minutes.
Freshman,5,"I love attending ABAC! The people here are so welcoming and supportive. Tifton is a smaller town, but there are plenty of people attending college here from all walks of life. The professors here are wonderful, and I feel that they truly care about my success. They care about my success in their class as well as later on in life. They want the best for each and every student. ABAC is incredibly affordable, especially to now be a four year college."
Freshman,5,I wouldn't change a thing about this college. The staff is awesome and very respectful and helpful. The courses are very thorough and a very clean campus.
Sophomore,5,Its fun and the professors are easy to talk to and contact. the dorms are nice to stay in even though the beds provided are tough and you need a mattress pad for them. Also they provide an academic achievement center with free tutors to all students. they also have free access to a full gym that is on campus. teachers work well with commuters as well
Freshman,5,"It’s a small college with excellent student life and good academics. I like the small town and community atmosphere. The tuition is reasonable and there is a high job placement rate after graduation. I feel the professors are knowledgeable and demonstrate through action and word the desire for each students success.
My housing is clean and conviently located in the campus. The cafeteria would could be more varied with a need for later dining hours to accommodate sports and campus organization meetings. 
I like how the campus is self contained outside of town but close enough for shopping and entertainment. It is a beautiful campus with a fascinating history."
Freshman,5,"My freshman experience with Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College has been nothing less than astounding. I decided to live on campus because I believed it would allow for more opportunities to be involved; I was right. I've had the pleasure of forming strong relationships with a diverse group of people and am currently being challenged by what I believe are some of the best professors in the state. Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College offers some of the best four-year degrees, and I'm looking forward to obtaining my bachelors degree in nursing while living here. The campus is a safe, clean environment that has proven itself perfect for students who are serious about academic success. If I were to rate this school on a scale of one to five, i'd give it a score of five. If interested in pursuing a degree here at ABAC, I recommend scheduling a campus visit!"
Senior,5,"I graduated from Abraham Baldwin College in 2014 with my Associate degree in Nursing. It is a wonderful school. I found the College to be a very diversity school and the professors and teacher s and all of the faculty are there for you when you need them. They are connected and the school gives you many opportunities to further your career and  makes it affordable to attend. ABAC is an excellent school and I definitely recommend if looking to choose a career , choose Abraham Baldwin College. I did."
Sophomore,5,I have only been here for a few weeks but so far I am loving the campus and the school itself. The teachers are very friendly and are willing to help you in any way they can. You are able to make new friends and everyone you see or talk to is very friendly and willing to help you in any way they can.
Freshman,5,I like this college because everyone is so friendly and helpful. I feel like I'm at home when I am on their campus.
Freshman,5,The staff and student volunteers are extremely nice and helpful. The campus is gorgeous and easy to navigate. The freshmen housing is very nice and tends to the needs of the students. They plan several activities to help the freshmen feel welcome before classes begin. I highly recommend this college to any students wanting to venture off into the agricultural field!!
Senior,5,"Excellent school overall. Academics success is a main focus of the school. This is evident in the availability of tutoring and professor assistance. Professors always strive to encourage students to do their best and work with them patiently if they are struggling. The school also provides additional help through evening programs such as essay writing help sessions, loan information programs, and much more. Housing is well kept, contains a lot of space, and exceeds other college housing while remaining economically feasible. The school overall is inexpensive. Financial services can be a bit finicky but always takes the time to work through difficulties patiently."
Freshman,5,"Abraham Bladwin Agriculture College;  ABAC is a good setting for students who don't want to be to far from home but still gets the southern feeling when they are away from home.I recommend this collge for any freshmen who wants to persue a career in Nursing or Agriculture . ABAC has the best nursing program,very competitive, updated technogially and hands-on experience. The atmosphere at ABAC is so calm and a place where you can be free to xpress yourself, the staff is very friendly to everyone."
Freshman,5,The teachers truly care about you. Most of the students are friendly and everyone gets along very well. They are always upgrading the college. The library is very nice and they offer food at the campus. There are plenty of groups for a student to get into.
Sophomore,5,Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College offers a quality education with tremendous staff. The college is set on a beautiful campus. I would highly recommend this school to anyone.
Sophomore,5,"I love ABAC, it is a great smaller college for students who would like to be apart of smaller classes, you get more one on one time with the professors, you meet more people and easily widen your network. There is not anything I would change about this school, it speaks for itself and I am sure all the students who attend would agree."
Senior,5,"ABAC is a community, with approximately 3500 students it is large enough to meet new people every day but small enough to always recognize many people.  The professors are fantastic!  ABAC's open door policy with staff is fantastic.  Professors strive to make students competitive and ready for the workforce."
College Freshman,5,Class sizes are small. One class over 20 students.
College Freshman,5,A degree from ABAC means you have field experience
College Freshman,5,Best small school for a forestry degree.
College Student,5,Everything about Bainbridge College is convenient.
College Student,5,All of my professors have been extremely understanding and helpful.
College Senior,5,"Every professor that I have had at ABAC has been willing to work hands on with students to enhance the learning process. Class sizes are relatively small, about 20-30 per class. There are various different classes including: Mathematics, English, History, Music, Science, Social Science, Humanities and Fine Arts, and Physical Education."
College Senior,5,ABAC is my starting point in college. I plan to finish up my core credits at ABAC before transferring for my Bachelor's degree.
College Freshman,5,Professors are willing to help you in your career search.
College Freshman,5,"ABAC is a great school that makes you feel welcome. They really take the term ""southern hospitality"" to heart."
College Junior,5,"The campus is very clean, very friendly staff, you feel cared about as an individual when you apply."
College Sophomore,5,They has a good team to have and advise you with your classes.
College Sophomore,5,The school is small but what ever it take to help a student to get what they need.
College Sophomore,5,The campus is a wonderful campus I truly enjoy the campus.
Freshman,4,"I really like ABAC online, they are there constantly helping each and every student with anything and have virtual Zoom classes that you can join anytime if you feel like you need help with anything. And the online learning experience is very easy to learn and easy to use, I defiantly recommend online learning."
Freshman,4,"I did not plan on going to this college at first, but now that I am here I do not regret it. It is a very nice college and all of my professors are nice as well. Dining hall never disappoints and I enjoy their variety of drinks. All of the students here are friendly and I am really enjoying going here. I plan on returning for my sophmore year because I am learning a lot of material here. I have enjoyed learning math as well and before it was not my favorite subject. The instructors that I have had tend to teach well and are comprehendible. There is a great amount of diversity as well and many clubs. I enjoy taking walks on the track as well and it always feels safe to do so. I am currently staying at Place and I enjoy it very much. I have enough space in my room and a great kitchen to use. The fridge is spacious enough and there are plenty of cabinets. The free area is great for the amount of people who stay at the dorm and the people here are nice. The bathrooms here are very clean."
Sophomore,4,The teaches did not give an extreme amount of work. If you need help the teacher would respond to you in a timely manner and would interact with us to keep us engaged with the course.
Freshman,4,I am very happy with my college choice. They are committed to making this fall semester the best and safest it can be for each individual student.
Freshman,4,My online courses start this fall and so far they seem very well structured. The professors genuinely care about their student's success.
Sophomore,4,"Although online classes are not my preference, my instructors worked with me to help me retain the information I needed. I struggled with it as I focus better in a classroom setting, but COVID prevented that. Our instructors worked tirelessly to help us get the most out of this semester, although we were unable to see each other face-to-face."
Junior,4,"The people here are all so amazing, everyone is willing to help, you can never go wrong with meeting new people because everyone is so willing to make you feel at home, the atmosphere is just so positive."
Junior,4,I am in the nursing program and overall the schools program is nice!! The only thing I would change about ABAC is the staff response time. They either get back to you very late or not at all. The school also plans things really late so hopefully you aren’t a planner because they will make your OCD side run wild.
Junior,4,The online transition was not as bad as I thought it would be. The professors provide you with an online schedule to complete weekly so you can go at your own pace and can plan your schedule. The classes are on zoom so you can have somewhat of a face to face contact with the teachers. You have to manage your time well with online classes.
Freshman,4,I like the landscape of the campus. There are always flowers blooming with there scents in the air. One thing I would like to change is how clubs open up to new students.
Sophomore,4,"I honestly love ABAC. It has a wonderful atmosphere, brilliant professors who spend a lot of time on student engagement, and there are many program options for a much smaller tuition fee than other colleges. There is something for everyone--it is not just about agriculture."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy that ABAC has more diverse programs than I originally anticipated. Most professors are very friendly and are willing to help students in any way they can.
Freshman,4,"I like the housing, the athletics department, and the academics. This is a great school to attend if you are thinking about going into the Agriculture program such farming, biology, anatomy, and etc."
Sophomore,4,ABAC has been absolutely wonderful so far. The faculty and staff care about all of its students and their education very much
Sophomore,4,"When the first day of college began, I began to get nervous because of all of the rumors saying that college will be difficult and need to study a lot. In that case, it is true but if you make the sacrifices and study hard it will make life easier. The things I like is the student life because everyone is friendly with each other. It is not to difficult to get lost on campus. Things to improve are more student event activities like games or getting together."
Sophomore,4,"ABAC is a very beautiful place. The food is amazing, especially fried chicken Thursday. Classes are small so when a student is struggling, they can reach out to the professor and ask for help. They also have free tutoring. They have a pond on campus for those who’s like to enjoy the outdoors fishing. ABAC have tennis, softball, baseball, and soccer."
Junior,4,"I love that we have professors that want you to succeeded. I love that the library is getting basically a make-over. I think more parking would be beneficial for the school staff, faculty, and students alike."
Sophomore,4,A great college. College can be a very scary situation with new students. Someone always emails or wrote letters in the mail when you need something or missing anything. I think overall it’s a tough but fair school. They encourages you to learn as well
Senior,4,"Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College is a state college in Tifton, Ga. The college provides a safe environment for students. The college also have great professors and resources for students in need. The resources are the food pantry, clothing closet, scholarship, on campus jobs etc. What I like about the college is the campus is beautiful. Students can be themselves without being judged. There are a variety of organizations and clubs such as Ambassadors, Helping Profession Association, Rural Studies and so forth. The college also have intramural sports like tennis, baseball, and soccer. What I also like about the college is there are always events for students to attend. I would like to see is more available parking space for students."
Sophomore,4,"Great campus, lots of activities to do on campus. The professors really challenge you and want you to learn. The push you to do your best."
Freshman,4,I really like how open but small the campus is. The food is great but repetitive at times. The only concern I have is with safety when crossing the roads to get to another part of campus.
Freshman,4,Great professors. Great people. Great classes. Only down side is there isn't much to do around the town.
Niche User,4,"Campus is very nice, quiet but lively, and normal. Small school, teachers and staff  are willing to help . Meet great people here."
Freshman,4,"ABAC is a great college. Everyone from housing to advisors to student accounts, have been so nice and easy to work with. The one thing that I would change is dining, as a freshman yo must pay for a dining plan, even if you never use it."
Freshman,4,Professors care and are extremely understanding. Nice facilities. Good academics. The dual-enrollment program is excellent. All of the staff help students reach their potential.
Niche User,4,"I  haven't attended  Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College , but I have heard very positive thing about the school.  I will be a transient student. The professors are willing to work the students on their subjects."
Freshman,4,"Good college, however, there is not too much to do on the weekends. Professors are for the most part nice and willing to help students."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed going to Bainbridge State College. I never really had any issues with the school. They often had activities for all students and they were fun and free, the faculty was helpful in anything I needed help with, and the teachers were very helpful if I did not understand something, they would openly help and give direction in what to do next."
Freshman,4,My experience as a freshmen has been very good. Theirs so much activities that our campus offers. The most thing that interested me was that the campus is divers with so many ethnicity.
Freshman,4,Very helpful professors that help you with study plans and give plenty of opportunities for extra credit. Academic Achievement Center for tutoring that is helpful if you are struggling in any class. Nice living facilities and dining hall and a very clean campus.
Freshman,4,ABAC is great community college. I love it! Its small but it is in a way better because the professors are more attentive and caring. The dorms are great and the food is pretty good to.
Freshman,4,Bainbridge State College was a very good place to take my first college class. I was a Move On When Ready student and felt very prepared for the rest of my college career after taking my course.
Freshman,4,ABAC has a variety of majors to choose from. They also value every students education. The staff are very respectful and are on call if someone needs them.
Junior,4,I love ABAC! I've always had a good time attending classes and the activities on campus. I commute 30 minutes back and forth so I don't always get to participate with the events going on. The police department is really good on letting everyone know what the weather is doing and whether or not classes are canceled. They also are very helpful if your car battery dies and need to be jumped off. The students are all really nice. The professors are great! They all really enjoy teaching their classes. I highly recommend you take a look at ABAC!
Sophomore,4,"Abraham Baldwin has a diverse group of students but with this still comes a great student life. Almost every student is friendly and willing to tell you about their experiances. In particular, a goodmorning or head nod is seemingly expected from nearly every student you come across whether you know them or not."
Sophomore,4,The campus is wonderful. The scenery is beautiful and you can tell is taken care of . the dinning food is not as great but dinning hall has a great student atmosphere. the housing is okay the rooms are nice but housing can get a little overboard with some of there rules and regulations. the professors are great and truly want to work with you. the class size is pretty small.
Sophomore,4,College has online courses that are reasonable rate and accomadating to continue with a full time job.
College Freshman,4,We get together to take this online class in the dorm
College Freshman,4,"Classes are really hands on, you apply your learning"
College Student,4,Our youth apprenticeship program is one of the best around!
College Junior,4,Everything is great at the school. Professors are nice and will help you out.
College Junior,4,Everybody gets along together at this school.
College Senior,4,"I will be transferring in the Spring of 2017 and ABAC's website makes it very easy and convenient to check for transferable credits. All of the classes I have taken so far were accepted by the school I will be transferring to (Coastal College of Georgia). The classes are also easy to register for. Even with a job and family time, I have enough time to relax as well as study."
College Senior,4,Online classes are neat because it allows you to have discussion posts with other peers in the class. Online classes are also convenient for those who aren't able to commute to school everyday. Registration is easy once you figure out which classes are expressed or not.
College Senior,4,Faculty and Staff work very hard to help you find the perfect career that meets up with your degree.
College Senior,4,ABAC is a well respected school. Professors will work with you to get internships or jobs.
College Senior,4,ABAC is a nice campus with friendly teachers who are willing to help you.
College Junior,4,I haven't had to switch schools but they've let me know it wouldn't be a problem
College Junior,4,The class sizes are smaller which makes it easier to learn also you can easily contact a professor if you needed help
College Junior,4,Getting me ready to become a teacher
College Junior,4,The staff is always super friendly and have always helped me get the information I needed
College Senior,4,Haven’t had to transfer credits
College Senior,4,Mrs. Flake (math1111) has been the most influential person in my educational career.
College Sophomore,4,Its all left up on the professors I had some good  one and so not so good.
College Freshman,4,The classes are small and offer a chance to get one on one time with the professors. There are many courses available for someone starting college.
College Freshman,4,My current major is difficult and the classes are beyond surface level information.
College Freshman,4,It is a small school with alot to offer.
College Student,4,"ABAC is a great school. I always feel like they are here to help me, especially since tutoring is available until midnight every day. Class size is at most 30 students, and you can stop the professor anytime or walk into their office for help. Also, your adviser is a professor in the area that you study, so they always know what the best route is for you when you have questions or doubts. School involvement is also a big part of ABAC. They host events, games, activities, and club meetings every day of the week, including weekends."
College Junior,4,I go to school one day a week and complete the work online. The other two classes are online classes and I can complete the work anytime.
College Junior,4,"The professors want the students to succeed and they are willing to help explain everything. Online classes are very easy, but you have to stay on top of the work or you could fall behind."
Junior,2,"Bainbridge Satan Colleage only has one four year degree that I know of. I will be graduating in May of 2017 with an Associate Degree in General Studies. I want to continue my education but unless I want to study Business I have to attend another institution.  Why,  if Bainbridge is a four year college why can't I earn a degree in any field?  Not so, unless I want to be a Teacher, or study business I have to look elsewhere."
College Student,2,"If you say you graduated from there, you're not saying much."
College Student,2,Teachers don't really help you
College Student,2,The core classes are the hardest
College Senior,2,There is no career advisement or services available. It would be nice if there was.
College Senior,2,Our wireless is awful. Half the time the printers do not work. The computer's are slow.
College Senior,2,Our library is very small and does not have a lot to offer. Mainly I have to rent books from other schools.
College Senior,2,I don't know anything this school has that makes it special.
College Senior,2,"My experience here has not been all too good, it is just not the school for me. I am transferring to a much larger university."
College Senior,2,"The student body is not diverse at all, everyone is ""country"" and will judge you if you are not."
College Junior,2,"They are kind of diverse, but most are not accepting of other culture. It is a very southern school."
College Freshman,2,"Most online professors really don't care, but some really take their job serious and they want to see you succeed."
College Freshman,2,The student center is always full of people and the library never has enough computers to use.
Recent Alumnus,2,Some of the staff could have been more helpful and available
College Senior,2,I personally feel that online classes are not as helpful. You don't get the interaction you would get if you were in a classroom and I like to be able to ask my professor a question so i could better understand what's going on. Then having my peers around to explain it in a simpler way so that I can better understand.
College Freshman,2,"I gave the computer networking a C- because of it's slow internet connection. We, as students get kicked off of the internet at least every few hours which forces us to continuously sign back in to the student network. If you get an Ethernet cord you should be fine. The school has labs and printers on campus but many times the computers are slow and need to not updated and you have to pay to use the printer of course. You should defiantly invest in your own personal laptop and printer."
College Freshman,2,"I gave this a C- because of the lack of participation here. A lot of the students that come here, come with the intentions on receiving their associates degree then transferring to a bigger college or university. Some students would even come just for a year just because it's great to start off financially.  So, students aren't as involved because most are here for one thing, and one thing only. The focus isn't on being actively involved."
College Senior,2,"If you transfer before you graduate your credits are not always accepted at your next school. However if classes are in demand scheduling them is pretty easy. Also its sometimes hard to get a class you really want because you can't find it. Frustrations I have had with ABAC would include the dorms which are nice, but sometimes they aren't cleaned well and bugs and incests infest some rooms which is gross. Overall the school is about average."
College Freshman,2,The network is always busy and the printers do not work
College Senior,2,Has Issues – We have a good amount of computers in the library but we often get hasseled about haveing things printed. We have to pay for everything we have coppied. And a lot the time the librarians aren't accessible.
Senior,1,If i could give it negative 5 million stars i would. This college is a joke and unless you're from around the area in agriculture already or only interested in big business farming and sales then you're in the wrong place. I love agriculture but unless its monocrop then you're out of luck. Save you're money and make the grades to get into UGA. Absolute joke.
Senior,1,I took online and hybrid classes and it was an absolute cluster for the most part. Im not sure how some professors can even be hired it has to be a favor to them from someone they know on the inside.
College Freshman,1,"The network and wifi are always logging me off. Printing is okay, you get $10 for the semester and each copy is only 5 cents."
College Senior,1,If you like a small campus feel where everyone knows everyone then you MIGHT like this school. However I would never recommend it to anyone.
College Senior,1,It has the feel of a comuter school. Every leaves on the weekends so the campus is really dry. On top of that your pretty much in the country.
College Senior,1,"The libary id closed on weekends and the ""computer lab consist of 6 computers in which all are pretty much taken. The gym is pretty small."
College Senior,1,I honestly would not recommend anyone to go to abac. Sure is the cheapest college in georgia and in my opinion you get less than what you paid for!
College Senior,1,There really isn't a career service at ABAC. The only way that anyone has ever gotten a job after their time at ABAC was to talk to the president of the school to see if he could give them a good review. There is nothing set up at ABAC to help graduates.
College Junior,1,"The financial aid office is a mess. Nothing is ever on time. The refund checks are always late. The faculty and staff lose documents constantly, and are awful at following up with students. There are students that have missed out entire semesters even if their paperwork was submitted ahead of the deadline because the staff don't do their part."
College Senior,1,The reason I chose this grade is because I am not the only student here that is still going through financial aid difficulties.
College Senior,1,the reason why I choose this grade is because the student body at this college is very weak. Teacher's don't communicate with students. Thats mainly why students don't ask any questions.
College Senior,1,"The reason I choose this grade is because I am currently still dealing with financial difficulties. When I first enrolled at Bainbridge College I was not given any financial aid and I was put on Academic probabtion because my classes weren't getting paid for. Had I known that if my financial aid advisor had told me that my financial aid wasn't processed. However I am still dealing with financial aid issues because I am currently on financial aid supsension and I didn't know it. When I had called my academic advisor and financial aid advisor and show then that my grades were meeting the academic requirements. they couldn't figure out how I got on financial aid supspension. Thats why I gave this college a D+ because they are not concerned about the students, and I have experienced that for myself."
College Junior,1,"Need to Have More Professors Teaching Course – They should have a more variety of professors teaching a course, not just one."
College Junior,1,Not Sure – We don't offer post grad services to my knowledge. This is because ABAC is an 2 year institution.
College Sophomore,1,"This is an Ag school. So again, if your not an Ag major, you will not fit in as well"

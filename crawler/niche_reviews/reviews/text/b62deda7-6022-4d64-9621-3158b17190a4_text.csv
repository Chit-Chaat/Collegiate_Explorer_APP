Junior,5,I do currently take online classes but the teachers do a great job of staying organized to make it as easy as possible for us.
Junior,5,"As a current junior in RPI's Information Technology and Web Science program which is our most highly ranked program I believe RPI is an underrated school at this point. Beautiful campus, great food, something to do every weekend, and every club you could ever think of. The courses you take are insanely hard and time consuming but they only make you better at whatever it is you're going to school for. If I could go back in time and do it again RPI would still be the school of my choice."
Freshman,5,Its a wonderful school! A lot of FAANGs recruit from there and the professors are very attentive. The food their is pretty decent if you are living on campus. Also there is a pizza place right next to the school
Senior,5,"I owe almost all of my current success, from amazing post-graduation job offers, to previous opportunities, to RPI. Although the graduate program at Rensselaer is phenomenal, the school is made up of mostly undergraduates. I highly recommend high school students, who plan on studying any STEM field, to come here for this reason. I have received so many projects and conference opportunities through research and academia, that a similarly elite engineering school would not be able to offer, at the same quality, for undergraduates. My only negative assessment is that RPI has limited much Greek activity, due to liability concerns and a past controversy. That being said, I have faith that much of the passionate alumni will be able to fix this problem, and be able to separate the good houses from the bad house. Overall, however, RPI offers an outstanding education, and as a computer science major, I am very thankful for all the opportunities and connections I have had/made here."
Junior,5,"Even though the administration has damaged the reputation of R.P.I., I like the school. I have learned a lot of challengeable course works in terms of engineering. Most of professors like to teach students, but some of them are not concerned about teaching.  I took part in the spring career fair and a lot of big companies like GE, Lockheed Martin, Cisco, Accenture, etc. came. Even the fall career fair is bigger. So, if you think that you want to study about deep knowledge of engineering, this school is going to fit to you."
Alum,5,Worth every penny if a job is what you want after 4 years. An RPI degree will attract recruitment.  My son's current employer FOUND HIM on LinkedIn all because he saw an RPI degree on his resume. Getting through 4 years and earning a degree at RPI will attract companies looking to hire entry level positions.  He was an IT major.
Alum,5,"This is a great school for STEM. Overall engaging professors and enterprising students. I did Physics at Rensselaer but chose medicine as a career and the approach to problem solving that RPI provided was  a critical component to success in academic medicine and later in private practice. 

The only thing that needs to be changed is the rate and amount of financial support from alumni. Despite some of the highest salaries of its graduates it his a low percentage and dollar amount of support from alumni. This means the endowment is relatively low and the amount of aid to students is comparatively limited. 

If you choose a RPI you will receive a great education so be proud and be generous as an alum."
Senior,5,"I enjoy the close-knit campus life. I am familiar with most of the people that I walk past every day and have had great one-on-one time with my professors. I live close to campus so I don't have to travel far for class or to study and the classes are challenging but exciting at the same time. The only downfall is Greek life. Fraternities aren't allowed to host parties anymore and we're basically a dry campus so it's difficult to relieve stress on the weekends. Other than that, RPI is a great school and I'm glad I decided to come here."
Sophomore,5,"Classes are great, professors are phenomenal, administration is bad, weather is cloudy and cold and depressing."
Alum,5,"Rensselaer is a technical university that strongly engages students to dive deeply into their area of study while fostering an awareness of the global and societal implications of their work.  Professors and assistants often take interests in students and their pursuits at an individual level.  Having also hired Rensselaer grads, I find them on a whole more prepared to take on multidimensional problems, engage in creative problem solving, and to be strong team members because of their ability to individually contribute as well as collaborate."
Freshman,5,"bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms bad food, bad dorms"
Sophomore,5,RPI is a great college for what I want! Everyone is so nice and come together in being stressed over school work!
Sophomore,5,"Overall, RPI is a great school in all the areas that count the most. For instance, this school provides a lot of opportunities for its students and has some amazing professors. This school is not perfect, as most things in life are no, in regards to the average housing and surrounding area."
Sophomore,5,"I've enjoyed my time here so far. The professor are great and classes are really challenging. The administration sucks, which is the only real bad thing about this school."
Freshman,5,Their admissions responds very quickly. The academics are very fulfilling. I'm super excited to continue living and learning .
Sophomore,5,"Rensselaer is an institution with rigorous curriculum and challenging academics. The atmosphere is full of curiosity and a willingness to learn and grow in whatever field you are in. Through every lecture, lab, and class, students are able to learn more than what they ever thought possible within a two or three hour period. There are a variety of clubs, organizations, and sports to join, as well, all capable of bettering the individual within his or her passions and lives."
Sophomore,5,"I love the campus, professors, small classroom sizes,  the food is pretty decent at most dining halls.  
Maybe improving some of the dorms, do updating."
Alum,5,I absolutely loved my time at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. It was absolutely challenging but the education I received there was unparalleled. It prepared me for the postgraduate world in so many ways.
Niche User,5,"An absolutely amazing institute, the programs offered and the facilities available are top of the line."
Freshman,5,"It is a tremendous school academically, and a great environment for students to learn, hang out, and develop friendships. The city itself isn't great, but some improvements are in the works, like new stores and restaurants. I recommend it highly."
Junior,5,"Overall, RPI has hooked me up with some amazing opportunities, great people/connections, and a great education. It's a nerdy campus, but I find Troy quaint and the campus is really pretty. A lot of professors go above and beyond and have their curriculums really up to date with industry (many teach, do research, and consult at the same time)."
Junior,5,It is nice to attend an institution that cares about who you are and what you are trying to do. I have had problems in the past with help finding the right path to take but everyone I have talked to has been more than helpful and informative in what they can do for me or what they think would truly be my best options.
Freshman,5,"Overall, I love the atmosphere and feel of the campus. I also love the opportunities available to me through the school which is why I chose to attend the school. So far, I don't have any complaints."
Alum,5,"My experiences here were unlike any other college experience that you could have.  This is due to the work ethic & confidence I obtained while being surrounded by the great people. Yes, these people can be nerdy or at times pompous, but there is an opportunity to make friends with all kinds of people, so you will find the right group for you if you put yourself out there. People might complain about RPI- it should be made clear the separation between complaining about the academics & about RPI in general. Those who rag on RPI are mostly talking about the difficult experience with the rigorous academics. That said, most will finish their time here feeling pleased with the results of their challenging 4 years. You can also have a lot of fun here at the bars in Troy or just by mingling with the crowd who likes to party. If you go here, you will  need to make your own fun & there are plenty of people who will be down to have fun after a long week of working hard in school."
Sophomore,5,"I've got that nerd type persona that is so common in the student body here at a technical school; needless to say, I feel very at home here at RPI. All the students are really passionate about what they do, and get involved in the hundreds of diverse student-run clubs here on campus.  Everybody is also very smart, because we all came from being the top students in our high schools. Even with that in mind, there isn't too much academic competition because the education level is very difficult. We all try to help each other out, and the professors are very helpful at their office hours."
Sophomore,5,One of the first things I noticed when starting at RPI was how friendly everyone was. Everyone is very helpful and outgoing.
Junior,5,RPI is an academically challenging school that fully prepares you for the professional world. Many resources are available beyond academics to propel you forward.
Alum,5,"Very high quality of education and knowledgeable staff, and for specific fields it's the echelon of education. The job fair essentially guarantees you a fantastic and lucrative job if you work hard and present yourself well. That being said, the social atmosphere can leave something to be desired. I've heard great life and ROTC are both sure fire ways to have a great social experience, but there is a sense of competition rather than cooperation. To be that's one of the largest problems facing the pursuit of knowledge and truth today. In summary, RPI offers an unmatched quality of education, however you may have to make some social sacrifices. I knew that going in, and when I had my first job secured within the second month of my last semester it was unquestionably worth it. Finally, the male: female ratio is about 4:1."
Freshman,5,"RPI is truly a phenomenal school. Extremely fast-paced and challenging, but I wouldn’t go anywhere else for my undergraduate education."
Freshman,5,"I love the place here. It is very beautiful outside, and there are plenty of places to enjoy. Also, we have various kinds of club that could join and experience tons of things."
Sophomore,5,"My time at Rensselaer so far has been absolutely exceptional. I have been able to undertake a research opportunity in my first year as well as score both an internship and co-op at Fortune 500 company in California. Coming from the West coast, the weather took my by surprise but it really wasn't that bad. RPI provides a small, yet supportive community where it's large enough that you can explore your interests yet small enough that you can be yourself and meet amazing friends/peers that'll be with you whenever you need it. Considering RPI is so academically rigorous, it's surprising how willing people are to help each other out. Classes are also pretty small and professors really care about their students/are the best in their field. If I could do it again, I would enroll a million times over and I suggest to all my peers that they do the same."
Sophomore,5,"Academics are very difficult here, but the degree is worth it. You'll come out of RPI really knowing your field. Parties are mostly through Greek Life, so it can be tricky to find parties or to get in if you are unaffiliated. The majority of people probably don't party. Campus is in a great location, short walk from downtown Troy, and the city bus service is free to students. There is so much to do at RPI and no matter who you are you'll always find a group to fit in with!"
Senior,5,"At it's heart it is a tech school. With that comes things like lack of parties and night life. However, everyone finds their own people and if you really try finding places to go out is easy (I do things all the time). Night life is not as bad as people say, people exaggerate. We are all a bunch of 18-22 year olds (undergrad) in one place... as long as you find the right people you will have a good time. However, if you are planning on going to a tech school and you are worried enough about night life to make or break your decision to attend.... don't come here. People here have a genuine care for their education you don't see at many schools.  Through all the socially awkward experiences it is a pretty vibrant place where you will grow professionally as well as academically into someone you could have never imagined.

If you are a minority, look into multicultural orgs. They helped me transition a lot. 
PS: Do a co-op. The soft skills you will learn will be invaluable."
Sophomore,5,Amazing school full of inspiring entrepreneurs! You will get challenged and learn a whole lot here. Almost every tech company goes here for students. The best way to descibe the acedemics here is that it creates blue collor students in a white collor environment.
Graduate Student,5,"A thriving community and home, Rensselaer is a fantastic place to earn a college degree. Campus life is virbrant and rewarding. RPI fills current students and graduate alike with a sense of pride and fulfillment, well worth the commitment of your education."
Sophomore,5,"I just finished my sophomore year and I have to say that I love RPI so much. The professors are honestly what make it the best and the advisers. The classes are very small compared to many other universities and there are so many people you can talk to for help. I've struggled personally with school while here, but there's always been someone here to help me do better. Granted, I have to say even if you come into RPI with a 2400 on your SAT you're still going to struggle. I came in with a 2380 and I'm very far from a perfect student. Companies know that though and respect that Rensselaer brand image greatly. People just knowing you attended this school offer you jobs."
Senior,5,"The campus is really nice and so are the people. Rock hard academics, but it's worth it in the end. Many people claim the social life is a drag, but most of those people are the ones that don't leave their rooms in the first place. There's usually a lot going on whether it be parties, campus events, concerts, or things clubs are doing in the local community."
Sophomore,5,"Rensselaer is a phenomenal school. The professors in the Information Technology program are experts in their field and the research being done with corporate sponsors like IBM, Google, etc. is amazing. I've had a great time so far and taken a lot of interesting classes in all my subject areas. I was especially impressed by the journalism and communications department. Overall, if you want to have a great chance at getting internships and jobs in the future in a relatively noncompetitive environment, RPI is a great place to go to school. Granted, it can be very hard at times, but if you're admitted you can accomplish anything as long as you work very hard. Research positions are relatively easy to get even as a freshman. Professors train students and start them right away."
Freshman,5,"Most people don't even know, but RPI has a very good social and academic balance. The work can be overwhelming and there can be a lot of sleepless nights, but overall the weekends are really fun. Great professors, dorms, and high quality of education and students.

The only thing I'd complain about is the food. Sodexo kinda sucks, but it's gotten a lot better since the beginning of the year."
Sophomore,5,"I've had a great time at Rensselaer so far. I've been heavily involved in Rensselaer's student-run union as well as student government. Students have a great say in what happens on campus, which is great. The academics, overall, are also amazing and comparable to what you would find at other top-tier universities for STEM. The business school is also great as well! Third best in New York, and top 50 in the country!"
Alum,5,"If you are into a STEM oriented education, RPI is for you! If you graduated at the top of your class in high school, be prepared to be average because everyone else did too. This makes Rensselaer a competitive place but you will find friends that will last well after graduation. The curriculum is highly structured so don't expect to have many electives. This does assure that when you graduate you will have the knowledge and thoroughness that are expected of an RPI grad."
Junior,5,"The only thing I really have to complain about is the food, but Sodexo supplies to must colleges (aka no matter where you go you're getting bad overpriced food). Besides that, it's a great college with a beautiful campus and so far has exceeded all my expectations."
Alum,5,"Rensselaer gave me a fabulous education that allowed me to come out of college making over 100k at a large corporation and quickly move up into the ranks of management.  Overall, RPI is top tier school with a strong, large, and influential alumni base which is changing the world on a day to day basis. It's a shame this school doesn't get as much attention as it deserves, but this has been slowly changing."
Junior,5,The day I got into RPI was the happiest day of my entire life. I never regret a second of the time I have spent here and am looking forward to finishing my last year and enrolling in law school.
Senior,5,"Greek Life is a great part of campus life that is usually overlooked. At RPI, fraternities and sororities are very different than at state schools and, for the most part, really are just functional groups of students that go out on the weekends. Being a member of a sorority,  I never felt pressured to do drugs and had a very supportive group of people that helped me do well over the last four years. My future employer is now actually a graduate of my sorority, funny how things work."
Sophomore,5,"So far, I have absolutely loved my time at RPI. It was a bit of an adjustment coming from a major city, but Troy is nice and there are many opportunities to interact with other students on RPI's campus. Surprisingly, Troy's night life is much more active than Albany and the town has changed a lot (for the better) even in the time that I have been here.  It is really evolving into a tech-hub and college town. As for RPI, the school is great. I love my professors and have had an amazing opportunity interacting with graduate and doctoral researchers. My adviser easily has 200 publications and was very willing to income me in their recent research endeavors. RPI, for some departments, is very small and has a certain community to it that I wouldn't have gotten at larger university. Granted, in some larger majors like MANE or CS, you will have much larger courses until your sophomore year, but they then become much much smaller."
Sophomore,5,"RPI is a great school.  It is hard, particularly engineering, but well worth it.  No grade inflation here. Really prepares you."
Graduate Student,5,Beautiful campus and great professors. Sometimes you feel kind of dumb compared to your peers and school is really hard but for the most part things are great here. It was pretty easy getting acclimated as a graduate student coming from another college. It is easy to get into parties if you know people in frats and the research is good.
Junior,5,"Seeing as though there have been some bad comments I personally disagree with, I'm going to respond in this review.
Food: It's alright, but very expensive - not unlike at other private universities though. Don't expect much from any college meal plan.
Admin: Student-administrative conflict is pretty common at most schools. I don't see how they're destroying student life though. This really is a tertiary issue that most people just blow off since it really doesn't mean very much.
Cost: Why come to RPI if you can't afford it? That's your own fault lol. If you 'pay' a fortune to come, there's a reason - your parents can afford it... don't complain if that's a case since you didn't have to enroll if it was that much.
Professors: I personally only disliked one of my professors. Just be careful when choosing classes and you'll always have good professors. There are good and bad ones but for the most part they're passionate about what they're doing and teach very well."
Sophomore,5,Very intellectually and ethnically diverse campus that lets you explore your interests through the versatile and rigorous curriculum offered at RPI. My brother goes to Cornell and I would say that I would have chosen RPI over Cornell knowing what I know today considering how much more RPI is dedicated to undegraduate teaching and learning. Amazing professors and small classes that really engage students. I absolutely love it here and the community surrounding RPI in Troy is actually a lot LOT nicer than it seems. A lot of nifty shops and places to go on the weekends and hang out if you're willing to take the walk down the approach.
Senior,5,I personally loved studying here and have had a really fun and memorable experience. I wouldn't have made it into grad school if it wasn't for my time at RPI.
Junior,5,"The Student Union of RPI gives students an unparalleled opportunity to manage a budget of over $8 million and represent the interests of the students. Students at RPI are very well aware of what is happening on campus and basically everything (clubs, ECs, etc.) are all completely student run. This is probably the most unique thing about RPI, aside from the amazing undergraduate education (which is also very rigorous) and the undergraduate research program which is much more extensive than at many peer schools."
Alum,5,"Amazing faculty and opportunities, I had multiple publications from an undergraduate research lab and professors that really supported me to get into a great career."
Sophomore,5,"Phenomenal yet underrated CS program with a plethora of different companies hiring (mainly from the Fortune 500) and very high starting salaries. The average grade made 94k last year after graduating. It's really hard, but once you get through it's all worth it. Besides that, RPI is a great place to go to school. I've had a lot of fun here and met some really great people."
Freshman,5,"My decision to come to RPI was definitely one I don't regret. The curriculum is very rigorous and keeps me on my toes, but I have also met such amazing people and professors it's insane."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love coming to school here every day. So many opportunities to engage in ECs with social life revolving around the uniquely student-run Union, D1 hockey, and Greek Life. Great place to study undergrad engineering or science. Business majors also fare well, and the HASS program is oddly rigorous - just like the rest of the school. It's all worth it though when you graduate."
Niche User,5,Visited campus today and was very impressed by the willingness of the study body to engage with potential applicants.
Freshman,5,"I live in Quad this semester and I have to say that the campus is drop dead gorgeous. I'm very happy with my dorm and the living situation in general. The food is pretty average, but that's basically my only complaint. The professors are amazing and really focus on educating students. The student body is also very diverse intellectually and geographically. I kinda wish there were more liberal arts courses, but hey it's a predominantly STEM school. What is offered through is great. I completely undervalued the humanities, arts, and social sciences departments but the courses ended up being rigorous and stimulating regardless."
Niche User,5,"My brother goes here and seems to enjoy it a lot. He says it's hard and I really want to come when I'm older. His biggest complaints seem to be the hard work and difficult classes, but besides that everything seems fine. He talks a lot about Greek Life and says that's very good at RPI as long as you can balance it with school."
Sophomore,5,"I've absolutely loved my time here so far. I'm home now for winter break and I already miss RPI. It's definitely very challenging and difficult to do well, but in the end it's all worth the doors RPI will open with potential employers, etc."
Junior,4,"The education is as rigorous as it is known for. On top of that, the professors are truly experts in their field, and given the time to work with them one-on-one, any hard-working individual will become an expert them-self. RPIs biggest weaknesses come from the administration, and if you can overlook some restricted parts of the college experience the education is rigorous and worth it. The number of employers who come to Rensselaer is astounding, and I personally know numerous graduates who had jobs lined up more than six months out from graduation. The other big issue is the area. Troy is notorious for crime and while it's getting better and has been for the last decade, we still get numerous notifications about crime in Troy. That being said, campus itself is generally safe, but walking off campus is risky, even during the daytime."
Sophomore,4,"Most professors adapted online classes well. I'm convinced a few did not understand what an online class is, but for the most part professors were understanding."
Sophomore,4,"The best part is the professors. Many of them truly care about the student's and want them to suceed. The classes are challenging, but not needlessly so. Plenty of opportunities for jobs."
Sophomore,4,"RPI offers rigorous education and lots of resources to help you succeed in academics. There are a lot of opportunities to get involved in campus, like clubs and organizations. The administration isn't great though. There are a lot of things the students don't like about them, such as trying to get rid of Greek Life and useless policies."
Sophomore,4,Due to the current global pandemic the school has switched to a hybrid schedule for the upcoming fall and spring. Online courses felt the same as taking the courses in person. Many of the courses already post lectures and all information online so the only thing to change was having in person interaction.
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed the classes and the campus environment. There was plenty of opportunities for me to interact with my fellow students and teachers for classes and extracurricular activities and teachers were always to offer help to any student in need. I dislike the surrounding area which is rather bleak but that being said there's still plenty to do on campus. The biggest thing I would like changed would for the administration to listen more to the student body's opinions.
Niche User,4,"RPI is an amazing college where you can find a multitude of different people pursuing interests and degrees in a variety of fields and areas. The professors at RPI are inspiring and truly love what they do. The only concern I have about RPI is their food - it isn't the best - but it's decent. The dorms are also kept very clean. The only problem is that as a freshman, there is only one building that has access to air conditioning. All the other buildings do not, so if you're an incoming freshman, I advise you to bring a fan."
Freshman,4,"A pretty dull and mundane appearance but the people there are nice and chill, mostly chill nerds. There are a lot of resources available at our fingertips. Frankly, the coursework is hefty and thankfully students are provided with lots and lots of extra help."
Sophomore,4,"I'm enjoying my time at RPI very much thus far. It's extremely challenging and fulfilling, and despite the stereotype of engineers being antisocial, I have a great network of friends and am plenty social. My biggest concerns about RPI are the costs of attending and the location. Troy is known as a city with a lot of crime, but it is on the way up, and those issues are becoming less prominent. Overall, I feel safe at RPI, but my experience is not the same as everyone's, I'm sure. Secondly, the cost of attendance is very high. It's scary to think about the amount of money I'm putting into this and the risk should do poorly. However, RPI's return on investment is excellent, so my concerns are continually lessened. Overall, I love being at RPI and would recommend it to anyone who can handle the workload."
Sophomore,4,"I am a Games Simulation Arts and Sciences student.  Professors for this major are great and very helpful.  Administrators are good to work with and want to see students succeed.  Campus food is good.  Lots of choices.  I use to live on campus Freshman year, but it wasn't for me, so I live at home now and commute.  I definitely get my cardio in while walking to and from classes.  Troy is a great city, too."
Freshman,4,"Honestly, I’ve truly enjoyed my time here so far. This school is INCREDIBLY difficult to do well in with regards to grades, and if you can’t manage time effectively you will either flunk out or lose your social life entirely. Luckily, most students accepted here have learned these skills, and can practice them here. The professors do generally care about the class and the students, but this doesn’t make their grading any easier. Despite the difficulty, it absolutely feels worth it to go here. If you put yourself out there, having a social life is no issue, and the hardest part is making sure you can balance the workload and social aspect of school, but this is very similar to what everyone faces in the real world, so this is good practice. Additionally, you’re going to make fat stacks if you’re a good student and go here, so as long as you come in with some good scholarships you should have a manageable amount of student debt after your time here."
Alum,4,"Great academic coursework and opportunities for growth. Career services are good as well and networking is great. Not necessarily the best atmosphere for racial, gender, and sexual minorities."
Freshman,4,"As a new member of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, I had not yet experienced life in the school. However, I can say for certain is that my impression on RPI during the Student Orientation was relatively positive."
Freshman,4,"I like the people at this school more than anything. Everyone is welcoming and willing to help others. Academics are tough here, so you need to put a lot of time into studying."
Sophomore,4,"I like that the professors and TAs are very responsive in the Computer Science department.  Entertaining and informative.

Some of the buildings are not well air conditioned.  Long walks to get to places."
Freshman,4,"The party scene is trash cause of shirley, classes are hard af but if you like a challenge it isn't all bad. You feel dumb quite often here, but it's all in the hopes of getting a job immediately after college."
Sophomore,4,"The professors care about you and they know what they are talking about. Since it is a tech-based school, everyone is nerdy and it might be hard to make friends and the social scene isn't that big."
Sophomore,4,Not many people don't get involved in fun things because the work load is overwhelming so student life isn't that great overall. The school has also gotten strict about frats and partying so parties aren't very big anymore. There are clubs to get involved in if you have the dedication or the free time. Most people go here for the academics and the hope that they'll get a high paying job in the future. The tuition is very expensive but I think it should be worth it if the school maintains its prestige.
Sophomore,4,"Difficult academics earn you a degree that will support your future aspirations. This school will support you mentally and academically to the best of their ability, and the payout is well worth it. The clubs are diverse as they are meaningful ranging from robotics to rocketry to learning Russian to Cinema. RPI's technological facilities are enormous as they are accessible- but be prepared to reach out yourself to use the school's resources. The food is beyond amazing, seriously, its awesome- but be ready to do a little hill climbing to access all of campus."
Sophomore,4,"Academics are good. My only complaint is the food. RPI itself is not really my thing, however, the architecture program is absolutely fantastic and I love it. Very intensive and rigorous but worth it in the end."
Junior,4,"The school is very challenging academically, but it's well worth it in the end. Most professors are very willing to help their students succeed. Something I do not like about the school is that much of your grades are dependent on the professor you get. This causes many students to drop or withdraw from classes to get a different, more experienced professor the next time around. Of course how much effort a student puts in will truly be what determines their grades, but getting specific professors for certain courses does make a difference. The food is decent. The dining hall food isn't great, but the food in the student union is delicious. The people are very friendly at RPI and everyone is very smart. Sports and clubs are very big at the school and there is something for everyone."
Junior,4,Rigorous academic program that provides good coursework and hands-on experience.  Some issues with administration and student life can make it unattractive to prospective students.
Sophomore,4,"RPI is an academically challenging school where students learn to balance both work and leisure, offering many intramural activities, clubs and a rather large greek life scene.  Overall students looking to develop themselves into ideal job candidates while still managing to enjoy their college experience should look to rensselaer."
Niche User,4,"Rensselaer is a great school, don't get me wrong, but it is waaaaayyyy too expensive. At $71,000 per year with an inflation rate of about $2,000 per year, it is more expensive than even Ivy League schools. Now that being said, if you are into music, you are nerdy, and you like video games, then this school is for you!"
Freshman,4,"I am currently a second semester Freshman pledging a fraternity.  RPI generally gets a very poor reputation for student life.  While the social experience isn't necessarily going to come looking for you, it is definitely there.  I thought about transferring this upcoming year because of money issues and the reasons I didn't were RPI's reputation in Computer Science and the social life I currently have.  I am having a lot more fun at RPI than most people expect.  I'm always doing something on the weekends whether it be with friends or brothers.  Classes are definitely hard, but they pay off."
Freshman,4,"The classes offered here are very challenging and will definitely help you learn how to manage your time and work hard. If you want a college that is academically-inclined, this is one of the best ones in the country for engineering and computer science majors. However, if you're looking for a college with more of a social scene, don't come here. There is absolutely nothing to do here, unless you join a fraternity."
Freshman,4,"I’m a freshman this year and overall I really like RPI. Students are willing to help each other out and the atmosphere is very relaxed, something my friends at other polytechnic schools don’t see on their campus. Classes are challenging but professors and TA’s are more than willing to meet with you and give you the extra help you need. The school has a special mentoring program in place for students in the basic introductory math and science classes. These sessions are similar to a recitation but are smaller and more individualized. My mentor made us study guides for exams and held office hours. The school has a wide range of people going from students who are athletes to those who are avid gamers, there’s a place for everyone to fit in."
Sophomore,4,I cherish the fact that RPI is an extremely challenging institute. RPI has taught me how to manage and become an individual outside my home. I would like to see more diversity on campus and a more aesthetic community.
Freshman,4,Its a really hard school but will definitely be worth it at the end based on its alumni. Not really big party school but University at Albany is 20 min away.
Graduate Student,4,"The campus was amazing, the look and feel of the school was very intriguing. The student life seem very nice given the large amount of clubs and activities offered by the school."
Alum,4,I enjoyed my time here. It was academically rigorous and there were plenty of opportunities for research! It is a nerdy school with over half the student population being engineering majors though.
Sophomore,4,A lot of difficult coursework but you really get to see the limits to your academic ability. The social life is here but you need to find your own little pocket to fit into. Rensselaer is what you put into it. You can have a terrible time if you don't mix school work with free time. I've met some very incredible people that I would not have if I went somewhere else.
Niche User,4,Very good school for STEM majors. Rich in history and a recognizable name in the STEM field. Troy is a nice town with other colleges close by in Albany and Schenectady. The campus offers a good variety of activities for students.
Freshman,4,For my orientation it was something totally different from ny old daily life but its worth it one of the too academic schools in the country and has people for all around the country and the world. I loved it there and i can not wait to start. All though he classes will be very challenging it opens up the doors to a very comfortable life.
Junior,4,"There's things to be improved, but overall is a wonderful school. If you want to find things to do, you have to put yourself out there - there's hundreds of clubs and groups people can be involved in. You get as much as you put into the school - if you work hard, play hard, you will do wonders. This school is no walk in the park, and is very challenging academically - for some, when they arrive, for others, when they get into more specific classes for their majors. It's a good place to consider."
Sophomore,4,This school has great academics that will definitely challenge the best of students. I met some of the greatest people here and now they are my closest friends. There are a lot of clubs to get involved in and something for everyone. Classes are difficult but if you schedule your time it is manageable.
Sophomore,4,"Good School, they do have housing issues. They require you to have housing on-campus for freshman and sophomore year, but this year they ran out of on-campus housing and decided to cram everybody onto a waitlist."
Sophomore,4,I have had an excellent experience with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute thus far. Their system for new students is pretty rigid but they have a lot to offer for student life. I've had lots of great professors. The main draw back is the tuition costs.
Junior,4,"Great employment opportunities, that's why I decided to come here.  Staff and professors are not always the friendliest.  Some of the facilities can be very old.  Very expensive school as well."
Junior,4,"Academic life is challenging, the social scene is decent but it might be a bit difficult to find a clique. Most professors know what they're teaching but for intro courses, there's a few that are really bad."
Sophomore,4,"This school works extremely hard to make sure that each student is well taken care of. Whether that means academically or personally, the professors and staff are very helpful in any situation that you need help with.  The campus is really pretty and has an amazing view of the town."
Junior,4,"Rensselaer is a very good school that provides an amazing variety of opportunities for students no matter the interest. From building racecars to different performance groups. There is a club or organization for anything. And if it doesn't exist, the school is very supportive of creating a new one. RPI prepares its student very well for work after school. The work is not easy, but that's what makes it worth it at the end."
College Freshman,4,The average salaries for rpi graduates is insanely high
College Freshman,4,"The courses are mostly high quality, and don't have unreasonable amounts of work."
College Freshman,4,"I have had nearly no problems so far on campus, and there are buttons all over the place to alert authorities immediately"
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of opportunities to have fun and learn cool things.
College Junior,4,The really like hockey at this school and the other sports fall to the wayside
College Junior,4,"I enjoy it a lot, I have been able to explore my interest efficiently."
College Sophomore,4,"I lived in a suite and it was great! We had our own kitchen, bathroom and living space. The hardest parts would be cost for post-freshman housing and the age of the buildings, most of which were built a very long time ago."
College Sophomore,4,"This school is academically rigorous. The professors are all generally passionate about what they are teaching. There is a disconnect, however, between the administration and the students' needs."
College Freshman,4,"The nightlife is decent. If you go out and make friends, you'll have a great time. I've personally never had an issue finding things to do. All you need to do is be outgoing."
College Freshman,4,"The party scene is what you make of it. There are some pretty fun parties here and then, but nothing crazy."
College Freshman,4,"RPI isn't the most diverse school in the world, but there are many people from many different backgrounds to engage with. The gender ratio has been getting better as well as diversity on campus, but there is still a lot more work to be done. People tend to be super accepting of their peers."
College Junior,4,"Courses are challenging and give a decent amount of work outside of class. If you get behind, you will struggle, but otherwise as long as you keep up with the work it isn't bad. The professors that I have had also seem very approachable, especially for the more intro level courses."
College Junior,4,"I only stayed in an on campus dorm freshman year. Everyone on the floor was pretty friendly towards each other, and I know plenty of people that met their best friends because they were on the same floor."
College Sophomore,4,"Drugs are out there, just like they are anywhere in the world. Just be smart and stay away from the wrong people."
College Sophomore,4,The Health & Safety department does an adequate job.
College Sophomore,4,"The dormitory rooms are just about what you would expect. Single, double, and triple rooms are offered at slightly high prices. They provide you adequate space for your belongings and for your personal comfort. The community bathrooms (shared by an entire hallway) are cleaned every morning while suite bathrooms (shared by two rooms) are cleaned once per week. The Resident Assistants do a great job of organizing activities for your hallway and entire dorm to promote some level of social activity. 

Most of the freshman hill dorms (except for Barton, which is relatively new) could use a touch of renovation. However, the buildings are still in fine condition and serve as good living spaces. Freshman hill is also very close to the academic buildings on campus. No student should have to walk more than 10 minutes to a class."
College Sophomore,4,The facilities located at the East Campus Athletic Village (ECAV) were constructed very recently. The facilities are very nice but are primarily used by varsity athletes. The basketball court is used for intramural basketball and volleyball at night. There are also two large turf fields that are frequently used for intramural soccer.
College Junior,4,The school helps a lot with your career afterwards.
Alum,2,Online learning systems were full of glitches and difficult to use; many professors did not utilize any online learning tools.
Alum,2,"Academics were rigorous, but there was little support for students from teachers. Overall a bleak college experience."
Sophomore,2,"The online learning experience wasn't that great. We are paying full tuition, but learning online at RPI is the same education as anywhere else."
Sophomore,2,"All of my classes are online for Fall 2020, but the tuition remains the same, if more. This is incredibly unfair to students that can barely afford it to just sit on a laptop and not get the same educational experience."
Sophomore,2,"Some of my professors refused to accommodate for the timezone difference which greatly affected my work. Also one of the administrators or whatever thinks that students should sacrifice their sleep if they want good grades. So if you have to wake up at 2 am to take a class, you should do that because all that matters is education."
Freshman,2,"Academically sound school, though the administration cares nothing about the students but their money, and you'll be hanging around a lot of the same type of kids —from New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont, Long Island, and NYC. 

     If you come from a multi-cultural background or from a very one of a kind up bringing as I did, you might have trouble relating to and forming relationships with people.

     My advice is to most of all place your social and physical well-being above your academic pursuits, because there is no use in being at an environment you cannot thrive in —it's hard."
Sophomore,2,Professors are nice but lazy. The courses are of very low quality. Compared to some schools where profs recorded very nice videos and uploaded them... this school is absolutely beaten. RPI has NO previous online teaching experiences. This makes the experience not only awkward but not valuable at all.
Freshman,2,My first year experience at Rensselaer was not too bad. The weather is atrocious and takes some getting used to. The people here are fairly nice however but the school's work load put on the students is very high. This school is very challenging especially being a student athlete. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is most definitely not a school for everybody.  Every person here has a different experience at the school. Most people say that freshman year is always the worst because of the adjustment so hopefully my remaining years here will be a smoother ride. I do not like how athletes do not get better dorms or at least the first pick on dorms on campus.
Freshman,2,"Rensselaer is a great school, for the first month. Teachers rush work in like maniacs and some get angry when you don't understand. Looking back at my first year I think I've made a mistake choosing to go here. If you are trying to join any sort of Greek life in college DO NOT ATTEND. The school is doing all that they can to shut down Greek life in RPI, AND shutdown the STUDENT BODY. The food is HORRIBLE!! overall I would rate it 4/10, they cant even make mac and cheese correctly. Not to mention dorms, crammed dirty and terrible beds. Way too many people trying to be the coolest of the group and overall Troy NY is not the best place to live if you're the adventurous type. 
RPI IS OVERPRICED, WILL CRUSH YOUR COLLEGE EXPECTATIONS."
Freshman,2,"Being an international student here is hard. As a Chinese student who have friends on both sides, I'll say the gap between the majority student body and international students is huge. If I walk into a classroom not knowing anyone, people will just assume that I don't speak English and they will all gather in their own ethic groups around the room. You can't blame them, because people like people who like them, but sometimes the blatant racism is just overwhelming. I've encountered a few occasions myself, whether is people yelling 'Ch**gch**g ' or talking about Chinese people in general in a demeaning tone loudly in public (this happens on daily basis),  and it's heartbreaking to see all this happening yet you can do nothing about it.  

People seem to forget that earth is just a planet full of people; we all have the same desires and feelings on so many levels, and yes l feel awful when people are trying to dehumanize me."
Freshman,2,"The environment of RPI is anything but warm and welcoming. Many of the students here are so self-righteous and were used to being the top of their class and will go out of their way to tell you how much better they are than you. If you're not an engineering major it's even worse. The engineering students (about 70% of the total students) are so degrading to non-engineering students it's disgusting. Obviously there are some engineering students who are great, but most aren't . If you are not planning on being an engineer I would highly suggest looking elsewhere because a lot of other schools have a lot better programs than RPI does. Yeah it may be a great engineering school, but not really an anything else school. Take it from me, this place is not worth the hassle or the 70k it costs to be here."
College Senior,2,"Athletics are certainly not the spotlight at RPI. Most of the varsity teams participate on the third division league with the exception of the ice hockey team which plays on the first division. That being said, hockey games are pretty exciting and usually packed. Hockey is the highlight of RPI athletics and the only sport that really seems to matter in terms of promotion and attendance. Hockey games require an entrance fee ($5 for students). Additionally, club sports are encouraged and do fairly well considering the pool of athletic students that attend an engineering school like RPI. The fitness facilities available for student-athletes are numerous and up to date and even those facilities available for regular students are kept clean have a good amount of equipment."
College Sophomore,2,"In terms of ethnicity, there is not much diversity here. Most students are Caucasian, with a large number of international Asian students. African Americans, Indian, Hispanic, and Asian-Americans do not make up a huge presence on campus, but there are still an adequate number of minorities. Many of these ethnic groups have clubs (CASA, NSBE, SHPE, SASE, ISA) where students of the same ethnic groups can get to know one another. Religious diversity is not that noticeable and no one will judge you on what you believe in. As for the LGBTQ, it does not make any difference what your sexual orientation is, everyone is very accepting."
College Sophomore,2,"This school is not the most diverse even though they claim to be. There are few black and African American students. There are even LESS Hispanics. The school is predominantly white males, white females, and international Asian students who do NOT associate themselves with the American students AT ALL."
College Sophomore,2,"I liked the location of my dorm just for the fact of being close to all the other buildings I needed to get to such as classes, food and the ECAV building."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms are pretty awful with the exception of like 4. For freshmen dorms, try to get into Barton. For sophomores, try to get into Stack, RAHPS, or Sharp. Juniors and seniors should definitely live off campus. Most of the dorms are very outdated, have issues with hot water, have crazy amounts of fire alarms, and no air conditioning. The pricing is absolutely absurd, but then again the whole school is ridiculously over priced. The only thing that makes all of it worth it is the  fact that you're receiving a high quality education and will get an awesome job at the end."
College Sophomore,2,"Our athletics are not very good. The most attended events are by far the hockey games, which are fun to watch even though we aren't an outstanding team. Many of the athletes feel they are better than non-athletes and deserve special treatment. The athletic facilities are quite good, especially the football stadium and the weight room for the athletes."
College Freshman,2,"Terrible.  Minimal choices, same things over and over again.  Either tasteless or gross."
College Freshman,2,I say bad because the surrounding streets off of RPI are very dangerous and the properties are clearly neglected. But the amount of money being saved is worth it all.
College Freshman,2,There isn't a lot to walk to from campus. Troy has some shops and the farmer's market is good when the weather is nice.
College Freshman,2,It starts out okay but by the end of the year the food sucks ass
College Freshman,2,A lot of kids feel they need to let off steam since classes are so stressful.
College Freshman,2,It seems like they only care about how many times they can drink each week
College Freshman,2,Very cold and unpredictable.  Shirley's weather machine will be the death of us all.
College Freshman,2,"As a girl, I am in the minority and yet I still cannot meet guys.  Anyone I think is attractive is either already taken or not looking for a relationship.  All other guys are too afraid to approach women (most won't even leave their rooms)."
College Sophomore,2,"The athletes are hardly even students. The hockey team is good, and that's it."
College Sophomore,2,"The health center is adequate and quite convenient. RPI itself is safe, but as I said earlier, Troy is a hotbed of violent crime."
College Sophomore,2,"You go to fraternity parties until you absolutely can't stand them anymore, then you sit home on weekends and play with yourself."
College Freshman,2,Basically it's winter from November to April... But the grounds crew is great at clearing snow and ice.
College Freshman,2,Over 60 percent of the student population is Asian or white.
College Freshman,2,"there is little to no school spirit and the kids here would rather stay in and play video games than go out and have fun. It seems like most kids are here for the same reasons: the engineering reputation, research opportunities and the valuable degree. "
College Freshman,2,hockey games are big but other than that there isnt rally any local atmosphere. People just want to get their degrees and leave.
College Junior,2,"The Electronic Arts major is very small at RPI, and still growing. At present, it lacks its own independent advisor, or even an advisor decently familiar with the program itself. The professors are brilliant, and the courses are worth taking, but hardly anyone in campus even knows that RPI has an arts major at all. The major itself is also undergoing a revamp in requirements. This is not an art school."
College Freshman,2,The Snow is rough getting to classes
College Sophomore,2,Ethnicity is not that diverse. The number of international students is exponentially growing. And I believe most of the students (or at least I met) are atheists.
College Sophomore,2,"Buildings are almost 200 years old, so people prefer newer building even though they are generally further from campus. It is very expensive to live on campus."
College Sophomore,2,The only sport anyone really pays attention to at RPI is hockey. Every other sport is really only there for the people that play them.
College Junior,2,"Muggings are, sadly, a more regular occurrence than I would like. There are areas around campus that you should avoid going to alone at night. As much as possible, go with a buddy, or use the campus shuttles. Over breaks, be sure to keep all doors and windows locked tightly (you probably should keep everything locked all the time). I try to stick to these rules, and I generally feel pretty safe Caution is a must.  The campus police are pretty good, they are available 24-7 and will give you a ride to your dorm if it's late at night."
College Junior,2,"Greek life is very limited at RPI. It plays a very small role at the school, and very few people join, or are even interested in it. They will throw parties, which are fun if you are into that stuff. But, if you (like me) just aren't into that, its not a big deal if you don't go to any of them. I'd recommend visiting the houses during Rush (which takes place over the course of a few weeks) for the free food (and often fun events)."
College Freshman,2,The walls are made of tissue paper which means I can hear everything my neighbors do or say which is seriously awkward. Also there are way too many forced triples for freshmen. There are not a lot of singles on campus which sucks. Most of the dorms don't have elevators and are very unfriendly to the handicapped.
College Junior,2,"some good study abroad opportunities, although for some majors you have to pay RPI's tuition plus the other school's tuition  and room and board for that semester..."
College Junior,2,"There is a decent blue light system, but I have almost been run over by public safety while crossing crosswalks with the walk light on about 5 times. Pub safe cares more about pretending to be cops than watching out for safety."
College Junior,2,The gym is pretty good but usually crowded. You pretty much have to join greek life to have a good social life.
College Junior,2,The dining hall food is not great and for the first 2 years you are required to live on campus and have a meal plan which is way overpriced. You can use flex dollars from your plan at a few places around campus including the student union which has really good food so I recommend checking that out.
College Sophomore,2,"It rains a lot in the fall and spring, and snows just enough in winter to make going to classes slushy, but not beautiful and snow coated. Winter is long, windy, and grey. This leads a lot of students to exhibit symptoms similar to SAD. When it's sunny, things are beautiful, but that just doesn't happen often enough during the majority of the school year. Classes are also rarely canceled due to weather, which is a pain."
College Sophomore,2,"The off campus dining options are pretty much what you'd expect in a college town - pizza, Chinese, and Mexican. To be fair, they're all relatively cheap, which is great on a student budget, but can grow repetitive after a while. The Mexican place that is right off campus actually takes Flex dollars (a form of money that can only be used on food vendors on campus, comes as part of the meal plan) which is convenient if you like Mexican food. Otherwise...not the best food choices to substitute going to the dining hall."
College Sophomore,2,Financial Aid gets shifty after your freshmen year.  They try to convince you it won't be that expensive but then after you have been here a year they take away all your money...They are also really mean.
College Junior,2,"Laptops Are Not Good. all the students mostly have the same laptop that are issued by the school. I've had a lot of problems with mine physically breaking, parts have fallen off and the hinges keep breaking. Also they can get really slow and you can always go to the computer center but it usually takes forever to fix anything."
College Senior,2,"The weather at RPI is mostly cloudy...all of the time. Therefore, the weather is not one of the popular topics among students to discuss."
College Sophomore,2,"High Cost. At RPI, freshman aren't technically even allowed to drive, though this generally isn't a problem as dorms are, at the furthest, a ten minute walk. Permit costs are ridiculous, and the fines are even worse. Though the need for a car is minimal, due to a good shuttle system as well as local buses."
College Freshman,2,"Troy, NY – On campus there are not very many options, but if you're bold enough to travel into downtown Troy there are tons of small cafes and restaurants that are delicious. Latham isn't too awful either if you can drive 10 minutes away."
College Sophomore,2,"Dining halls are at first seen as a blessing to incoming students, due to the fact that once you're inside you can eat whatever you want. The catch, that you realize once student baiting season is over, is the selection. The institute's entire food supply is all but monopolized by Sodexo, formerly recognized as a prison food supplier, and currently recognized as ""that half-frozen flavorless pile under the heat lamps.""

Most students are able to withstand Sodexo for approximately 7 months, though the institute expects you to last the full length of the 2 year mandatory meal plan. Particularly enlightened students will invest their hunger in the food sold at the student union, which provides everything from Indian to Mexican to subs and ice cream. Restaurants near campus such as Big Apple Pizzeria and Moe's are also a good solution to the dining hall conundrum, and will accept your meal plan money. Unfortunately, any better food can only be found downtown."
College Junior,2,"Troy weather is not particularly enjoyable and can be depressing. I nice sunny day might happen once a week, but rarely. I am usually not that picky about weather and even enjoy the cold, snow, or summer rain. Troy is just cold and rainy."
College Freshman,2,"Unless you have a car with you, it is unwise to venture off campus at all. You may get stabbed or mugged."
College Freshman,2,"The laptops that the school requires are great and the computing center is very helpful if you have problems. However, good luck finding a working printer/copier/scanner when you need one. The campus computers are a bit outdated and can be extremely slow. Other than the laptops, the computers suck."
College Student,2,Everything in troy goes dead after 6. Since I am a architecure major things get really quiet realy quickly.
College Junior,2,"Overcast and Cold – Towards the end of October throughout until April, the Campus is riddled with overcast conditions, and freezing temperatures and consistent windiness in every direction along with frequent precipitation."
College Junior,2,"City Streets Have Their Codes – Parking is difficult on campus, especially  on streets shared with staff, and Troy resident. Designated parking lots are inconvenient in terms of distance and require permits. Other, farther lots can be accessed but may require RPI shuttle transport to get into the main campus."
College Junior,2,"A Burned Out City – Troy, NY is by no means the most vibrant and diverse city for a college student. Touted as the ""Home of Uncle Sam,"" Troy is barely fueled by its constant overcast and weary residents. The restaurants in the region offer a decent quality and variety of cuisine. Attractions are limited to dining, bowling, and riverfront walks. Although the city of Albany is a 10 mile drive away, the lack of efficient public transport sets an unfortunate limit on travel."
College Junior,2,Nothing Much for Underage – If you are over 21 there are plenty of bars and places to go to but there is not a lot for under 21. There are frat parties but they are not that great
Sophomore,1,"As an international student: DO NOT CHOOSE THIS SCHOOL. My reasons:
1. It's true RPI is ok with academics. But tbh, ANY STEM school is like that. Doesn't really matter if it's RPI or some shits. In STEM it matters more about how good you ACTUALLY are, not where you went for school. If you wanna be good, you have to work hard WHEREVER you go.
2. If you're paying full tuition (which is common for internationals)... damn, go somewhere cheaper. Lots of public schools have much cheaper tuition rates.
3. Absolutely no reputation in Asia/Pacific... Go to bigger ones!
4. Some profs are racists. I'm saying it. There's this prof who told me it's so hard for white folks to identify Asians. 
5. Shitty food. Commons == $8 for shits. Restaurants == $20 for better-tasted shits.
6. Poor city. My Airbnb owner has a review that says he dealt with drugs. WTF?
7. Cringe, creepy, morbid. These are the best 3 words for me to describe *some* students there.

SO:
IF U EVER WANNA BE BETTER, DO NOT GO TO RPI!!"
Senior,1,"Awful professors, administration, and campus life. Absolutely not worth the fortune it costs to go here, especially since the administration seems to be trying to make student life as terrible as possible. Troy is a pretty garbage city, too. Not worth. Sodexo, the company that forces every student to purchase an over-priced meal plan, makes some of the worst 'food' on the planet. 'Public Safety' doesn't care about students. The 'Health Center' doesn't care about students. I would give this terrible place 0 stars if I could. Only come here if you want to waste your money."
College Sophomore,1,"Troy is a dreary, run-down city with literally no attractions that don't include alcohol. It's also a hotbed of violent crime."
College Sophomore,1,"The sky is perpetually gray, the winter is endless, and the wind literally never stops."
College Sophomore,1,"The gender ratio is god awful. There are many international students, but the vast majority of them are from China and speak next to no English and thus do not interact with the population at large in any meaningful way. If you're an American, you're stuck with a bunch of white guys. Bottom line."
College Sophomore,1,"It's always gray, I never see the sun, and it is insanely cold"
College Sophomore,1,"The city it is in, Troy, is a sleepy town with nothing to do.  Albany is not close enough for casual visits"
College Sophomore,1,"After the first month or two, I got so sick of the dining hall food that I started buying a lot more of my own food or just not eating"
College Freshman,1,the food sucks. Fresman 15 is more like freshman 50 due to the lack of options. My tip would be to go greek and eat there every night you can. 
College Sophomore,1,Drugs are pretty visible (alcohols are more) at RPI. There are constantly random drug tests on campus during semesters.
College Sophomore,1,Very dangerous and nothing to do around here. It is going to be a very sad life living here after graduation.
College Sophomore,1,Public buses are free for RPI students with (swiping IDs). Shuttles are generally not on time but they go around pretty often.
College Sophomore,1,It is dangerous but it is cheaper than living on campus. Many people live together to save up the costs.
College Sophomore,1,The campus is on the hill so it is very windy and cold. Summer is nice because it is not that hot but winter is disastrous. There is no 'closed school due to weather' because RPI is a research school and it is not supposed to be closed for research results or lab experiments.
College Sophomore,1,Foods are very bad with almost no options to choose from. Always the same foods are offered.
College Sophomore,1,Parties are very poor. The only good thing for being a girl is that girls can get into any parties without almost any costs. It is hard for guys unless they have connections to frats or sororities.
College Sophomore,1,"Greeks at RPI are not as amazing as the greeks at other schools. RPI people are nerds, so there is no exception for greeks."
College Sophomore,1,"There is certainly a variety of people. There are a few amount of guys that are so into partying, absolutely not care about studying. A large portion of people at RPI is just nerds, very intelligent but lacking social skills. Most of the girls do not seem to care how they look, mostly dressing up very casually (Engineering labs require long pants).  "
College Sophomore,1,"I was not qualified to apply for financial aid since I am an international student.  Recently it was a hard time for me and my family financially, so I looked for some opportunities for financial aids but there were no open aids for international whatsoever."
College Sophomore,1,"RPI is expensive and the tuition is always going up. There aren't many financial aid opportunities. There's the RPI medal which is awarded in high school and work study. There's not much else in the way of financial aid. Most of the times you'll have to take out loans. The bursars office can also be a pain to deal with if they don't get your payments right on time and put a hold on your account. Unless you're very rich and your parents are going to pay for everything, you'll want to apply for scholarships and try to get work study, if you can."

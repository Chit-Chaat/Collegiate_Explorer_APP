Graduate Student,5,"great school, affordable and very convenient if you plan to study online. 
They do not secure preceptors however, which is the hardest thing to do in school in my honest opinion. Many students struggled with this issue."
Graduate Student,5,"I chose to study online, as I work full time and live in a different state than this school. It worked out well for me and I am graduating soon."
Senior,5,"Due to COVID, all classes have been transitioned to Online learning. Regis College and Regis North have stepped up their learning experiences without a single doubt. It is a new learning experience for all and faculty and staff has made the transition 10x smoother, better, and of course fun. It's a learning experience for all and they are not ashamed to acknowledge that and join us students for the ride!"
Senior,5,"Regis has been my home away from home. Although I don't live on campus the classes, students, faculty, and staff have been more than welcoming, helpful, understanding, and so much more. I am honestly extremely grateful to attend Regis College for the past couple of years, and I wouldn't have wanted it any other way."
Sophomore,5,"I took a few classes online, especially when the pandemic in America happened. Regis College has very well organized online classes, and it is very easy to learn with their resources."
Sophomore,5,I like the small classes that Regis offers. Small classes create more of an opportunity for stronger relationships between students and professors.
Sophomore,5,The classes are going well. The professors are very understanding and allow students to have extra time if needed. They use zoom which is pretty easy to use.
Sophomore,5,The online transition with Regis College wasn't difficult and all the services they offered on campus are still very much available. Daily Zoom meetings were held and everything was kept right on tract which I really appreciated.
Junior,5,Excellent college with great professors. Campus is modern. Student life is excellent with a variety of things to do around campus.
Graduate Student,5,Professors and staff are VERY connected to the students.  You are never far away from help!  Very supportive atmosphere both personally and academically
Sophomore,5,"Great School, with excellent professional professors. Academic year is very easy to follow. I really like the campus, its very safe and friendly!"
Niche User,5,Regis has been unbelievably helpful through my journey transferring in. I can't thank them enough for how smooth they have made this process ad how kind they have been answering my many questions.
Senior,5,"Being a senior in college, I believe I have made the most out of my time at Regis College. It is a very diverse school offering competitive sports which I was fortunate enough to take part in. Along with this there are a variety of clubs and associations to take part in, as well as a bunch of campus activities. Everyone from the students to staff is super friendly and it is such a nice little community to live in!"
Junior,5,"What is good about Regis College is that the school has excellent academic support with advising and tutoring. They provide excellent services to help you have a good college experience. The professors are really friendly and lieniant with their students and if you are having a hard time, there are multiple available resources such as academic coaching, tutoring, and advising. The clubs and activities here at Regis College are exciting. We have a large variety of clubs that expresses the value of diversity and brings us all together as a community."
Sophomore,5,"I like the way they treat people. At Regis college , everyone is treated with respect and our opinion matters. There is always someone there to help us, when we need help with homework, we have the tutoring center."
Junior,5,"After graduating from another school and attending Regis College to complete my degree, Regis has been very welcoming and has provided me with a great deal of guidance. I would like to become a PA in the future and Regis College has provided me with all the tools I will need to continue my career path. I am very grateful for the opportunities that have been presented to me in my time at Regis. I will also be able to complete requirements for my future career at Regis. The resources that Regis provides their students sets them up for success and ensures that their learning is a priority. The campus is very nice and even has a Dunkin'  Donuts on site.  They really care about your success, and they help you in every way they can. My experience at Regis has been amazing, and I am very thankful for the support they have provided me with."
Sophomore,5,What I love about Regis is the beautiful campus and the great amount of support I received from the school. This college has very friendly students and the perfessors do so well with teaching. The academic support center is truly amazing. Tutoring and academic coaching is excellent and I would recommend it to all students who are willing to succeed.
Freshman,5,Attending Regis makes me feel safe and provides a great learning environment. Professors really interact with you and help you stay on the right track and give you resources to help you achieve your goal.
Freshman,5,I like how you can connect with the professors and have one-on-one time with them if need be. They’re really nice and make sure you’re on the right track and aim to help you graduate! Everyone is very welcoming and it’s a great experience so far!!
Sophomore,5,Regis is an excellent academic institution. They have a great facilities and the people are wonderful. The environment is good and isn't have big campus but its beautiful. Very good institution that give to the student and excellent opportunity to complete a degree.
Niche User,5,"I love the feel of Regis College, it just feels like home. The student body and staff are so friendly. If i was to sneeze they would say God bless you, and open doors for others. this place is unlike other colleges i've seen."
Sophomore,5,I am a basketball player here at Regis College and I absolutely love it. The small little campus in Weston Mass is a perfect school for me. The only thing I would change about school would be the food! The class sizes are amazing the most I have is 14 and that's a lab. Less students mean more 1 on 1 time to ask professors any questions about the material or the lesson.
Freshman,5,"Regis has a very competitive nursing program that I am working towards in becoming apart of.  Academically, it was challenging however, the support system is incredible. Regis College has a center called the Academic Center for Excellence, where there are academic coaches, a writing center, and a center for mathematics and sciences. I took full advantage of all of those centers, and that was reflected in my grades. Regis is great with student to teacher ratio. An average class has about 20-30 students. I have a relationship with all of my teachers  and they all knew me personally, which I loved. Overall, I love Regis and recommend it for anyone who wants to pursue a nursing career. Everyone there is super supportive and will do anything in their power to make sure you succeed."
College Freshman,5,"You feel very safe at this school! There are watchers at the entrance from 6pm to 6am. There are emergency bottoms everywhere around campus, including several outside. The school is in a very rich town so it's very private and safe here."
College Freshman,5,Among my diverse group of classmates there are similarities in our motivation and drive to do well. We support and help each other so that we can all be successful and the professors want that for us. The staff is amazing here.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I loved AIC, the President takes the time to get to know everyone's name, and spend a lot of time in the quad getting to know all the students on campus, he even takes the time to get to know potential recruits for sports when they are visiting campus. The professors are helpful and are usually professionals. They do what they can to help you succeed. If you make a lot of friends, campus life will be great and there will be a lot to do in terms of campus parties, house parties, and getting off campus to the bars. Student Activities always has events going on. My overall experience at AIC was amazing. It is all what you make it and how many things you get involved in and take advantage of. The more outgoing you are the better your experience will be"
Recent Alumnus,5,"The majority of the campus is student athletes, which was great for me because I was a two sport scholarship athlete at AIC. The Athletes primarily stick together and support each other at their games. The fitness center at AIC isn't Top of the Line, but it has everything you need, plus a varsity weight room for team lifts which is great. There are two gyms which is AWSOME for scheduling practices and having efficient room to practice with your team. Both gyms are also big enough to get outdoor sports inside when the weather is too cold. However, the ice hockey team needs their own Ice Rink. Our turf field is one of the nicest in the conference, and probably in the area. The new athletics Director, Matt Johnson is going to do amazing things with the athletics program at AIC and I am excited to see all the amazing growth the Athletics at AIC make while under his leadership."
College Junior,5,We have such a strong presence of diversity
College Sophomore,5,These topics are very good and they really do relate to people on campus because these things do happen everywhere.
College Sophomore,5,We have one of the best nursing programs in the state and our NCLEX passing rates are excellent. This is due to having the core nursing classes done by the time clinical comes around. The workload can be overwhelming at times but in the end its worth the time and effort since the program is so amazing.
College Sophomore,5,Nursing means the world to me and being a part of Regis gives me that opportunity.
College Sophomore,5,The professors make it the best part because you feel comfortable learning with them and widening your knowledge 
College Senior,5,I would choose my school again because it is student centered. The small teacher to student ratio makes learning fun and easy. You always get feed back from professors and they know you by name. For a big school that would not be possible. 
College Sophomore,5,I love my school. Everyone here is very friendly and they treat everyone very fairly.
College Sophomore,5,"The professors tell you on the first day what is expected of the student. College isn't like High school, you have to work hard and put in the effort. If you go to class and you do your reading and homework, you will succeed. "
College Sophomore,5,"The nursing major is the most popular one on campus. It seems that everyone is trying to become a nurse. It is very competitive. Once you are in the program, you do have to work extremely hard. If you are responsible for another human beings life, you better have been paying attention in school. The standard are very high and it's because you are being trained on how to properly care for another human being."
College Sophomore,5,"If you play sports you are required to go to study hall for 2 hours every day. Our school organizes all kinds of fun things to do all the time. They have movie night at least twice a month on a huge projector screen. They throw dances and parties once a month on a Thursday, if you have Friday classes in the morning, I suggest you skip them. They are fun but you will not be able to wake up for your 8am class. We have a cafeteria and a like lounge downstairs that you could choose to eat at. The school organizes lots of fun activities like scavenger hunts, rally's, decorating pumpkins, and all sorts of contest which you could win awesome prizes like flat screen t.v's, drake tickets, celtics, bruins games and money."
College Sophomore,5,"There really doesn't seem to be a problem with drugs or alcohol on this campus. We had a great person come speak to all the students during orientation about drugs and alcohol. His name is Chris Herren. He was a basketball legend but he let drugs destroy his life, his basketball future and his dreams. He changed his life around and he gives speeches to people of the effects of drugs and alcohol. He shares his story with everyone so he can make a difference. He wants us to be aware of what drugs and alcohol do. He also gave us statistics about how many people are affected by it. If you have an alcoholic father or mother, then you are 40 times more likely to become a drug user or an alcoholic like your parent. The school had him come back and talk to just the athletes about drugs and alcohol again. The school brought in a smashed car and had to open the doors with the jaws of life. They did this for alcohol awareness. They wanted to show kids what happens if you drink and drive."
College Sophomore,5,"I have not done any internships. Since I am in the Nursing field, I have to do clinical's not internships. Clinical's are part of the nursing curriculum and the school helps you get into the different hospitals. Connections are everything these days. It helps when you go to nursing seminars and you network because that will help you out later on in life when you are looking for an internship, clinical or a job once you have successfully completed school."
College Sophomore,5,"I am very happy with choosing Nursing as my major. My career goal is to graduate from Regis College with my B.A degree in nursing. Regis College has a really great success rate on passing the NCLEX exam which you have to pass in the state of Massachusetts in order to receive your license to practice nursing in our state. My goal is to get a job in one of the top leading hospitals in the country; Boston Children's Hospital, Mass General or Brigham and Women's Hospital. I do not have any concerns about finding a job after I graduate because I know that once I start my clinicals in these hospitals, I will form a good relationship with my employers. I will work extra hard, put in a lot of effort and I am very confident that they will offer me a job! A lot of students from Regis College have told me that it has worked for them in the past and I am hoping that it will work for me as well. If that doesn't work, there are many opportunities for Regis College to help me find a job once I graduate and pass my NCLEX exam."
Sophomore,4,"I already knew coming to regis college would be a change of scenery, considering it was a catholic school and I'm not a religious person. Regis surprised me though, they welcome you with open arms no matter your culture, sexual orientation, religion, etc. The staff and students as a whole community do a really good job at involving everyone to get to know one another. I got to meat many different people who are across the world and learn about them sleves and how their countries are compared to ours. if students want a good sense of community, I would definetley tell them regis is the way to go. I enjoy my time there so far and many more to come."
Sophomore,4,"I guess because of the pandemic you can say I took an online class since. SO, my experience was not too bad, it was just the same in class but more boring I guess since I was home. It was not the same as having it on campus but it was not too bad to handle. Some of the work was a drag but I am glad I know what to expect when I sign up for online classes in the future."
Freshman,4,professors made themselves available to you when you needed help. They set up office hours outside of their normal ones to cater to you. They made sure that you understood the content
Sophomore,4,"The school is great. But it is very expensive and i just finished my first year and I am in 35,000 debt. I wish they gave out more money to students because it would really help."
Freshman,4,Great school to find who you are! It is a very small and close community. Has great academics. And very specific majors.
Sophomore,4,"Overall my experience with Regis College has been very good. The school has a small campus making it an easier learning experience since the classrooms are small. Everyone is supportive and they are always available to help with whatever you need. Its a small community but we are brought together whether its with sports, clubs, or any event that is held. If you want to feel more like a community and family while achieving your education goals then I defiantly recommend Regis College for you."
Freshman,4,"Has a great academic system, makes sure students have a more direct way to get into jobs by giving more direct majors."
Niche User,4,"I went on a college tour to Regis College and I loved how they had my major and that they contained a pre-vet program that I want to do. I also liked how they had a fire place lounge where you can relax and play video games. I also liked the swimming pool and the different types of sports which one of them they had that I want to play was Volleyball. I would like to change the diversity aspect of their college. When I went to visit I only saw four black women and mainly the whole school was white. Other than that I wouldn't change anything, the school is great, the cafeteria, and the people there are nice."
Junior,4,"I really like my professors from my major, they are very helpful and kind. I have made many great friends on camps that I am grateful for!"
Freshman,4,"Regis College is a great place to create a successful academic and social environment. The professors and advisors are willing to work with you to make your experience the best it can possibly be. The professors,staff and students believe in one another and strive for the success of everyone on campus, no matter how big or small that success may be. Overall, Regis is one of the greatest decisions you can make and you’ll never be alone on your journey to success."
Freshman,4,My experience so far in Regis has turned out better than I expected as I entered the college not knowing anyone I ended the semester with a group of friends that I am now very close with. I loved playing soccer at Regis which I was recruited for. The facilities that we have are very friendly and open to everyone which is common around campus. Regis College has a very small community but it is welcoming to everyone and likes to help others in any way possible which has made my experience better.
Graduate Student,4,"Regis is located in a beautiful area in Mass. The campus small, but well kept.  The small campus allows for a good academic environment as the student to professor ratio is better"
Graduate Student,4,Online courses are well managed. Have had some difficulties with financial aid office and registering for courses.
Sophomore,4,"Awesome, this school is small but has a lot to offer. The only thing that sucks is the location, not many stores within radius of the school"
Graduate Student,4,"I haven't gotten accepted yet.  So far, I like how involved the admission counselor has been with me completing my application."
Sophomore,4,Great learning place. Wonderful professors. Love the nursing staff. They make sure you learn and understand all the materal. Very caring.
Sophomore,4,"The teacher to student ratio is fantastic. I love the ability to have one on one time with a professor if needed. The only thing I would change is the amount of students. Although I do like the small classes, I wish there were more people on campus."
Freshman,4,I am majoring in nursing here at Regis College. The classes are great and so is the nursing program. If you are looking to major in nursing I would recommend this school. There have only been a few issues I have encountered here but nothing major which is why I give it 4 stars!
Senior,4,"i am a nursing major and they have one of the best  nursing curriculum in Massachusetts. i have learned a lot and i would recommend someone to join this school. they have academic tutors even on weekends. if you are ready to put in the work, trust me, you will see the results."
Senior,4,"As a nursing student the school prepares student very well for the nursing career. I like the small classes and the faculty is overall very good. The food isn't amazing, but it's slowly improving."
Freshman,4,Regis is a place where everyone is allowed to be themselves. They encourage their students to stand out and better themselves for the future.
Freshman,4,"As a nursing major, the school does a lot to prepare you for your career. I like the small classes and the faculty is overall very good. The food isn't amazing, but it's slowly improving. I like the sense of community and how everyone is friendly and welcoming. There are a good amount of commuters, so not much happens on campus on weekends. This leads to the majority of campus going home on weekends."
College Freshman,4,The only warn you about drugs in the move in week.
College Freshman,4,The courses are great and the class sizes are pretty small with usually 20 students in every class. The teachers are very nice and pretty good at teaching. There are a good amount of class offered from what I've seen.
College Freshman,4,The serives on campus are good. I haven't used much of it but it seems good to me.
College Freshman,4,"Regis College is the type of college for the person who is looking for a smaller school and wants to stay closer to home. We don't have crazy parties like Zoo Mass but the parties aren't bad and the education is great, especially in the nursing program! They also give an crazy amount for financial aid"
College Freshman,4,"It's great. Everyone there is so helpful, even if we think that everything us falling into pieces, theres people who are so wonderful."
College Sophomore,4,"Safety on campus is very serious on campus, we have campus police that ensure everything is running in order. Resident assistants help with that process as well, after certain events, students are sent straight to their room. I feel generally safe, because there are cameras, as well as people who make it their duty to make sure things run smoothly."
College Sophomore,4,"As a first year student, it was a wonderful experience living on campus. The dorms were a good size, as well as the closets, beds and drawers. Sometimes, there would be a draft in the room during the winter but it wasn't too bothersome. The social atmosphere was pretty cool, the Resident Assistants, would make sure that rules were instilled, they would also have little programs for the students to attend."
College Freshman,4,"When you work hard, opportunities are not hard to find. Regis has so many connections and so many employers want to hire a graduate from Regis. They know they are getting a student who worked hard for their degree and is motivated to work hard in their professional career."
College Freshman,4,Good size rooms and great on campus vibe!  Living on campus allows you to really get to know other students in your community. It's a great way to build friendships and get to know more of the student population.
College Sophomore,4,We have a lot of emergency lights around campus and have videos made to spread awareness and safety measures
College Sophomore,4,My professors have been nice to me p. I wish there were more classes offered such as languages other than Spanish and Portuguese
College Sophomore,4,We care for the teams. We are updated about the upcoming games and what happened in the games.
College Sophomore,4,I like how you can be friends with anyone and how small the school is
College Sophomore,4,"The alumni network is very important at Regis. They attend school events and interact with students. I have not yet tried to apply for an internship, but I am not too worried because there are so many different resources and people available all over to campus to help."
College Sophomore,4,"Because Regis is a small community school, we the students get more of a one on one interaction, which I think helps many students succeed and learn. It makes the students feel important and a part of something bigger. The courses vary and the professors have a good background amount of knowledge."
College Sophomore,4,"Regis College lives through its values everyday. It is a diverse community that offers programs to all students. I think it is a competitive school. The professors care about their students succeeding. The school offers many programs to assist in studies, financial, and job wise. I would chose this school again because I have the best of friends and I appreciate all the time the professors took to help me."
College Junior,4,"Everyone has respect and kindness instilled in them; it's a very large family. Professors are more than just teachers. They are counselors, advisors, friends, big brothers/sisters, confidants. ""Big enough to lead, small enough to care."""
College Senior,4,I am a student athlete and I love the campus and family feel Regis has to offer. Going into my senior I have learned alot from Regis not just what was in the books or class in was studying for.
College Freshman,4,"Although it is a small campus, Regis College does a great job at separating each level of college students so that we are always around students our own age and do not feel uncomfortable."
College Sophomore,4,I applied for financial aid as a freshman through FASFA but did not receive any.  Regis provided me with an extremely generous merit scholarship.  Many students come to Regis because it provides the most money of all colleges they apply to.  It is very affordable for students.
College Junior,4,"Easy to get into my program, harder to get into some others."
College Junior,4,"It has been amazing. I've made amazing  friends, and have gotten such a an amazing education."
College Junior,4,"I love Regis. I've had my ups and downs, but I have had some of the best experiences in my life. I wouldn't change it for thee world."
College Junior,4,"For a school that used to be an all girls school, the amount of guys on campus is great."
College Junior,4,We have many NCAA champion teams
College Junior,4,"Financial aid here is great. Over 90% of the student population receives some sort of financial aid. I have had no problem receiving financial aid, I will only be spending 1/4th of the total cost of 4 years here."
College Junior,4,We have a campaign against sexual assaults going on on campus currently. The school cares about students overall health and safety
College Junior,4,"The administration is extremely helpful. They make sure that all the students are safe, happy, and healthy"
College Junior,4,The housing situation isn't terrible. We have 5 dorms on campus. Our freshman dorm is a dry-dorm. The past few years we've had a surplus of resident students for the fall semesters. During that time if there wasn't space on campus the school would house the overflow of residents in a hotel in Framingham. They would offer a shuttle between the hotel and the school. But this fall that is going to change. We are in the process of adding a new addition to Maria Hall. It's adding suite-style dorms. This should be open by fall of 2015.
College Sophomore,4,"It is great, I really get the assistance I need. It is not easy but it is worth it."
College Sophomore,4,It is great but a better way to get more students and money for the school is to open up more sports like football and cheerleading.
College Senior,4,However people dont follow it
College Sophomore,4,Diversity is great here because we have a lot of kids on scholarship who only come here because its the cheapest college that they can get being in the economic situation most of us are in. Since we come from different backgrounds it makes us very diverse and accepting because everyones unique.
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at this school so far is very good because of the professors. Since there's not many students at regis college, the professors have time to connect and know the student individually. This is also what makes our school unique because compared to other schools in the area, the professors don't even have time to learn your name."
College Sophomore,4,each fulltime student receives a new ipad when they enter the college. there are sufficient access to computers and places to hook up wireless through out the campus inside and out. Some of the transportation to the campus is also WI-FIs so students can do work while commuting.
College Sophomore,4,The diversity of the college community is excellent. there is so much learning and teaching going on outside the classroom that takes place within the circles of friends. Campus life is energizing and has a cultural environment that's like no other. 
College Senior,4,I enjoy getting my Certificate in Public Health because it is much easier that going for a Master's in Public Health. It is only a certificate and gets you joy of being a public health advocate. 
College Senior,4,We have an excellent swimming pool and a brand new athletic center. A well equipped library and a new student center. For the resident students there are multiple events and activities that are hosted through out the year. 
Sophomore,2,If you are considering Regis maybe keep looking. Here are a few reasons why. Food is not good and there is not much to pick from; also if you have a gluten allergy forget about the food on campus. Tuition is way over priced and the sports here suck. I have heard mainly bad things about most of the professors here and have a couple bad ones myself. The school claims to be Catholic but the Catholic teaching being taught here are very strange. Also if you like to party get ready to being going to your friends colleges on the weekends or taking an uber to Boston because this colleges party scene sucks. Stink bugs were and still are a huge problem in I would say 50% or more of the dorm rooms here.
College Sophomore,2,I lived in campus my freshman year and the rooms were too small and it was dirty. I didn't enjoy my experience at all. Now I am a commuter
College Junior,2,"we are d3, not that good"
College Junior,2,unless you go for  nursing or health fields do not go
College Freshman,2,"I'm a freshman now, and I'm already working on transferring for the spring 2016 semester. This school advertises itself as a big family, and super welcoming when in reality it's a boring school full of weird a**holes. Little to no parties, and when there are parties, they're extremely exclusive. It's also in the middle of nowhere, and there is nothing to do on campus. Sports teams are boring and there is no greek life. Overall, choosing this school was a huge mistake. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone honestly, and I cannot wait to never go back."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms are clean and like any other college dorm, but it can be quite annoying.  I am currently a resident assistant, and I notice that the social atmosphere is lacking, and I do everything I can to bring it up, but it can be very difficult.  Regis is now building a new addition to Maria Hall where there will be suite-style living for students, but the cost will be higher than usual (cost still unknown to students and faculty).  The campus is extremely small, so it is easy to get anywhere from any dorm.  The housing process is going to be different this year, the department of resident life is trying to make it easier for students."
College Senior,2,To incite any change on campus takes a long process
College Senior,2,Shuttle runs every half hour and is very small
College Senior,2,"No one stays on campus on the weekends, student activities does not have age appropriate events"
College Sophomore,2,We have the popular shopping mall down the street but Boston is a train ride away which can be difficult especially during the winter. also we are located in a rich town where there isnt much around to do off campus unless you really like shopping.
College Sophomore,2,"We live in the middle of no where, so it's hard to find apartments near our campus."
College Sophomore,2,I hate when you open the window to your dorm and all you can smell is marijuana coming from outside because people smoke in the back. 
College Sophomore,2,"There's not many parties at the school, just personal room parties."
College Sophomore,2,The food on campus isn't that great. They serve the same thing almost every week. About two weeks ago they started adding more of a variety of foods and I have been a little more happier. They do offer a bunch of gluten free foods and options. You get sick of the same thing all the time. They need to offer more of a variety. I think the school should offer some organic foods and more vegetarian meals.
College Sophomore,2,Not many spots and you get tickets if you park anywhere but a designated spot. 
College Senior,2,"The dining hall was really starting to improve last year, and then we switched catering companies, and the variety has gone down significantly. There are some pleasant changes, but there are also some unfortunate ones, especially the variety becoming worse. We do have a cafe, which is good for burgers, and then we have the bistro, which is a very small coffee area with a few bags of chips on a shelf. They have really dropped the ball this year with switching providers."
College Freshman,2,The dorms are expensive. They need to clean it more often though.
College Junior,2,"Barely Anything to Do – The student activities at Regis College are not the greatest. It is not that Regis doesn't prepare fun activities for students, it is that the students never show up to anything. People are usually confined to being off campus and doing their own things, so the student life is lacking in it's liveliness."
College Student,2,"Drug Lackin' – The drug scene at Regis isn't that huge compared to other schools. A lot of students are nursing majors and serious about their studies. You can find drugs if you really want to, but you might need to start making some friends that are commuters or from outside colleges."
College Senior,2,"Underneath the Surface – Like an item we may pick up or find weird we have to find the beauty that it may hold. Regis College has many things that can make the college so much greater. The college is blessed with diversity and acknowledging that would allow a greater sense of community and tearing down the walls of segregation. Also breaking tradition of what is ""fun"" needs to be examined. We are always given a hypnotist or comedian.. but what about something new? bring new activites, new presenters and that would keep the students intrigued."
Alum,1,Did not take online courses. Not an offering while I was in attendance. Will NOT consider school for graduate studies.
Freshman,1,"DO NOT GO HERE. If you're looking for a college with lots of social life, classes that challenge you to be better, no drama, and some type of party scene Regis college is not the place for you. Now if you're looking for a college with strict campus police, awful food (this year there were 75 cockroaches in the kitchen), no social life what-so-ever, and so much drama it's probably worse than high school, well this is the right school for you. This school is the most boring school, maybe because of its size but there are no parties and half of your so called friends will talk about you behind your back. The only thing I can say was good about my experience was the closed campus and it was easy to get to and from my dorm and classes. Oh yeah did I mention all you will do is rot away in your dorm room with nothing to do. I am warning you if you want to have any kind of fun in college DO NOT GO HERE. Also the campus is disgusting"
Niche User,1,Do not let the zip code fool you. This is a school were sexual misconduct is swept under the rug. The administrators will make the victim miserable so they will leave. They are beyond unsupportive. The drugs and drinking is tolerated. Went down a hallway one evening and marijuana was permeating it. Room attendants cannot always be found. You will see students who are from other countries that are getting full tuition paid while hard working Americans pay full fare for this corrupt school. Another black eye for a catholic institution.
College Sophomore,1,"Regis does not help students find off-campus housing.  Students will look in either Waltham or Framingham, options are limited, and there is little safety in the area."
College Sophomore,1,"Meal options in the Café are terrible.  They offer only a few options and no options for people who have dietary restrictions, like gluten free, vegan, or vegetarian.  Many students order off-campus delivery, but that can get expensive.  Meal plans only work at on campus dining options."
College Sophomore,1,Cops continue giving tickets to students because there are no parking and its frustrating because we have no where to park. We have to get to class on time and theres no parking.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have a Greek life.
College Sophomore,1,"Regis just recently lost their contract with our catering company... the food was on the upswing spring semester when we got a new director of dining but I'm not sure how it will be this year. There are two places to go for hot food; the main dining hall, and the LSU. The main dining hall is essentially open from 7am-8pm and the LSU opens at 12pm and is open until 1am. the LSU is more comfort food based like fried food and burritos whereas the main dining hall has healthier buffet style food. Im not sure how meal plans will work this year because of the change that Regis dining is experiencing, but I would recommend choosing a plan that allows for at least two meals a day and has a decent amount ($200 per semester at least) of dining dollars."
College Junior,1,very basic off campus dining experience nothing out of the ordinary
College Junior,1,there is a non-existent nightlife at regis college
College Sophomore,1,its hard to find parking pots because hey are spread around the school and if you don't know the campus well you out of luck. the parking lots you find have a small amount of spots and they are mostly filled.
College Sophomore,1,Students mainly drink in their rooms as their is really nowhere else to go except for a few off campus houses. The school is pretty strict as to doing these things on campus.
College Junior,1,"Cinderblock EVERYTHING – The facilities at Regis are not attractive at all, minus the Fine and Performing Arts Center. The dorms are old and need to be updated along with the bathrooms. The classrooms are average. The dining hall was semi renovated but still kind of grosses me out. There need to be MAJOR renovations."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Enough – Not nearly enough parking for everyone, especially difficult when there are events at the school"
College Freshman,1,"Nothing in Site – Because Regis College is surrounded by numerous amounts of trees where a person cannot see civilization unless driven, there are no restuarants that are situated near by. In order to go to off-campus dining places, a person must either have a car or take the shuttle that is provided by Regis  College."
College Freshman,1,"Trees, Trees, and Some More Trees – Regis College is similar to UMass Amherst due to the fact that they both have their own city in a way. There are no stores or resturaunts that are close by this college. Instead, there are trees, trees, and some more trees as if a person will never see civilization. On the other hand, it is possible to go to the store, if the person has a car. Also, a person is capable of going to the Natick Mall, which is fifteen minutes away from Regis College, if the person as a car. In conclusion, if a person has some type of transportation, then he/she is capable of going to any place that they desire whereas people who don't have possesion of a car will not be capable of going different places"
College Freshman,1,"Before I experienced that college life, i didn't know what to expect at all. However, now that I know what Regis College has to offer, it didn't meet my expectations completely. At the beginning of my freshman year, the parties and activies were filled with excitement and fun. Approaching the middle and end of the year, it became quite boring and unlively. Furthermore, there were no longer parties being hosted and there was nothing intersting to do on campus."
College Junior,1,"Nursing Program at Regis – The program was easy to get into, but the second you get in, you'll want out. The teachers are beyond awful and it is a giant headache to find preceptors. The program claims they will find them for you, but they don't. The Dean of the nursing department doesn't care about her students. This school is a headache."
College Junior,1,"Attending Regis College was the worst decision I have ever mad in my entire life. The campus is beautiful. However, their professors are awful and their nursing program leaves something to be desired. Worst administration I have ever seen, with a huge lack of respect for their students. DO NOT GO HERE!!! YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!"
College Freshman,1,"The Caffinated Cafee – Whenever I think of Caffeine, i think of the energy giving power that caffeine is capable of. The Cafe is the only good place to eat on campus and they have a very average but good quality service. Yes, it is just fast food and fries, but it's decent food that definitely beats the inedible and sometimes ghastly food in the Main dining hall. I am a commuter and I do visit the dining hall, so i am aware of the food options, though there are not many, and it tends to rotate with the same food choice cycles. The food isn't that great but the CAFE will get you through the day."

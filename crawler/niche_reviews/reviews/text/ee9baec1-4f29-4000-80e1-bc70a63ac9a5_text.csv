Graduate Student,5,"I greatly appreciate all of the efforts my professors and Creighton's staff put into transitioning my courses into an online format. The material was all there, the lectures were as straight-forward as possible, and my professors were very reasonable with deadlines considering the circumstances."
Graduate Student,5,"The professors and staff genuinely care about the success of every student from their first year until graduation. I love Creighton's passion for service, its campus, and that the city surrounding Creighton, Omaha, is considered many students' ""Home-aha."" I was first attracted by its academic reputation and the opportunity to complete both my undergraduate pre-requisites and a PharmD in a total of 6 years instead of 8, and I stayed for the people and the Bluejay spirit."
Sophomore,5,"It have been challenging because I am an active learner, however I feel that Creighton University has provided the most cohesive learning environment possible."
Sophomore,5,"I have had an extraordinary experience at Creighton University.  It has incorporated my love for science, faith and service.  Creighton is a family, a home away from home!  It's education is top notch and it's focus on the Christian values and service to others is why I am there.  Go Bluejays!"
Alum,5,The professors were very understanding and were willing to go out of their way to help you transition well. Some even offered personal zoom calls with them.
Sophomore,5,"Choosing to attend Creighton University was absolutely the best decision I have ever made. Creighton truly cares about its students and wants the best for you. Walking around campus, there is a family atmosphere. Everyone wants the best for everyone and cheers them on when they succeed. I am only going into my sophomore year now, but I am positive the rest of my time at Creighton will be equally amazing. The professors I have met and made connections with will always support me, my friends will be my friends forever, and the memories and educational experiences will never fade. I can say with complete honestly that Creighton is worth every single penny that I am paying. Although, I am paying for it myself and would love some help with that. Either way, my experience with Creighton University has been outstanding and one of a kind."
Sophomore,5,"I did not take any classes online until the coronavirus pandemic. It was a tough transition for all of Creighton, but I believe my professors and advisors handled it very well."
Senior,5,"Half of the Spring 2020 semester was moved online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our professors were flexible and able to move all of our classes, clinical, and labs online so we could complete our required courses for the semester and be on track to graduate on time. Their hard work did not go unnoticed and the transition to online classes was very smooth."
Senior,5,I love Creighton because of its amazing undergraduate nursing program. It is challenging yet rewarding at the same time.
Freshman,5,I just finished my freshman year and loved my experience at Creighton. It has such a close community that it didn't take long at all to feel like home. Although my classes were challenging I could tell that my teachers genuinely cared about me and wanted to help me succeed.
Freshman,5,"When I first came to Creighton, I planned to go here for two years, build up my academic resume, and then transfer to Notre Dame. I scrapped that plan within the first week. I’m going to tell you now, the freshman dorms are cramped and the food isn’t the best; thanks to those two factors, I’ve made some truly fantastic friendships. I have nothing but praise for my professors; while some of the common core stuff is a bit annoying, everything else makes it worth it. Doesn’t matter if you’re arts and science, business, or nursing, this is a great school and if you work hard and talk to a lot of people, you’ll have a fantastic time and be truly prepared for the future."
Freshman,5,"Given the circumstances, my professors handled themselves very well, and I was still able to learn a lot while also working full time."
Senior,5,Great experience that allows for well-rounded character development And opportunities post-graduation. They truly care about post graduate placement and job opportunities and go out of their way to help you achieve your goals. Especially amazing nursing college.
Freshman,5,"Creighton has a great overall learning environment. The professors are there to help you, and truly want you to succeed. The Creighton community is very welcoming. You will feel at home the minute you step on campus."
Alum,5,"Creighton offers a variety of research opportunities for undergraduates that you don’t necessarily have access to everywhere. The student body at Creighton is one that feels like a group of leaders, since so many students are involved in extracurricular activities and organizations, and hold leadership positions in those organizations. You are able to get lots of face time with professors and they almost always know you by name since the classes are small. The Jesuit values are at the center of life at Creighton, which trains students to confront injustice and search for opportunities to stand with those on the receiving end of that injustice."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love it here. Creighton students are so inviting, welcoming, supportive, and outgoing. It's an amazing and fun atmosphere with so much to get involved with! Everybody is really nice and the campus is gorgeous as well. 10/10 would recommend."
Sophomore,5,Beautiful campus with super friendly people. Great community. Staff and students are super helpful in any of your questions!
Sophomore,5,Creighton is a great Jesuit University that incorporates the Jesuit values in everyday class activities.  This University allows one to become a well-rounded student and teaches you life valuable lessons
Sophomore,5,"I had a great first year at Creighton. People were great, professors were phenomenal. I can't say enough great things about it."
Sophomore,5,"Creighton University offers a wonderful community with faculty and staff that desire their students to develop as an authentic person in faith, service, personal interests, and professional careers.  Students are not only academically challenged, but they are challenged to do more by being more - being someone with genuine values, demeanor, and action."
Sophomore,5,To me Creighton is safe I have had classes that ended at night and I was never felt unsafe walking back to my room. There are people walking and there is lights on the pathways which is nice.
Alum,5,"It’s a great community!  The people are friendly and the academics rival the elite schools. I was challenged in ways I had not been challenged before - academically, personally and spiritually."
Alum,5,"Creighton University is an amazing place to go to college. It feels like home, it's comfortable and warm. You grow, you are challenged, and you learn; however, you always feel safe and surrounded by friends."
Niche User,5,"I'm looking into their nursing program, and it is an amazing school. absolutely in love. Wish it was less expensive though."
Niche User,5,I am a Creighton University Rowing recruit and I just love the atmosphere of Creighton and its people!
Sophomore,5,Creighton University is my home away from home! The professors genuinely care about their students and want them to learn. There is always something to do on campus and everyone here is so nice!
Senior,5,"There are several reasons as to why I love Creighton University. First, Creighton University has given me more than I could have ever imagined. While at Creighton, I have received an excellent education and have been challenged to reflect on my own personal beliefs and values. Another reason as to why I love Creighton University is because the courses that are offered are constantly changing my outlook and perspective on life. The faculty care for each student, and it is very evident that they genuinely want each student to succeed. Lastly, I rated Creighton University five stars because they prepare you for your future. The faculty teach you the material and also teach you how to apply it to everyday life. This is something that I find very important and unique to Creighton University. This school teaches you to learn through understanding rather than memorizing."
Alum,5,"Creighton University, a medium size Jesuit University in Omaha Nebraska, has very good undergraduate programs and excellent health-related schools.  The professors are friendly and top notches, the students come mostly from the midwest, but they have quite a bit from California and Hawaii."
Sophomore,5,Creighton University really cares for their students and you will receive so many amazing opportunities!
Graduate Student,5,I’m so excited to get started and earn a doctorate degree in nursing. I did research on university that would provide me me with a great education. Creighton University was definitely one of the top of the list schools.
Niche User,5,Creighton University is an amazing institution! They helps students be their best and even strive for more!
Niche User,5,"I attended a college visit there and everyone was very supportive, kind, and helpful. They wanted my experience to be amazing and were sure to see if there was anything they could do to make it even better."
Alum,5,Made me the professional that I am.  The professors are outstanding and brought out the best in me.  A tremendous experience that has positively affected my life.
Senior,5,Creighton University is devoted to a liberal and very holistic education. They also focus on connecting you with the community and setting you up for success in the future.
Alum,5,"Creighton University is a midwestern hidden gem. It is a small, academic haven for those living in the flyover states. The culture at Creighton is open, kind, and friendly with smiles all over campus. The tight-knit community of students is supportive and accessible for whatever one may need. 
The academics at Creighton University are unmatched in the area. Ranked by US News as the #1 private college in the midwest, it certainly lives up to the hype. With strong business, pre-health, and business programs, any type of student can find a niche and thrive. Additionally, the undergraduate research program is incredibly active. The classes are challenging, but the support of the professors is amazing. They care about the whole student, not just academic performance. Many are willing to go above and beyond to serve their students."
Graduate Student,5,"I am currently an entering freshmen for the school of dentistry. Based on my interaction with faculty and staff so far my experience has been nothing but outstanding from everyone I have met so far. In addition, a new state of the art building has recently been established and this is something that has been done to ensure the best quality of education for students."
Graduate Student,5,I am a current graduate student at Creighton University and I have absolutely loved my experience so far. The professors are extremely helpful and have a desire to see you succeed in your program. The classes are challenging but are understanding that you also have other things on your plate besides school. I have yet to talk to anyone on campus staff that is not friendly and helpful! Creighton is definitely a great choice for an education. They are flexible with a lot of online choices and are in a great location if students want a a bigger city experience without it being overwhelming.
Graduate Student,5,"I love the Jesuit education experience. Creighton is tough but rewarding, and I already know I'm smarter because of my time here. I love it!!"
Alum,5,"As a recent grad I cannot recommend Creighton enough to someone. Whether it was in the classroom, extracurricular activities, or socializing with friends, I grew as a person each and every day. I was treated to an amazing staff of professors, many coming from unique and diverse backgrounds, and all with my academic and professional growth as their chief priority. I also was lucky to meet some of the greatest people in the world, people I am lucky to call lifelong friends. In my four years at Creighton, I failed to meet someone I didn't enjoy being around. The university attracts students with strong values and I was able to see and realize this for the four years I was there. Additionally, there is a sense of culture and pride in the university that is prevalent not just through campus but through the city of Omaha as a whole. It is an amazing community to be apart of and I truly envy anyone who is just beginning their journey with the university. Roll Jays!"
Freshman,5,"Being a first year student, I didn’t know what to expect coming to college. Creighton is, and I mean this when I say it, like one giant family and home. The staff does a very good job on welcoming you and making sure that you are prepared to be at Creighton!"
Freshman,5,I loved touring the school. It's right in Downtown Omaha in Nebraska and there are so many cool places surrounding the campus. Everyone I met at Creighton was so friendly and helpful to me when I was deciding where I would like to spend my next four years after high school.
Niche User,5,"Creighton is a great Jesuit school with amazing undergraduate and graduate programs. There is a major emphasis on health and sciences programs, research, and a holistic education. The professors are accessible and always willing to help. The EDGE is a very unique student support service that provides academic tutoring, career advising/discernment, and opportunities for real-world experience."
Freshman,5,I am so excited to attend Creighton in the fall. I have toured the campus multiple times and I love the close knit community that is Creighton University.
Sophomore,5,"I love Creighton. The academics are rigorous no matter what you're going into, but that's expected. Great and very unique professors that provide a well spring of knowledge. The environment is competitive, but that's an environment needed to thrive. Creighton emphasizes the Jesuit values being that it is a Catholic and Jesuit institution which gives their students spiritual guidance throughout their time here."
Niche User,5,"Great atmosphere and city to be in, the school has great pride and audacity for their accomplishments. A top ranked business school and signified diversity lead to Creighton being a top college."
Sophomore,5,"I love how this college has a strong focus on knot only teaching you in studies, but also a strong focus on making each student a better person mentally and physically!"
Niche User,5,"I loved the fact that the Heider College of Business offers 6,000 plus internships per year with only 1000 students"
Sophomore,5,"Creighton is great! Many fantastic degree programs, a welcoming student body, and so much more. Classes are rigorous, especially compared to many other schools, but accessible, and professors and advising staff are always willing to help you out to succeed."
Sophomore,5,"Creighton University is surely like no other college campus I've been to. I have never visited Creighton's campus before actually moving to live here, so I was coming in blind. However, when I first got on campus--on move in day--I automatically fell in love with the scenery. For a few minutes, I forgot about homesickness and the nervousness of starting college. It was a beautiful scenery--ancient looking buildings, colorful gardens, fountains, statues, and friendly faces. Moving from Micronesia to Omaha--nowhere close to Nebraska--was tough but the beautiful campus and the kind and supportive staff and students of Creighton made me feel right at home. I do face challenges and obstacles now and then, but I wouldn't wish to be anywhere else but here."
Junior,5,"Creighton is known for its rigorous academic setting and passionate professors. As a third year student, I can testify that Creighton does challenge students to think critically and encourages collaboration among each college to innovative. Creight also stays true to their Jesuit values. I have served different groups of people through the service trip program and weekly service partnerships."
Alum,5,Creighton University is an outstanding insitution to acquire an excellent education. You will find extraordinary instructors and staff who help make your college experience worth every penny.
Sophomore,5,"I love going to school at Creighton. As a nursing student, I have found the professors to be extremely invested in my success. Getting a degree from Creighton holds a lot of weight so getting a job after I get out of school should be manageable. I know most people think Nebraska would be a horrible place to go to school, but Creighton's campus is beautiful and Omaha has more activities going on than I would have expected. I can't imagine myself anywhere else."
Niche User,5,I visited Creighton twice and I love their campus. The teachers there are so nice as well as the students. The campus is beautiful and the location is perfect. A short walk and you're in the night scene of Omaha. Omaha is a great place for 'foodies'.
Freshman,5,"Professors are highly invested in each of their students and are easy to approach. The campus is beautiful and it's hard to walk to class without saying hi to at least one friendly face. Classes are challenging, but rewarding, and there are plenty of resources to encourage student success. "
Sophomore,5,"Creighton is a comfortable urban college with a strong reputation for producing high academic achievers. I love the campus, it's small city setting in Omaha, NE, the mild change of seasons, and the regional attraction of students like me. In addition to a stellar academic record, Creighton has plenty of extracurricular activities to make college life fun. There are intramural sports, Greek life, division one basketball and a warm, friendly atmosphere that makes me feel comfortable. "
College Sophomore,5,"All parties here are fraternity parties. Although people nationwide assume that the best parties are in sig ep, SAE and Phi Psi, that's not true here at Creighton. The parties aren't necessarily like the one in the movie Project X, but they can sometimes get pretty wild. The students here drink like crazy, so the parties tend to be mainly about drinking and hooking up rather than socializing. Even though the parties here are great, they aren't dirty or over the top like ones you'd expect to see at state or party schools. The closest bar to Creighton is about a minute away. It's called the Jay. I heard it's horrible. Transportation isn;t the best here. Most people drive. Those who don't usually carpool. If not, then they call an uber. No one here uses cabs and very few people use the bus."
College Freshman,5,"My classes were a little hard at first but now it's better the professors helped me out a lot, the facility is up to date it's not old looking. The faculty is great where you need help they make themselves available."
College Freshman,5,This school is 1 of the best as far as people finding jobs after school in the field in which we went to school for.
College Freshman,5,Security is always around makes me feel very safe.
College Freshman,5,We have cable good and air beds aren't that bad and the rooms are a good size
Freshman,4,Online classes have been pretty manageable. I have heard that some professors have  trouble with using the online technology but all of my online classes have gone smoothly.
Freshman,4,"So far I have had a great experience at Creighton. The campus is beautiful, everyone is very nice, and the school work is challenging but manageable. Things are a little different because of COVID-19 but the university is doing its best to find ways to get students involved with various activities."
Sophomore,4,"I like the small community and I get to know my professors personally, but sometimes it seems too small."
Sophomore,4,"I'm currently in my second year at Creighton University and living amidst a pandemic and yet still having a fun time with my friends while following the understandable new health and safety standards set by our school for the time being. Aside from that, the education I'm getting right now is amazing. The staff have a personal connection with many of their students which is not only unique, but incredibly helpful especially during a stressful time like right now."
Sophomore,4,"When all classes were moved online in mid March of last semester, I initially struggled until I was able to reach out to my professors for guidance and help. Since then, I've transitioned into hybrid classes and have really gotten the hang of the online programs being used and as have my teachers and peers which has been extremely helpful and honestly experience changing."
Alum,4,"I loved my time at Creighton University, it was a welcome environment, challenged me to me a better student and better person, and the professors are all very supportive! It is not very diverse though unfortunately. I wish that more funds were allocated to the health science and disciplines other than business."
Graduate Student,4,"Creighton is a great school with a close-knit community of students. Athletic events are especially fun to attend, and the campus is gorgeous in the Spring with tons of flowers and hammocks around."
Graduate Student,4,My professors at Creighton were able to adapt to providing online courses due to COVID-19 pretty seamlessly. I was impressed at their ability to continue teaching complicated content through Zoom and online lectures.
Freshman,4,My professors were able to make the transition to distance learning as smooth as possible. The school as a whole really made an effort to keep us all connected so we didn't lose the Creighton community while learning from home.
Sophomore,4,"My Creighton experience was pretty good for freshman year. As a homebody, I feel like staying at the dorms and hanging out with friends is enough to satisfy me. The academics and curriculum set at Creighton really prepare you. For students looking into dentistry, medicine, and nursing schools or careers, this school will definitely help you prepare for your dreams!!"
Junior,4,"Creighton is a special place that is for sure. My first time touring campus, I absolutely just fell in love with everything. At first glance, I noticed that the campus is small enough for where most people knew or were at least friendly  each other but also bigger enough so that students could go unnoticed if they really wanted too. Academically speaking, Creighton and its professors definitely put an emphasis on studies first and play later, but nearly all professors truly do care and want to get their students the best education they can. Due to class sizes being smaller than a typical University, building a personal connection and contacting a professor for help outside of the classroom is extremely easy and even encouraged by most. Campus life is definitely alive and well too. There is hundreds of different clubs and organizations one can join ranging from Greek Life to chess club that makes finding a getaway from the academic easier while widening ones social circle"
Sophomore,4,"I was worried about the cost of Creighton going into my freshman year, but I can tell you the experience I've had is worth it! All of my professors knew my name and gave constant attention to our classwork, even for my large lecture classes as a nursing major. Sporting events are so much fun, and because our out-of-state population is so high, you have a great chance of meeting people from all over the world! Our dining staff is funny and sweet, and I personally love the food, though the diversity of food options isn't always there. A few of our freshman dorms are admittedly run-down, but they have just begun reconstruction on a few of them, and the upperclassmen dorms are very nice. My RA was the best; she was never condescending, and had a group chat of our floor in case we had any questions or just wanted to talk. There are so many counseling and tutoring opportunities on campus, and it's made readily available to students. If you attend CU, don't miss the fall lip sync battle!"
Niche User,4,"When I went to visit it was so connected and really focused on their students, there's nothing I'd truly change."
Freshman,4,Creighton University's academics are outstanding. The opportunities on and off of campus to expand your academic and worldly view are endless. However the dining options are limited and the freshman residence halls are not all that well kept.
Alum,4,"I really loved this university. Professors were approachable and knowledgeable. I loved the constant stretching of my capabilities to refine me to be the best OT I could be. 

This is a great college on a quaint campus where it is easy to always see familiar faces. To me that is a plus especially as a freshman so you don’t have to feel like a tiny fish in a large ocean like at some universities. 

Creighton has great basketball, baseball, soccer, and volleyball teams. There are tons of intramural sports as well. 

The biggest downside is the huge amount of loan debt that I incurred. Another is the lack of a football team."
Freshman,4,"I really like how challenging and difficult the curriculum here at Creighton is. So far I've been loving all of my classes, except for philosophy, and I really like the energy and spirit that surrounds the school. My one complaint with Creighton is that their dorms aren't up to par with some of the other local colleges."
Freshman,4,the experience at Creighton is honestly wonderful. since its a smaller getting to know everyone is really easy.  but the only real reason it didn't get five stars is the fact that getting added scholarships are really hard.
Niche User,4,"Creighton University has a well academic program, but as well as a division 1 soccer program. It is one of the top most best medical university's in the country, and its focus is to make students successful in their dream jobs. Not only that, but Creighton University is a Catholic devoted University."
Junior,4,"Solid University overall. Many coming from the coasts will dismiss it for it's weather and the lack of interesting cities outside of Omaha, but it's a great community whose students overwhelmingly love the school."
Sophomore,4,"It offers a very challenging and rigorous academics, but it is not as diverse as I would like it to be. The campus is very beautiful and the people are very nice. Even though it is a Jesuit Catholic institution there is no pressure to become affiliated religiously. There are many student organizations to get involved with, and there are many ways to make a positive impact on the world through the school whether it is through service trips or other community outreach programs.  It is a very good school, but its price makes it hard for others besides the financially fortunate to go there."
Freshman,4,"I really like Creighton University. It’s something that adds to my connection with my family as I am a legacy, but it is not an overwhelming factor. I’ve met a lot of new and friendly people. I’m looking forward to my next four years at Creighton!"
Senior,4,Creighton is a small campus with great teachers and academics. They have a lot going on during the school year on campus and they like to give back to the students.
Freshman,4,"I am so glad I came to Creighton. The professors here are amazing, they want to help you and see you succeed. The environment here is positive and welcoming, and everyone has a different story. The only thing about going here is the cost, it's so expensive that I don't know if I will be able to attend for another year. They also have been raising tuition costs, which makes things harder. I hope that they give more scholarships out to students to help make school actually affordable."
Freshman,4,Creighton has a phenomenal nursing program along with many other pre-professional majors. The jesuit education allows students to develop fully in all aspects of their life.
Senior,4,Creighton is a great school if you are planning to enter the health care or business field.  I feel that Creighton has prepared me well and has given me the tool necessary to succeed after graduation.
Sophomore,4,Creighton is a very academically challenging school that pushes its students to focus on their studies and excel academically.
Niche User,4,"I went to Creighton University on a college visit during the ""Jay Days"". I had an amazing experience. The church and the campus is absolutely beautiful and the academics seemed very challenging. The downside is the cost of attendance and the fact that very little scholarships are offered."
Niche User,4,I was recently accepted. The school is generous with financial aid. Their excellent global scholars program is why I applied here.
Graduate Student,4,"The online program is perfect for me because I am a single mother, who works full time. Therefore, I can work at my own pace. The professor's are very helpful and available by appointment times."
Freshman,4,Most of the teachers at Creighton are great! The student population also has a lot of wonderful people.
Sophomore,4,"I do enjoy Creighton University.  After visiting Simpson, Drake, and other private Midwest four year institutions I must say that Creighton's Campus just felt like home.  The professors are all supportive and with a small student to teacher ratio, I feel like an actual person in their classes and can build a relationship with the professors.  The food is excellent, Godfather's Pizza, Chinese, Latin American, Sushi, Burgers, and buffet styled mess halls are a good indication of the different food at Creighton.  The dorms are a little on the dated side, yet they have modern amenities.  The older buildings really gives the place a theme and a warm glow.  Everything is nice and compact seeing that this campus is in the middle of Omaha and all of my classes are within 10-15 minutes of one another.  The advisors are always courteous and listen to the students needs and wants."
Graduate Student,4,"My advisor contacted me right away, as did my academic coach. They have always been quick to respond and helpful in answering all of my questions. Go Jays!"
Senior,4,"Creighton's standards are high and this challenges each and every student to meet them. The campus is lovely and as a non-traditional student, there are still many ways to get involved on campus. I also appreciate Creighton's commitment to service. As an agnostic student at a Catholic Jesuit university, I have never felt more welcome."
Freshman,4,Overall a pretty good school once you find your place and get past the freshman dorms and food...although they are in the process of major remodeling so we shall see how that all improves in the years to come.
Sophomore,4,"I don't have anything to compare this college with because it is the only one I have gone too. It's fairly easy to get into classes, even if they are full. In my opinion, there is some clique-iness and it's hard to get involved as an upperclassmen if you are not already in a sorority/fraternity or some other organization. It's competetive but many professors have your back."
Senior,4,"Creighton University has a beautiful campus. The campus life is filled with a variety activities and opportunities. I would like to see more diversity and more recognition of diverse situations and clubs on campus. 
I am in love with the jesuit values of this institution, and admire the open teaching and demand of critiquing. Ideas and perspectices arr challenged and growth is always apparent here."
Sophomore,4,"So far I am a sophomore  at Creighton in their nursing school. I love the school atmosphere! It is difficult, but there are fabulous ways for people to get effective help. I have learned so much in just two and a half years!"
Sophomore,4,I enjoy it very much. I love the city of Omaha and I love the people on campus. Its a very beautiful campus and I feel like I have all of the resources I need to get a great education.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Creighton has been absolutely wonderful. Not only are there tons of things to get involved in, but the academics are great as well. Professors and all other faculty go above and beyond to help students in the classroom and beyond. Classes are close-knit and have a personal feel to them. Students get to know each others names and the professor usually knows each student in the class. The Creighton community is incomparable."
Freshman,4,Creighton University has a great amount of emphasis on their education. Students also have many opportunities to become involved in campus affairs. I really liked how individuals could join Greek Life second semester so that they meet more people while at Creighton.
Freshman,4,"The professors here are  great! They are always available to help students with homework, papers, or any of the material. They really encourage you to go to their office and speak about past exams or current material. They really make time through e-mail as well throughout the weekend. They really care! There are also multiple resources here to help you with academics such as, tutoring, group work, supplemental instruction, etc."
Freshman,4,"I love Creighton University. If you have looked at Creighton, even a little, I'm sure you have heard the words ""community"" and ""family"" more times than you can count. It may seem excessive but those words honestly describe the school so well. Within the first week of school, I made friends that are going to be in the rest of my life. The teachers care about you as a person, not just you as a student. You can truly feel the sense of togetherness from the second you step on campus."
Junior,4,"Creighton is a wonderful university for someone looking for a competitive education. I love the jesuit education aspect of Creighton, they focus heavily on developing the individual which is not as focused on in public schools. I wish that there was more social student life outside of campus, but the lack of that aspect I think comes with living in downtown Omaha."
College Sophomore,4,"Students mainly want to party here so that they can get drunk or hook up. Parties occur a lot during the first few weeks of the fall semester, and they occur less frequently during the end of fall and the entire spring semester."
College Sophomore,4,"If you're majoring in a natural science or math or are majoring in a non-science field but are pre med, good look getting above a 3.3 or 3.4. The Magis Core is really tedious and prevents students from finishing school in 3 years or even starting to focus on the major until junior year. Science classes are not that hard by themselves but with the magic core classes in the schedule, it's hard to study for the science classes. Bio, chem, physics and math in college ecan not be studied a day before an exam. Studying for those cases here has to to start at least 3-4 days in advance, and it's hard to manage your time with the Magis core. Once you're a junior, it gets easier, unless you're premed and thus have to take bio chem (biochem only available to juniors and seniors here) and genetics and prepare for the MCAT. Basically, this school is 1000x harder than it actually seems (as it is a liberal arts school and a jesuit school) and that's why graduating from here is a huge accomplishment. That's also why it's a big deal to be in greek life here as well as being able to manage academics at the same time. On top of that, there are a lot of try hards (not me) who not only do greek life and excel at academics, but also volunteer hundreds of hours, shadow physicians, do internships at hospitals/business or law firms/etc., and remain physically fit. This school is really hard. 'Nuff said."
College Sophomore,4,"Starting salaries for kids who major in anything in the business school is crazy high. The median is around $49,000 whereas starting salary for undergrads from the college of arts and sciences here is $33,000 and the median for people from any graduate school at creighton (except the med school here) is $38,000. The business students probably have the least work in undergrad here at creighton, and they make the most. Go figure."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not gonna lie, our campus housing is probably one of our best things going for us right now, besides our business and premed programs. 2 of the Freshman Halls, Kiewit and Gallagher, are dumps, but the other two (Swanson and Deglman) are good. Deglman is a better version of Kiewit and Gallagher (gallagher is literally the worst; only have been there once and never plan to go again). I fortunately lived in Swanson, and it was awesome, however the social life in the halls of Swanson was absolute garbage. The best social life was in Kiewit and Gallagher. In fact, many people who weren't in greek life in spring semester became close friends with others in their dorm floors. The best housing in terms of quality and space is Heider and Kennefick (2 of the 4 sophomore dorms), but they're off campus. McGloin is by far the best in terms of walking to and from classes for sophomores (it's in the center of campus), and it's quality of life is the third best of the 4. Swanson is also a sophomore dorm (in addition to being a freshman dorm) and although it's the best for freshmen, it's the worst for sophomores. The junior and senior residence halls are like condos; they are even better than actual houses, however a lot of junior and seniors end up buying their own homes or living in their respective greek houses. The only problem with junior and senior housing is that the 2 residence halls for both junior and seniors are about a 15 minute walk from the humanities, science and math classes. Business students and athletes are in luck because the business building and athletic facilities are all very close to the junior and senior residence halls (Davis and Opus)."
College Sophomore,4,"Class sizes are relatively small, usually under 30 students. This gives the professor a chance to get to know their students."
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is definitely important on campus but does not define the school.
College Sophomore,4,The support for both varsity and intramural sports are great. The non-varsity athletic center is mediocre.
College Freshman,4,It is a fact that the students who attend here are pretty focused on there studies and their future. They know what they want. Internships and jobs are offered a lot
College Freshman,4,There are a large of courses offered. Many are pretty interesting and professors care about you future and want you to succeed.
College Freshman,4,I feel pretty safe around campus!
College Freshman,4,Its pretty nice. Its clean and people are pretty friendly
College Freshman,4,They have a very good soccer team!
College Freshman,4,It is a great school. Very rigorous and fun. Its also diverse.
College Junior,4,The students have to be willing to put in the work for a job search but Creighton will help them along the way.
College Junior,4,Public safety can be lazy at times but overall I feel great on campus.
College Junior,4,Could be updated but still great. Love the small campus.
College Junior,4,Don't watch the sports much but enjoy the culture on campus.
Alum,2,"Graduated from Creighton last week and just had to make sure that potential students do not make the same mistake I did. Creighton is known for being in the upper echelon of Jesuit universities in the United States. That being said, they are extremely hypocritical in personifying the Jesuit values that they preach. This is not a review to give Creighton a bad name, as I am a recent graduate and am somewhat proud of that, however I just think that students should know exactly what values the university holds and to what extent they go to practice those values on and off campus. You would expect a notable Jesuit university to ""practice what they preach,"" however that is not the case with Creighton. Keep any opposing views to yourself as you will be ostracized and ridiculed. In addition Creighton's campus security lacks any common sense and student safety has been and continues to be an issue at Creighton. I would invite you to look up some of the incidents that have occured recently."
Sophomore,2,"My dorm room had mold in it to the point where we had to temporarily evacuate the room. My dorm room had a cockroach as well, but when I went to talk with housing, they told me that the roaches were ""normal and part of dorming"" and that unless we saw over a dozen in our room, there was nothing they would do. The food is so atrocious I got food poisoning half a dozen times and had to stop eating there, and I know several people who did the same. Finally, as a humanities major, I cannot believe the lack of focus. The teachers try their best but without focus from Creighton as a whole, the humanities are terrible at the school. There are no opportunities or options and it is almost impossible to find out information about programs or opportunities because no one outside of the humanities faculty seems to care at all. Overall, Creighton made me feel as if I was wasting my money, and made me feel as if they did not care about me as a student at all."
Sophomore,2,"The social scene here is terrible.  There is absolutely NOTHING to do if you aren't 21.  This year we lost the Jay, our school bar that was essentially on campus, and it has completely shifted the social scene on campus.  The fraternities and sororities are extremely limited on what they can actually do.  There is absolutely 0 school hangout that Creighton students can meet up at.  The social life for freshmen and sophomores consists of hanging out in the dorms and the occasional house party. The on campus living is awful, and they require sophomores to live ""on campus,"" even though the dorms are far enough away that you're basically off campus without any of the benefits of actually being off campus (AKA nice living and RA presence). I enjoy all of my professors I've had in the business school, so if academics are the only thing on your mind this is a great place for you.  If you're social, however, and you like doing things on the weekends, this is the absolute wrong place to be."
Junior,2,"I attended Creighton and transferred to another university after a year. I was shocked by how little Creighton actually embraced the Jesuit values. The school is conservative and homogenous relative to other college campuses. Students don't really do service or work with communities that are different than them. Social justice and inclusion are preached but not executed and microagressions are high.  
Academically, I did have some great professors, but I feel I've received a better pre-med education at my new university. Creighton failed to offer proper academic guidance and financial resources to allow me to succeed.
I am not one to write reviews often, but I just think that when visiting Creighton, you should look under the surface.  They do put on a great show when speaking about their resources, community, and service.  Once you arrive though, that mentality slowly gets stripped.  I did meet some wonderful individuals at Creighton, but I am much happier now that I have left."
Freshman,2,"I'll admit, Creighton is generous in giving scholarships/financial aid. I'm vegan & requested to not be on a meal plan due to poor variety on campus. They denied my multiple requests. This was insanely frustrating. Like any other school, rape is just as a problem on this campus as any other campus regardless of it being private or not. Also, this school claims to follow jesuit values, yet, the school hides rape cases so it can artificially keep their rape/crime stats low. Attached is an article written by a Creighton student who was raped. In the article, she discusses the type of treatment she received from the school when she reported... https://lifewithcassie1.wordpress.com/2017/01/26/i-am-a-lover-but-im-also-a-fighter/"
College Sophomore,2,"Here's the thing: Al the admissions officers and everyone at Creighton says that it's diverse before you come here, but once you arrive on campus it's a totally different thing. Racism isn't publicly shown here but there is a lot of subtle and indirect racism. The people who have it pretty hard here are definitely Indians (or any other person whose ethnicity comes from South Asia), Middle Eastern people, sometimes African Americans (the African American basketball players are treated nicely, however), and Latinos. After all, it is a school in the Midwest and half the school is from minnesota. People like to say we're diverse just because we have people from Hawaii, but it really isn;t that diverse. Most of the ""social interactions"" occur between Caucasian people who are really good looking and/or fit or have an athletic build. It's basically high school all over again, despite how many Creighton students try to say it's not."
College Freshman,2,"Personally, it was a rough learning environment for the field I'm in.  Specifically, the worst experience I had was in the second semester general biology.  Our professor didn't seem like she really knew her material because there was many unclear, confusing, and clashing information taught.  She also didn't seem like she cared about any of us.  She is known as the weed out teacher.  Other than that, there were a few other professors who really knew the material they were teaching.  But, personally I feel like majority of the professors I've had this year, didn't try to get to know their students and didn't seem like they actually cared about us."
College Freshman,2,I throughly enjoy living on campus. I've close to my classes and it's convenient to go to the library for late night study sessions.
College Junior,2,"The food is not healthy, and finding healthy options is near impossible. Beginning in 2015-2016, there will no longer be meal exchange meaning you have to use your dining dollars, which is ridiculous and increased our meal plan costs significantly."
College Freshman,2,"It's okay, but they don't give very many options"
College Sophomore,2,Nothing really within walking distance.
College Senior,2,"There is not much variety, nor good discounts to take advantage of, unless you want pizza for every meal."
College Junior,2,The food is pretty bad!
College Senior,2,Pretty cliquey from an outside opinion
College Senior,2,"You need a car or friends with one if you want to do anything around here, especially during winter. Bar scene is big in the old market, not much outdoor activities due to the terrible weather (unless you like sledding a lot). Restaurants are pretty good."
College Senior,2,"It does depend on where you live, each hall has pros and cons. RA's are kill-joys and the rules of having members of the opposite sex in your room between 2-7am are ridiculous. Some RA's are complete assholes, others are fair."
College Senior,2,"A common joke on campus is that ""the only thing public safety is good for is catching underage drinking""."
College Freshman,2,The weather in the winter months can be pretty brutal.
College Sophomore,2,"Great if you want to get drunk. If you don't you better have a car or else you will be living a very uneventful life at creighton. Overall, if you don't want to party I would not go here."
College Sophomore,2,If you don't want to go greek please do not go to this school. It is impossible to have a friend that is greek when you are not. Greek students become very busy due to the greek life here and lose track of the non greek people. Greek life is not for me and I am ok with that after seeing how a lot of my friends have changed after joining a frat/sorority
College Sophomore,2,"I am one of the few of my friends that went to the school barely drinking alcohol if at all. I am not saying anything bad about consuming alcohol, but what I have found is that if you don't like to drink in excess than you are out of luck at this school. It is rare to find a person to hang out with that does not drink till they throw up every chance they get."
College Freshman,2,"Though greeks don't look down on non-greeks, after recruitment many new greek members don't have time for their non-Greek friends and tend to start to hang out with mainly friends from their sorority."
College Freshman,2,There is almost no public transportation system around Omaha from campus.
College Freshman,2,"The snow, cold temperatures, and wind make walking around on campus in winter miserable."
College Junior,2,"I personally haven't had a great Creighton experience. Most students on campus come from wealthy families and act as though the world owes them something. If you aren't in Greek life, you generally don't have a ton of friends. And if you aren't pretty(for girls) it is especially hard. Creighton isn't bad though, it seems as though everyone else is having a great time. I am just not."
College Freshman,2,"Most students live in a slummy area of Omaha, where the houses/apartments are cheaper. Unfortunately, these areas are not the safest."
College Freshman,2,"The food system here needs a serious revamp. The hours are terrible and the late night options are very limited. Due to the lack of food near the campus, students without cars rely heavily on the food on campus. Sodexo's catering becomes quite monotonous and loses its little luster over time. But, unfortunately, we are trapped. "
College Freshman,2,"Campus safety is more concerned with parties than with the actual safety of individual students. Once I had to walk alone to the CUMC alone at night to fill a prescription. Since it was then too late to walk back, I called campus safety and they refused to give me a lift back to campus (less than a half mile away). I reluctantly had to ask a teammate of mine to pick me up and drop me back off at campus. "
College Freshman,2,Greek Life is a joke here. Pikes got kicked off campus a couple years ago. The only thing that they do are throw parties.
College Freshman,2,Not much here in Omaha. 
College Junior,2,"parking fee is $315.00 and you are not guaranteed a space, I work full time and must drive my car to campus everyday"
College Junior,2,Creighton University is a Jesuit University.  There are strict rules about visitation (especially in the evenings) of those who are not living in your dorm.
College Junior,2,Creighton is in Omaha.  It snows in Omaha.  It's hard to go out in a short dress to a party in the snow.
College Freshman,2,Midwest weather is extremely bipolar. It will be sunny and nice outside one day but the next it will be snowing and miserable. Be sure to pack a lot of warm clothing for the long winter.
College Freshman,2,"If you don't have a car at Creighton, you better pray you have a friend who does.  Otherwise you will not have rides places outside of campus.  Public safety will drive you to the hospital and that's about it.  There is a shuttle that drives to some of the farther dorms and off campus housing, but that's about it."
College Freshman,2,It snows and rains alot here but classes are rarely affected by weather unless the professors themselves cannot make it to the campus.
College Freshman,2,The dining halls don't give you many choices or very high quality so you can use your meal exchange elsewhere but then it costs extra.
College Senior,2,"The school is fairly strict about entrance into the residence halls and underage drinking - but what most people do not realize is that this is actually beneficial to the students. The policies for entrance into the halls promotes safety and the C.A.R.E program provides an opportunity for students who are found very intoxicated to be taken to the nearby hospital - and while your parents are called early in the morning, the offense does not go on your permanent record (which is a huge plus)."
College Senior,2,"As a non-Greek, I don't think Greek life is too important here.  It is definitely good for parties and making friends, but you don't need to be in a fraternity/sorority to do so."
College Senior,2,"The games are good, but the teams are overrated and the fans aren't very fun."
College Sophomore,2,"I doesn't snow too much. When it does it would stick for a week or two at most. It can get a little chilly. The campus is small so if you need to go outside, it wouldn't be for long. It takes about 10-15 minutes to get from one end of campus to the other."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus itself is pretty lenient. You can get warnings and tickets for parking in the wrong parking lots. After a while students understand where to park. They are most strict in the dorms. Some of them have quiet times. Everone is supposed to be quiet after a certain time. Alcoholic beverages or drugs are not allowed. Sexual intercourse is prohibited. Everyone needs to swipe their ID cards to get in. If it's a visitor, they must leave their ID at the front desk. If someone is to spend the night, they must be of the same sex. Someone of the opposite sex must leave at a certain time or someone would be sent to escort them out."
College Junior,2,"The weather is random and intense. It's really hot in the summer and generally really cold in the winter. There's lot's of wind, also, which is rarely fun. But on that same note, when it's nice out it is really really nice out. You can generally find a bunch of students laying in the grassy areas just soaking in the atmosphere. Definitely visit campus during the spring."
College Junior,2,"there are no drugs noticeable, aside from the nerds and their adderrall"
College Freshman,2,"Social atmosphere is nice, but dorms are small and your room mate could suck. There are stupid co-ed rules."
College Sophomore,2,"Could Be a Lot Better – There are gems in the rough, but they are there.  The ratio helps a TON if you are a guy.  But if you're the kind of guy who wants to hook up with dozens, this isn't the place - word gets around and girls here generally aren't like that."
College Sophomore,2,"Just Don't Get Caught – Overall, there's drugs if you want them. A whole variety of them. You just need to know where to look. Personally, I've been on all of them, but the key is to not get caught with them. If you don't get caught with them, then it is usually pretty easy to slide on by. As for alcohol, they can be more strict about it if you're underage. If they find bottles or cans in your dorm you could get in trouble for it. So if you are going to have alcohol in your room, make sure to store them out of sight. Another good thing to do when you're planning on getting shwasted, is having a plan. At least know where you're gonna sleep that night and make sure you find a way to get back home after a crazy night. So in the end, just be smart about it and don't get caught."
College Student,2,Parking is scarce and expensive. There are not nearly enough parking garages/lots to accommodate the faculty and student need. This is a constant complaint and moves are being made to try to improve the situation.
College Freshman,2,Up and Down – Typical midwest weather. You can experience all four seasons in 6 hours.
College Freshman,2,"Some Ras Are Cool, Some Are Jerks – If you're drinking in the dorms, you have to be really quiet, some RAs look for anything to come write someone up. It's not a big deal getting written up for alcohol, but the fines are outrageous."
College Freshman,2,"Transportation at Creighton is very good. There are free shuttles that take you around campus, but campus is so small so they're really unnecessary. They just started a new taxi service, which will hopefully do Creighton some good."
College Senior,2,"Homogenous Population – Creighton is very relective of Nebraska in general, not very diverse."
College Freshman,2,Gets Old Fast – There isn't enough variety.  Eating the same kinds of food every day makes it a lot less appetizing. Food quality is also less than good.
College Senior,2,"Dining Halls – There is not a lot of variety at the dining halls and it often gets old. Great for those that are on a meal plan, but not worth it if you are not on one, or if you are on the flex plan"
College Sophomore,2,Not Very Organized. I am wanting to pursue in the Pharmacy field but I feel like there are not many good programs or clubs that has helped me through  my college life.
College Sophomore,2,"Parking depends on where you live. As a freshman, parking really sucks because there is not very much parking near the freshman dorms. As a sophomore, if you live in McGloin, you have an entire parking garage and an outdoor parking lot at your disposal. Most upperclassmen that live off campus take the shuttle to school, so then you don't even have to worry about parking. Parking permits are just under $300 for the year,  and public safety is not afraid to hand out tickets! But they are also very understanding.....I have gotten several tickets, but I have not paid a single one yet."
College Senior,2,"Unless you are while or hawaiian, you will likely feel like you are outnumbered. Since Creighton is a private school, a large majority of the students are white and from the upper middle class or upper class. There is a large hawaiian population on campus but they mostly stick together and do not socialize with anyone unless you are asian or hawaiian. Despite the lack of diversity, there seems to be acceptance towards all races and little segregation."
College Sophomore,2,The wind makes it feel like it is much colder than it actually is
College Sophomore,2,Should not give out so many tickets if they arent going to make more parking spots available
College Sophomore,2,"Catholic School – At least half of Creighton students attended private Catholic high schools and are upper-middle class white kids. But there's still a fair amount of diversity: democrats and republicans, jewish and muslim students, frat boys and artsy ""hipsters"" can all be found."
Alum,1,Classes I took online were decent. I wish I had taken them in person. CU faculty are pretty great and well trained.
Alum,1,"Catholic in name but almost Satanic in practice. Typical Jesuit institution: admissions office will tell you it is a Catholic school so Catholic families put money in their mouths. Once you arrive, you realize no one is interested in Catholicism or any virtue for that matter. The fact that Creighton students go off campus to attend FOCUS events at UNO speaks volumes. There is no community for Catholic students on this campus. FOCUS has been told they cannot come on the campus. The small percentage of Catholics who practice their faith are treated as outcasts. Party culture is pandemic. Culture of toxic one-upmanship is prevalent in this high-achieving environment (can someone say F.L.P?). I have graduated but I don't like to be associated with this place. I would give money to Franciscan and Ave Maria university and even a Newman center at a secular school before I gave money to CU. If you want your college student to go to heaven, you are better off sending them to UNL."
Freshman,1,"As much as I realize this is a tough time, Creighton has been a total bait and switch.

Their intramural lineup is entirely video games.

Clubs are not allowed to do anything as far as I can tell. Club sports are not allowed to practice.

You cannot eat in the dining hall.

One of my kids has almost all classes online (not all, most).

The move in could have been substantially easier if there was a START HERE.  There wasn't which led to an extremely frustrating beginning.

Housing costs are equal, which is great if you get a nice dorm, but not really fair to those that get stuck in the least desirable halls.

Would get more out of joining the real Rocket League online... .wish I was kidding."
Niche User,1,"Civil rights will be violated. 
No student safety. 
Employees pretend to be security. Not licensed nor trained. 
Rape and drugs rampant on campus."
Freshman,1,"I am going to transfer schools because of the private, catholic ideology that Creighton facilitates. If you aren't a white, catholic, pro-life, conservative, heterosexual, cisgender person, good luck finding your place here! After the first day, I hated it because of the lack of diversity and it has only gotten worse as I have learned about the University's behind-the-scenes bigotry."
Niche User,1,"Went to Creighton as a freshman and lived in Gallagher Hall well known as the worst living situation. If you are looking for people to be nice, understanding or even pleasant to talk to at the administration level, do not even bother. Every single person there has zero intention of helping you with any questions or concerns you have. As a first semester freshman, you will get all the classes you need, however as a second semester freshman good luck getting any classes you need. For a small student population you would think their class availability would be better, don’t let this fool you they are very impacted. It’s been three years since I attended Creighton and if they are ever brought up I cannot help but get flashbacks of how horrible the school is. AVOID this school at all costs! There ware WAY BETTER schools out there."
Junior,1,VERY SMALL SCHOOL WITH LITTLE PRIVACY. THE PROFESSORS ARE UNFAIR AND VERY CLOSE MINDED. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SCHOOL TO MANY PEOPLE
College Sophomore,1,"Living on campus is hell. Throughout this school year, we had 2 gas leaks and had to evacuate. We had to find our own place to live in."
College Sophomore,1,"Believe it or not, the worst sorority is Pi Phi. They're extremely mean girls dressed in nice dressing."
College Junior,1,"Creighton has archaic rules. If found participating in consensual sex, you are fined and it is placed on your record. No one of the opposite sex is allowed in your dorm past a certain time or else you get fined. 

The administration is rude to anyone who does not share their catholic values. And I have yet to see them act on their mission of ""cura personalis"" or care for the individual."
College Senior,1,"Right on the border of the sketchy part of town, I've had friends who were mugged and sexually abused not too far off of campus. Walk in groups. It's a must. A  good amount of girls carry those pink pepper sprays with them"
College Senior,1,"The only things consistently good are the pizzas and burgers. Everything in the dining halls gets repetitive, and when they try something new or ethnic it's terrible. I've gotten food poisoning twice so far, things are often undercooked, especially scrambled eggs."
College Senior,1,"Bipolar, 50 degree weather swings some days, it's dreadful. The worst part about the school by far"
College Sophomore,1,"Creighton models their rules to fit Jesuit standards which is what makes it so strict? I don't know... We have to check people into dorms after 7:00 which is way too early. Girls and guys cannot be in the same room, or even the same floor, past 1:00 on weekdays and 3:00 on weekends -- which makes studying with classmates hard because you can't just have a late night cram/study session on your floor (floors are generally separated by gender) or in your room. It just seems like residence life is playing big brother rather than allowing students to mature and become adults on their own."
College Sophomore,1,"For the most part, everything closes by 11 pm. If you don't have a car, life in Omaha is extremely boring. Drinking every weekend gets old, but if you don't drink then you don't do anything. It's pretty much the best place to study and the best place to go insane from boredom."
College Sophomore,1,"I was not told how bad the weather is at this school. I have seen the sun about four times in the last two months. Omaha has the most unnaturally annoying wind on the planet. It never stops blowing in your face the entire year. The cold would not be so bad if it was not windy, but it is always windy. Oh yeah, did I mention that the sky is always grey. Be sure to pack vitamin d pills before going to creighton because seasonal depression is a thing believe it or not. There is no hope for the weather, so if you come from a much better place than you will miss the sun and hate the wind like everyone I know."
College Senior,1,"At Creighton they have what's called C.A.R.E. This program is a bit offensive to me, but then again I've never had to go through it. The program concerns underclassmen in the dorms mostly, if a person is suspected to be drunk (and you have to be pretty drunk and pretty blatant for them to say anything) they make you blow in a breathalyzer and if you blow over a .08 they send you the the CU med center and make you stay the night, they call your parents, and charge you $1000. So the moral of that story is if you're too drunk stay out somewhere else or be discreet. When it comes to drugs, they never call the police like all other state schools do. They don't like having the police around the campus at all. They will write you up, take your drugs, and you're paraphernalia. If you have anything harder than weed, I'm not sure what happens I've never experienced that. But if you have a lot of weed (say more than an ounce) you'll get in more trouble the more weed you have. Be discreet, don't be an asshole, school is more important that partying, I would know, I almost lost my scholarships and had been written up a handful of times. It gets boring, I promise."
College Junior,1,I hate the winters and the classes are sometimes quite a ways away.
College Junior,1,Most of these people seriously need a reality check. They haven't had a single real experience in their lives and yet they are quite quick to judge and look down upon you. They are definitely sheltered and misinformed of what real life is like outside their comfortable suburbia. That and the females are generally hideous. So much for the higher girl to guy ratio...
College Student,1,"White Midwest Kids – Other than the good portion of Hawaiian students, there's little other diversity on campus. The majority of students are middle class, white students from the midwest region."

Freshman,5,"I got accepted to UW Seattle but chose SPU because I learn best in small settings, and the school gives out lots of scholarships that made it similar to what I would've paid for as an in-state student at UW. As a freshman, I thought it would be hard to learn materials as it was the case during my senior year of high school, but professors here are very supportive and although meeting new people is challenging due to COVID-19, the school tries hard to open with safety measures. The view from the library outside is beautiful with an overlook of the bridges and trees. I heard they are lowering the tuition for the 2021-22 year by 25%, so I would definitely recommend people around me to apply to SPU."
Freshman,5,"I am attending some classes in-person while wearing a mask, and it is nice to interact with people during this time. Some classes are pre-recorded and some are live over zoom."
Junior,5,"Seattle Pacific University is an amazing university and great professors. The professors care about your growth as a person. SPU is doing everything they can to ensure that you engage in their classes and find internships or jobs. The class is small, so it helps you to know everyone. And t is relatively easy to get to know your professors. SPU is an awesome location and there are so many things to do when as a student."
Junior,5,I had great experiences with online learning during my last quarter. The professors tried their best to keep in touch and helped students to have access to the resources. They offered different things to make students feel confident and easy in online learning.
Freshman,5,"I'm currently a freshman at Seattle Pacific University and although my time was cut short this year, I can say with certainty that Seattle Pacific is great for those who are considering going to a small private school. SPU is a Christian school but don't let that stop you from applying if you don't identify as such. As an agnostic at a Christian university, I don't feel as though I'm unwanted. Sure, you have to take some mandatory religion classes but I like to think of it as an opportunity to learn a little bit more about something you might've not considered before."
Freshman,5,They made me feel at home. I got to have a personal tour with my guidance counselor and we both had a first time experience going into the bookstore over there. It was quite a fun experience!!
Alum,5,"Amazing university with strong community. Enjoyed my time there and made lifelong friends. The professors are dedicated & care so much about their students. Professors often pray for students before exams, and invite them over to their homes for dinner."
Alum,5,"Seattle Pacific University is an exciting place where the professors care about your growth as a person, as well as your education.  Many of the profs, as well as the deans, the student leaders, and the president of the University himself, wish to get to know you outside of the classroom.  There is a lot of support.  SPU has on campus security, as well, available 24 hrs a day to offer assistance or provide an escort around campus at night.  The school encourages students to volunteer in the community, and they offer message boards to help find volunteer opportunities, jobs, and living situations.  I was encouraged to grow in my faith, and given freedom to worship on campus, at the neighboring church, or find my own place of worship.  I would recommend SPU to anyone seeking to make a difference in their community and world.  SPU offers many mission experiences locally, and around the world. Diversity is celebrated, and Jesus is lifted up as the cornerstone for life."
Freshman,5,"Within the first week, SPU made a great effort with our transition to the new school as smooth as possible, especially us minority students. I felt at home with the group of friends they grouped me with. they are now people I confide in and support as they have helped me feel welcome."
Freshman,5,"I thoroughly enjoy going to Seattle Pacific University. It has a great sense of community and the faculty truly care and invest in their students. There are so many great ways to get involved in both clubs on campus and community service off campus. They truly live up to their motto ""Invest the culture, change the world"" as they have opportunities for students to serve both locally and globally. I have been here less than 3 months and already my dorm floor already feels like family. Residence life always has something fun going on and you are sure to feel involved and connected. They care about students academically, but also in a holistic way."
Sophomore,5,The class sizes are my favorite thing about SPU. My biggest class is with 40 students and my smallest was with 15. The professors care about you as a student and want to make sure you excel in their class.
Freshman,5,Best Decision I have made!! Attending SPU has truly been an experience. The majors and programs offered here are the best. They also have very high rates of studetns who get jobs once done with college or when entering medical school.
Freshman,5,"I have only been on campus for a short while, but so far, I love it. I have met so many interesting people and am currently taking classes I am truly interested in."
Freshman,5,The campus is gorgeous and located within walking disctance of downtown Seattle. The students and faculty are all very welcoming and inclusive and all want to see you succeed. The academics are above average because of the amount of effort each professor puts in to make sure you are understanding the information.
Sophomore,5,"My first year at SPU was the best year of my life! Not only were the academics rigorous and stretching, I knew I was being taught by people who were very knowledgeable. I also like that they have freedom to teach the class how they want--each of my professors had unique, warm personalities and I sought help from them often. The community, however, is what makes SPU stand out. Everyone on campus is incredibly kind, and there is always something to go do somewhere on campus or in the surrounding area. Since it's a small school, too, it's easy to meet and know a lot of people and therefore easy to see people around campus and connect with them."
Freshman,5,SPU is in such a beautiful location. I've been lucky to meet great people who I now get to call lifelong friends. I enjoy all of my professors. They're all willing to help me achieve my goals.
Freshman,5,"As an International student from Italy, I really like the small and familiar environment within Seattle Pacific University. Indeed, it is very easy to make new friends and also to have a specific attention from the professors (due to small classes), which is very peculiar for the university."
Niche User,5,"As a prospective student, the people and the atmosphere was very welcoming and made me even more excited to go there in the fall. Even though it is known as a fairly religious-based school, they do not force you to engage in any religion if you don't want to and they're very open about everything."
Alum,5,Great school with a very supportive faculty. Professors are there to help you succeed. I would like to see SPU continue to expand their academic curriculum to provide more academic opportunities to students.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoyed the size of my campus and student to professor ratio. It gave me more purpose to go to class because I think it is easier and less anxiety filled to have a class size small enough to do basic attendance. You receive more visual and verbal interaction with said professor which I believe helps most students learn better. However, I would like to see more diversity on my campus. Not so much race but within the religious aspects as well. I came to SPU with the knowledge of my new school is very diverse. While I am in my second year at this school, it has come to my attention that we actually lack at  bringing ethnic culture and different religious point of views onto this campus."
Junior,5,"I have very much liked my experience at SPU so far. It has been a true home away from home for me and I will always be grateful for that. Being from Chicago, the move out west was quite a big deal for me and I knew absolutely nobody coming into this school two years ago. However, my random roommate could not have been a better match and the inclusivity that they strive for has really had an impact on me. I have made several friends, joined clubs, and have expanded my social scene more than I have in quite a while. The courses and professors are great and thought-provoking and add a value to my education."
Junior,5,I love Seattle Pacific University! It is a small liberal arts Christian school which means you get to take a variety of classes and every class size is small. This means you get more attention from the professor and professors are able to work more with you one on one.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Seattle Pacific University has been so awesome. Since we are a small school, that means we have smaller classes and our professors are able to build closer relationships with us.  The support, challenge, and care I received from my professors were what made my first year so worth it. Many of our professors are Doctors in their fields and teach from a place of great experience and knowledge. It is very evident in their teaching! In smaller classes, it is also so much easier to make friends with colleagues and build closer relationships with them as well. Campus life is great. All of the dorms have great communities and our dining hall is known by other colleges to be really good. Although you will reach a point where you get tired of dining hall food, it is at the end of the day, pretty good for a college cafeteria. Altogether, I love SPU and look forward to the rest of my years here."
Alum,5,"Wonderful community of students, top notch educators, beautiful campus, and entertaining city! Seattle Pacific University has it all and provides"
Sophomore,5,"I love this school! It's a great community, there are so many fun events! People down grade this school because there is no greek life or party life, but don't want a greek life then apply to a school that has no greek life, and then complain about it!! I am seeing more and more diversity on campus. Yes, it is still primarily white BUT the diversity is growing and there are more events celebrating different cultures. The class sizes are small, and professors are wonderful. Everyone is so loving and supporting. A truly great community.  The food options are getting better. It has so many cute and exciting neighborhoods nearby. There is a WONDERFUL safety and security office.  LOVE LOVE LOVE"
Freshman,5,"I really love the campus size and the location! Being in the city, yet not being in the city, is a great place to live. Having smaller classes means more hands-on experience, and more one on one time with professors. However, the school tends to lack in diversity."
Sophomore,5,"LOVELY!!! SO FRIGGING AMAZING! As a Muslim student, I don't feel excluded as I did in highschool. All of them are kind and lovely, including the professors."
Niche User,5,"They seem very friendly there. So far, I have only visited, but they seem nice. The administration has done a great job of reaching out to me!"
Freshman,5,I like Seattle Pacific because of the small class sizes and attention I receive from professors. It is an easy place to be yourself and learn without feeling as if you are being judged. I enjoy this school because it gives me the opportunity to thrive in whatever direction I choose due to the fact that it is diverse in the studies it offers. Seattle Pacific University is a culture that is loving and welcoming and it is a blessing to be a part of.  All of these are reasons why I decided to come here and I am so glad I did.
Freshman,5,"I love going to school here! The class sizes are fairly small (20-40 students), so I actually know my classmates and my professors. No matter how busy they are, my professors have always been more than willing to provide help outside of class as well."
Sophomore,5,"I love Seattle Pacific. I am a second year here. I think a lot of the lower reviews saying we have no greek life and students cannot drink are funny because they openly advertise that on the tour, on the website, in the rules, etc. SPU proudly says it is a dry campus and if anyone took two seconds to ask, they would know that going in. It is a great school, the professors really care and the workload is actually manageable."
Freshman,5,I love how SPU welcomes the new students who've never been away from home before. They have made my first month a wonderful transition with a beautiful community atmosphere.
Alum,5,"SPU is an amazing school, this school not only guided me in the right career path for myself but it gave me a chance at having an amazing education. This has broadened my knowledge base with the many resources they provided through my undergraduate years and has led me to return to my alma matter in completing my masters degree. The staff know you by name and not just your id number, the environment is warm, caring, providing you with that comfort of not letting you fall behind."
Junior,5,"The small size of SPU gives it a number of advantages. First, you get smaller class sizes. Most of my lower division classes were 25-40 students. Upper division classes are even smaller. The professors are there because they want to invest in students, so nearly all of them welcome students to visit during office hours, and I have met with a few of my professors for coffee to further discuss class material or life. I also found a really good community of peers at SPU. It should be noted that a lot of this is because I started there as a freshman in the dorms--if you do not live on campus and/or transfer in, it is a lot harder to feel that you have joined the community. Also, they lack diversity. The majority of students are white women. The majority of professors are white men. Nevertheless, I had a very positive experience at SPU. I am pleased with the level of education I have received and how the professors have developed deep, critical thinking in me."
Junior,5,It is a wonderful school with great teachers and classes. Student life is great if you are a social person. Food is not too bad and dorms are nice.
Junior,5,"I have immensely enjoyed my time at Seattle Pacific University. Although the campus is small, it is a beautiful oasis nestled in the affable Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle, with plenty of city to explore! The food--Gwinn--is amazing, and you'll love the buffet-style cafeteria featuring amazing cookies you can stash in your backpack for later. I have learned so much during my time at SPU, due to the excellent academics and engaging professors.  Give it a chance and I promise you'll love it just as much as I do!"
Niche User,5,Seattle pacific university is my top choice for college. I recently applied there and was even more recently excepted. I will be starting a new chapter in my life and I'm very grateful it will be at SPU.  The campus is great and the fact that it's only a few minutes away from downtown Seattle is a huge perk and it will hopefully open so many doors for me and other future students.
Sophomore,5,Coming to SPU definitely changed my life. It provided me an atmosphere to grow and flourish away from home and to figure out who I was. The professors and academics are great! The biggest part of why I chose this school was the great campus and how homey it felt to me when I first visited. I love it!
Junior,5,Enjoying my time at SPU. Love my dorm and the rigorous academic program. Campus is compact enough to feel home-y.
Senior,5,"Seattle Pacific University has given me a lot of opportunities to grow myself spiritually, academically, emotionally and socially. The faculty and staff are wonderful and the overall community is caring and good intentioned. If anything needs to change, I would say that there needs to be a space or community center for people to hang out late in the night."
Freshman,5,"All the people you meet here are amazing and kind people. The professors work well with you to make sure you succeed. The faculty make you feel as if you're a genuine human being, rather than a number they're getting money for having. Small class sizes make having a one on one with professors easy, because it allows them to get to know you."
College Sophomore,5,Students find a variety of jobs post graduation
College Sophomore,5,SPU provides the best experiences
College Sophomore,5,You are very safe at SPU
College Sophomore,5,Living on campus makes it easy to get to everything
College Sophomore,5,The fan spirit is great and everyone gets involved
College Sophomore,5,SPU has the best atmosphere
College Junior,5,The staff do a lot to prevent sexual assault
College Junior,5,Administration really do care about their students
College Junior,5,Professors are both humble and helpful in learning
College Sophomore,5,The reason I decided to come to SPU was because of its renounced Nursing program. It's one of the best in the state!
Recent Alumnus,5,Seattle Pacific University is a very reputable. Great resources for employment as well.
Recent Alumnus,5,Seattle Pacific University has a great atmosphere. Great place to learn and build relationships and connections.
College Senior,5,"I live on campus in a dorm. I do live in one of the newest, nicest dorms so my experience is probably better than most people's. My dorm is very nice, very clean and safe, and very spacious. It is a little bit pricey, but worth it. i like to live on campus for the social aspect."
College Freshman,5,"Fortunately, I am graduating with a nursing degree and nursing is in demand. SPU offers many opportunities to make connections with future employers."
College Freshman,5,"I work for Safety and Security and am bias. From the students perspectives, security could do better at advertising programs and amenities that they do. However, our campus is the safest around and average officer response time is one minute."
College Freshman,5,"Seattle Pacific University is a small, private Christian University. To be a student that succeeds here, they must engage in Christian culture. Each course is designed to challenge the students to develop them on a broader scale. The professors love working with their students. SPU has a small campus that gives the students access to anything they need within reasonable distance. Personally, I would not transfer to any other school and recommend that any perspective student who desires a degree while gaining a closer relationship to God to come here."
College Junior,5,My brother and sister in law both graduated from SPU and have great jobs now.
College Junior,5,"I love the community of this school, the location, and what I'm gaining in knowledge and personally."
College Freshman,5,Tahoma sports are absolutely wonderful. Most of the people at school get involved and they go to most of the sporting events. Everyone dresses up and gets very spirited at each of the sporting events
Junior,4,"The professors are very understanding and most lectures are prerecorded.  It's definitely difficult learning online, but the school is trying."
Junior,4,"The education has been good but the social aspects are lacking.  There aren't a lot of ways to meet new people, but I think that's because of COVID-19."
Sophomore,4,"Seattle Pacific University has excellent teachers who truly care about their students. The curriculum offered allows the students to learn valuable lessons and is manageable to anyone who genuinely applies themselves. However, tuition was recently raised which makes affording this education difficult even for students on partial scholarships. I would like for the university to offer more assistance when it comes to financial assistance."
Senior,4,"Usually all my classes are in person, I learn better in a hands-on environment. Currently, they are all online, due to COVID 19. I have been taking six classes, and only physically see three of my teachers. I appreciate the zoom classes, even if hard, at least we can ask questions easily. Another teacher does a video and a power point, the second does videos, and the third does a power-point with audio. These are all great ways to teach in a new environment, they just don’t each cater to all types of students, so I am finding learning a lot more based on my ability to teach myself. Everyone is doing what they can, I appreciate that this is all new to the teachers too, but I do think some are adjusting better than others. Just like some are better at returning emails than others."
Senior,4,"I really love the small class size, and the relationships that I have built. The campus is beautiful. 

SPU uses the Yellow Ribbon Program to allow GI Bill users, to attend, without paying extra, since SPU is private. This allowed me to get an amazing education, using my husband's military benefits. 

I have met some amazing teachers, who pray before class, and remind us that our grades don't define us.   

The classes are challenging, and the teachers push us to be our best."
Freshman,4,"Professors at SPU are doing everything they can to ensure that you engage in their classes online as you would in person. Personally, my professors have been doing an extraordinary job teaching their materials and trying to get students to participate (thankfully, they don't seem to mind if you sit silently to learn)."
Sophomore,4,I appreciate the staff a lot as they try very hard for their students to help them especially the social sciences departments. I would like to see a change on how they handle student diversity.
Freshman,4,"I love the intimate class sizes at SPU.  It allows you to get to know your professors personally--all my professors this year have known me by name and say hi to me when they see me around campus.  The camaraderie at the school is also infectious, and everyone is so welcoming, making it very easy to make friends.  However, I would definitely like to see SPU become more diverse.  It feels very white and straight, and it would be great to see more students of color and have more opportunities for students of different backgrounds to connect."
Niche User,4,"I like the campus at Seattle Pacific University, is pretty big. I am not a student there yet, but I will be one soon. I also like the type of courses they have there and they are also flexible with the courses.
They are also flexible with the GPA and they don't really expect me to have 3.0 or higher for me to be considerate to take the major I want to take it. They are also flexible with the student advising appointments they have there they make various and the only thing we have to do is sign in online, or reschedule for another day they have available in their calendar and attend. I also like how they make students that want to transfer there  have tours to know first the school, and where are classes, dinning room, housing in campus there, gym, admissions office and other buildings are located in Seattle Pacific University."
Freshman,4,"SPU is a good school, I love the sense of community, the academics, and the faculty. The SPU area is a nice area, and there are so many things to do when as a student. The student life is fun and there are many things to attend and do like talent shows and basketball games."
Freshman,4,"The people have been out going and incredibly helpful. My room mate and I are great friends and get along well. I hope to see more people come to faith in Jesus, it being a Christian school."
Junior,4,"SPU is a very nice university with friendly students and great professors. I have loved majority of my classes during my time here. Being a commuter, SPU tries to always involve commuters Into various events to make us feel more apart of the community which is very nice."
Junior,4,Those who love a small campus that want to build strong mentorships with professors would enjoy this university.
Sophomore,4,Seattle Pacific University is a great university that is dedicated to helping their students feel comfortable and perform to their best.
Sophomore,4,"Seattle Pacific is a wonderful school if you are looking for a smaller school and a religious school. For a private school they are much more lenient on rules than other religious schools. There is no curfew but the opposite gender cannot spend the night in your dorm. Which is understandable for it being Christian. However, the amount of opportunity is amazing. You just need to be willing to look for it. Major companies are based in Seattle. Nordstrom, Amazon and Costco for example. Being in a city there are lots of commercial opportunity but SPU makes sure that you get a solid chance. Once accepted into your major, professors will give you more insight on what internships are like."
Senior,4,"I have really enjoyed attending SPU.  The classes are small enough that, as  a student, it is relatively easy to get to know your professors.  The culture of SPU is vibrant and focused on service in the community of Seattle."
Alum,4,SPU was a great school for education! Professors are challenging and care about their subjects! It was a little expensive but one should know that going into it. I would recommend this college and I'm happy I went here!
Alum,4,"I spent 3 years at SPU for my undergraduate degree in biology and bioethics. I enjoyed the academics and professor part of it, but there were not a lot of diverse aspects and it was a difficult institution overall. I wanted to be part of clubs and organizations but it was very difficult to do because of the rigorous program SPU has to offer and having the opportunity to make time to join any clubs and be involved. Overall, I enjoyed receiving my degree here and would recommend anyone considering a safe, challenging and respected college in the Greater Seattle Area."
Freshman,4,"I think that SPU is a school that can improve but has many things that make it a great place of community that encourages learning. Overall, the campus, food, and classes are for the most part good."
Freshman,4,"I love Seattle Pacific. It's in an awesome location in Queen Anne, and not to far away from the city where so many connections and resources can be utilized. School community is awesome and I have not had a professor I didn't like."
Freshman,4,"The transition when moving from Hawai'i to Washington surely was not an easy task to overcome. However, the support system, faculty, and atmosphere of SPU has allowed me to have a home away from home."
Sophomore,4,SPU is a very cozy and small campus in Seattle. It is not a huge school so it is easy to meet new people because you see them around everywhere. The class sizes are typically small and that usually allows for easy contact with the professors. The professors are very easy to reach outside of class in my opinion. The weather in the winter can get a bit dreary but SPU in the first months of fall quarter and the entire spring quarter is a very beautiful place. The weather is great and the campus is surprisingly simplistic but beautiful.
Junior,4,I love the environment and location at SPU and the professors in my department are all amazing. I love this school but it's tuition is so expensive.
Junior,4,I appreciate that Seattle Pacific University is one of the more open-minded and liberal Christian universities that I’ve heard of. There is a high population of students who strive for change and empowerment to all. Something I would love to change about Seattle Pacific University would have to be the prejudices that are provided through those that lack the certain open-mindedness that pushes our nation forward. SPU experiences several issues in regards to LGBTQA+ students in positions of student leadership over the past couple years and it really made it hard being at the university due to the fact that I am apart of such communities.
Sophomore,4,I love the community of Seattle Pacific. I was easily able to meet new people that have helped me grow individually and educationally.
Junior,4,"I really like the small school atmosphere of the place. You make good friends that you most likely will have multiple classes with so it makes it easier to study and makes class more fun. The teachers have a lot of knowledge and are very receptive to feedback. Campus is beautiful and really well taken care of! The only down fall is that since they are a Christian school you are required to take quite a few in depth theology classes, regardless of your major. This takes up a lot of time, credits, and money for classes that may not be applicable for some people."
Junior,4,"Seattle Pacific is a really great school. Although a Christian affiliate, SPU does a lot to maintain proper social, political, and cultural awareness and advances. However, I think there should be more to include students that do not identify with Christianity. The class sizes are small, intimate, and the teachers care about the students. I like the small school setting, especially because spu is situated in a good area, so as not to get too isolated by the size of the school"
Sophomore,4,"I like how everyone is very friendly. I also like how SPU tries to add diversity. However, they could add more diversity."
Freshman,4,What I love about Seattle Pacific University is the community aspect. Everyone loves and accepts each other and the professors do an amazing job of creating the community. What I would like to see change is for our campus to be more culturally and ethnically diverse.
Freshman,4,So far SPU seems like a good school. It is very small however and sometimes hard to get away from people.
Junior,4,The coursework is difficult but very informative. Teachers are very knowledgeable but also very kind and caring.
Sophomore,4,"Seattle Pacific University is a great school! The professors connect with their students and truly want them to succeed in college and their future careers. Also, the learning atmosphere is phenomenal, as the small class sizes make it possible to ask many questions during the lecture. Overall, the campus is beautifully maintained in a great location."
Alum,4,"I graduated from Seattle Pacific University two years ago. I was there only for three years as I had transferred credit from a local community college. It was a very challenging three years for me, but, once I felt connected with a community, it was very rewarding. I met many very wonderful, compassionate, and intelligent people there, but I think my favorite part about SPU, beside it's great location in Seattle and all of the opportunities that location provided, were the professors. While I did not connect with all of my professors, I did with most and still stay in touch and see them. They played such a huge role in my development, not only academically, during those three years, but also personally. There were some times I can recall have felt like I gave up on myself, but it was the professors of all people that kept me going and gave me the motivation and self-assurance that I would get through those challenging moments."
Junior,4,The faculty is generally extremely proactive in helping you and the school provides some good networking activities. Very warm environment and wonderful location. Love their political science department!
Freshman,4,"My experience at Seattle Pacific University so far has been wonderful. The professors and other faculty members are very friendly and helpful and are always very available to explain any confusions or just talk. The community of students is very tight knit and welcoming and there are always events and clubs to be involved in. There is a wide diversity of students who all have different interests and the dorm life is a very fun and positive community. The academics here are rigorous and challenging, but they are very beneficial and students are provided with a wonderful well-rounded liberal arts education."
Freshman,4,"SPU is a smaller, more tight knit private Christian University. Though based on a methodist background, the school is highly accepting of people from all ways of life. They are focused highly on the idea of reconciliation and making a global impact."
Sophomore,4,"If you're looking for a University that has a mix of the Christian life with the local life, then SPU is it. There's a lot of local places to visit since it's located in the Seattle area, and the campus is very nice for a small University. The diversity of the school is not as unique, but the people are friendly nonetheless. If you like climbing up hills, this would also be a suitable place. The athletics that are available are very limited, as most are introduced as recreational activities, but students make the most of it. "
College Junior,4,"Dorms are cheap, except for Emerson and Arnett"
College Sophomore,4,"I've actually been quite impressed with the employers that recruit as SPU, as big names like Google, Disney, and Seattle Seahawks have all come to campus in the past few months. It must mean that our degrees mean something good!"
College Sophomore,4,"I'm really happy with my choice of school, especially given the class sizes, accessible professors, and community life."
College Sophomore,4,"While I'm not a huge fan of the pricing or the lottery system, I really like residence life, especially the community/social atmosphere. Also, the level of rule enforcement seems good to me- people are more or less free to party off campus as they see fit, and they can come back later without much hassle, leaving the dorms relatively peaceful but still fun for the less adventurous. Not all dorms have the same level of spaciousness or storage, which is a bummer."
College Sophomore,4,"Since my school is pretty small, private, and relatively religious, it's not a diverse or super rigorous academic community. While there are academic challenges and our programs are great given our resources, we're still a small school and our students come from a pretty well established middle-class conservative and evangelical niche."
College Sophomore,4,Safety and Security are very accommodating and are always there to help when you need it.
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics at my school offer lots of opportunities for the campus to grow as a community. They offer freebies for the first however many people to come to the games, and they make the varsity games fun to watch. The facilities are awesome, and there are people there to immediately answer any questions you may have."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school, but my first year experience wasn't the greatest. This was not a reflection however on the quality of my education or the quality of the school itself, rather the choices that I made. I can guarantee that I made the right choice in choosing my school."
Recent Alumnus,4,Seattle Pacific University is overall a great university with great diversity.
Recent Alumnus,4,The safety on campus is great but it is still Seattle.
Recent Alumnus,4,On campus housing has a great atmosphere. Dorms are fun and convenient.
Recent Alumnus,4,Greek life seems to be important but not discriminating.
Recent Alumnus,4,Students at Seattle Pacific University seem to get pretty involved in sports and support.
College Senior,4,"The courses I'm enrolled in are relevant to my course of study and provide meaningful information.  Instructors have their own styles, but each is still very knowledgeable about our topics and covers important topics."
College Senior,4,"There was a shooting on campus in 2015, I believe.  Luckily, the shooter was disarmed quickly by a student.  Since then, security has been addressed in many ways; most notably the need to use student ID cards to open doors to buildings."
College Senior,4,"I'm taking two master-level classes during summer quarter.  I started class just a week ago but so far have been very impressed with SPU.  The professors are obviously well qualified for their jobs and have had extensive experience in the field I'm pursuing.  The work is rigorous, challenging, and appropriate for this level of academics.  The tuition is fairly high for such a small campus, but the classrooms and facilities that I've encountered are well above par."
College Senior,4,"Academics are great. Professors seem to be generally nice and well-educated, curriculum is doable, and classes and workload are manageable. Tutoring and help is available. Study areas are not very common and could be increased."
College Senior,4,"My overall experience at school has been very great. Coming to college, I was nervous, but everyone was very friendly and very welcoming right off the bat. The school is small and very community-oriented, making it feel immediately like home to me. Because of the lack of a greek system, great emphasis is put on dorm floors and activities. This floor became like a family, and I was quickly able to make close friends and feel comfortable at school. I still am not really sure why I chose it, but I had a good feeling about it, and it turned out great. I would definitely choose my school again if given the option."
College Sophomore,4,"Our sporting events are one of the number one activities students participate in, and they help develop a sense of community and school pride."
College Freshman,4,I have had a range from strict to open professors. The quality of each course is excellent. Each student makes it a priority to engage in the classwork. Every professor on campus is indulged into their work every single say they make an appearance on this campus. Class sizes are relatively small once in a major. My chemistry class was the largest I have had which was seventy students.
College Senior,4,I feel very safe at my school. The security and response time is great and there are great security measures.
College Senior,4,I think that the value of the degree I am getting at Seattle Pacific is very high. I expect to have good job prospects and the number of employers recruiting on campus gets larger every year.
College Senior,4,"Seattle Pacific is overall a great school. There is a strong sense of community and the class size is fairly small which allows for a lot of individualized attention. The campus is beautiful, the professors are generally competent and the classes are enriching."
Niche User,2,"My first year here was absolutely horrible! It is extremely overpriced, especially if you are out-of-state. Don't be fooled by the great scholarships--they won't increase it with increasing tuition costs. And they don't care about minorities, it's pretty clear. I had two friends with very racist roommates have a very hard time leaving their dorm. One of them was paid off in order to stay in her dorm. The other had to move to a more expensive dorm. My first two roommates lied about me and left the dorm without telling me until the day of, showing how little SPU cares about student life. I can't transfer a lot of my credits from SPU either. Crappy advisors unless you know them and the system well enough. Could not discourage you more from this school. There's a reason why I spiraled into a deep depression here, just saying."
Freshman,2,"SPU ’s pros: Most professors here received their undergraduates from SPU and doctorates from Ivy league colleges so they try to make your experience positive and worthwhile. In my courses, we have done improve skits on the skill we studied throughout the week for hands-on learners,  listened to podcasts for auditory learners, and watched videos for visual learners. SPU Issues: I am Mexican and I definitely have received unintentional racism. Housing pairs minorities as roommates, refuses to switch roommates who need to be separated for mental stability and, don't accommodate out-of-state students who can't fly home for breaks."
Niche User,2,"My visit to SPU was disappointing because the hosts were freshmen and they presented the University as “unfavorable weather, not knowledgeable about the campus, and encouraged a dislike for the school.”"
Junior,2,"The most disappointing aspect of this school was the blatant lies I was told to get me attend. It turned out to be a sales pitch for as awful a product as are often featured in infomercials. Their school can't be very good if they have to lie about their product to get attendees. I asked very specific questions, which upon attendance, proved completely untrue.
Ideologically speaking, this school advertises as conservative, but practices an oppressive hostility towards any ideas different than their liberal ideas.
The majority of professors are unprofessional with arbitrary and unequitable grading methods. When speaking with a veteran of the school, my third year in, s/he told me to take professors, not classes. I got nothing out of most of my classes, with the exception of two or three professors.
The on campus ""amenities"" such as commuter accommodation, food options, exercise, are all mediocre at best.
If I had a choice, knowing what I know now, I doubt I would attend."
College Senior,2,"I'm not in campus housing.  There is a full year waiting list for grad housing and during the summer, unless you live on campus the rest of the year, there are no housing options except for special event/conference housing which is $65/night.  For summer quarter, that's well over $3,700 (+ $12/week for clean bed linens).  They should really have an option for summer only housing if they're offering summer only programs.  Also, there are NO (none, zip, nada) laundry facilities for common use on the campus!  That's crazy!!  

I love almost everything about SPU, but they need to up there game when it comes to the housing situation!"
College Senior,2,Partying is very limited. Parties are not prevalent.
College Senior,2,"Party life is very limited. Drinking and smoking are against school rules. People do it, but you don't often see it if you aren't looking for it. I personally don't go to clubs or bars"
College Freshman,2,Almost no parties of the traditional college sense.
College Freshman,2,No parties on campus. Go to UW to party.
College Sophomore,2,"There are pretty much no parties. If you want to party, you probably have to go over to UW."
College Sophomore,2,The administration is very strict
College Freshman,2,Nobody pas attention to the teams and its another aspect that I really dislike.
College Junior,2,Nearly non-existent. Maybe go find upperclassmen or go to the nearby schools
College Freshman,2,"There's nothing very close to campus except a Thai place and 7-Eleven. If you want more Thai food you can walk to Fremont or Downtown Queen Anne, but they're 20-25 minutes away one way."
College Freshman,2,All the parties that students go to are off-campus at upperclassmen's houses.
College Sophomore,2,"Had a classmate who was almost raped by a male student and after getting pulled off by two other males and reported to the school he didnt even get in trouble. Infact the girl moved to a different dorm, not him."
College Sophomore,2,"No school spirit, soccer and basketball is the best sport available, also has a crew team and gymnastics."
College Sophomore,2,"Primarily white Christians, few exceptions, does embrace culture though."
College Junior,2,"Acceptance here is not the issue at all I think that SPU does a really great job at acceptance, its just that there isn't much diversity all around to accept."
College Sophomore,2,"The nightlife at the school is almost non-existent. It mostly consists of watching movies, or playing video games."
College Sophomore,2,It is extremely rainy and overcast in Seattle and this affects the dispositions of the students on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"For starters, to be openly homosexual is frowned upon and will likely get you kicked out, though I've never seen it happen. As a private Christian college with very high tuition, the population is primarily rich white kids, with the second largest (general) ethnic group being Asian. All of my roommates are politically conservative, and despite being in the middle of Seattle, I suspect that a lot of other students are as well. All of that aside, the people themselves are usually kind, so I would be surprised to hear of overt discrimination or bigotry from an individual, but white people being awkward around people of color? Check."
College Junior,2,We don't have Greek life
College Sophomore,2,"I need sunshine. It goes quite a while without having any of that, so it can get kind of depressing around here."
College Senior,2,Expensive permits make for student and staff inconvience. both park a mile away for spaces are left unfilled for payees.
College Senior,2,"I decided to double major, as I changed majors after finding out that my univeristy was not accredited. I had to do everything on my own, finding problems with financial aid as an out of stte student. "
College Senior,2,"Poor for college student as most things close by 8 if they are not 21+ bars--this includes places downtown. the seattle area is also notorious for ""organic"" spots. where is the meat? ccoffe and pho don't contitute  as staple places, yet they are the only thing I see around"
College Sophomore,2,There isn't much to do at night on campus. Your best bet is to attend the UW parties. 
College Sophomore,2,Simple.... There is none. Someone like me coming from a very diverse school may not be too happy here. I have gotten accustom to it but it took time. Although it is a great school to go to.
College Senior,2,"Very draconian law exists at SPU. Dorms are gender segregated. The only way to visit a person of the opposite gender is if you are married and are living on an arranged apartment off campus. They make you sign a contract saying that you will be and will remain abstinent from sex, drinking, and drugs."
College Senior,2,"You can find people who put out, but don't expect it. If you are looking for an easy fling, take the bus 15 minutes to UW. If you are looking for a conservative relationship, you have your pick of people. Sex is a taboo topic on campus. Most people do not/ will not openly discuss their private lives (mostly doesn't exist is the bigger reason for this). Girls are expected to be model conservatives, and guys are expected to be gentlemen. Dorms and campus apts. are gender segregated. Already being in a long term, long distant committed relationship, I did not have to find anyone. If you are single, you can find someone, but if you want a quick thing, it probably won't happen."
College Senior,2,"Cost is high, availability of spots is low. Thankfully, you can mostly get away with parking in neighborhoods around the campus, if you can deal with walking."
College Senior,2,"Came from a big public university. If you are not part of the original cliche that your peers exist in, you will feel out casted. Although I am religious, I am not Free Methodist. The revelation of this fact has caused some people to disassociate with me completely. It is as if being something that is not protestant is a crime. This university has the social structure of a high school."
College Senior,2,"I don't think the weather affects too much. There isn't much snow, so school is usually not canceled. The most the weather does is affect peoples moods or makes them come late to class because of walking slower from the bus/car to class."
College Senior,2,"There are some very good teachers but there are also some very poor teachers. Some teachers do ""group work"" projects that affect everyone in the groups grade. So if one person didn't email their work to the teacher everyone in that group fails. This is something that I ran across more than once and was annoyed by it. When I tried talking to the teachers they would say there is nothing they could do about it. So I had to repeat the class or take a different one where I would receive the same credit."
College Senior,2,"Financial aid was hard to receive, and then became easy, but then because very hard. And so I gave up and decided to simply stick with applying for scholarships."
College Senior,2,The only main places on campus I've been are the soccer fields and classrooms. There is a hangout area that is pretty popular outside that is in the middle of all the buildings. That area is pretty nice during Summer Quarter but otherwise it's really cold to be out there.
College Senior,2,The only time I've had to use the computers at WCC are when I took a class that required you to type things up during class. So I don't know the accuracy of their internet or printer because I barely used them.
College Senior,2,"Since it is a city, it's like a lot of cities, not very safe. The attractions I think are mainly the shopping with not just clothes but food. The big thing is CostCo and the new Winco. The mall has $4 movies too. The sports are ok, but it seems that the boys sports are more competitive and more fun to watch, compared to the girls. The ""local"" attitude is mostly pleasant. I put local in quotation marks because there are a lot of people from Canada that come to the USA. And for some reason are usually very snippy and impolite to everyone around."
College Student,2,"I've only been in the dorms a handful of times to visit. They're a little run-down and they are definitely dorms, but they're not terrible either. "
College Student,2,"There's a coffee shop and a subway, and the subway is in a small convenience store. The prices are a bit steep and there's not a lot of variety, but it gets the job done."
College Student,2,Parking is easily accessible and central to campus. But the permits are outrageously expensive - I always drive and park on the perimeter of campus to save on the permit.
College Student,2,"Because it's so small, the resources aren't the best (for example, the athletics or art departments). But the campus is beautiful, well-landscaped, and well-kept (buildings and grounds alike). General environmental awareness. "
College Student,2,"There are several bus lines that go by the school, which is nice, but it usually involves at least a couple of transfers for me to get back home. If timed incorrectly, I might end up late for class. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"Well, there isn't a variety of  computer labs. The Computer lab that campus has is in the library on the bottom floor and theres only a couple of computers. 

However you can rent out a new MacBook from the library tech counter and use that. 

Printing on campus is not so great, there is only one printing station (the Library) on campus and printing credit is paid by the student (so you'll have to add money to your card to print out that 90 page essay, instead of it coming out of tuition). It usually cost $0.10 per page for black and white and then $0.30 for color.

But believe me it's worth it!."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Well If your looking to pay arm and leg for a place as small as your closest and as old as your grandmother's mother then off campus housing is the choice for YOU! 

Seattle Pacific University is in a weird location, so are the houses and apartments, your looking somewhere between $1800-2999 for an apartment. 

The UW has studios for cheaper, however if you have roommates you'll be looking at $500-700 near SPU."
College Sophomore,2,SPU is extremely strict. They have recently become less strict but they used to make professors report students even off campus if they were drinking. We are college students we need to learn to make our own choices and they need to calm down some.
College Sophomore,2,"Getting a spot in a residence hall parking lot can be almost impossible, depending on the residence hall. However, there is street parking nearby, and you may have to drive around for a little while to find it, but it's free and the furthest walk is probably two blocks. Cars aren't needed, as we are right on the bus lines, but they are extremely helpful if you want to get anywhere besides downtown."
College Sophomore,2,"There are people of many different races and religions at SPU, but they represent a small percentage of the student body."
College Freshman,2,"In the beginning you want to eat everything but you get tired of it really soon. There isn't the best choices if you are vegan, but if you like pizza and burgers you will be a ok."
College Sophomore,2,"There is nothing that is within immediate walking distance of SPU so a designated driver or public transportation is always necessary if you decide to go out. As for the parties around SPU, they seem to be small and fairly exclusive. If you're looking for a party school, this is not the right fit for you."
College Junior,2,Nothing happens at night people go to downtown Seattle
College Junior,2,"Walking to class is a big pain. Layering up can solve this problem, but then when you get to class you're sweating, peeling off layers, and sitting in a pile of your own coats and sweaters."
Recent Alumnus,2,We generally considered the security center to be a power-tripping bunch of clowns.
College Freshman,2,"The university is trying, but based on friends I have talked to, it is still hard being a minority."
College Freshman,2,Crazy Strict – It is always helpful to have a car but parking on campus can be terrible. The area is so small anyways that trying to bring student cars into that is just terrible unless you live in Emerson hall which is expensive but includes a parking garage with assigned spots.
College Freshman,2,"Off-Campus Apartments Are Expensive – The local area of Queen Anne, Seattle, WA is filled with copious amounts of houses and apartments but the cost of living deters students. The local area is very beautiful and is a prime location for living due to convenience and distance from campus grounds. Although certain lots of property are expensive a little research and patience will reward you with a beautiful and quaint house."
College Freshman,2,"Hatred for Gwinn – Before I came to campus, I was told that the food was 'excellent' by the admissions staff. Upon arrival to Gwinn, I wanted to throw up. I can't stand eating there. There's never anything that's good. I've seen people throw up in the dining hall on multiple occasions. To make things worse, on preview days (when prospective student get to eat in the dining hall) they actually have ACCEPTABLE food. The hours on the weekends are horrible. I do not recommend getting a meal plan at all."
College Junior,2,"Mostly Uniform – As a small Christian college, there is not significant diversity at SPU. The majority of students are middle to upper class white Christians. However, there is some diversity, and different racial groups are represented in campus organizations. The lack of diversity can cause kind of a uniformity in attitude across the campus, especially where religious issues are concerned."
College Sophomore,2,"On Campus Apartments Only – There are campus apartments, but freshmen are excluded from applying."
Junior,1,"Don't drink the Kool-Aid! SPU looks great from the outside, but when I lived on campus it was very clear that the school doesn't care about the students. I even had a professor that told my class ""Once they get you here they couldn't care less about you"", and they were one of the best professors I've ever had... They lied about how many of my credits would transfer in so I would go there and I decided to transfer to another school after only one year at SPU. The student life/culture is very, very bad. Everyone talks about people behind their backs and a lot of students are very entitled/snobbish. It is way overpriced and only uses the Christan label as a ploy to attract students. I would never recommend a friend to go there and feel bad for those who do."
Freshman,1,"They send a letter to my son and told him you are Approved for Enrolment, then we called few people around, find out the worse university. My son called them and told them, thanks for the letter, but I chose different university. After a few months, they Mail Letter to us and Ask to Pay $350 for Enrolment Letter we sent. We totally shocked, we did not request any enrolment, you guys sent a letter, why you ask for $350 !!!! - Totally SCAM"
Senior,1,"Funny how there are reviews saying the campus is diverse or the sports are good. Totally inaccurate. I have never seen a campus with such a large percentage of white students. There is no football team; sports at the school feel non-existent, just like the clubs. The tuition is very high, yet the school has very little to offer. The facilities are pretty lousy and the food is bad. Course offerings are very limited. The worst thing about the school is the community. The students are very immature and sheltered. Vast majority are very preppy, cliquey, stuck up and very unkind. I have had a very sad experience at this campus and I really have lost all respect for the school."
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life
College Sophomore,1,"I don't party myself, but i've never heard of big or great parties around my schools area."
College Freshman,1,"I understand that this is a Christian University, but it's too strict here at this school. I think that it's ridiculous that we need floor hours for the opposite gender on the floor. I mean, it's college and we are ALL adults. What's the point of going to college to be an adult when you're still being treated like a child?"
College Freshman,1,"There are no parties at this school because it is Christian and well, I feel that there are none that are easy of access."
College Freshman,1,"No parking anywhere, do not even attempt.  I had to park 10 miles away."
College Freshman,1,Sometimes it feels more like a prison than a college.
College Freshman,1,Its pathetic and depressing that nothing happens at SPU. You have to go to the University of Washington to have a social life.
College Freshman,1,The thing i hate the most about this school
College Freshman,1,"There is no Greek Life at SPU. People try to pretend their floors are Frats or Sororities, but it's just obnoxious."
College Freshman,1,There are no parties at our school. Alcohol is not allowed on campus and neither is drugs.  You would have to go to University of Washington to find some good parties.
College Freshman,1,We do not have a greek system unfortunately. We only have dorm housing.
College Freshman,1,"The music program here has a couple amazing professors who teach superbly in the classroom, but there are NO ensembles here that can play past the junior high level. Without the ability to apply the theory and ear training one learns in lecture, there are many students who are graduating from this school without being able to play a basic high school level solo. These students will be unable to get jobs and won't be qualified for ANY position related to their major. It's a horrible circle to watch and I am doing everything in my power to escape it."
College Freshman,1,"I am appalled at how low the standards have been set for SPU students. I only took 3 AP classes in high school and had an average academic background, yet I have completed my first quarter (including general and prerequisite classes for my major) with straight As without even trying. This sounds pretentious, but myself and other freshman have been unpleasantly surprised with how easy it is to pass classes here. If you're looking for a challenge in any way, shape, or form, go somewhere else. I am transferring because I know that this school is not going to prepare me for the real world."
College Freshman,1,There are very few places to eat within walking distance.
College Freshman,1,"There is literally nothing going on on campus, ever. I am an introvert and still find it uncomfortably quiet. Students go to UW if they want to party."
College Freshman,1,"Although the dorms at SPU are nice externally, the residence life staff and requirements make it intolerable. There are fines for EVERYTHING, mandatory meetings that start at 9:45 pm (which is too late for someone with 8 am classes), and a great amount of passive-aggressiveness towards students (such as whiteboards that read, ""We were at prayer group last night, where were you?""). When questioned, residence life staff have said that these requirements and expectations are to promote community. I personally feel that they are stifling and inappropriate- students should be able to make the friends they want in college without feeling pressure from his or her floor. There are no sororities or fraternities, but each floor is treated as one. This is unacceptable behavior and one of the reasons why I am transferring from this school. Also although I haven't heard of other residents that have had this issue, my room has a toilet that breaks weekly."
College Freshman,1,i chose this one because it was the worst scholarship i received in comparison to the other universities that i was accepted to

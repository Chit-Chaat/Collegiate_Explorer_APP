Graduate Student,5,Awesome school! Each teacher has there own individual way of teaching but is still able to make us students be able to understand the material given to us. I would also say UNMC was always fast at returning any questions I had.
Senior,5,We took some online classes to accommodate the pandemic. The school did a good job of changing the curriculum to make sure that we would still receive all of our clinical hours and be able to learn as much as we would have if we were in class.
Senior,5,"We have had amazing learning opportunities through clinical experience and simulation labs as well and in-person and online learning to accommodate the pandemic. The teachers are very helping, supportive and understanding and present everyone with the same opportunities."
Senior,5,I am getting a well rounded education. Excellent professors and nice campus. Parking isn't great to get to campus. Lots of technical difficulties with cross campus teaching
Alum,5,"Completed an accelerated BSN program through the Nebraska Medical Center.  I have nothing but high praise for the program structure, professors, and the learning opportunities that were provided during my course of study."
Junior,5,UNMC is an excellent school for anyone looking to pursue or further their education in the medical field! The professor are knowledgeable and genuinely care about your success!
Junior,5,"The University of Nebraska Medical Center, College of nursing has exceptionally high standards to achieve to get into the program and complete the program. They offer low tuition rates making it extremely affordable for the education you are receiving. I have never had so many amazing educators before that care so much about you individually, and want success for you. This is an excellent university."
College Junior,5,There is a security officer that makes rounds throughout the night as students are studying. It's nice to see him when you are there by yourself studying!
College Senior,5,UNMC has been a great experience for me.
College Senior,5,"We graduate in May, and most of my classmates have jobs lined up already."
College Senior,5,The student body is very proactive about stopping sexual harassment and assault. Any issues with crime and/or sexual harassment have been issues off-campus and generally out of UNMC's control or influence.
College Senior,5,"I graduated from UNL in 2014, and will now graduate from UNMC in 2016. I've thrived so much more at UNMC because of the small class sizes, focused curriculum, clinical experiences, and help from professors and graduate assistants."
College Junior,5,Our school is very safe with security available at all times.
College Junior,5,My school works hard to ensure that we are all offered great internship positions and experiences.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Everyone seems willing to help out. This included faculty, staff, and alumni out in the field."
Recent Alumnus,5,I would definitely choose this school again. We have great teachers
College Junior,5,"My second year of college, I attended the University of Nebraska- Lincoln, soon to go to UNMC in the fall. UNL was by far one of the best college experiences I have had thus far. They offer a variety of classes and offer a lot of help outside of classes. UNL also offers many extra curricular actives, of which I was apart of 3 clubs and a part of the greek system as well."
College Junior,5,the unmc building is awesome
College Junior,5,"I am very happy with my major. It is not an easy one, but I enjoy every day of classes, lab, and clinical. I would like to become a CRNA or a Pediatric Orthopedic APRN. I have no concerns about finding a job after graduation as a Nurse."
College Junior,5,None of the students (to my knowledge) do drugs. We are all at this school because we are future professionals and take this very seriously. 
Graduate Student,4,Online experience at UNMC was sometimes rough but if there were any bumps every teacher would understand be very helpful throughout the situation. I would also say transitions from in class to online was smooth and there were still the same education level given.
Junior,4,The program I am in is very interactive across the entire state. I really enjoy the connectedness as well as the help that you receive from instructors and faculty to help you succeed!
College Freshman,4,Safety is at high level.
College Freshman,4,Degree in this school has high quality!
College Freshman,4,"The College has a new building which is equipped with the modern technology. Classes are small sized which also helps to create good studying environment. Parking spots are not always available, but nit far in a distance one can find some empty parking spots.Professors are in a great help!"
College Junior,4,"I have never had a problem with any of the above. I am the type of person that takes things for what they are and do what I am told, so I follow what I am supposed to do, as well as what is expected of me pretty well."
College Junior,4,"I rank this school as an ""It's great"" for the sole reason being that this is nursing school, and it is very difficult to go through, BUT for what this school prepares it's student's for, and the way they continue to build on the student's critical thinking, I think that this school does well and excels at preparing their students for this future."
College Senior,4,We're a medical institution. Drug and alcohol are understandably not used on campus. Off-campus is fine though.
College Senior,4,We only have professional Greek societies and are generally viewed very positively.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Not much choice in class, but I'm in a specific program. The teachers and classes are great."
Recent Alumnus,4,I feel quite safe all the time.
Recent Alumnus,4,I have seen the housing and it seems like a good value for your money.
College Freshman,4,"A lot of places to choose from, but most are pretty expensive."
College Freshman,4,There are many options in Omaha.
College Freshman,4,Different vendors come to campus depending on the day of the week.  They are all very good.
Recent Alumnus,4,There are many different options off campus.
Recent Alumnus,4,I never had an issue or problem with the security on campus.
College Junior,4,"After the financial aid office received my FAFSA, I got an email from the gal letting me know where I stood with funds for nursing school. She explained that I am maxed out on financial aid and student loans and then gave me options to help pay for school. As frustrating as it is that I won't get any extra money to help with living expenses, the financial aid office did a great job explaining everything."
College Senior,4,There are many options to apply for - I think the process is relatively easy also
College Senior,4,I believe this was the best choice for me and my future.
College Senior,4,There is a lot of diversity within the campus and adjoining school.
College Senior,4,I don't feel that we need campus security - we are a small campus that doesn't have issues. We share a facility with another college and things are kept really safe
College Senior,4,The community really pitches in with learning options at the hospital and great volunteer options to help the community
College Senior,4,For a small area there are many options provided to the students
College Senior,4,I think there are many options for great education at UNMC
College Senior,4,The teachers care about the students and provide helpful ways to learn the material. The workload is challenging but worth it.

College Junior,4,"I try to not go out to eat much, but when I do most places have a very good student pricing/discount."
College Junior,4,"UNMC does not have many dorms, and since I do not live in one it is hard for me to describe how strict they are with alcohol usage in dorms. UNMC has a very high honor code."
College Junior,4,People do not use UNMC's computers often because students are required to have their own.
College Junior,4,Greek life is awesome. They keep you involved both on and off campus. It also gives students more opportunities to step up and be leaders. Greek life also can award scholarships.
College Junior,4,Girls and guys at the campus get along great. There is a wide range of types of both boys and girls from in and out of state.
College Junior,4,UNMC is made of dedicated students who want to do well and help others. There is a lot to do and a lot of opportunities at which ever campus you go you. There is a great community and everyone gets along well.

College Junior,4,"Very nice facilities, but have to move locations during school sometimes to accommodate upgrades."
College Junior,4,"I am currently enrolled in an online prerequisite for a program that I just got excepted into.  The workload is heavy, as I am teaching myself everything.  The professor tries to answer e-mailed questions in a timely manner."
College Senior,4,The computer labs have excellent printing options and are continually updated.
College Junior,4,Good Classes – So far classes are going to be ok. Instructors seem very helpful and encouraging. They want us to be successful so I'm pumped to do my best. Very excited about the facilities too.
College Junior,2,finding housing is very difficult...especially if you have a pet. I ended up having to buy a house just so that I could keep my small dog. There are very limited options available. the school is pretty helpful in trying to help find housing and will post when they hear of something.
College Sophomore,2,It is easy to ride with people places and Kearney has a taxi service. It is a smaller town so transportation is not really needed.
College Student,2,"There is no transportation offered by the school, so most all students drive.  However, finding parking is easy as there are many over-flow lots.  Many lots make driving to campus convenient.  Parking passes are really reasonable for the entire year."
College Sophomore,2,you must have a car here. i think that there should be more public transportation.
College Junior,1,"As stated prior, UNMC Northern Division does not have any emphasis on Greek Life. It is non-existent."
College Junior,1,"In the Northern Division of UNMC, there is no athletic emphasis. If students would want to be part of the athletic life, they would have to visit Northeast Community College to participate."
College Senior,1,Housing options are few near the campus. Most available are expensive and are further away than is convenient.
College Senior,1,"UNMC Lincoln CON Safety – We are all forced to use the parking garages for UNMC CON classes. At night, this area is unsafe. During the day, it is difficult to obtain access during class periods and many of us are late to our first class because we are hunting for parking."
College Senior,1,Facilities are those UNL allows us to use. UNMC in Lincoln does not have any facilities of it's own.
College Senior,1,There are no on -campus dining options except for vending machines.

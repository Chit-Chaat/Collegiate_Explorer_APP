Freshman,5,"The people here are very polite and helpful, there are various different events and clubs to partake in.

Seminole State college is a wonderful educational institute. The professor are very knowledgeable and care about their students learning. They are always available for extra help.

Freshman,5,I like it here at Seminole State because there are many campuses that are around central Florida. The online options for classes are very helpful and the classes are smaller which is a good learning environment.
Sophomore,5,"The campus is very clean and the many students are very active. Some of them Ghost certain activities and booths, and a few companies might show up time to time too. The people get everyone involved in whatever activities or booths they have. Some of the people also have various food booths for the students to enjoy."
Junior,5,"I am a nursing major and Seminole State has the top nursing program. The professors want you to succeed and are always willing to help. I love that the classes are small so I do not just feel like a ""number"" in class. I wouldn't change anything about Seminole State!"
Freshman,5,I was apprehensive starting back at 36 years of age. I was pleasantly surprised to see the classes were diverse as far as ages. It put me at ease and my experience has been great so far! I am looking forward to continuing my education at Seminole State.
Sophomore,5,"Seminole State College is a great cold for people that want to expand their education. Unlike UCF simoneau state has the Options of courses such as construction management , the courses Or smaller and more personal than UCF.  The cost of the courses or half the price of UCF, in the people are willing to work with your personal schedule no matter what.

There are a lot of student activities. The college embraces diversity of culture. It also is very accommodating to students with disabilities.
Freshman,5,"It has been quite a challenge as a single mother of 4 with ptsd and panic disorder to get into a school and complete my classes. Although it was difficult to get registered because of money I owed other schools to get my transcripts, I finally paid it off and am registered. I love the online diversity of my school. I just took a medical terminology class which was self paced and completed it within one week with an A. I wish all online classes were self paced. At this school I can get my AA with only online classes which is vital to my agoraphobia."
Sophomore,5,Wonderful college! Love the coaches and advisors everyone answers accordingly to emails and phone calls. No one is rude or looks miserable working.

Freshman,5,"I love the campus, the admin and teachers are really friendly. 
The class size is small and thus the teacher knows all the students in the class."
Freshman,5,"I liked the college! The smaller classes made me feel like I could really participate in class, like I wasn't floundering in a sea of 300 people in one lecture. The teachers had time for you and if you had a problem, all you had to do was ask for help."
Sophomore,5,Have a great variety of programs to choose from  and easy ways to pay for schooling. The renovations at the Lake Mary campus are making the school look awesome.
Senior,5,I like how the cost and how it cheaper for me and more flexible for me. I also love how you are in charge of your own education and you get to pick your own schedule. Seminole state also has a very great thing of letting you choose your specific placement as far as class wise and that is one thing I love about this college. I recently did dual enrollment in school and the overall experience was excellent.
Niche User,5,"I enjoy the small class sizes and how well the teachers try to help each individual student. Every class taken has been a whole new experience, and the online classes are very well set up."
Sophomore,5,Admissions and guidance was helpful and very accessible.  Provided proper knowledge and useful tips to complete transfer.
Niche User,5,The student experience at Seminole State is amazing! The teachers are great and campus staff is always helpful.
Sophomore,5,I am currently taking and have taken online courses through Seminole State College and I've had an overall positive experience. I've only encountered a few not so great teachers but that didn't stop me from passing. The campuses are very nice as well.
Sophomore,5,I'm absolutely in with the new student center at Seminole State because everything and everyone is in one building from my advisors to the bookstore to the cafeteria  purely genius!
Freshman,5,Seminole State is a really great college to go to especially if you are a full time employee. not only do they have a couple convenient locations they also offer many degrees and classes online.e
Freshman,5,"My name is Daphney Jean-Francois. I have complete my first semester at seminole state , i had classes both online and on campus. My professors were great and i can't wait to go back after the break"
Freshman,5,It’s a great and diverse college where you can expand your horizons. The faculty is excellent and they are focused to help the students. Seminole State counts with a great number of clubs and extracurricular courses. This college also counts with a great honor program that helps the students to get a lot of scholarship opportunities. One of the best qualities of this college is it’s organization. The registration process is simple and there is a lot of help for it.
Niche User,5,Seminole State offers a numerous amount of classes with great professors for a really great price! I am currently a dual enrollment student and I love it. Everyone makes me feel welcomed and offer help in any subjects I might be struggling with. They also have available computers and tutoring every day.
Sophomore,5,I have always loved that the classes are quite small so everyone can have questions answered and help received. The staff are always willing to work with you and they have tutors on campus for all classes.
Sophomore,5,Very friendly environment. Professors are very knowledgeable. Great place to learn! I would definitely recommend to a friend.
Niche User,5,"Great place of opportunity, they have a variety of new bachelor degree programs that you can seek. They have a lot of great professors that could provide personal help unlike large uneversities."
Junior,4,My experience at Seminole State college was a great experience with very helpful and caring people who will guide you all the way. What was amazing to me was the Public Safety building with so many labs with real life scenarios.
Graduate Student,4,Online classes aren't bad at all. Everyone learns differently so be sure to do what works best for you and your learning style.
Graduate Student,4,The school is great! There are several beautiful campuses that are all conveniently located in the Orlando area. Students are nice and friendly. Professors are hit and miss sometimes.
Junior,4,Seminole State truly provides a safe environment for students to grow. They constantly provide opportunities to get involved and expose yourself to diversity.
Alum,4,Friendly environment. Faculty and staff really want to see you go as far as possible. There is really no way for you to fail.
Freshman,4,"Quick and efficient to say the least. Everything is very organized and easy to find, making it finding your class one less thing to stress about."
Freshman,4,It's a great school. My only critique is that contacting your advisor can take longer than expected.
Sophomore,4,The online experience was pretty good but it was hard to keep in touch with the professors and the admins.
Freshman,4,"I like this school very much. I appreciate the professors and the staff in general. The campus locations are very nice and well kept. However, I do have issues with them in terms of residency. Anyone who graduated in Florida will have no issues with this school."
Niche User,4,"It has been mostly online. The times I've needed to go to the campus have been enjoyable and very easy to manage. They could stand to be a bit more time efficient in the library, but it wasn't too bad of a wait to get my books."
Alum,4,My experience at Seminole was fantastic. My professors were very knnowledgable and honest. They made my online classes and experience a breeze.
Sophomore,4,"This college really is where you can get the most bang for your buck. I have been a student as Seminole State for a while now and love how affordable the classes are. They have a pretty strict attendance policy and you must be in class or you can be dropped which is inconvenient. But they have numerous programs available and almost all of the teachers I have had have been excellent. The small class size helps the teachers be more individualized in your education. The teachers really care about the students and its obvious they want you to succeed. Overall, its a great college to be a part of."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoyed the laid back approach that Seminole state professors make. The classrooms are small enough to have meaningful relationships with your professors. It is a little more difficult to make friends at this college due to the fact that the students just show up for their respected class and head straight to work right after for the most part.
Sophomore,4,"I generally liked being a student at seminole state, my main campus was altamonte  and I attended 1 class at sanford one summer. Great value for the price per class if your dependent on grants and personal income like I was."
Sophomore,4,"I had an amazing experience in this college! I came to college not expecting much, but Seminole State College offered me opportunities that I never knew of. I would highly recommend that you get involved on campus in order to get the most out of your experience!"
Sophomore,4,I like how one of the campuses is conveniently close to my house and I do not have to drive far away for school. The campuses are beautiful and most of my professors have been amazing.
Sophomore,4,Due to it being a community college there are no dorms/housing but they do offer assistance. It's a great starting point for those who would like to further their education on a budget.
Sophomore,4,Very down to earth it felt like a regular school with just regular people. Very inclusive to all adults even people with kids and or disabilities. I enjoyed being there. Good range of pretty cool professors. They could use more BA programs though.
Sophomore,4,"The teachers are fantastic, so far I’ve done very well in all my classes. It’s all thanks to their amazing teachers!! Also the advisors have been super helpful."
Alum,4,Very good option if you wish to matriculate to a 4-year university. Awesome way to save money. Academics are great and it still feels like you're getting that cool college experience......kind of.
Junior,4,Most of the professor were very helpful. The only thing that I did not like was the Academic success center where you get help did not have people that could help with every class.
Sophomore,4,"If you want to go to an affordable and easy college to prepare you for your dream university, then you should go to Seminole State College of Florida. The college is very affordable and you get a solid college education while you are there. The people there are generally friendly and the teachers care and are there to help you and prepare you for your future. The only downside is that not all classes are available at all of the campuses so scheduling can be tough but other than that I liked the school."
Sophomore,4,"Seminole State College is a great school! There are many clubs to join and extracurricular activities to do. The class sizes are small, so students have an opportunity to have one-on-one time professor if they need it."
Sophomore,4,I wish there was more choices for on campus classes for student with regular working full-time jobs. Online classes tend to be more difficult to grasp hard concepts without the teacher-student classroom learning setting.
Sophomore,4,"It is a very open school and I am able to explore a lot of my favorite subjects; however, a lot of the subjects do not have many classes available, therefore, I must apply early to get in."
Niche User,4,"Nice professors and a nice campus. The classes are only up to 30 students, which is great for students who work better in a smaller environment. Everyone is really friendly and the classes are really easy."
Sophomore,4,"I loved SeminoleState
The teachers and students are very helpful!
I've always had the tools and resources on hand whenever I needed them and the food is healthy."
Freshman,4,"Not only is the campus with its recent renovations an absolute beauty to behold but the people from the staff, students and professors are a joy to be around. What I love the most is that the staff is committed to advocating for the students in not only providing them with a great education and curriculum but motivating them in pursuing what they want in life. In addition, I absolutely love the culture and ethnic diversity that Seminole State offers. Being a Hispanic it is refreshing to bond with other professional individuals of my culture while simultaneously interacting with other people of multiple backgrounds and that alone reminds me of the beauty of humanity and importance of diversity. Many other universities are titans in both scale and quantity and thus it's easy to become overwhelmed and lonely, but here I believe students not only have a chance to enhance their education but gain a sense of belonging and community."
Junior,4,"Although the campuses are beautiful and class sizes are kept small, but they have multiple campus locations. While that may be ideal for some people, I find it hard to take classes at Altamonte campus(the campus closest to me with the nursing program i'm working towards) because some courses are only offered on a specific campus (like in sanford/lake mary or oveido) and not others. Besides that, I suppose everything else is alright. It's a small quiet school and there isn't any trouble on or around campus at all."
Freshman,4,Community college with great staff not too expensive. The campus is clean and pretty large with great places to study even with free tutoring.
Freshman,4,"Friendly staff, nice campus, easy admissions process, great class offered, low tuition, great value for money spent, safe environment, community school, many classmates attending, positive atmosphere, flexible course offerings."
Alum,4,I only took classes at the Sanford/Lake Mary campus but it was very nice and the community is very accepting and active as well.
Freshman,4,Good school have some good teachers and small classes. The book store has what you need along with the choice of renting books. Would like to see better communication from the school.
Sophomore,4,"For a small state college that build there way up from a community college, I would say they are doing a very good job. Most of the staff and faculty are fairly helpful, with the occasional bad professor. Although, the school seems to be under constant construction, I’d say the college has a very good rating. However, I do not agree completely with there textbook service policies and vagueness when it comes to some student services."
Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere! The class sizes are small enough to get enough one on one with the professor which is great for someone like me with a learning disability that need extra help. The one thing I loved about the Altamonte campus is the staff, everyone is so helpful and always answered any question I had vs. the Sanford/lake Mary campus I always had a hard time getting answers."
Sophomore,4,"After having dual enrolled at SSC I can say that the online courses were easy to navigate and gave me the advantage of being able to learn on my own while still having almost immediate access to campus resources, teachers, and canvas."
Freshman,4,My illustration teacher and painting teacher really helped me with my portfolio for my college application to Ringling!
Junior,4,Amazing college tto furthur your education. 90 percent of the staff is friendly and there to help you succeed. Many opportunities to be included in events.
Sophomore,4,"Seminole state college is a great school if you are looking for an area that is close to home, and much smaller than your average university. Most go here their first 2 years to get acclimated with the college life then decide to transfer to a university."
Sophomore,4,"I am only taking online classes, but whenever I do go on campus, I can tell that it is well cared-for by staff and students. The staff at the bookstore is courteous and helpful, and the professors I've had so far are reasonable with their policies and do their best to help students succeed in all classes. The only thing about SSC is the lack of a variety of bachelor programs, so students must transfer somewhere else if they want to pursue a different degree than what's offered, but I wouldn't hold it against a community college like SSC."
Junior,4,"I have only attended Seminole Sate for a couple semesters, however, it has proved to be a great college. With multiple campuses that have their own unique styles, and amazing teachers who will be happy to go out of their way to help their students, I am definitely excited and looking forward to furthering my education here!"
Senior,4,"I have been going to Seminole State College for three years now. The reason why I enjoy going here is because for one, the class sizes are smaller so for me personally it is easier to learn the material. I have always had difficulty in school so the fact that I can easily talk and communicate with my professors about the material makes it even more efficient. Also, if I ever had an issue with my account or anything regarding my upcoming term all I had to do was go into the office and there was always a consultant there ready to help, making it quick and easy. I highly recommend this school even to those only interested in the two year program and then transferring to a major university."
Sophomore,4,"Seminole State is really nice if you want to start off doing introduction classes and the core classes (math, science, etc.) then move onto an university."
Niche User,4,I thought Seminole State was a great school. It provided a quality education at a price that was not completely insurmountable!
Sophomore,4,"since being and Seminole state college I've had a great experience, the new campus at Altamonte springs  looks great. he professors are nice. I met the president of the college one day while i was trying to find the college book store and she walked me through the campus to show me the location."
Senior,4,"I love the campus experience and I love the professors they are very professional and they truly care about their students. However, I wish the school offered more programs."
Alum,4,It was a perfect school for me to start at. I was able to adjust to the college life without having to be overwhelmed by the big university feelings.
Freshman,4,"So far, my experience has been very enjoyable. The administration is very kind and willing to work with you to make sure you got what you need to be successful.
The biggest thing they could work on is them being more attentive with students when there are issues with teachers."
Senior,4,"I have had a great experience with the teachers at Seminole State College, all of them are very supportive and have helped me achieve getting closer to my Bachelor's Degree. However not so much with the schools Academic Advisers, they did not know where to direct me for my future degree. Obviously this needs to change, because I am now financially suffering the consequences to their neglect to advise me."
Alum,4,"Great 2 year program, very helpful staff and professors. Campuses are new and clean. Student life is very active."
Senior,4,Enrolling in a program almost guarantees you a job after or even before graduation. The class sizes are small and professors become familiar with you and become excellent references for employment.
Freshman,4,"I am currently enrolled in the college and so far, it has been pleasant with regards to education and staff."
Freshman,4,"it is half the price of most top universities, it is easier to get in, it is local, the classes are smaller, and the staff and faculty rally care about my well being."
Freshman,4,"The staff is very dedicated and friendly. Even security guards go out of their way to greet students and chat with them. Teachers make sure to introduce students to the resources available at the college, like the library, tutoring, and clubs."
Sophomore,4,I really like it at seminole state college. Its an awesome place to learn and have awesome teachers. They know the material of the subject. Its been an awesome experience at seminole state. I like the fact they have events that you can participate in. I would love for them to put an accounting bachelor program in there so I can continue school.
Junior,4,It is one of the best universities in Sanford. They help student to become succeed and I am satisfy while being in this university. Just need scholarship because tuition fee and housing is not affordable. Hope I get some scholarship to help me out with this problem.
Sophomore,4,"I have just recently transferred over to SSC from Daytona State College, and i am completely in love with this school. The campus is beautiful, the advisors are so helpful and kind, especially Mrs. Walkover (10/10 recommend her)! The classrooms are smaller which is great because you can get a lot of 1 on 1 attention when you need help, and lastly but not least the campus does a lot of fun activities, all mostly held within the recently built student center! This school is great for any first year college students looking for a comfortable start with excellent teachers, staff, and students."
Freshman,4,"It is only my first year at Seminole State, but I am loving it so far. It is so much less stress than the big universities. The small class sized make sure that everyone is involved, and therefore understand the subject more. I am at the Oviedo campus, and it is beautiful there, with all the wilderness surrounding it. I really do not know why everyone does not go for the smaller college route."
Niche User,4,Easy way to get back into school.  I just wish there was more information about my career path and goals
Sophomore,4,Attending Seminole State is great. The teacher to student ratio is nice you don't feel like you go unnoticed but you aren't the only student in the room either. The library is so helpful from the hours they're open to the books and different online search engines.
Sophomore,2,Seminole State is an affordable option for people like myself who had approximately zero dollars saved for college. The classes are fairly priced but expect a cheap college experience. The seminole state staff are very unhelpful and seemingly undertrained for the job at hand. To me it seemed that seminole state best fit an adult trying to go back to school and not a new student attending college.
Junior,2,"The professors at this college are wonderful and are willing to assist their students in any way. They want to see you excel and pass their classes.  However, the administration at this college could be hand picked a little better. They do not offer much support or assistance while enrolling or while being a current student with questions. Overall this college is decent once you get all your academics in order."
College Junior,2,I don't know one thing that distinguishes us different that stands out from the rest
College Sophomore,2,I rarely if ever hear about job internships or opportunities after college while on campus.
College Junior,2,Could be a lot better.
College Junior,2,Have to take the same classes because my credits can't transfer.
College Senior,2,"Based upon my experience I do not recommend this to for military, I am retired Military this institution refused to accept my American Council on Education credits."
College Senior,2,Courses are offered at limited locations.
College Senior,2,The student center is really gross and the food isn't that great either. It needs to be updated or needs a really good spring cleaning done.
College Senior,2,Well for one I am a TV Production major and I am working on PCs (which are terrible) instead of MACs which I believe needs to be changed. You cannot work on MAC programs on a PC it is just impossible.
College Senior,2,"My campus is very small, just two buildings. I guess that it what happens when you go to community college. People are just there to get an education and move on."
College Freshman,2,Be wary of which professor you take classes with. Always check Rate My Professor before signing up for classes.
College Sophomore,2,I haven't taken any online courses. I did have to use an online program for doing math homework and I hated it.
Recent Alumnus,2,"They can be very helpful with the transition to a 4 year college.  However, there really isn't an alumni network."
College Junior,2,There is absolutely nothing outstanding about this aspect of the school. It has early and late classes. there are plenty depending on the campus chosen. its in the middle.
College Junior,2,I don't notice a big difference between my major and other people with similar majors. Not a big difference between sciences.
College Junior,2,"This is a transitional school. It does no one thing well. keeps small classes, parking lot is pretty decent."
College Sophomore,2,"i dont particularly like the online courses, just from my experience with the online tests and assignments...i prefer to have a professor there to explain things to me."
College Junior,2,Online homework is frustrating because it has to be so precise.
College Freshman,2,"Several computers are available for student use in the library, but they are usually taken by students using them for social networking sites. Printing is a hassle on campus because you have to prepay for the print job on your campus account. Each piece of paper is $.10 but you can't just pay for it at the library when you print. You have to go to the cashier's office, put money on your campus credit card then go back to the library and swipe your card to print. I have given up on using the campus resources and only rely on my personal computer and printer at home. The school network is reliable and the school computer labs in the classrooms are very nice."

Alum,5,"I really enjoyed my time at CSM as they have a small campus and small class sizes which help provide one on one classroom opportunities. They have many clubs and activities for students that live on and off campus. All of this helps create a sense of community and helps you become familiar with the staff and campus. They also offer support to different groups of students such as single mothers, dreamers and minorities."
Freshman,5,"I love the small community, and how everyone just wants to help each other achieve their dreams. The campus is small and quaint and everyone is really friendly. The academics are beyond amazing."
Sophomore,5,"The experience I have at CSM is great! Every teacher is there to offer advice and guide you toward a great path. Our logo was chosen based on the walking nuns from Ireland who would help people. That is what CSM's mission is, to prepare students to help others in the world. Which is something I have learned about a little more with attending CSM.
There is really nothing that I would change."
Graduate Student,5,"I loved that my college participated in a Spirit of Service day, where students got to go out in to the community and volunteer. It was a very neat opportunity for students to give back to their community. I participated in it every year."

The peers I am surrounded with on campus are very welcoming and the professors truly want students to excel in the program. I have been extremely happy with choosing the OTD program!
Sophomore,5,"You can tell that the teachers really care about each student. The campus and student size are small which is nice in a bigger city, Omaha."
Freshman,5,I love that your professors know how much you are investing into your education and show that through their instruction. The college always has tutors available to assist the students with their academics success. Such a great presence glad I chose College of Saint Mary!!
Junior,5,"I love the small family atmosphere. It truly is a small family, but it is in a big city so you still get the big city vibe! It is a great place to be"
Niche User,5,I liked how the staff and students are very friendly and they care about each other.  What I would like to see a change is more food options.  There isn't a lot of allergy friendly food.
Freshman,5,Great student involvement opportunities her at CSM! I live in the dorms and they are good sized rooms and well taken care of! So far my experience has been wonderful here!!!
Junior,5,College of Saint Mary has a wonderfully welcoming atmosphere. Everyone you meet is willing to talk and assist you in any way. They made my transfer process a breeze!

Senior,5,"College of Saint Mary is not just a college... It is a home. Every time I step foot through the doors, I know that there will be someone asking how my day has been, if I need help with anything, or just welcoming me with a smile. The professors truly care about your academic success and will work with you if you are struggling. My professors are amazing sources of information, but I also know that I can go to them if I have personal problems as well or just need someone to talk to. As far as the classroom goes, they incorporate many different styles of learning so you get the most out of your college experience. 
I really cannot say enough good things about College of Saint Mary. It has been the best decision that I have ever made."
Junior,5,"I love College of Saint Mary in Omaha! The academic staff are wonderful and supportive and treat you with respect and dignity. They are honestly there to help you succeed.

The class sizes are just right, you can feel comfortable in group discussions, and the instructors are very open and easy to talk to."
Freshman,5,"I work multiple jobs, but I am also a full-time student, and I am enjoying my experience here at College of Saint Mary. I love how dedicated this school is to educate women to become leaders. Even though it's a Catholic school, you do not have to be Catholic to attend, such as myself. This school is diverse and there's always something to do, and I love that. I like that on campus there are dorms for moms and their kids, I know it's really helpful for especially the single parents. I do wish there were more sports such as track-and-field. Other than that, I am enjoying my experience."
College Freshman,5,Security is excellent! Most of the girls on campus have their number in their phone for any emergency. We are able to call them at any point in the night to walk with us to the dorms if we do not feel safe.

College Student,5,"The pros: Freedom

Cons: None really depending on how far you leave and if living off campus is a distraction for you because it isn't for me!"
College Student,5,"The school is located near one of the busiest streets in town where there is lots of fast food places, restaurants and even Walmart! Food is affordable if you are in a car it is about a 3 min drive to Walmart so its literally across the street."
College Sophomore,5,they help you if you don't know how to apply financial Aid. College is good at that

College Sophomore,5,its good. you can find everything here and its close by.
College Junior,5,"College of Saint Mary is very strict in many ways, academically if your grade drops they will let you know about their policies and if you don't keep a certain gpa you will not get into your program."
College Senior,5,Many professors are internationally and nationally known researchers and writers on the topics of Occupational Therapy. I have learned a great amount of information from my teachers and believe that College of Saint Mary is constantly striving to improve their program.
College Freshman,5,My school has a very good nursing program and I'm glad to be in it.
College Freshman,5,We have underground tunnels connecting to every building.

Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the atmosphere and the environment at CSM. It is a very safe campus, and the students that are on campus are all super kind and accepting.

Freshman,4,"College of Saint Mary is a great college. The campus is very home-like and easy to get around. I would encourage a lot of freshman (women) to consider College of Saint Mary if they are worried about large Universities. College of Saint Mary has very good teacher to student ratio which is definitely one of my favorite aspects. There is only one building for on-campus housing, this makes it very easy to meet new people quickly. I am very happy I decided to come to College of Saint Mary."
Junior,4,It is a great school with amazing and engaging professors. They are always willing to help and never turn their backs on you. They truly want to help you succeed and you can really see that.
Freshman,4,"I like how College of Saint Mary is such a small campus, you really get to know the professors and are able to have one on one time. I feel comfortable to ask questions and share my ideas. The library is a great resource for studying. They have heated tunnels for the winter time or when it is chilly outside to walk to class. They have a great lied fitness center open so you can exercise and workout. They have a great security team that monitors campus making sure to keep us students safe. College of Saint Mary has opened up wonderfully opportunities for me."
Freshman,4,"College of Saint Mary had exceptional classes with great discussion and students. Most staff was helpful with academics. Math center and the coffee shop were 2 of the best places on campus, I definitely recommend visiting those places if you tour."
College Junior,4,It is a safe environment.
College Junior,4,I truly liked all the staff and faculty members here.
College Junior,4,"I live off campus, so the answers are based on what I heard about it."

College Freshman,4,There is a quality of services on campus to provide the best information for a job.
College Freshman,4,"Since the classes are small, we are able to have a lot of hands on experience and we are able to get to know our professors. There is a big variety of courses that you are able to take."
College Freshman,4,The housing process was very easy to go through. They always stayed in contact with you if there was new information about the resident halls. They are a very good proximity to classes. College of Saint Mary houses single mothers and their children in one hall and traditional in another hall.
College Freshman,4,My college is an all girls college which is unique but helpful in ways some people do not know. I transferred from Wayne State College last semester so I was able to see differences in the classroom. We get into more conversations and aren't afraid to ask questions.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus. Security is always patrolling the area.
College Freshman,4,The occupational therapy program at this school is accredited.

College Junior,4,The OT program at CSM has made great strides and I am proud to be a part of it!
College Freshman,4,"The parking lots are dark at night.  I wish they were lit up more.  There also seems to only be one security officer working at night so it kind of stinks if its late and I ask for someone to walk me to my car and have to wait awhile. Overall, I feel safe on campus, especially during the day."
College Freshman,4,The admissions process was relatively easy and quick.  The admissions staff were friendly and nice and made a good impression about the school.  In the year and a half that I've been at the school I have yet to see or talk to those people again.
College Sophomore,4,"I do appreciate the opportunity to take additional courses without additional charges after the full time requirements are made.  I do not appreciate the fact that if you are to test out of a course, you still do need to pay the credit required fees, even if the full time requirements are made.  I have been an LPN for 8 years.  I am in the LPN-to-BSN program and will be able to test out of the LPN required nursing courses required.  My choice is to take the time to go through the required LPN nursing courses again or pay the required course credits as a full time non-traditional student in order to continue on the path to my bachelor's degree."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Phenomenal Organizational Leadership Master's Program with an innovative curriculum directed by Dr. Joslin who hand selects talented faculty members.  Convenient access to wifi study area.  Small student population.  Well maintained campus with water fountains adapted to fill a water bottle at the press of a button.  Friendly and accessible college president.  

Small $5 cafeteria buffet that is really only okay for desserts.  Christina's place is overpriced and nothing a peanut butter and jelly sack lunch sandwich couldn't beat.  Small bookstore not worth the visit to buy/rent textbooks, however there are some fun accessories and good sale buys at the end of each semester.  Library and student achievement center both have rude staff."
College Junior,4,"If you go to the president, you can usually get your way. The students are usually pretty well behaved. The administration is pretty strict otherwise."
College Junior,4,"I hate having a roommate, but living in the MLL community has been so beneficial for me and my child. I plan on staying here my entire college career."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the Express Center office, the ladies are very nice and willing to help when needed. It is the hardest thing ever to get the school to help out with financial expenses. It is an ongoing headache and you have to deal with it every semester."
College Student,4,I have not stayed in the dorms long but I do know its strict in regards to visitors (males) after hours and etc pretty basic catholic all girl school rules nothing major
College Student,4,"Everything about College of Saint Mary Is great , except for the cost. The school is very very expensive without a scholarship and the dorms for the freshman's are small. Otherwise its a great school"
College Sophomore,4,There are numerous options for off-campus dining that is not far from campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I recieved a scholarship when I got accepted to the school. However, with the rise of tuition each year, I need outside help in order to continue attending here."

College Freshman,4,I have not had an internship but I plan on getting one next year and being in the nursing program at College of Saint Mary helps with that.

College Sophomore,4,the people who work for financial aid are good at sending you email reminders so that you can get your award letter on time. Most of the students there receive a lot of help so that school can be affordable.
College Sophomore,4,There are all kinds or races and ethnecities in this college. There is also a great diversity in age groups.
College Sophomore,4,It all depends on who you know and who you hang out with.
College Freshman,4,they post good policies where I can understand them correctly and if I have questions I know who to go to.
College Senior,4,"I have not had an internship, but I have went on fieldwork two times.  The first time was an hour drive every day, but I would not take back that experience because it was beneficial to me in multiple ways.  The second fieldwork was a little different.  I only drove about 15 minutes, but I felt like I got very little out of the experience.  The facilty at College of Saint Mary really gets you ready for the fieldwork experience and has one class per semester dedicated to doing so."
College Senior,4,"I lived on campus for two years and in those two years I never heard of anybody getting caught with drugs on campus.  I did have a friend that was caught drinking underage and she received a school MIP. The college is a wet campus, but they continuously check the rooms and make sure that no one that is underage is drinking.  The peer pressure at the school is very minimal.  If you don't want to do something, then the students are excepting of that."
College Junior,2,"They are still trying to figure out the best way to make the food. The lunch ladies are RUDE. The food is not horrible, I wish they would stick with basic options that they know and stop experimenting with random food thrown together."
College Freshman,2,There are a lot of lesbians that go to my school which is not a bad thing but they go because its an all girls school.
College Freshman,2,"I have noticed it can be hard to recieve aid, however if you stay in touch with them, your advisor and teachers, they will make it happen."
College Freshman,2,financial aid at my college is not the best at all. I feel that a lot of students have to drop out because they are not offered aid. This is very sad because the students that the college gives aid to are only mothers and really really thats about it. When students can't make payments the college really doesnt seem to help out at all.
College Junior,2,We have a small campus so many of the students live on campus or at home. There are several students who live off-campus but they find their own housing and the school does not pay for that.
College Student,2,"As a freshman, I lived on campus in Walsh Hall as part of the Mothers Living and Learning Program. You were allowed to live with your children up to age seven on campus. The program was a great idea but their follow-through was lacking. It was very disorganized and it was not the greatest social atmosphere. They charged a mint for it."
College Freshman,1,We do not have any Greek life on campus.
College Sophomore,1,Campus life is horrible. I had a roommate from hell who would steal my stuff and come home late at night. The hall ways can be loud at night. I'm living off campus next semester.
College Sophomore,1,My school does not have a greek life and it's an all girl's school.
College Sophomore,1,I am a cross-country runner and the facilities are terrible and no one comes to meets.

College Freshman,1,"There is no Greek Life at College of Saint Mary as far as I'm aware. I don't live on campus, though."
Recent Alumnus,1,I was in the MAT program.  Faculty are not trained.  Program is unorganized.  I had a 4.0 and excellent recommendations until my last CT.  8 days before Graduation I was dismissed from the program due to a C on her evaluation.
College Freshman,1,There really is no sort of party scene at that school that I know of. I also do not live on campus
College Sophomore,1,"WAY TOO STRICT. I don't understand why, we're all adults and we are being treated as if we are in a daycare. It is completely unnecessary."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have any parties at all. NONE. Most people go to Lincoln or UNO.
College Sophomore,1,There is none. You have to know people who go to the coed college down the street.
College Sophomore,1,I don't go to party and we don't have part y in college because it catholic school
College Junior,1,We don't have a Greek life
College Junior,1,With the school being a catholic all girls school there are no parties on campus.
College Senior,1,Harder to find scholarships for post grad
College Senior,1,"they do not accept any greek life, but I pledged at Creighton University during my undergrad."
Recent Alumnus,1,What I think is interesting is that negative student reviews disappear from web pages somehow.  ???
Recent Alumnus,1,"In the OT program the students teach the classes and their board pass rate for the last several years sucks!  Some students NEVER pass!!!  I had to stand there and lecture on how to rehab people with strokes, brain injuries, hip fractures, etc.  When I had NO experience rehabbing any of these!   "
College Student,1,"Not Much to Do – Unless you are 21 or older and have some sort of transportation to hit up a bar in Omaha somewhere, you are out of luck. There is virtually nothing to do on campus. Every once in awhile, the school offers a cookout or a dance, but they are usually a flop with a small attendance. Nightlife = look elsewhere."

Sophomore,5,"Personally, Our lady of the Lakes has the best advising service out there! They are ensuring that they know you personally and are making sure that you are feeling right at home!"
Junior,5,OLLU is a small campus so it is easy to find parking and get to class on time. The smaller class sizes also allow for better teacher/student interaction and improves my education.
Senior,5,"Overall a very nurturing environment.
I have met a diverse group of people from all over the world from this small catholic university.
Consider attending OLLU if you are a San Antonio native, the heart of West Side San Antonio."
Senior,5,"I have taken a number of online classes at OLLU from different departments. Every class has been easy to organize and find your way through digitally, even with the absence of a professor. The materials are easily found, and learning objectives are always clearly emphasized.
Even during the Corona crisis, where every class transitioned to an online format for the end of the semester, these remained the same, even with instructors that were not trained to teach online classes. This shows me that the professors were guided appropriately in the process of instructing online classes by the institution itself and that every instructor is taught the same way in order to make all online classes maintain their high status across all departments.
I am an international student, which prohibits me from taking more than 2 online classes every semester, but I would definitely not have an issue with taking more than that if I was able to."
Senior,5,"A very beautiful university that has everything that you need in a smaller area. Not the biggest campus, but it proves to be convenient, as you will never have to traverse long distances to reach the place you have to be, whether it is your classroom, the dorms, the library, the chapel, or the student activity center.
The sense of community is something the school prides itself on. The teacher love to help the students in any way they can, and multiple events are planned daily by both students, professors, and exterior sources to create stronger bonds between the members of the university.
The buildings of the university are breathtaking in terms of visual appeal, it almost looks like a castle, and the large chapel is beautifully implemented into the main building.
The opportunities to dine are also very good at this school, the cafeteria provides a lot of different types of food, and there is always food that will satisfy every type of diet."
Sophomore,5,"What I liked about Our Lady of the Lake is that the teachers are so helpful, they will always try and make time with you. They also always try and make the work easier for you. I also like that the class sizes are smaller, it makes me focus more. Another thing would be that the people who go to the school are really nice and friendly."
Sophomore,5,"The only reason as to why I took classes online was because of the pandemic and the professors did everything that they could to help us. In some of my classes we did a meeting online and it made life feel a little normal again, because I felt like I was at school. Teachers also posted and updated us about the material that we were learning constantly. They really put an effort into making sure that we understand the lessons that we got. You could tell that the teachers really cared about us and about our education."
Junior,5,"It's good, however, I prefer lecture courses. Only because I feel like there has heavier course work when taking online courses as compared to on campus lecture courses. Again, that is just my opinion but not the less they prepare you for your future career and that is all that matters."
Junior,5,It's a gorgeous campus that is so welcoming. Everything is so helpful and really gives you specialized care and direction directing you towards your success in your academics and your sure career.
Graduate Student,5,"I had a great experience while pursuing my undergrad at Our Lady of the Lake University and now my Graduate program. The environment and classes are a great size, Professors and staff is very friendly and helpful."
Sophomore,5,"Our Lady of the Lake University has been a wonderful college experience. The faculty and staff have been there for each student and for each other. The professors really work with each individual student, and this is possible through the small classes the university has."
Sophomore,5,I love my school! It is a small close-knit community and is like a small family. Faculty really care about the student's success and will work with every student no matter their circumstances. The school also had a great athletic program with very good teams. It has many options for dorms and meal plans.
Graduate Student,5,I am currently taking the online MSW program at OLLU and I love it! So far the professors are great and I've learned a lot from the material.
Graduate Student,5,I’m working on my MSW and the experienced has been wonderful.  I feel that it will change my professional future therefore my whole life.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy how small the classes are because it gives me a chance to talk to my professors one on one and really get help if I need so. The professors have been really helpful.
Sophomore,5,"What I have extremely admired and the sole reason for my existence at OLLU is the very small classes. This is very beneficial because when having an issue when understanding an assignment or any question I had at all, I am able to contact my professors with clarity that I will soon be replied back to. When looking for a college to go to, this was the most important, that the classes were small and I would get the attention I need. OLLU does have recycling bins, in class rooms, out on the lawn where everyone walks. The place where I've noticed where they do not have recycling bins is the cafeteria! The main place where people eat and throw their stuff away. This is one thing OLLU can change."
Niche User,5,When I went to visit I liked how the professors were nice and the administrative was very helpful with questions.
Sophomore,5,Been going here for almost a full two years and I love my university so much. We are a small community but a close and vibrant one.
Senior,5,I have an overall great review on Our Lady Of The Lake University.  I am really interested in their criminal justice major.
Sophomore,5,Staff and faculty at our lady of the lake are very generous and helpful. They make the transition from high school to college very smooth and peaceful. Overall the school is a very positive and fun environment.
Sophomore,5,"I have already been at this university for two years now and I love it. It is very welcoming and open. For students who want small classroom sizes, this university is perfect for those students. It has a very rich sense of history and connection with the Catholic faith. The university is constantly expanding in size and in fields for majors and minors. There is always a positive attitude there and the teachers and staff are always there to help you get your degree and walk the stage. When I first got to the university, I was nervous but have since made many friends with students, teachers and staff."
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy just about everything on the grounds. Wonderful experience, would recommend to just about anyone if they had the time and money even if not yet tangible. If you can work toward your dream then you can live through the lake experience in any form."
Sophomore,5,"This is my first year attending Our Lady of the Lake University. I transferred from a D3 school in West Texas. I am an Early Childhood Education major. So far at OLLU, it has been nothing but great times. Everyone here is very welcoming and want to see you succeed. The transition has been easy for me. It is such an amazing Univeristy and the campus is beautiful. I cannot wait to see what else is to come."
Junior,5,"I love it here at Our Lady of the Lake. Every professor I had cared so much about my success. I was struggling with a couple of classes and going through a rough time. Even though I wasn't being the best student they still believed I can make it. If it wasn't for them believing in me and speaking life to me, I would've dropped out. I'm still going through a rough time due to financing, but I have to find a way to continue going. They still haven't given up on me, I shouldn't let lack of finance prevent me from getting my degree to become a teacher also."
Junior,5,"Our Lady of the Lake has been a blessing to my life. I love that the classes are small. You're able to interact with the professor very easily. Every single professor I've had has made the learning experience so easy for me. They're teaching methods have allowed me to understand the course and the content. The University also has something going on every day. We are also very involved with our community and we're fortunate enough to be in a local area where we have a good amount of access to community services near us where most of the students attend. The university also provides a lot of services for students and the community. Their help services for the students has been a great impact through the years. Though Our Lady of The Lake is more expensive than some of us can afford, the environment and the programs that the University offers has made me feel like it is still worth attending no matter the cost."
Junior,5,I absolutely LOVE OLLU. The staff make the school beyond warm and welcoming. I have always felt like I was in a safe environment while I was at school. They are always so helpful and resourceful. The professors are always willing to help and always make themselves available to help when you are struggling.
Freshman,5,My overall experience with Our Lady of the Lake was  that they were very student oriented. If a student needed help from a financial aid adviser they would receive it as well as the professors who allow themselves to be available  to the student most of the time or provide resource to further guide them.
Freshman,5,I loved the campus as a whole . Everyone was so welcoming and supportive. They are very organized and informative. The faculty was encouraging and straightforward. Great School.
Sophomore,5,"This is a great school where you are not a number to a professor! They will work with you all you have to do is ask. Here at the lake is a small tight-knit community where they want you to succeed. You have access to all the resources that you would be necessary both academically and personally. With the school being only about 10 minutes from downtown, there is always something to do on your off time, but if you don't want to leave campus there is always some type of event happening somewhere on campus. I am glad that i chose to come to the lake!"
Niche User,5,This Campus felt like home the minute i stepped on it and i am glad i will become a part of the Saints family.
Freshman,5,I feel very comfortable here at Our Lady of the Lake University. Professors are very helpful and always encourage you to do better. I would like to change Our Lady of the Lake University to have more sports opened up to these students.
Sophomore,5,Excellent school for those who want to pursue their majors then choose this school. It offers a variety of choices to choose from.
Senior,5,Amazing life changing shcool with amazing professors who truly care for their student. Small classes make the experience more connected and the students and social life/culture is great even for communters for myself.
Freshman,5,"I really like their student life. Everyone is so helpful. The faculty and staff are the most understanding people. I'm currently a second semester freshman and I have felt nothing but welcomed. Professors have helped with my first year experience. I went into college knowing absolutely nothing, but so far I have gained more knowledge than ever. OLLU has been my best decision I have made as an adult."
Sophomore,5,I enjoying coming to the school because the professors work with and are very flexible with your schedule if you let them know on time.
Freshman,5,"When i went to visit our lady of the lake i absolutely loved it. its one of the schools that i would really like to attend if i got the chance, not only that but it help to get money to make sure i do attend."
Sophomore,5,This university has helped me grow socially and academically. They have excellent professors and the rate of students to professors is amazing.
Sophomore,5,"I love the fact that the class sizes are so small because if you take the time, you can actually create a very strong bond with your teachers (who are always more than willing to go out of their way to help their students). The campus is beautiful, everyone there is so friendly with each other, it’s such a great family to be apart of."
Sophomore,5,I love Our Lady of the Lake Univeristy because it's such a small community and all the professors you have are really there to help you succeed.
Sophomore,5,"Excellent professors - great place to live in san antonio tx - i love the ministry program and attend retreats regarding our Awakening Program - the place is just so friendly, very family oriented and a  wonderful place to be - i have gone to catholic private schools since the age of 3 years old - Holy Trinity Catholic School - Bishop Dunne Catholic High School and now Our Lady of the Lake University - I would recommend this school and all the programs they have to anyone interested - thank you for any consideration possible for me"
Freshman,5,Our Lady of the Lake University is a wonderful campus filled with amazing professors and faculty that are willing to help to achieve any goals you set your mind to.
Niche User,5,When I attended OLLU I had a great time. The class sizes were small so I had a lot more interaction with my professors and they were always there if you needed something. All the professors that I had were very helpful and I learned a lot more than I thought I was. The price was a bit high but other than that it was great.
Niche User,5,"OLLU is a beautiful campus, the enviroment is very at peace and spiritual within your fellow classmates."
Junior,5,"Such a wonderful school! Great professors, who are concerned with student's long-term goals. I applied to this university even though I am not a devout Catholic, and never have been. I was shocked to find out that this is not a requirement. This proves that this school is superior when it comes to diversity. There are people from all walks of life, including the staff."
Freshman,5,"i fell in love with the campus. the teachers are really gate. like any other college there will be parties, it just depends on if u go or don't"
Senior,5,I love the church. And all the diversity. And I love all the ideas that our lady of the lake has and the religious connection. Our lady of the lake has a lot of good things. Our lady of the lake is in a good area where there is a lot of close things.
Freshman,5,"Everyone on campus is super friendly, including the staff and the professors. I feel very welcomed and glad I chose Our Lady of The Lake University."
Sophomore,5,"Our Lady of the Lake University is an impressive haven for learning to say the least. I have been attending this institution for one year now (as an off campus commuter) and have had nearly 100 percent positive experiences. So far the professors here have been very helpful and sincere in their efforts to foster student success. OLLU reached out to me to offer scholarships when no other four year university did. Even when I struggled to pay tuition, they found academic scholarships to finance my degree plan. If a student is looking for a one on one environment that allows student growth on a mental, emotional, and spiritual level then Our Lady of the Lake University is the place."
Freshman,5,Our Lady of the Lake is an amazing campus that students can go to learn many different things. I am glad to be attending OLLU!
Sophomore,5,"Since the moment I applied to the second I registered for classes, I felt like I mattered and wasnt just a number. Excellent staff."
Freshman,5,"The faculty, staff, and administration all are very kind and helpful if you need to ask questions. Everyone is dedicated to ensuring your success as a student and providing a warm, exciting, and inclusive student life."
Junior,5,"This is a beautiful campus, with caring professors who help you succeed.  The university has a great student success center and professional writing center.  Safe campus, university police will escort you to your car at night, its amazing."
Graduate Student,5,"I am taking online courses with OLLUSA and I love it.  The counselors, the professors, and the students are amazing.  I have never had so much support from my school community as I have with OLLUSA.  If you want to attend a Catholic university, this one should be at the top of your list."
Freshman,5,I love the people here. The positive energy that fills the halls is great for not feeling like you're stuck at some university. Anyone can have a great time at OLLU!
Sophomore,5,Overall my experience at Our Lady of the Lake University has been pleasant. The teachers are engaging and the study body is extremely positive.
Freshman,5,"I have visited with OLLU and they were very helpful and inviting, I enjoyed the campus tour a the help Priscilla Elizondo gave, she was very helpful and answered all my questions even the uncomfortable ones. The interior of the building even though they are old they were very nice and well maintained. The young girl that gave me the tour of the campus provided some interesting facts about the school and the grounds. Over all my experience with the school has been great."
Junior,5,I love the history of the lake. Staff is very friendly and teachers truly care. I could not have found a more perfect university for me. I love the small campus because you truly get to know your classmates.
Graduate Student,5,Great school ad excellent professor. Staff is always professional and willing to assist student in any way possible.
Junior,5,"I've experienced an institution that give each student the ability to apply themselves toward their own degree. Ollu provides students with math, science, and writing labs to help sharpen the students skill or their work or project. The professor to student ratio is a smaller and not the auditorium size classes like in a publis university."
Freshman,5,"Our Lady Of the Lake University(OLLU), made me feel welcomed. All the students are helpful and give good advice. Living on campus has been fun so far. I love the resources OLLU has to offer."
Sophomore,4,"Like, everyone, we all have our preferences of learning and I have had my ups and downs with viral learning but OLLU provides the best service regarding online learning."
Junior,4,Most of my professors were able to transition smoothly to online teaching when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the change. There were some bumps in the road occasionally and one professor in particular could have tried to prepare better since they were obviously uncomfortable with the online platform but it was a learning experience for all of us.
Graduate Student,4,So far as a graduate student I believe this OLLU and I have been a perfect match. The overall experience has been something I will most definetly take with me and cherish for the rest of my life.
Graduate Student,4,online was challenging which in a weird way was great for me because I didn't want to pay for something and get cheated on the educational portion just because it was online. I took most courses online which were very engaging and interactive.
Senior,4,"Most online instruction at OLLU was very manageable.
This was especially helpful due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak when the campus shutdown."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely loved attending OLLU even though my time was cut short. The professors (most of them) helped me out whenever I asked them. Although I was stuck in a dormitory rather than an apartment, it did not ruin my experience in the slightest. I would have given OLLU 5 stars if all my professors were transparent and helpful."
Freshman,4,"As I mentioned previously, my learning experience was great. I loved the fact that class sizes were small and that meant that the professors were there for you."
Niche User,4,Since the day I first visited Our lady of the lake’s campus I thought that the atmosphere and the environment was the type of environment that was very welcoming. Since day one I wanted to go to school here. The staff are very helpful and understanding. I recommend this school to anyone who could possibly be interested in it.
Graduate Student,4,I am an on-line student. It has been fairly easy to do everything from the privacy of my home. I am a mom and I work so this was the perfect place to attend and get my Master's Degree.
Freshman,4,"Overall, Our Lady of the Lake has given me a wonderful experience along with education. The teachers I have interacted with have been very kind. The students have also been respectful."
Niche User,4,"Our Lady of Our Lake University is a great school. The campus is amazing. The school spirit is awesome. You can meet some nice and helpful professors here. Defenitly a school worth going to,"
Graduate Student,4,OLLU is a very well-knit community. The teachers and staff genuinely care about the students. Having smaller classes allows for a more hands on learning experience.
Sophomore,4,"The enviorment is very nice, the school really has great pride. The only thing I would like to see it improve on is the availability of parking around the school. The campus is great, I hope you decide to become an OLLU saint."
Junior,4,Everyone at OLLU is very welcoming and gives you a family vibe. The classes are small so you really get to know everyone. OLLU provides many services to help you in both your academic and personal struggles.
Junior,4,"For the most part it is an amazing school, friendly, helpful. But my religion class stressed me out. I did really good in all of my classes other than that one. I felt so discouraged and overwhelmed over this one class . I was taking four classes while working at least 24 hours a week, I was so worried I would lose my scholarship award if I did not pass that class. Other than that I really do love this beautiful school, but I do wish it was in a better neighborhood and was a bit closer to me but it is all worth it."
Freshman,4,"As my first year as a freshman here, the classroom sizes are extremely small which are useful for more interaction with the professors. I would like to see more additional classes for development especially in the language classes."
Freshman,4,I loved how small it is and how everyone knows everyone. I feel safe and I feel like the professors can really get to know each student.
Alum,4,"What I loved most about Our Lady of the Lake was the small classroom settings. Most of the classes I took were no more than 20 students.  This allowed for the professors to be able to create relationships with their students and to actually get to know them.  The atmosphere of the campus and the culture that it held by being in the west side of San Antonio, Texas, created a unique environment.  Most of the classes I took were science based, and the fact that a lake was located right next to the campus created many situations that were perfect for the professors to take the classes outdoors to do research. All of the professors were completely understanding and wanted the best for their students.  They did everything they could to prepare me for life after college.  They were also very understanding of my schedule when I was involved in collegiate soccer."
Freshman,4,"The thing I love about Our Lady of the Lake University is the teacher to student ratio. This allowed me as a student to have a better relationship with my professor rather than just being a number. The campus is beautiful and offers a lot of space for students to study or do homework. Everyone here on campus is very friendly and always willing to help it does not matter if they know you or not. Professors are always fast to get back at you with information you need and they love when you come to their office and ask questions, they truly are here to benefit the students."
Junior,4,I like Our Lady of the Lake University because of the atmosphere it provides.  There is no pressure for students to join every kind of club and there is no rush to get to class because everything is very close. I really enjoy my time here at Our Lady of the Lake!
Junior,4,"As a transfer student I have to say the adjustment to a new campus environment was a lot easier than I thought. I had excellent help by staff and administration. As far as financial aid, they've help me tremendously on how to save and what sites and foundations offer excellent scholarships and loans. In the end, it'll be all worth it."
Graduate Student,4,"I have loved my time at Our Lady of the Lake University. The faculty have extensive experience and knowledge. The university has an associated training center for psychologists and therapists in training. They also have a beautiful and calm campus. The campus is in a historically impoverished neighborhood. However, this fits the social justice principles of the Catholic university. I would recommend this school to my loved ones. Tuition is very high and financial aid is low given it is a private school. I strongly advice financial planning and preparation to ensure you can pay tuition and complete your program."
Senior,4,"I like it at Our Lady of the Lake University.  I only wish it was not , so expensive. I also wish they offer more online classes and more night classes.  The professors are really good at what they do."
Sophomore,4,"I love the environment and the safety of this small university. I love how the teachers care about every single student and they truly want everyone to succeed. I am proud to be apart of the very successful athletic program as well. Our Lady of the Lake is a great University however I would love to see it expand and grow with new buildings, more room, and a bigger student body."
Freshman,4,"Our Lady of the Lake has a wonderful program, and provides the best to its students education. The college provides the best programs to ensure the academic readiness of their students."
Freshman,4,Our Lake of the Lake University is a great school over all. I would like to change the dorms since it's a very old school along with the annual tuition. Thank you!
Freshman,4,"The school is pretty cool. I really like how small the classes are which is what you expect of a private school and the teachers that I've had so far have all been very involved with the class and do reach out if they suspect you're having trouble. Student life, everyone is pretty nice and will help you out if they see you struggling. Tuition is bleh. Besides that, small things that I would change would have to be the cafeteria food...I NEED MORE OPTIONS BESIDES DIFFERENT VARIANTS OF CHICKEN."
College Junior,4,Most professors care about your academic success. They are very helpful with any issues you may have. Most teachers want you to get the material
College Junior,4,"I haven't seen any problems so far, but making the acceptance known is a bit over done at times"
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe when I'm on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Generally good facilities for all athletic use.
College Sophomore,4,OLLU prepares students for real life employment
College Freshman,4,Constant security on campus for safety
College Freshman,4,Great atmosphere to fucus on studies
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe on campus. OLLU is located on the West Side and is said to b the rougher part of town. The university police are very helpful and make me feel secure on campus. I feel like I don't live on the rougher side of town with them. There have been incidents dealing with drugs on campus but the police handled them swiftly and promptly.
College Sophomore,4,The university had small class sizes so it was easier to be viewed as an individual rather than a number. It was also easier to establish a teacher-student relationship and get more help from professors. There was only a couple of professors I had a hard time working with because their teaching and grading styles were impractical. Courses were interesting and helpful to my degree.
College Sophomore,4,Career service center is very helpful. They specialize in researching internships and jobs and then provide that information for the students when asked. The campus employees encourage networking and have influenced students to be proactive in talking with alumni and recruiters.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms were convenient and clean. They are located near the campus making travel to and from classes easy. The only thing is that with how much they cost, one would expect a kitchen. There are no kitchens available in the dorms."
College Sophomore,4,"I loved the small-town, community feel. The university was welcoming with friendly, helpful staff, and plenty of useful programs and resources. I wish, however, that the program I am currently enrolled in wasn't so limited. I thought it was what I wanted and it ended up being very antiquated and not advanced enough to where I originally thought it was. Aside from that, my experience with the university has been very enjoyable."
College Sophomore,4,"Te campus police is always around and alert, and their numbers are posted in the hallways of the dorms. The campus provides emails and group talks that provide the information for any service we may need in the case of an emergency, disturbances, theft and so forth."
College Sophomore,4,The class sizes are a good amount so that students can connect with their professors. There are a few that do not help and are rude. There are a few courses that are required that do not pertain to some majors. Most of the searchers try or are actively involved in a student's career.
College Sophomore,4,The resident assistants always provide activities for people living on campus. They do complain about their job a lot and do not enforce the rules too often. They are often the people breaking the rules. They are very organized most of the time as well.
College Sophomore,4,The school and professors are extremely helpful. They are always trying to push you to do your best. They provide a lot of materials in order to help you with any difficulty. You are also able to connect with the professors more since the clasrroms are smaller.
College Sophomore,4,"It's great if your an athlete, if not then you won't get much recognition."
College Junior,4,"For the Education field, we are more than likely getting a job where we student teach at. That is very excited and a huge stress reliever."
College Freshman,4,"OLLU is a wonderful university with amazing people who are always surrounding you. As a student athlete who lives on campus, I am always involved and find myself enjoying my time at the lake. My favorite experience so far is winning the conference championship for the first time on the volleyball team at Our Lady of the Lake University."
College Sophomore,4,our security officers work with the San Antonio Police Department to ensure greater security in OLLU.
College Sophomore,4,The Professors here in OLLU are very helpful. They want for you to succeed and if you need help in anything their office door is always open or they are an email away.
College Sophomore,4,The staff in the career and development center are always there to help build up your resume and help you look for internships.
College Sophomore,4,Flores Building is the best dormitory
College Sophomore,4,Sport Life in OLLU is good! The only negative issue is I wish more people go to the games.
College Junior,4,Our safety and security is great and I feel safe.
College Junior,4,It's a vibrant school that offers top professors in their field to give you the full expertise for your future.Everyone is friendly and strives for you to succeed. No one wants to see you fail. We have some of the oldest historical buildings with beautiful landscape and it's all located in the west-side heart of San Antonio.
College Junior,4,"The sports offered are softball, basketball, baseball, dance, and a few more. The most popular are baseball softball, and basketball. Our school is mild-moderate on team spirit."
College Freshman,4,Everything runs very smoothly at the dorms.
College Sophomore,4,"Our school spirit is shockingly large, WINGS UP! All the sports here at ollu are equally supported and their performance is outstanding. The UWAC (gym) is probably one of the best kept up facilities here on campus."
College Sophomore,4,Campus police monitor campus 24/7. Although the area around campus isn't the best I feel safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,The classes are great! Most of my classes have an average of twenty students. The professors are very open and encourage students to speak to them. I have yet to meet a professor I haven't liked.
College Sophomore,4,There's a career fair that is hosted on campus for anyone who would like to attend. It's a great place to meet prospective employers. The career center is very helpful as well. They will help with your resume and give you tips on how to better your chances of getting a job.
College Sophomore,4,Flores Hall is one of the newer dorm halls. The laundry rooms are spacious and are on each floor. The dorms are a good size that enables you to have your own space between you and your roommate. The RAs host various events to create a social atmosphere. All in all it's an great place to call your home away from home.
Graduate Student,2,"The online Msw program is very high for what and how the professors teach. During my internship the professors were highly unprofessional, cancelling on important Skype meetings at the last minute through a text message, calling my someone else's name. My aid and class schedule got messed up during my internship to a point where I was getting harassing calls and text all hours of the day. Now that I transferred to a different msw program I am having a difficult time with receiving my internship contact and elevation so I can receive credit for it. Very unprofessional."
College Sophomore,2,There really aren't any parties on campus so don't expect to have a lot to do.
College Junior,2,It feels as if I am back in high school and everyone is separated into groups rated on popularity.
College Sophomore,2,It cost too much money to be apart of Greek life on campus and too time consuming.
College Junior,2,Our gym is so small. We can barley fit 200 people in  there. All of our sports have now won championships and have gone to nationals and haven't received anything because of it. We only have one weight room to share with other athletes and the students. It gets very cramped and crowded and there isn't enough equipment.
College Freshman,2,"Decent university with a great and passionate student body. As a student athlete, it is very apparent to see the support shown by everyone from professors to students. Unfortunately the negatives far outweigh the positives here. The cafe staff can be unprofessional at times while food and drinks are severely over priced; a case of water costs $40. The track & field being run by the current coach is an absolute joke. The unprofessional-ism and sexist discrimination portrayed by both head and assistant coaches has run the entire men's track team out the door."
College Sophomore,2,"We have an area for softball, baseball, baketball, and there is a pool, but the equipment for student to work out seems a bit too small and not enough equipment or large enough room for it."
College Sophomore,2,"It's expensive, and there's hardly ever a good vegan or vegetarian option with good hours."
College Freshman,2,Few parties. None on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"There was so much paperwork that they needed and a few times where they lost my paperwork and needed for me to order it again. I cannot stand doing financial aid, it is always a big struggle. Also, i am never notified of any problems."
College Sophomore,2,I am a vegetarian and i struggle finding restaurants where i can have a decent meal. All that's around here is Mexican resturants and fast food.
College Sophomore,2,I wish the area surrounding the campus was safer and better.
College Sophomore,2,"The school is located deep in the west side of San Antonio, not the ideal place for a college student to reside off campus. On campus however is a very safe and respected community."
College Junior,2,There is no night life here on campus. All halls are dry except for one. So even if you're 21 in a non alcohol hall you cannot drink. But downtown is close by and San Antonio has some great spots as far as on the actual campus its not as awesome as the stories from other schools that I hear.
College Sophomore,2,I do not live on campus therefore I never eat there. When I do eat there the bad thing about it is that there is not a lot of options. They have the same thing everyday.
College Sophomore,2,Our school only has minimum amount of Greek life. I never really see anything going on or hear anything about them.
College Junior,2,You have to go away from campus for nightlife.
College Freshman,2,"The dorm I live in has a good view, but it is not so spacious like other dorm room I have been to. My restroom was filthy when I moved in. The cost for some of these dorms is ridiculous, sometimes the hot water goes out. It is always cold in my room even when it is cold outside. They landscapers cut the grass every other day and do not let me sleep in piece on days I go in late."
College Freshman,2,"Here in Texas the weather is unpredictable, one day hot the next cold. There was one time it rained and the it was so cold the streets froze so classes were canceled. The weather does affect very little but is very critical."
College Freshman,2,"The weather here in San Antonio is bi polar. Its humid one day then windy, rainy, freezing, normal temperature I don't like it at all!I start to feel sick sometimes"
College Freshman,1,"As a former track athlete at OLLU, this is the worst program I've been a part of. There is no track on campus, so practices were conducted at a high school track 10 minutes away. The coaching being done by someone who does not nearly have the normal accolades and requirements that a college track coach should have."
Recent Alumnus,1,Administration is weak.   Too much alcohol allowed.
Recent Alumnus,1,Smell and unsanitary.  Workers pocket the money - i have seen it.   Too much corruption between staff and campus police.
Recent Alumnus,1,"OLLU is not a place I will ever send my younger siblings to.   The education system lacks discipline, companies do not hire from OLLU due to the students not prepared.   It's not the students fault, it is the programs.   For example, only one student who graduated with a Biology degree went on to further their education, due to their high mcat scores.   All the rest of the students ended up with regular jobs, call centers, used car sales, etc.   It's very sad that so many parents and students spend so much money on their education but do not get a degree to even help them in today's job market.   Do not send your kids here."
College Freshman,1,"It's all fast food, TALK ABOUT FRESHMAN 15!"
College Sophomore,1,"The city of San Antonio is more suited for those who are over the age of 21 and so is the university. It being a small campus, there is not a lot of room for typical college ragers and social gatherings, so the nightlife is really more suited to thrive off campus."
College Freshman,1,there really isnt a night life on campus but we are close to down town so if you have a car you can go off campus
College Freshman,1,there is no variety and very expensive for what you are getting
College Freshman,1,large group of students who smoke weed publicly and don't get reprimanded
College Senior,1,There are not many places to eat unless you like fast food. Pizza hut gives us a discount.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Practically non existent it is a miracle the students don't starve. There are maybe 10 tables in their ""cafeteria"" and you can either have something from the ""grill"" or have what someone there considers to be pizza and they have a staff of 5 or 6."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Everyone is Hispanic or Latino and not only that but their education seems to be below par. Everyone speaks as thought they only finished middle school and sounds completely uneducated. Pleople there are rude and the staff has no customer service skills. This does not feel like a private university, it actually feels like a low income government college. I truley don't know what kind of education I will receive here but things do not look good so far..."
College Freshman,1,"I am from San Antonio, as much as I love our school, and I do, I would never live on the side of town its located. 
There are not many apartment complexes, and even though they have made houses into apartments the nieghborhood is not very safe."

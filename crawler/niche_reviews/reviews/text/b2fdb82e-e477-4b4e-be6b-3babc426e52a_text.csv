Freshman,5,"The professional staff at NDNU is very friendly and quite helpful with student's needs and concerns for financial aid packages.  I am also happy with the mental health department how easy it is to talk to someone who really cares about student's mental health.  What I love even more is the small classroom sizes.  The university's grounds are quite beautiful - it reminds me of a scene from the fairytale books my mom read to me as a kid. Only this time, I am Snow white and I’m feeding an apple to a fawn. I’d recommend NDNU to incoming freshman."
Freshman,5,really good school. Primarily choose to attend it due to it being small and for the opportunity to continue playing soccer. So far the staff has been very helpful and accommodating especially for athletes. The resources offered are redly available and its easy to seek help compared to other big schools
Junior,5,I received a big scholarship which really helps me a lot. The class size here is very small so I have a lot of opportunities to talk to my professors. The professors here are very delicate for teaching.
Freshman,5,"I came here not knowing anyone, but it was easy to make friends here. I also really like that it is a diverse campus and I feel at home here."
Senior,5,"Belmont is an amazing city to go to college and enjoy life. While it can be expensive, it is safe and the campus is beautiful. The buildings and architecture paired with the campus' location atop a hill in town, it makes for a breathtaking display."
Senior,5,"The campus is gorgeous! It's in a good part of Belmont with close to shops and stores.  Students are very helpful, staff as well.  Professors really care about you and you can make appts. with them quickly.  Notre Dame is a Catholic University, but all are welcome.  There is a good atmosphere where you feel welcome."
Graduate Student,5,"I'm currently in the graduate program for MFT, Art Therapy.  I love the program as well as the small class size and personalized attention each student receives."
Graduate Student,5,"I couldn't be happier with this school. It has exceeded all of my expectations. The professors are inspiring, my classmates and future colleagues are very knowledgeable, the campus is small and easy to get around. I am in a Clinical Psychology program with an emphasis in Marriage Family Therapy and everyone in the program has been absolutely kind, compassionate, and hard working. The only thing I have experienced that has been a little bit of a downfall has been the poor wifi connection and the buildings are outdated. Other than that I wouldn't change my decision to attend Notre Dame De Namur."
Senior,5,"International Business professor Reem Gohar
is very passionate and excellent at engaging all students in class"
Senior,5,I liked the way the professors teach. They are engaging and helpful when it comes to classroom discussion and assignment help.
Senior,5,Over all my experience at Notre dame has been excellent. The people at the school are very helpful and are always willing to lead a hand no matter the situation. The sisters at the school are great people to sit down and converse with. The teaching staff is amazing. I would recommend anybody that is looking for a great school with a very diverse campus and college life to come to Notre Dame.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Notre Dame De Namur has been great, I would say the smaller class size is the best part of attending a small school.  Living on campus and having a food plan has been extremely convenient, good food and nice rooms.  The cost of tuition would be the only negative that I have experienced."
Freshman,5,Notre dame de Namur is a really good school I like this school because the clases aren't super big there is about 23 or less students in your clases I think I really like this because you get to know your professors and they know you . This is a really nice school it's small really hard to get lost people really nice and also staff
Niche User,5,"My experience of Notre Dame de Namur has been amazing, because the people there had been really helpful and every time I have a question they always answer it and the people there are really nice and respectful."
Recent Alumnus,5,I feel safe walking anywhere in Belmont.
Recent Alumnus,5,It's important to do the work to earn it.
Recent Alumnus,5,Everyone is a team player.
Recent Alumnus,5,"So far I've received all the information I've asked for, it seems that everyone is very helpful and goes above and beyond to help one another."
College Sophomore,5,Our school makes sure nobody has to go through sexual assault or anything of the sorts. The campus is very safe and makes you feel safe it's so small that it makes you feel safe wherever you are.
College Junior,5,There are people from all over the world that attend this University and its incredible.  I love learning about cultures and it is great knowing there is someone that can describe and explain where they come from
College Junior,5,My best experience with the school is that I can make friends a lot more easily than other schools I have been in. Everyone at NDNU is very friendly.
College Sophomore,5,It's probably the most focused concern on campus
College Student,5,What makes my school unique is the time and attention they put into the school and community
College Freshman,5,The food and dining on campus is spectacular and I personally love buying the sandwiches there. I usually pay with cash because I am currently a commuter.
College Sophomore,5,"Teachers are very focused on actual learning, not just test taking!"
College Sophomore,5,NDNU has a very diverse community. Everyone is accepting of others.
Recent Alumnus,5,I love my program the teachers have a passion for the subject and want to help the students succeed
Recent Alumnus,5,I love the blend of being in a town but also having lots of nature around I have seen deer on campus several times
Recent Alumnus,5,"The workload is reasonable and the assignments definitely are geared toward us understanding the material better, the building is nice and the classrooms work well with what we need for class."
College Junior,5,"For what I was looking for, the program this school offers is ideal."
College Junior,5,Even Art Room has new Macs in it!
College Junior,5,Liberal Studies accelerated program is really the only way I could have gone back to college.  Each class only meets 7 times.
College Junior,5,Climate best by government test
College Senior,5,I do not use the shuttle or zip cars because the bus and train are within a ten minute walk from campus.
College Senior,5,They offer different lunch and dinner options everyday and all the produce and meat come from farms within 100 miles of our school. Food is very affordable and tasty!
College Senior,5,"Love the weather here in the Peninsula. Where else besides Hawaii, could you wear shorts in October?"
College Junior,5,The computer labs are always available even when there is a class going on and the wireless there is always good unless there is a school wide network failure
College Sophomore,5,its great being a communications major takes a certain type of person to be able to talk to people and get through to them and my school really teaches you how to do that
Recent Alumnus,5,I am in the master's program for Marriage and Family therapy with a concentration on Art Therapy. There is a good ratio student to professor. All of my professors so far have passion for their subject and know their topic inside and out. Advisers help students take appropriate amounts of classes and the curriculum is is up to date and relevant.
Recent Alumnus,5,I came to NDNU because it has one of the top Art Therapy master's programs on the west coast. All the professors know their subject not only through academic success but through life experience as they all practice in the field. They all set the bar high for the student and at the same time offer excellent support.
Senior,4,"The professors adapted quickly to the new way of teaching and were generous with the workload. Unfortunately, the labs weren't the same but that's not in their control."
Niche User,4,"I haven't started college yet, I'm a high school senior. I visited Notre Dame in a field trip and I love/d it"
Senior,4,"Great university if you love small and intimate class sizes. The university is a catholic university but as well a commuter school which means many of the students are commuters. The university does a lot of community work which is really amazing helping and giving back to the community. NDNU is located in Belmont CA, which is a very low-key area but it has easy access to San Francisco and San Jose. The school has a good sports program, men and women's soccer are wonderful to watch as well as men and women's basketball and men's lacrosse. Men's and women's cross country always does well, the university has added men and women track and field so the sports scene has grown which makes student life better."
Senior,4,"The friends you make here are amazing. The wildlife on campus is on of the highlights, especially all the deer. The atmosphere overall is great. They try to help you in the best way possible."
Sophomore,4,Most of the teachers that I have had are very nice and are thorough at teaching their classes. Upper class students are always really nice and welcoming to the lower class students.
Junior,4,"Small private university with a great liberal arts program. Great food, but the dorms are quite old."
Freshman,4,I like the education system at the school but I wish some of the equipment and campus was more modernized for example I wish we had our own track or new equipment in the weight room or put the pool back. I like the food there and the people are all right just the campus could be expanded more than it is. I get it's private so its small but they should try and put more athletic equipment
Freshman,4,"Notre Dame de Namur University is a great small school because of the community it fosters. The Notre Dame community has an immense amount of diversity, whether it be through religious practices, ethnicities, origins, or personal experiences. It is this friendly community that makes the learning and growing experience that much more fruitful."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, the academics are very good at NDNU and it's easy to ask for help from all of the teachers because of the small classroom sizes. I've never encountered a rude or mean person on campus because mostly everyone is friendly. When you walk onto campus, there's a peaceful atmosphere and it has a boarding school feel. The new commuter lounge and the library are probably the best parts of campus, but I still wish there were more student events on campus for residents. My favorite part of Notre Dame is the support from your peers and teachers which make it easier to succeed and become successful. You'll definitely graduate in 4-5 years."
Freshman,4,"Notre Dame de Namur is a great school. There is not much of a party scene on campus, but the small classes and one on one with the teachers make up for not having a party scenery. The campus is small and very clean easy to navigate places. The professor are very interested in their students and their success."
Sophomore,4,"Great if you like smaller class sizes, and look to form bonds with professors. Professors are willing to help you and actually have the time to help you due to the small class sizes. Tons of out of class resources as well if you need added help."
Junior,4,Its a wonderful experience and very nice having a small campus to be able to get around faster. If you like small school this one is perfect for you! It is very easy to get into contact with professors.
Niche User,4,"During my time at Notre Dame de Namur University, it was great but there were a few flaws. The school has a terrible student service. However, in person, their service is phenomenal!"
Freshman,4,"What I've enjoyed from NDNU is the fact that the school is so small. Because it is so small, each student is able to stay in touch with their professors and actually have a one on one relationship with each professor. One thing I would change would be the level of hardness each class is, it is very easy to pass without a challenge."
Senior,4,Class sizes are usually less than 30 which is really great. Students are able to get one on one help by their professors if needed and are easily approachable.
Alum,4,I made a lot of new friends and met my boyfriend through one of my friends. My teachers were nice and they all knew me by name.
Junior,4,I am a junior at Norte De Namur University.  I like attending this school because it's small and because it's small you can have a one on one relationship with your teachers.  I have had a great experience since I've been attending here at Notre Dame due to the student activities they have on campus that you can be involved with. If there is anything I would change about the school it would be that more diverse units would be allowed/accepted to be transferred into the school.
College Senior,4,One of the greatest university that I joined
College Sophomore,4,The professors are good they try to make sure that everybody knows what they're doing when  it comes to the material being taught. The classes are fun and the work load is manageable.
College Sophomore,4,It had good rooms and they were very well monitored the the RA's and they rooms are also very comfortable. It literally takes you 3 minutes to walk to your class from any of the dorms.
College Sophomore,4,It has many helpful events in which students are encouraged to interact with each other as one. It also has many people from all over the world therefore you get to make connections from many different places. The professors are easy to approach and do anything they can to help you out.
College Sophomore,4,"A lot of opportunities, it just depends on the student of how capable they are"
College Sophomore,4,"The quality of education is top notch, just very expensive to attend."
College Sophomore,4,Generally care for the safety of its students
College Sophomore,4,Two gyms with lots of equipment to choose from
College Sophomore,4,"Classes may be small and limited amenities, but the quality of education is great."
College Sophomore,4,Love all of the classes I have had. Teachers care about you if you try and come to class.
College Sophomore,4,From what I hear it is good. People always tell me they knew someone with a degree from here.
College Sophomore,4,I really like the school
College Junior,4,There are so many classes to take here and the teachers are all very approachable.
College Junior,4,"I love being an athlete, the training room needs an upgrade though."
College Junior,4,I love playing on the soccer team. I love my major
College Sophomore,4,"The quality of the courses offered at the school is great. The professors challenge you in thinking about how you would process a text. The class styles are different depending on the class that you are taking. I took a class that was called Lit Review, and in every class we had a seminar and we talked about the poems that we were reading and asked questions to the class as well as examine the different parts of the poem. In other classes the professors lecture for an entire class and we just take notes. Overall the are great and it also depends on the class that you are taking to see the different class styles. The class sizes is excellent because there are not more that 18 students per class unless its a class like biology of chemistry that has a class size of not more that 30."
College Sophomore,4,"I fell very safe on campus. There are public safety officers patrolling the school and because the school is small, that makes is easy for them to go around campus. I have hear of two cases of domestic violence at my time at school. Other than that I have not heard of any other thing that makes me have a concern for my safety."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms in the campus are great. My freshman year I had two roommates and we had the biggest dorm because the other students had one roommate opposed to us that had two. We keep our room clean and we also had a bathroom on our hall so we had to walk out of our room to use it. The people that cleaned the bathroom did a good job and they cleaned it everyday between 12pm-1pm. The housing process as easy in that I choose the lowest form of paying for housing. I payed about $3,200 per semester for having 3 people inside my dorm including me. If you had 2 people in your dorm including you, it costs $4,179. If you lived in an apartment with another person you could pay $4,978. Finally if you lived in a single room, you would pay $4,868. The social atmosphere was great because there are males in females living in your hall and you get to have events like watch movies, go the the theaters, go bowling, or even go to a san francisco giants game. I personally liked living on campus my first year, but like I lived less than 10 miles away from campus, I would drive my second year at the university."
College Sophomore,4,you get what you put in
College Sophomore,4,Personally I do not know of anyone who has been sexually assaulted here
College Sophomore,4,We don't have any issues on this subject we are pretty good about keeping the students safe
College Junior,4,"The school is great, but I wish I didn't have to deal with the loans."
College Junior,4,"I feel safe to be on campus, but only in the daytime."
College Freshman,4,I always see campus security walking around school when I'm there in the morning and afternoon. I don't have an experience with them at night because i go home but i always here people talking about them from there dorm experiences. You need an id to access dorm rooms so without that no one would be able to go inside.
College Freshman,4,All courses are efficient and great. Teachers really try to push you to do your best. Always reminding to study and giving motivation. Quality is at best. They really stick to the schedule and have a lot of tasks to do for students to make sure they get the best of the courses. The class sizes are really small up to 30 students. And the variety of classes are great. My smallest class so far was 12.
College Freshman,4,"I love is close family atmosphere and culturally diverse community of students. It's easy to talk to people and who who they are. The teachers care about your performance and engage with you in class. Although it does feel more like a high school than a college because of small classes and more attentive teachers, I feel they doesn't take away from the college level education."
College Senior,4,"The staff, advisers, student services are there to help the students to do well in all of their classes. There are extended hours at the library for the final term. There is help with the assistance of fathers, sisters at the church for support. The class size is reasonable for day or night students. The teachers are always friendly, being available during office hours, or e-mail to get in contact with a professor."
College Senior,4,"It would be nice to have student club activities that can help the community. It could try to focus more on sport teams and clubs that student would want to join. Definitely the professors, adviser are friendly, caring and helpful dealing with registering and finding the classes within a certain time frame."
College Junior,4,I love the class size.
College Junior,4,"Our campus is very safe, public safety is always on patrol."
Recent Alumnus,4,It is an old campus with up to date technology. Everyone is so wonderful.
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience at NDNU has been primarily a positive one. What makes my school unique is the diverse population of  students; around 30 percent are Hispanic/ Latino, along with other minority groups who are also a significant part of the school's ethnic make-up. The fact that this is a Hispanic serving institution makes me feel that this school will best support me out of all the other schools that I applied to, which is one of the reasons why I chose to attend."
College Senior,4,It's great. It has a small college feel with sports events of an upper college like San Jose State.
College Senior,4,"I really enjoy NDNU. The small class sizes really help me stay focused and actually learn the subject matter. Most of the teachers are great and want to see you succeed and will do anything they need to, to see that happen."
College Freshman,4,I make the most out of it.
College Freshman,4,"Pricey, and nice little shops, but a little bit of walking. It's a nice neighborhood though."
College Freshman,4,"Nice choice of restaurants nearby in walking distance, just very pricey. I would prefer to eat there instead of on campus, but I would go broke."
College Sophomore,4,They are very kind and helpful
College Freshman,4,Organic products used and food for the most part taste good. Just sometimes they get too repetitive.
College Freshman,4,Few people get sick and serious matters such as sexual assault are discussed with the class as a whole as a preventive activity.
College Freshman,4,They do their job well
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus
College Freshman,4,I learn and teachers are very helpful. Classes area challenging
Graduate Student,2,This school has a 95% acceptance rate and has a very high tuition for the education you get. I don’t advise anyone go here unless they like a very small school experience and lack of being challenged.
College Junior,2,"I have only heard that our sports program is decent to bad, however, not have actually attended any sporting events."
College Sophomore,2,I've had my fair share of bad professors at this university. There are hidden jewels amongst them though. Sadly there are too far between.
College Sophomore,2,School is very expensive for what it provides. Campuses is indeed small and diverse but the education is subpar. There are too many professors who don't care to be there which lowers the morale of students who intentionally did not want to be there. University should be converted into a community campuses.
College Sophomore,2,You have to fight really really hard to get money
College Freshman,2,"Where do I start. The lounge in one building smells like cat piss, and the study lounge in the building gets so loud during ""quiet hours"" that it's impossible to study. Pretty much any place you go to in order to study peacefully will be incredibly loud and busy during quiet hours. The kitchens are terrible and in need of repair very badly. One oven doesn't work, one oven hardly works, half the microwaves don't even work, and they're usually dirty or the plate inside is broken/stolen. Expect extremely cold showers in some halls. The social atmosphere here feels like a negative high school experience, except instead of being able to go home at the end of the day and lock yourself in your room, you live through it all day long. If you do not get along with a person on campus, chances are you will still run into them EVERYWHERE you go, including every time you go out to get a meal. Even if you change rooms to get away from a bad roommate, chances are you will still be in the same building and/or floor as them since freshman are housed in only two separate buildings. (Note that gossip here spreads like wildfire since it's a very small school. Honestly, I thought people would be a little more mature than a group of middleschoolers.) The rooms are incredibly cramped,  and triple rooms are not worth the money save unless you're okay with claustrophobia. Honestly the only reason it's gotten 2/5 is because I had a very sweet RA who actually cared about residents."
College Freshman,2,There are no big parties on campus and if there is they get shut down really fast
College Freshman,2,there is no school spirit when it comes to athletics unless its other athletic teams providing the support.
College Freshman,2,Off campus living is extremely expensive and hard to find around campus
College Freshman,2,The administration makes false accusations on particular people just by association which puts some people under stress for dealing with something they weren't even a part of.
College Senior,2,Apparently 30% of the population on campus are commuters and yet the school seams to not acknowledge that. There are so few places that a commuter can park since the parking spaces are always taken.
College Sophomore,2,Off-campus housing is very expensive! I would only live in campus.
College Freshman,2,"I feel like there should be more freedom in terms of drinking on campus regardless of age. It's safer for kids to drink on campus than to sneak into clubs off campus, you know?"
College Sophomore,2,cost is okay. miles can run up too high. I feel that the need for a shuttle/ buss that can provide students with transitions to outside places or even a lift up the hill when buying grocery.
College Student,2,It's a catholic university…they are strict about everything.
College Freshman,2,"They should open it more, and include a better variety of majors."
College Freshman,2,"I am still going through the ""major changes"""
College Freshman,2,"At our campus, it doesn't seem like we have a nigh life."
College Freshman,2,"The campus could add more transportation methods, since we are on a hill."
College Freshman,2,"I love the weather here, but more back in LA."
Niche User,1,Terrible communication and a very bad experience for all students. Was not suitable for the unexpected pandemic transition to online learning.
Niche User,1,"From the price to the food, all the way to the facilities and athletics, this school is absolutely terrible."
Freshman,1,"This school is terrible. First, the campus is dry and boring, there is no student life and the management is terrible. The offices here have a terrible lack of communication and it is definetly not worth the tuition price. The food is mostly the same all the time and many students complain about it. It is also in an area where there is nothing to do unless you drive almost an hour away. In the one year I spent here as a freshman, I have only been depressed to be here and dread SO much going back that I will be applying to transfer as soon as possible."
Junior,1,You can see the lack of funding here. Only spent a year here more than ready to move on to a university that will give me an academic challenge. 1/10 would not recommend.
College Sophomore,1,"I guess I can only rate Greek life as the worst, because our school is a private catholic college so we don't have Greek life."
College Sophomore,1,We don't allow Greek life on campus
College Senior,1,"There was no other option to answer this since there is no Greek/faternity,cappa sigma at this university. The reason is the university is private and is a catholic school."
College Sophomore,1,I hate listening to drunk people
College Freshman,1,Just so prodigiously empty in the party scene category.
College Sophomore,1,There is no night life at NDNU it's really sad....
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life and the school seems to not want to do anything with Greek life there which in a sense sucks. There should be sororities and fraternities established on campus. Hopefully that changes soon.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life at the school.
College Freshman,1,The school doesn't really care about any other sports other than Basketball.
College Student,1,"They do not offer any underwater basket weaving courses, which I have undoubtedly been offered when I first applied to the school.  The school then decided that they do not want to offer the class that I wanted to take ever since I was in kindergarten."
College Freshman,1,faculty is slowly diminishing as well as the programs they offer. it is high school in both student life and faculty. it is disappointing to see the departments fighting for funding and control.
College Sophomore,1,"this is due to the unnecessary strictness. Obviously underage drinking and drug use is against the law, and it must be enforced, but one can't even talk about the underage drinking that took place off campus without having an RA peek through your window or have their ear against your door. The RD has good intentions for the school but she comes off as really unfriendly, she does not believe that there should be any ""adult age appropriate"" events because she thinks people will be too loud and rambunctious. The RAs are very sneaky not only do they use sneaky tactics to get residents in trouble they are also very invasive. They focus so much on kids playing loud music but pay no attention to the constant cheating that goes on in the classrooms."
College Sophomore,1,"Belmont is very expensive, and the the community would rather the students not live in the city. To find any reasonable off-campus housing you'd have to go to Redwood City or San Mateo"
College Sophomore,1,"Housing in the beginning of the year is very unorganized. Many students get their room situation switched the day they show up due to all the lack of organization. Most student have no choice but to live on campus because the surrounding city is sooo expensive to live in. The Resident Assistants are incredibly invasive and nosey, they are constantly on some kind of high horse. On a more positive note, the resident halls are really close to everything on campus...well thats the only redeeming quality"
College Junior,1,"GIVE US a BREAK! LET US LIVE! CAMPUS SECURITY IS FAR TOO OBSESSED WITH NOISE.
CAMPUS SECURITY DOESN'T CARE MUCH OR SEEM TO, ABOUT OTHER FAR MORE IMPORTANT THINGS--SUCH AS MAKING SURE THEY ARE REACHABLE IF WE LOCK OURSELVES OUT--NOT TICKETING EVERY SINGLE CAR FOR EVERY SECOND IT IS NOT IN A STALL (LIKE THEY DID MY FAMILY, THEY HAD TO FIGHT A TICKET AND FINE! THAT WAS GOING TO BE PUT ON MY RECORD!) JUST WORKING WITH THE STUDENTS AND NOT BEING'POLICE"" TO US, WOULD CALM EVERYONE DOWN...IT WOULD!!! BIG TIME"
College Sophomore,1,"Public Safety – Public Safety on the weekends is ridiculous!  They go power hungry on the and harass the students when they aren't doing anything.  They find reasons to write up students, get in their faces, make up ludicrous reasons for giving a write-up, and have proven to be virtually useless when help is requested. The only reason they are not getting an ""F"" is because they have an officer that is extremely helpful and nice."

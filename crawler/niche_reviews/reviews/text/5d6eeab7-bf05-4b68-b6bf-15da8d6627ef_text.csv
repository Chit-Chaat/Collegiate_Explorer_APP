Alum,5,"When I arrived freshman year, I did not know ANYONE- I was the only person from my hometown and 1:15 from my entire state! I had a brief transition month where I was trying to find my way but overall, I felt everyone was warm and welcoming, eager to make new friends. Because SMU is so small, you start to see that people clique up into small groups based on their sorority/fraternity/club/major/activities. But by senior year, those walls got broken down. Even though cliques and small groups exist, it is not a closed membership experience- everyone is welcoming and seeing people on campus or at a bar is exciting and engaging. Of course, you have the people who think they are superior and will be stand-offish and rude... but that is every college. AND those people are the social-climbers who are insecure. SparkNotes version of this post: I had a huge group of true and amazing friends, excellent relationships with my professors, and a driven, work hard/play hard environment. GO HERE!"
Alum,5,"I graduated in May, so my last semester was during the transition period. No one knew how to handle the situation and honestly, no one truly knows now. There was a huge disconnect among students and teachers because the lines between work + play were blurring. Bedrooms became classrooms and in-person interaction was deemed as dangerous. It was a weird time (and still is). The teachers were accommodating and the school offered many outlets to connect with your teachers, librarians, clubs, research sites, etc. The lazy ones or those who can't ""do"" change can't survive this. Sorry! I am a person who values human interaction and studies consumer behavior, BUT You just have to be creative in your approach and really focus on time management."
Sophomore,5,This college has been a godsend for me. The professors truly care about your success and the student body is dedicated to inclusion. I could not be more happy with my current school!
Graduate Student,5,"I liked the resources available, the campus structure and the different programs overlapping at times making your classes more diverse and allowing for more connections and networking. I would like to see a more diverse student body, it is a majority Caucasian school, but it does have a decent amount of international students that are excited to experience college in America."
Niche User,5,The online courses have been awesome! They are as if I was in person taking the class. The professors have worked hard to be able to teach online.
Niche User,5,I love Southern Methodist University because it has a diverse campus with opportunities for everyone.
Alum,5,"Overall a great experience. Plenty of clubs and organizations to join, the boulevard is great before football games."
Alum,5,I did not take any classes online for the time I was there all four years. I went to class everyday.
Freshman,5,"I am an incoming freshman, so I haven't lived on campus yet or taken classes. However, their communication methods during this pandemic have been very effective. Also, during the application process, they showed a lot of interest in me, which is what made me pick the school. The campus was also beautiful, and everyone there was friendly and enthusiastic."
Freshman,5,"I did a virtual orientation, which was very organized and helpful. I also communicated with my advisor over zoom to pick my classes. Everything online was effective."
Sophomore,5,"I love SMU! The classes are rigorous, but not so difficult that I'm falling behind. The professors offer office hours, so I can always go in for help when I don't understand something. I've made friends here and joined clubs, my favorite being the debate team. It's helped to teach me to speak well and have confidence in myself. Go Mustangs!"
Sophomore,5,"Southern Methodist University has given me an incredible experience in terms of fantastic faculty, amazing social life, and beautiful campus."
Graduate Student,5,SMU is an amazing place to study.  It feels like a home away from home.   The professors are excellent scholars in their field and also care about the students as individuals.  I have really enjoyed my time here so far and love the experience of studying here.
Alum,5,"SMU is a great school with a broad range of student-types. There are the highly-motivated scientists, artists, business professionals, &c. who are constantly pushing themselves to go above-and-beyond course requirements, and there are also more casual students who remind the more work-focused ones about the importance of work-life balance."
Niche User,5,"The campus has a culture like no other, located right on the edge of downtown Dallas. It has a homey, college-town feel (they call the university city Uptown), with all of the social and career opportunities of the big city. SMU really made sure to reach out to me while I was applying and trying to make my college decision, which convinced me of the commitment the university has to each and every prospective- or current student."
Niche User,5,"I visited SMU multiple times and it is such a wonderful and welcoming campus. The people in the campus were so helpful when it comes to navigativing the small, yet huge campus. I really enjoyed the dining hall because it was very organized and the food was amazing."
Sophomore,5,I transferred into SMU as an incoming sophomore and the people here have made the transition as smooth as possible. Everyone is here to make sure that you find your place and people in order to have the best college experience possible! The small class sizes for difficult subjects are also a HUGE plus since it is easier to go in and talk and get help from very educated professors!
Graduate Student,5,The staff and students are friendly and helpful. The campus has easy access to the freeways and downtown. Enrollment was seem less. The curriculum is most current and the professors are knowledgeable. The social network is broad.
Freshman,5,Souther methodist university has a great selection of classes to chose from. The best thing about the classes is the class sizes. Classes are small which makes it easy to pay attention and communicate with the professors
Freshman,5,"The campus is very beautiful and there is clearly a lot of time and care that goes into the student experience. There are opportunities for everyone to get involved in some form or another however the Greek life scene can sometimes feel a bit polarizing. Also the campus is embarrassingly Environmentally unsustainable. Overall though, the teachers are great and there is plenty of opportunity to succeed and grow."
Niche User,5,"The campus is absolutely beautiful! The architecture of the building are very similar to those of Ancient Greek. The staff that was giving us a tour was nice and answered any question i had to ask. One of my favorite parts of the visit was that they have ""therapy"" dogs in the library, which is supposed to help students with stress that they get from school."
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy the lectures, the professors are more than perfect.  Very friendly and calm environment in the busy city of dallas. What are would like to see changed is a reduction in tuition fees."
Freshman,5,"SMU has an amazing environment whether that be physically with only a short drive into downtown Dallas, socially with an active and spirited student body, or academically with small class sizes and teachers who get to know you."
Niche User,5,"When I visited smu I loved how amazing people and the professors are. Everyone is nice and positive. Smu itself is a good university, it is in metro area and the education and the classes they have is amazing but students and professors makes smu even more special because of their positive attitude"
Junior,5,"No matter who you are, what background you have, talents or interests, Southern Methodist has a place for you. Even as a transfer, I was immediately accepted into the community and given an achievable plan to graduate on time. Even if you are interested in an area that is not included in your major, you are encouraged to take classes and join clubs that feed that interest. I'm taking classes about Shakespeare and the Solar System and learning so much that I would have never thought I'd learn in my area of Psychology. SMU truly caters to the whole person - physically, mentally and emotionally, spiritually, and intellectually. All walks of life are represented on this campus, and everyone can find a home here."
Junior,5,Southern Methodist University is a great place to get an education. It is very expensive but the University is very willing to give scholarships and grants. The campus is beautiful. My walk to class is very visually pleasing and makes me actually enjoy attending class. The housing is a Residential Commons system that encourages commons pride and forms a sense of community within the building that you live in on campus. This makes your experience living on campus even that much better. The involvement of the students at SMU is incredible. There are so many options and activities that you can become a part of and find a home at SMU. The safety of campus is amazing. Even though it is located in the city when you are on campus you feel like you are in a safe bubble because the SMU police are always present.
Niche User,5,"SMU has great Law programs, that will help you expand your knowledge and career path. I would love to attend SMU, because is a local school for me and not only that, but it also offers what I need for my future career."
Sophomore,5,I love Southern Methodist University. The professors are all dedicated to their students and the material they are teaching. The campus is beautiful and all the facilities are well kept. The dorms and dining facilities are wonderful as well.
Sophomore,5,"So far in my time at SMU, I've had a great experience with the friends I've made, the activities they host to make campus more lively, and have enjoyed almost all of my professors, with their classes being both rigorous and entertaining. Overall, it's a great place to be with the nearby food and places to explore, along with the very well-kept campus itself."
Freshman,5,Amazing school. You can find a great balance between fun and academics here. The professors and advisors make sure each student achieves all their goals and never has to compromise between two goals.
Sophomore,5,People are so welcoming at SMU! The campus is beautiful and the professors really care for there students!
Junior,5,"They have the perfect size and the campus really does feel homey even though it is in the city. Dallas offers endless opportunities for internships, jobs, fun, and food. The professors are so knowledgeable and helpful. The school has so many ways to get involved and great school culture. Love this school."
Junior,5,"SMU will provide you with all the opportunities you need to be successful - there's clubs, internships/jobs in Dallas, and most professors are willing to go above and beyond to help you succeed. Lots of different kinds of people if you look for them (not just blonde-haired, blue-eyed Chads)."
Sophomore,5,"Southern Methodist University is a gorgeous campus in the heart of a bustling city. The campus is relatively small, enough to where getting to classes is simple and easy, but still large enough to explore and find a variety of things to do. Professors are attentive and helpful, guiding students through classes, and extra resources such as counselors and advisers are always available for questions."
Sophomore,5,"SMU has a beautiful college campus that is tight knit and extremely safe. The students are all very involved in a wide variety of things making it very easy for everyone to find their niche. With a low student to faculty ratio, the professors teach every class and care deeply about their students."
Freshman,5,I just transferred here. So far I’ve learned that there is not a lot of diversity but the alum support is huge. This school takes pride in its name and provides a great education.
Freshman,5,"I entered SMU not knowing anyone, and a lot of people come here in that same boat. I was lucky to find myself in a tight-knit group of friends first semester to make the transition easier. I have also had the opportunity to meet people from all across the U.S. and different parts of the world."
Niche User,5,"I like about Southern Methodist University because they have the best engineerings out of all in texas and i think they also have really good education.
I didn't know about a lots but thats all i know for now."
Junior,5,"As an engineering student, I was lucky enough to learn a lot in one semester and a half. SMU has a lot of scholarship opportunities which is great since tuition is higher than most schools in Texas."
Freshman,5,"Southern Methodist University is an amazing private mid-sized University that values high achieving students, diversity, hard work, and providing an amazing array of internship, study abroad, and academic opportunities to students pursuing a degree.  In the heart of downtown Dallas, SMU is nestled in one of the most dynamic and growing cities in America.  The opportunities within this university far surpass those of most other schools within Texas, as SMU is small enough to allow a student to shine but big enough to provide diversity of thought, academics and personalities within the student and professor communities."
Graduate Student,5,"SMU is a great school with strong ties to top corporations in the DFW area. The faculty is highly educated, and motivated to bring you current events and topics, shaping your education with real world understanding. The campus is beautiful, and the students are all welcoming and bright. i couldn't be happier! Go Mustangs!"
Niche User,5,I love how at the school that they treat everyone as a big family.They care for everyone as a whole. Also they help out the community with fundraisers and donations. This shows that they love the community also I love the sports as well.
Freshman,5,"I love SMU because it feels like home! When I was looking for the right school for me, no other university had both the intimacy of small classes and the level of spirit that you find on the Hilltop."
Alum,5,"Loved my experience at SMU.  I completed a graduate degree while I was working a full time job.  The professors (with very little exception) were amazing.  They really catered to working professionals.  The best part of my experience was their job placement program.  When I graduated, I was able to find a new job with Cisco.  I am very thankful to this school!  It’s well run and worth the investment!"
Niche User,5,The campus is beautiful and the academic rigor is challenging and evolving with technology. Many students choose to double-major and professors always make themselves available for help.
Niche User,5,"SOUTHERN METHODIST UNIVERSITY OFFERS THEIR STUDENTS A GREAT ARRAY OF ACTIVITIES TO GET INVOLVED. AFTER ATTENDING SEVERAL EVENTS THERE, I WAS PLEASED AND IMPRESSED BY THE ORGANIZATION AND LEADERSHIP SKILLS THAT THE STUDENTS HERE POSSESS. THIS SCHOOL IS FILLED WITH SCHOLARS WHO HAVE BIG GOALS AND ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THEIR SCHOOL. ALONG WITH THAT, THE CAMPUS IS CLEAN AND BEAUTIFUL AS SEEN BY ITS CITES ACROSS THE BUILDINGS."
Graduate Student,5,"My academic advisers and Success advisers for the Master of Science in Data Science program are awesome. The are very prompt when answer email and looking for resources that will make my time in the program manageable. My advisers call me weekly to check in with me to see how I am doing and if there is anything they can assist me with. The customer service on campus is amazing. All persons took the time to listen to my concerns and make sure that I was okay. So, if you are looking for a good Data Science program, as well as an awesome university to attend that care about its students, then Southern Methodist University (SMU) is the university."
Niche User,5,The campus is so beautiful. The only thing I would change is how much time I spent OFF campus! The Celebration of Lights festival is the only way I truly feel like it is Christmas. Dallas Hall is breathtaking and no other university will make you feel the way SMU does.
Sophomore,5,"No where I’d rather be at. Diversity is low, and some professors are hit or miss, but great academics and party scene."
Niche User,5,"The campus was beautiful and full of life. The academics are outstanding and the councilors really take the time to get to know every student individually. There is so much rich history in Dallas, from the architectural design of the campus, to the football tailgates on SMU boulevard."
Graduate Student,5,SMU is a private school which offers world-class programs taught by experienced working professors! My program is for working professionals so all my courses are from 6-9pm! The campus is safe and beautiful. Professors want to help you succeed!
Graduate Student,5,SMU is providing excellent customer service and my professors take the time to answer all my concerns and are always encouraging and supportive.
Sophomore,5,"SMU is the best decision I made.  I am so happy with every aspect of the school.  From the professors, to the dorms, to the athletics, it is the perfect fit for me.  I am a BBA Scholar and I am enrolled in the Cox Business School.  The Professors are great and class size is small so you have a personal relationship with your teachers.  I highly recommend SMU to everyone looking to attend a top university in an amazing city."
Graduate Student,5,"SMU is a great school with wonderful facilities and amazing professors, depending on what your major is in. The students can be pretentious. The Greek life is very dominant here. You're either Greek or a nobody (Greeks refer to them as GDIs)."
Junior,5,An amazingly beautiful campus with great resources. The school really cares about and takes care of its students.
Niche User,5,"My experience at Southern Methodist University has been amazing because they have an amazing environment, people, cultures, sports, and most importantly education to whatever you have a passion for. I would like to see change that they’re be a little more diversity between students so they can encourage other ethnic groups to come apply."
Alum,5,"I am a recent graduate of Southern Methodist University. It was an amazing experience from start to finish. Knowledgable professors with real world experience, a well-connected student body, and up-and-coming athletics. Everything is growing at SMU in a great way. I would recommend the school to anyone looking!"
Niche User,5,"As a parent of a sophomore, we have been extremely pleased with SMU. The campus is gorgeous. All of the new student and parent orientation sessions were comprehensive and very well done. Our child has had an excellent experience with housing in the Commons. He has enjoyed his classes with engaging professors who seem to care about his success. He started his freshman year with quite a few hours of AP credit. He has been able to chart his own path regarding his majors and minors. We are all happy with the SMU community."
Senior,5,"SMU has been a great college experience. The faculty truly care about you - not just your grade in the class. Although SMU is pricey, it is worth the top notch education that you will receive."
Sophomore,5,"The university has a unique curriculum that allows students to not only focus exclusively on their area of study, but allows flexibility to allow the student to study everything they're interested in.  The classes are rigorous, but the professors have a clear value of learning over grades."
Alum,4,The real estate and finance/accounting departments in the business school are top notch and super helpful for helping you get jobs. You're almost guaranteed a job with these majors. The curriculum is demanding but not at all impossible if you try. All my professors were very nice.
Senior,4,The online learning experience is fine. Lots of group projects and papers to write. SMU has done a terrible job to stop covid from spreading. The fact that 67 students are infected by the virus tells that their SMUFlex does not work. Some of their students probably do not care either that some got covid anyway.
Junior,4,I love being in Dallas- definitely one of the best parts of coming to SMU. Lot's of cool major/minor options and extra curricular activities to get involved in. Really fun social scene as well
Junior,4,The teachers have been very accommodating and helpful! Wifi occasionally breaks but SMU IT is really great and will help individuals
Graduate Student,4,"Academics are what you make of them and what major do you have. Overall SMU graduates are well respected in Texas. Rice being too competitive and UT being too huge and public, most wealthy parents send their kids to SMU, Baylor and TCU as these are small private bubble schools with strong academics and good athletics. If you are a business major then SMU and for pre-med, Baylor are school of choice for ones who can afford insane cost of attending."
Senior,4,"Besides the hefty tuition for being a private schools, SMU has so much to offer they have top notch academic programs as well as a great student senate to support different student organizations,"
Sophomore,4,Southern Methodist University is a very prestigious college located in Dallas. They have a beautiful campus and many highly qualified staff. The only downside is the price. I would only consider attending if you are on scholarship.
Sophomore,4,SMU has really challenged me as a student to study harder than I ever had to attain an average grade. I am encouraged to make relationships with professors and go above and beyond what my initial definition of success was. The party scene is awesome. Campus is the most beautiful.
Sophomore,4,Southern Methodist University is a very good school academically challenging and very personal. It is a smaller school providing unique learning opportunities with professors and personal relationships. The student culture and focus on Greek Life is a bit extreme at times but other than that a very good institution.
Senior,4,Loved my experience at smu. Dallas is a pretty great area. My time at smu has been filled with great friends and great professors to.
Niche User,4,I've had 3 visits  to SMU so far and the campus was beautiful. It had a large variety of things to do with free time as well as very kind students and faculty.
Senior,4,"The experience of being on a beautiful campus in a vibrant city and having wide variety of both social and professional opportunities at your doorstep is undoubtedly the best part of being a student at SMU. Every university has its ups and down, but SMU is very blessed in so many ways. It is very hard to go wrong with attending SMU. One of the cool benefits of attending this school is that it is very likely that you will get a job in Dallas with all your college friends who are graduating and staying in Dallas."
Sophomore,4,The atmosphere is very friendly and welcoming! teachers are always willing to help. a large variety with food selections and the dorms are really nice.
Junior,4,"When did a college visit back in 2016, it was by far the best college visit. SMU opened my eyes to so much and I can't wait to visit again before or during my senior. I encourage anyone that is doing college visits to go to SMU because it is a beautiful place."
Freshman,4,"it is a great school. wonderful staff, beautiful campus! lots of school spirit. you can tell the professors really want to help you"
Senior,4,"SMU is very well supported and connected. As a fine arts major, it helps to be near the center of the city where the arts scene is most active (as opposed to UTD, U of D, or UNT, which are a little more off the beaten path)... so location is a big plus! It's a bit homogenized, being located in the Park Cities; it has a high tuition (the ""Ivy League"" of the South) and draws from an affluent base, and it could benefit from greater diversity; but Meadows School of the Arts at SMU is better in that regard than some of the other programs/schools here. There are endless opportunities to get involved, and get funding for projects or learning opportunities that you're passionate about. I've been to Taos, NM and NYC with SMU, and I'm going to Poland later this year. They also helped me fund independent travel that supported my education and professional development: last year I went to a conference in PA and a workshop in NM. Overall, I've had a great experience!"
Junior,4,SMU is a good school! Get ready to learn and write tons of essays! But in return its perfect because you'll progress in your writing skills. Really pretty campus overall!
Senior,4,"I've really enjoyed my time at SMU so far. The academics are great, the campus is beautiful, and there are plenty of organizations to get involved with. The student culture can be a bit materialistic, especially within Greek life, but there are plenty of great kids to go around. Would really recommend SMU to anyone!"
Sophomore,4,"I just completed my first year at SMU, and I'm starting my second this fall. So far I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here. The academics and professors are very good and the class sizes are smaller than at a large university, which allows for a better learning environment and more time with the professors. The campus is gorgeous and has been rated the most beautiful college campus in Texas. Although I don't live on campus, I've been told that the dorms are nice and the food is very good. There are also ample student resources and organizations here."
Sophomore,4,"After my first year at SMU, there were specific qualities that I loved, while also some that I did not favor. Something I feel the university is exceptional at is providing a superior education. The school accomplishes this by having small class room sizes, and dedicated professors. These two aspects enhance student's learning capabilities and promote relationships. Student life is very prominent at SMU, with hundreds of organizations/clubs, it is hard to not find somewhere you belong, or something you enjoy doing. 
I believe that this university helped me grow both personally and intellectually. SMU is a smaller school with significantly less students than most known colleges. This can be good or bad depending on what you prefer. However, I have always succeeded better in smaller education environments, and that is a reason I feel contributes to my overall success at SMU."
Sophomore,4,"I am a Tower Scholar, BBA Scholar, and University Honors Program member. I had a tough start at SMU because I am personally nerdier than a lot of the demographic. However, after I started making friends on campus my overall experience changed. I always thought the academics were good; I am also in the most rigorous programs on campus. From an academic perspective, I feel really valued as a student. I am now starting to find my place on campus socially. Tuition is VERY expensive. Without scholarships, I could not go here. I have a half tuition scholarship and a business school school specific scholarship. Even with $32,500 annually in scholarships, I still struggle to afford SMU."
Sophomore,4,"I love SMU. It's a beautiful campus and the faculty truly cares about seeing students succeed. I believe there's somewhere for everyone to get connected, no matter what you're into. However, tuition costs are something that is definitely a con for this school. Tuition is already pushing $70k and increases every year, which is ridiculous considering how much the dorms and food suck."
Niche User,4,"SMU is a great university. All of their schools (Lyle, Cox, etc) are fantastic and the schools have some amazing professors. However, beware of facilities. Half the dorms are in terrible conditions while the other half are nearly brand new. The older dorms are a disaster (power problems, no hot water sometimes) while the new ones are usually in pretty good condition (they too have their moments). However, you only have to live on campus for two years. Additionally, around half the student body is involved in Greek Life, and rush can be extremely competitive if that is something you're interested in. Overall, this school is a lot of fun, but also requires a lot of academic focus."
Freshman,4,"It is a relatively small university compared to other public and private universities in Texas. The classes are also small as a result. Intro classes are some of the bigger classes but you still have time to go and speak to a professor during office hours. The dining hall food leaves more to be expected as after the first year you get tired of eating the same food over and over again. During certain festive periods, the dining halls serve different types of food such as State Fair night (corn dogs and funnel cake). The campus community is strong and it makes it easier to connect with those around you and enjoy your time there. In general, SMU is a good place to grow and make connections."
Junior,4,"As far as academics goes, you definitely get what you pay for. Having a degree from Cox will get you places and you will build your network like never before.  As far as the people go, I mean its SMU. 98% of people are in greek life and wealthy. Definitely smart, but entitled, judgy and snobby."
Freshman,4,"Overall, the university is boosted. Classes are small with the exception of lower level classes. Some buildings are old and nasty. I sometimes question why tuition is so high. The student life is fun and elaborate, as a lot of money goes towards these campus events. The professors are average and some actually care about education."
Junior,4,"SMU has provided a unique establishment of community in order for all students to feel welcome! However, the diversity presented within the school is quite low. There are sparse percentages of Latinos, Hispanics, African Americans, and Asians. Even though this is the case, the gradual enrollment of multiple international students does decrease the evident ethnic gap among students. Additonally, many of the teachers and remainder of the faculty are friendly and supportive for all students to succeed. With constant reminders regarding the A-LEC center and its workshops, students are free to ask questions from a variety of multiple disciplines to tutors who are readily available! Without a doubt, the student life at SMU is the best!"
Junior,4,"I love my time at SMU. It is a very beautiful school and the majority of the staff are super friendly and very helpful. There are a couple things I would change about the application process, but I am still happy I came to SMU."
Graduate Student,4,"I really enjoy the friendliness of the students and faculty at SMU! Saturdays during football season are a great chance to meet people on the Blvd and to take a study break. Lots of people enjoy Dedman Rec Center, where you can meet new people while you get your sweat on. Plus, there's plenty to do in the DFW area!"
Junior,4,"SMU wasn't even on the top five on my application list. Now is my third year here and my view has shifted. The most crucial element that breaks my negative opinion to SMU is the quality of professors. All the professors that I have met are both highly responsible and helpful. I'm surprised that almost all of them are from schools like Princeton and Yale. I don't want to emphasize on the glamor of the Ivy League, but it is a factor to see how SMU can attract some highly regarded professors in the U.S. Of course, it is not a determined element to guarantee teaching quality. I genuinely appreciate how every single professor dedicates time to talk with students even when it's out of the office hours. They not only help to solve the academic questions but also willing to chat and give guidance to some personal issues. I hear from many of my friends who also have the same comment to their professors. They are not just here to teach; they treat their students like family."
Senior,4,"Southern Methodist University is an excellent place to attend college. Especially if you start out as a freshman, the campus makes it easy to join various organizations as well as Greek life. The faculty is helpful and the advisors know the students by name."
Alum,4,"I had an amazing experience at SMU. Although I changed majors in between, the transition was smooth and supportive. I had various research experiences while attending SMU on and off campus. The professors are very passionate and supportive of their students. The campus itself is very beautiful all four seasons. During football season, there are many events on campus that involves enjoyable food and giveaways."
Freshman,4,"SMU offers a very high quality education and is located on a very beautiful campus. Furthermore, SMU has comparatively excellent dining and the residential commons are home to an absolutely charming community-oriented atmosphere. The faculty here is world-class and students have a very high chance of making a living in their chosen field. Despite all the good, it should be known that SMU has a very high total cost of attendance, being somewhere in the $70,000 a year range."
Freshman,4,"I had no idea, when accepting my admission to Southern Methodist University, that I would be entering a community that is as open and welcoming as this one. I am so pleased that I am able to receive a phenomenal education. I am beyond satisfied with the music program here at SMU. I could not have asked for a better facility, faculty, and curriculum. If I was able to go back and change my decision to attend this school, I would not."
Graduate Student,4,"I think Southern Methodist University is great for students who are looking to broaden their perspective on the world, particularly if they have an interest in Human Rights."
Junior,4,"SMU is a great university, but your experience will be what you make it. As far as academics, there are many valuable resource available and SMU offers quality education."
Freshman,4,"If you want amazing academics and an amazing social life, this is the place for you!  My classes are interesting and the professors really care about your experience. The parties are insane! We have a social scene unlike any other school. Greek life dominates, but in a good way!"
Sophomore,4,The music program is amazing. Everyone here is extremely talented and driven to work. Meadows is filled with such a beautiful community of like-minded individuals; I think it functions so well because of the kind of people it attracts.
Niche User,4,"its alright, the tours are very informal and dont give much information unless you ask. the information given when asked is very informational."
Niche User,4,SMU is a beautiful campus and made a major recent investment in new dorms. The quality of educations is strong and the school has a good alumni network and good relationships with employers in the greater Dallas area. It is not the most diverse school by any means and if you intend to be a GDI you'll need to build your own social schedule. It's a good school and in a great location.
College Sophomore,4,A lot of school spirit and boulevarding
Niche User,4,"Beautiful campus and very nice people. The food in the cafeterias was very good, especially for college food. The classes are engaging, and the alumni network has amazing connections."
College Freshman,4,There is a lot of networking and opportunities available. Once a graduate the likeliness of getting a job is pretty high.
College Freshman,4,All students were put through a course on sexual activity.
College Freshman,4,They always throw parties and seem to have a great time.
College Sophomore,4,"Basketball is definitely the most fan-supported sport on campus, but all sports have a significant number of fans."
College Sophomore,4,"Just the name of the school will get you far in the job market, especially around the Metroplex."
College Senior,4,The school treats you wonderfully from the time you step on  campus and will throughout your academic time there.
College Senior,4,"It has been a very positive experience and have a great impact on my life. The professors will go out of their way to help any of the students before or after class, even on weekends."
College Sophomore,4,"Classes are smaller due to SMU being a private institution. I've personally had some really passionate and helpful professors, but also a a few that weren't so good. Workload is manageable on top of involvement in extracurricular activities."
College Sophomore,4,"A few incidents throughout the school year, but generally pretty safe."
College Sophomore,4,Love the smaller class sizes and convenience of living on campus
College Senior,4,"I really love the school I attend. I entered back in 2010 as undergraduate and when offered a chance to continue my graduate studies there, I jumped on it. The classes are not too large and the professors really get to know their students. Some classes are as small as 10-15 students."
College Sophomore,4,"When professors love what they teach, the class is great and I am excited to learn from them. It's hit or miss. It depends on who you get."
College Sophomore,4,I am inspired by students in other departments who are very driven.
College Freshman,4,Greek life can be good or bad. There are what people call top tier and say if you aren't in the top tier you are a nobody but that isn't true.
College Junior,4,They are a huge deal on our campus
College Freshman,4,"It's great, it has everything you could possibly need and it really sets you up with so many great connections, its impossible to not secure a job or internship. Great weather, great shopping, great restaurants- Dallas is an amazing city. Greek life is huge at the school so definitely join in on it, its awesome and provides an insane social life."
College Sophomore,4,SMU is a very fun college for students
College Sophomore,4,"If you're into the party scene, there is always at least two different things going on on nearly any given night Wednesday to Saturday"
Sophomore,2,"I can’t say much about the virtual learning, and I don’t want to judge it because I know it is a new experience for everyone and I wouldn’t expect the professors to have worked all the flaws out. Most classes will be in person next semester though, so the quality of the online courses won’t matter soon."
Senior,2,"The university says it values diversity of opinions and perspectives, and what I see is far the opposite. The diversity in the student population is terrible. You see white people congregate with white people, and minority students with their own people. People say SMU student are sorority and fraternity snobs, and it is pretty accurate. I came to this campus expecting to meet people and have new experience, but students on this campus stick to their own kind. There is the group that enjoys the privilege that their ethnicity and economic and social status bring them, and they are reluctant to see the world outside of their own bubble. And SMU is their bubble. I regret coming to this school, and I could have gone to other universities that has more diversity. It is disappointing to see a school and student population to lack openness to new ideas and fake their concerns about the BLM movement while students on campus refuse to befriend students outside of their racial group."
Freshman,2,"Objectively this is a great school. It has good student facilities, competent administration, a rigorous curriculum, and prestigious faculty and alumni. It just really isn’t for me. If you are high class you will probably feel at home here. There is a heavy focus on Greek life and, to a lesser degree, athletics. I was disappointed with the extracurricular options on campus. There is a strong religious community on campus for obvious reasons. Again, this is a great school and if what I described doesn’t put you off you should go for it, it just really isn’t for me."
Sophomore,2,"Overall, SMU has probably one of the worst college atmospheres in the country. I found the level of pretentiousness and entitlement just unbelievable. There's an abnormal amount of wealth and students are out of touch with reality. I also want to emphasize that YOU ARE LOOKED DOWN UPON IF YOU ARE NOT PART OF GREEK LIFE. People wonder what's wrong with you if you don't rush, but then if you're cut during recruitment (so so many people are) you're still judged. This school is full of people in their own bubble who truly lack empathy and compassion for others. It's all just a big competition--who is in the best sorority or fraternity, who has the latest and most expensive Gucci bag, who goes on the most lavish vacations. I am not exaggerating and that's why I'm writing this review. While the academics are great and there's a beautiful campus, I truly hope you take into consideration this overwhelmingly toxic environment. I had no idea of the extent of it as an incoming freshman."
Sophomore,2,"Came in thinking it would be a great experience, but upon arrival I realized this was the wrong choice."
College Sophomore,2,"For the most part, I do not enjoy the Greek system and I tend to feel a lot of resentment towards members of the Greek community."
College Sophomore,2,"I was very frustrated to discover the new two-year on campus rule. Sophomores now have to remain on campus, and all on campus residents must purchase the standard meal plan which is very over-priced. I moved into the Service House so that I could avoid paying for a meal plan."
College Sophomore,2,Everyone knows someone who does or has done drugs beyond alcohol and marijuana
College Junior,2,"Just this year, at least 2 girls have reported sexual assault that made it to mass emails amongst campus in awareness."
College Sophomore,2,The overall academic system at SMU is poor.
College Sophomore,2,SMU does not peovide students with adequate support and connections.
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is a huge part of the social scene at SMU. Walking around campus it is clear who is in a sorority and who is not, and more often then not cliques are developed because of these varying sororities and fraternities which makes it difficult for outsiders to become a part of the community."
College Sophomore,2,Not very helpful or attentive financial aid department. Very confusing.
College Freshman,2,"There are no social events, the students are rude, RAs and faculty don't care about their students. SMU is an overall miserable experience. Not worth the crazy tuition. I'm not sure where all the money goes. It is not anything special once you are actually a student there. They pull out all the stops on the tours, but do nothing for their actual students."
College Freshman,2,"University park/ highland park is super expensive, and so is uptown."
College Freshman,2,"There's for sure many options. The frat parties get very repetitive, after months of seeing the same people doing the same things. Also if you like psycho judgmental girls analyzing every other girl at the party, these parties would be perfect for you. Off campus you for sure need a fake. Many of the clubs and bars have a much older crowd and are very pricey, so they are not so convenient for a college student."
College Freshman,2,"The two dining halls, Umph and Arnold, advertise themselves as ""healthy,"" however this is not true."
College Junior,2,"The administration hates greek life, but it doesn't make it any less prevalent. The campus also doesnt feel very safe at night. there are the emergency lights, but they are very sparce and half the time dont work. We are under investigation with title 9 for rape, so the lack of emergency life doesnt make me very comfortable."
College Junior,2,The office processes your aid at the very last minute. someone I know didn't find out how much money they received until about 2 weeks before school was going to start.
Recent Alumnus,2,all they care about is eliminating greek life
College Junior,2,"The football team is atrocious and no one goes to the games. School spirit has raised a little with our good basketball team, but is still pretty dismal."
College Freshman,2,They only care about money
College Junior,2,"its like a rat race running around all over to just get it submitted, financial aid counselors are not very helpful, the award amount wasnt nearly enough for the high cost of tuition"
College Sophomore,2,"Our campus is probably 90% white. Not sure how the minorities feel, but I find they mostly keep to themselves."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Hated my roommate, it's potluck for as much money as we pay for school there should be personality matches or something. Community bathrooms are annoying. There is only washers/dryers, water fountain, vending machine on the first floor. If you get locked out of your room between 8pm-8am you have to pay ten dollars for them to open your dorm.

Dinning commons close early and no late night options."
College Sophomore,2,"Housing is terrible here. The dorms are run down or demolished by students. The rooms are small and frankly, communities aren't built in large dorms of sophomores. Upperclassmen have already made friends so they aren't looking for in dorm bonding."
College Junior,2,No one really cares about any sport other than Men's basketball.
College Sophomore,2,"There's a handful of each race/ethnicity/religion and they band together via clubs (i.e. Muslim Student Association, Vietnamese Student Association) and rarely branch out from said organizations. The majority of my friends are white, with the exception of two Black friends. The Asians, Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites tend to keep to themselves. It's not a racism issue, it's just where students find their niche that they stay because it's comfortable and familiar."
College Sophomore,2,"Our football is a joke, BUT our basketball team did fantastic this year! With the renovation of Moody almost every game was sold out and people camped out for tickets. The hype of the games is amplified by the small environment and everyones excitement at finally being good at a sport on SMU's campus."
College Sophomore,2,"I think it's about $200 for the on campus pass. Freshman guys are allowed to park in Binkley and Airline, but Airline is so far from the dorms that you can basically only park in Binkley. It's fine after classes are over, but if you leave and come back during the day, you will not find a spot. Upperclassmen parking is a disaster if you live off campus and drive to class. Freshman girls are spoiled. They get the R sticker which lets them park anywhere they want. If you live in a fraternity or sorority house parking there is never really a problem. Be prepared to pay upwards of $400 a year on parking tickets. The old parking guy gets off on giving out tickets. Rumor has it that SMU makes over $800,000 in parking fines a year."
College Freshman,2,"Repetitive food, not very good."
College Freshman,2,"There are many racist people here, and lgbt is not something that is openly supported. This year, during student elections the student body voted against an lgbt comity."
College Freshman,2,SMU has very strict policies regarding most things.
College Freshman,2,"Unless you have a car, your choices of off campus dining is very limited."
College Freshman,2,"Depending on where you spend most of your time, there's a varying amount of diversity on campus."
College Freshman,2,"Freezing winter, burning how summer"
College Junior,2,I had a bad experience. Others may not. Off campus is a lot cheaper (not by a whole lot- but you save money).
College Junior,2,Rampant alcohol use. Cocaine is big as well. The fraternities contribute a lot to this.
College Freshman,2,the school is super waspy; lots of rich white kids
College Freshman,2,"Strictness involving honor code is good. It maintains the value of the degree. However, as far as alcohol and drugs go, it's archaic. You can lose your financial aid and get suspended for getting caught doing/selling drugs. It's college, people are going to do drugs. As long as they're not shooting up or smoking meth then let 'em have their weed and pills. A friend of mine got caught smoking weed and he got put on probation, academic probation, had to take drug tests, had to take a class about drugs, and got suspended for several days. It's not the school's business what the students put into their body. They've already got our money anyways."
College Freshman,2,There's not many computers on campus. Everyone has their own computer.
College Junior,2,"Not much diversity, only apparent in certain cliques."
College Freshman,2,We like to party... sometimes too much.
College Freshman,2,"Not going to lie SMU is definitely rich, white, and republican to the max. But that's how it should be."
College Junior,2,"not much diversity at all. very white, very rich. the minority community does have a lot of resources, but they are overshadowed by WHITE."
College Freshman,2,"I've never run into any drugs on campus, but hard drugs (cocaine, etc.) are rumored to be used in greek life and marijuana is rumored to be used in the arts community at a lower level. Alcohol, on the other hand, is everywhere. Underage drinking is extremely common. ""Are you going out tonight?"" is a really common question among all ages. Partying is extremely prominent. If you don't go out regularly, you are regarded as uncool. Taxis line the boulevard on Thursday nights. Low attendance is common on Friday mornings. Overall, the atmosphere is heavily influenced by alcohol, even though SMU is a dry campus. Alcohol violations are bad news for students who get caught in underage drinking, but not a huge amount of students ever get caught."
College Senior,2,"It's expensive to get a permit, and sometimes it can be extremely difficult to find a spot, especially during sporting events because the school asks students to move their cars to certain areas."
College Sophomore,2,Very few scholarships are given. People either get a lot of scholarship or they get little to no financial help. 
College Freshman,2,"My major is physics.
This is a liberal arts school."
College Freshman,2,"Diversity here is pretty weak.
Everyone is mostly white, 99% are rich, nearly everyone is republican, and for the most part, it seems like the majority is Christian. Religion is not very prominent here and people aren't very religious.
HOWEVER. People are not hateful. Minorities aren't looked down upon or anything,they're just that- minorities. "
College Freshman,2,"Parking during the week is a nightmare.
On weekends, however,more spots are free.
The parking garages are not conveniently located to the current dorms,but SMU is building the new commons buildings and right smack next to them are ridiculously nice looking parking garages."
College Sophomore,2,"Too much crime..assaults and rape..by students (1 out of 10) , most are non students. I dont like how so many people can access the campus and there is not visible security. I only see security in their cars giving out tickets..."
College Sophomore,2,"PerunaNet is garbage pretty much half the time.  Cell service does not work inside the dorms unless you have AT&T on the third floor or higher.  Also, if you are looking at SMU, buying a laptop shouldn't really be that much of an issue for you..."
College Sophomore,2,"I have absolutely hated most of the teachers that I have dealt with here.  All very stuck in their own ways.  Actually once had a deaf-from-birth teacher for English.  How is that supposed to work out well?  Also, the new UC screws students out of graduating from the business school in four years under an arbitrary attempt to expand students' horizons."
College Freshman,2,Took me a while to actually receive my financial aid.
College Freshman,2,I am not part of a sorority and it seems like that is all that is important here.
College Senior,2,"they weren't super helpful with the aid process, I had to ask and ask and ask for it to go anywhere"
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid that i recieved, while helpful, could certainly have covered more costs that I am now struggling to pay."
College Junior,2,"Professors very available, work is very hard, internships are expected. "
College Junior,2,Dallas has tons of great things to do/eat if you have a car. 
Junior,1,"The zoom call teaching quality was way better than on-campus. We now able to skip the worthless stuff and save time. Honestly professor barely teaching anything. They mumble around and assumed the student already know the material, because most kid here came from top prep school in the US. I would definitely want to transfer out."
Junior,1,"Education was far worse than local state university. This is from someone who took the same course from a local university and at smu. This school also prey on people to make as much as money as they can. You think they care because they throw all these kind of crap  that satisfy your need. Don't be fool they charged ways more than Ivy League and of course they can used it to be their advantage. My transfer credit was absolutely freaking messed up. Some of the requirement i supposed to get it wasn't even there. I have to contact my advisor to help me and only one question per week. Are you kidding me? This school is crap, if you plan to go here ? don't even think about it unless you get full ride. Leave this dogshit place and go to a cheaper school."
Junior,1,They are very stingy with their money. They are reluctant to give it away to students who need it and racism is a huge problem among the administration. The financial aid advisers rarely know how to help or offer help and everything is a process. They make it very hard to get anything done there properly especially for the cost
Freshman,1,"frats don't own their houses so they rent out clubs and bars to ""party."" no college town and you can't walk anywhere. Everyone spends an average of $50 on uber per day."
College Junior,1,"It is over the top, lots of rich kids and they are not very friendly to those that are not involved in Greek life."
College Sophomore,1,"The professors are rude and outwardly disrespect Christianity and religion. They are not concerned with student success, or interested in the subject matter. The courses are difficult to get into despite being required for all undergraduates."
College Sophomore,1,"SMU is a horribly negative environment. You can not graduate in four years. The academic advisors act as though graduating in five years is difficult. The professors and students outwardly disrespect Christianity and religion while promoting Athiesm during lecture and social events. One department of the school does not speak to the other and the entire school is very disorganized. The dorms are old and small. The dining halls offer limited options of low quality food and provide few options for those with food allergies. It is almost impossible to get into the classes that are required for your major. Oftentimes only one class is offered per semester and fewer than thirty seats are available. Many of the classes required for all undergraduates cover topics such as murder, rape, terrorism, abuse, children of war and violence all covered in graphic detail. This school is not designed for the sensitive of heart. There are no social events. SMU is a major disappointment and waste of money."
College Freshman,1,Nobody has school spirit here because we do not have good sports teams
College Freshman,1,"The police here do not act like they are genuinely concerned with the campus safety as they should be. Instead, they troll the campus looking for drunk girls and guys they can bust and get in trouble."
College Freshman,1,"I lived in a centrally located dorm, but it was horrible living accommodations. The elevator constantly reeked of throw up from the night before each morning. Also, people would damage the building, by punching out sealing tiles or ripping out the rails on the stairs. Instead of the vandalizers being held accountable, each student was billed for the collective damage, which really added up. Also, my dorm was small, narrow, and very dated. I was in a ""double,"" but the size was more appropriate for a single."
Recent Alumnus,1,"they say they give out a lot of aid, but I am now almost 300k in the hole debtwise..."
College Sophomore,1,"The one thing I hate about SMU is the administration. I have had two huge conflicts during my time at SMU, and despite my hardest efforts, the administration had no interest in helping me. They treat the students much more like employees than they do equals."
College Freshman,1,"I hate it, I dont want to live here next year"
College Freshman,1,Not open to anything other than white and rich people.
College Freshman,1,If you dont get a house you might as well leave the school. Girls and guys wont talk to you unless you are in a sorority and you can say goodbye to your social life. Most people transfer if they dont get a house. It really runs the school and there is no way to get away from it.
College Freshman,1,Parking is a 45 minutes affair sometimes.
College Sophomore,1,The wifi around campus is totally unreliable. It is never wise to wait until the last minute to do something because the wifi may be down.
College Junior,1,"hahahahaha. where? if you see someone who isnt a white anglo saxon protestant on campus while you are on your visit please come and let me know. (bit of an exaggeration, duh, but you get the point.)

the real lack of diversity is political and philosophical. the boys and girls of this fine institution (think they) are business majors, fiscally conservative, socially liberal and like to have a good time. you arent going to find the next socrates on campus unless you really go looking."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is very expensive at SMU.  If you bring a car, make sure you use it often to ensure the parking permit fee is worth it.  There are garages where you can park, but they aren't necessarily close to your classes.  Plus, there is parking around most dorms and the dining hall.  However, it gets crowded at peak times of the day or-- worse-- during football season.  Honestly, use the bus if you don't plan on traveling outside of the metroplex.  SMU has a private bus that takes you to the main bus/train station and around several surrounding blocks."
College Sophomore,1,All white rich people except for some international students

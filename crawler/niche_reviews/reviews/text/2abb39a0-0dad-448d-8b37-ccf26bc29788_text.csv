Freshman,5,"It's a great school! They truly care about their students!I always wanted to attend a black college.It was HOME. Having grown up in a predominately white neighborhood, I had never been around so many beautiful black people at one time!"
Freshman,5,"Taking classes usually means showing up on class at a particular time, sitting through a somewhat lengthy lecture and then going directly to your next class. Or, if you've spaced your classes out, you may be able to take a break in between, but you still have to stay on campus. It can make for really long, really intense, really exhausting days."
Senior,5,"It’s a great college, very diverse. It’s also a small school & that has its advantages.  The teachers are all awesome as well. I’d recomendable any one to look into this school!"
Senior,5,I took all classes in person. All the class rooms are small which makes learning here very intermediate. No one will be left behind here!
Junior,5,"Virginia Union university is a great university, that is very home feeling and keeps you engaged. This school has made me the man i am today and will always be apart of me."
Freshman,5,My experience at Virginia Union University was a experience no body would want to miss because they offer a lot and they help you as the year goes on
Freshman,5,I like that it isn’t too big. The classes are small which makes it easier to learn and interact with your professors.
Sophomore,5,I love the school culture at Virginia Union.  I love the students and love the relationships that the Professors have with the students.  The teachers are very nurturing which was essential to me my first year away from home.
Sophomore,5,My experience at Virginia Union University is going great so far. The professors are very caring and helpful for their students. All staff memebers genuinely want the best for all students so that we may succeed. Housing at my campus and food needs to be improved. Over all Virginia Union University is an excellent that I can’t wait to convince my future children to attend my future alma mater
Senior,5,"I enjoyed my time at Virginia Union University, especially the Criminal Justice program. The classes are in the police academy right across the street, we have professors who actually been in the field and we visit jails, prisons and detention centers to learn about the different types of jobs"
Graduate Student,5,"In the graduate program in Education, I feel it would be very helpful if the first required course you have to take is Technology. The reason why I strongly believe this is because this program requires a lot of research and writing. All reports are either written or presented using Power Point or Excel. Many students, like myself know the basics of Microsoft Word but struggle with the details  of a program like Power Point and Excel. We need to acquire a higher proficiency in technology because as teachers and administrators we will be faced with utilizing these skills every day."
Junior,5,The college was able to find the best degree program for me due to my busy schedule with two jobs and two children. The advisors and professors were always available and easily approachable.
Freshman,5,Being at Virginia Union University is one of the best school that you could ever attend. It’s an HBCU where you can explore your options and become something better than what you are. Learn how to be leader and not a follower and learn how to choose your own destiny. At union you can learn a lot about yourself and how you want to take your dreams and goals to the next level.
Junior,5,I like that it's an HBCU and everyone there is helpful. The professors are very understanding and hands and passionate about the courses they teach and I would change the cost of tutition. The food that is serviced and the dormitory living .
Freshman,5,"My first year at Virginia union university was a little shaking at he beginning because there was a lot of stuff I to get use to do, the campus is very interesting and the students are nice to get too know . The professor are very helpful and caring."
Freshman,5,"Going to a HBCU is probably that best and smartest decision i could ever make. the teachers here actually work with you. what makes it better is that the classes are small, so the teacher knows you by name and not just another student in the class. The students also take their time put to help other students when they need help. There is also a lot of on campus activities  to help you in determining the career path you would like to go down. Over all, coming to Virginia union university has changed my life goals for the better and i'm only a freshman "
College Junior,5,I am a math education major which a lot of others are not. My classes are small and my professors are what I aspire to be. They are geniuses!
Recent Alumnus,5,Maybe I think it is the best because I am Greek. Virginia Union's greek life is moving towards what it used to be back in the days. They have other organizations other than D9.
College Junior,5,"i love this school they do alot to prepare you for life after college whether it's graduate school or employment. they offer training classes, seminars and awards for each student."

As for attendance since our classes are small professors keep track of who is in class all in class. If they do not see you, some of them may call you to ask where you were at. You are only allowed to miss 3 classes the whole semester unexcused.

For academic my school faithfully expresses the importance of being on the Deans List and succeeding."

College Freshman,5,I love eating on campus. they have very different variety of pizza they all ways have fries i just love fries. i love eating on campus but what really gets me is the hours they need to stay open just a little later for dinner.
College Sophomore,5,"As a theatre major, I will be interning at a theatre and because we are so close to VCU which has 3 or 4 thatres on that campus it would be fairlly easy for me to began my internship. I also already have expierence working at a theatre as an assitstant and being an assitstant to the head of the arts department at VUU."
College Sophomore,5,"The cafeteria is the best place to eat. Especially for a HBCU , the food is great. There is a different variety of foods served every day. You will not ever get tired of eating in the cafeteria. !! You also get a variety of different meats, starches, and vegetables . You will be left satisfied !"
College Freshman,5,I came to University because it a great school and religion back ground
College Freshman,5,For Virginia Union night life can be very fun.  I say that because Virginia Commonwealth University is down the street from Virginia Union and its plenty of clubs and parties over there to go to.

College Sophomore,5,"It's beautiful when it is sunny, but we still have classes. When it snows in the Winter, it snows to where we go to class, but if we have a blizzard, classes are cancelled to the point we just stay in our dorms, but we have to regret it the next day if we have a text or final exam!"
College Sophomore,5,Newly Redone – Everything has been updated toward the generation of technology. Very spaces and very clean
College Sophomore,5,Family Oriented – Here at Virginia Union the teacher to student relationships are similar to those we form at home with our parent. The professors help out if they can and are available if needed

College Sophomore,5,Libraries Are Very Helpful – The library is a very helpful resource at VUU. It's staff is very helpful and the technology is up to date.

College Sophomore,5,"The weather down in Virginia is great except for the rainy days, but the campus it quite small so it make it very easy to get around"
College Freshman,5,Aww Man! The food is good; union does not receive discounts.
College Freshman,5,Drinking Is a Popular Activity on Campus – There is always a possible way to get a hold of something to smoke or an alcoholic beverage. Weekends are usually filled with drunk college students running and falling throughout the halls. As far as drugs you will most likely only find that to be smoking.
Freshman,4,I love that Virginia union us a nice and small campus you can find all the resources you need the people on campus are so friendly. the students so as myself are very good at what we do we try to have as much activities as we can and make sure everyone participates because that's how you get people to meet each other. my experience their was good at first I was shy but now that I know a couple of more people the college really fits me and I don't think I am  going anywhere  anytime soon.
Senior,4,"My experience at Virginia Union University has been Outstanding. The mentors I had were beyond exceptional, they showed the true meaning of family and true bonding; which is the reason why I am the man I am today. Also, the professors instilled me that your work ethic will always speak for itself and not what you say, but what you do and how you are as a person will always go along way regardless of the year, your age, and actions. I would love to see more international students attend this illustrious university because it is open to any and everybody."
Sophomore,4,"Union has been a very exciting experience. The campus is small and makes it feel like a big family. If i could change anything i would make some additions to the variety of food. All in all union is a school that you never forget about, the professors and advisors really care about you succeeding."
Sophomore,4,"Virginia Union University is what you make it as a person. Whatever your preferences are or hobbies, they are created by you. How you interact wit the campus depends on the person."
Sophomore,4,Virginia Union is great. I love it. The people there are so nice and the teaching is great. They are on top of you about certain things and are a very good help to you. I was nervous about attending but it felt like home after a while.  I made some awesome friends.
Graduate Student,4,Registration process is easy and staff very responsive to inquiries. Fees are reasonably priced and payment information is available without lots of searching and headache. I loved the  instant update on missing information which allowed me to track deadlines and submit timely materials.
Senior,4,Union is what you make it. It has its ups and downs but you will get through it. When everyone comes together as one. Impactful things begin to happen to the University and it becomes one big happy family.
Senior,4,So far my experience at Virginia Union University has been more good than bad. The people and staff who attend the University are very helpful and uplifting and very engaged. The academics are great and so are the sports and activities at the school.
Alum,4,"I attend their school of divinity, which is a renowned school for ministers.  I also attended their non-traditional weekend program, so I can't speak to their everyday student life on campus."
Sophomore,4,"I am a transfer and so far I have been enjoying my experience. The other students are friendly, the teachers work with you, lots of different clubs and activities and a pretty positive environment."
Freshman,4,"During  my short time at Virginia Union I have learned many valuable lessons.

Sophomore,4,Virginia Union University is what you make it. There are many different organizations on campus that can help you get involved. The faculty and staff are wonderful to the students and the love for this institution from the faculty and staff and also the students is amazing.

College Junior,4,The professors are good! The curriculum is productive and the workload is respectfully good.

College Junior,4,The professors are good. They are open to help after hours and they are helpful during class if you don't understand things. They will be extend time if you talk with them! They are extremely helpful.
College Junior,4,Greeks are very visual on campus. They are all about recruiting people. They are friendly and helpful. They invite everybody to the parties on and off campus.

Games are strongly supported and all students are encouraged to come out and cheer on the team when playing at home and even away. The athletic department has been very successful over the years as the sport teams here have played hard and well and made it deep into the season.

College Sophomore,4,"Virginia Union is a good school and getting better. They have people their that offer help with everything. More than some professors are hard on you and want to see you succeed.

College Freshman,4,I really love college. I feel like I am finally living my life and working on doing what I want in life.

College Freshman,4,its a great school and the teachers are amazing.
College Freshman,4,"The school is great. The staffing is reasonable with anything you need, but strict on freshmen."
College Freshman,4,if you want more freedom then off campus is the best option. the james and the spectrum are great for vuu students to live. they are close to campus and they are very convenient
College Freshman,4,"Its the perfect college experience , they are close and the cost is reasonable for college students. it has negatively impacted many but others it just allows a get away for some fun time on the weekend."
College Freshman,4,"off campus dining is very convenient, they are close by the school and there are alot of places near each other to choose from."
College Freshman,4,"the financial aid process was the biggest part of getting into school, it went very well though and they helped with all questions i had"

College Sophomore,4,"I love attending a HBCU. It's why I'm here!

."
College Freshman,4,"Hello I am currently a Freshman at Virginia Union University and staying on campus for me was a great choice. The people are nice and very welcoming. I like how campus is very diverse from males to females. No one judges you for who you are, you can just be yourself. I would totally recommend Union to some people. The dorms are pretty spacious, easy to meet new friends, there are always activities. The housing process is very easy also."
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone is diverse, guys and girls"
College Sophomore,4,"The psychology program is great. Just stay on top of your advisers, and make sure you take good notes and stay in good contact with all of your professors."
College Sophomore,4,"Any time me and my friends go to Mansion its a great time unless it is locals night which is on Thursdays, but even some Thursdays you can go and enjoy yourself."
College Sophomore,4,"They actually have good classes. I have been the most challenged with the courses. I love the fact that the offer most tutors in the same building as where most classes are held. The workload for some classes can be hard' but with some time management, it's doable. They have great work study opportunities also. To a Psychology major is not a huge deal on campus but is a little important to the counselors who help get the proper classes you need for your degree and your profession. The dorms are good, maybe a little work needs to be done to Hartshorn Hall, with the air and pipes, but other than that its fine."
College Sophomore,4,"The Professors are very nice and have no problem working with you if you are having difficulties. The best thing is that if they themselves cannot match your learning style they try to send you to someone who can help you better. The registration process can be a bit of a headache but once its done, its done. The most popular place to study is actually the library, its quiet and very calm atmosphere."
College Sophomore,4,Oh there is not much of a problem accepting those who are from a religious background. The school actually tries to make those who are of a different background still feel very comfortable within the University. The rate of LGBT diverse persons steadily grow. Half of the people I know are either gay or bi-sexual.
College Sophomore,4,"At my university, I experienced a lot. College life is awesome when you have a great mind set. I did everything my freshman year at college and looking for more fun next semester."
College Freshman,4,The off campus dining options are great.
College Freshman,4,Smoking and drinking is prohibited
College Freshman,4,Greek life can be big but still low-key at times
Alum,2,"I had the worst 4 years ever I didn’t really get the college experience Virginia Union felt more like high school. It was 3 different shootings on campus in 1 year and I just didn’t feel safe at all, so I need to see Virginia Union switch up there security around the campus to keep students safe."
Freshman,2,"Virginia Union isn't a university to be taken seriously. The bottom lines in that you pay $30,000 a year and do not receive the quality of what you pay. They do not take care of their students, safety is horrible,  and the dorms need to be destroyed and rebuilt."
Freshman,2,"The school isn't worth the amount that students have to pay. The older dorms are really nasty with mold in certain areas and have pests. The air conditioning doesn't work a lot of the times so when its cold outside its very cold inside and when its hot outside its very extremely hot inside, especially in some of the dorms. The water for the showers is cold from time to time. The schools wifi connection is very low most of the time and sometimes it just goes out completely which happens several times. The football stadium is very small and the away side bleaches are made of old hard pieces of wood. The actual football field is a disaster and is usually always muddy and doesn't have some type of surface platform around it like a track forcing people to have to step in the grass on bad conditions. When it rains the field becomes a huge mudslide. The best thing about this school is that the campus is small and you don't have to travel to far to get to class."
College Junior,2,No on campus parties. We are Christian based
College Senior,2,"For me it's hard to get an internship or part time job in my major. I am an Accounting major. I expect the career service to have accounting firms on the lists when we have job fairs but all we have when it comes to the Business majors is Banks, Insurance companies and forth. It's okay to invite Banks and all but we need at least to have some top accounting firms. The only time I see alumni network is during homecoming."
College Freshman,2,worst college experience when it came down to legal info
College Freshman,2,i got mold poisoning in my room and the temperatures were so backwords
College Sophomore,2,We had several incidents of students being roofied. This was not on campus though this was off campus. The school is generally safe just not the environment around it.
College Sophomore,2,"I live in LLC which is the new dorm. It is a new dorm and already students are tearing it apart. There is trash everywhere all along the stairwells. The janitors fail to keep it cleansy. Huntley Hall needs to be remodeled. Storer Hall needs better occupants. Newman Hall is decent, just the bathrooms are nasty. MacVicar Hall is usually just ratchet"
College Sophomore,2,Our basketball gym has no windows. There are a bunch of pillars blocking the view of a basketball game. Our football stadium bleachers are not sturdy and needs to be improved. We are the second oldest operated field in the country and honestly nothing has changed since it was originally built.
College Freshman,2,im transferring because my room had mold and off campus in Richmond is expensive
College Sophomore,2,Not my type of school but the professors are great. There is barley anything to do on campus and around campus. I would rather not comment on the dorms.
College Sophomore,2,"Vuu had more bad days than good ones. Majority of the school board cared for themselves. As a commuter, it was extremely difficult. And when I was given the opportunity to stay on campus, I chose not to because it was better than the everyday bs that went on at vuu. From the dorm life down to the food. The only good thing that came from that school was friends and they're all transferring away. If you don't leave by first semester freshman year, you're basically trapped because they won't transfer many credits. They give you classes other schools won't except. This school has one of the highest tuition fees in the state and the only thing that shows for it is the monuments they put up to impress alumni. The dorms are terrible, the food is disgusting, the wifi suck, the campus activities are boring so that leaves the students to find other things to do. Terrible eating hours 12-1am brunch and 6-8pm dinner (which you can only eat once with people scouring for a place to sit. There isn't any other places on campus to eat at after 8pm which forces students to order out. The janitor comes once a week. It's terrible honestly."
College Freshman,2,No dining places that really stand out besides your regular fast food places.
College Sophomore,2,We have to constantly call the financial aid office about problems.
College Freshman,2,The financial aid process at my school is really bad. The people that work there make everything more difficult than it is. It is a complete disaster.
College Freshman,2,Our athletics are bad at my school.
College Freshman,2,Its bad my school doesn't have transportation
College Junior,2,There needs to be more strict policies. The students grades and attendance do show a drop-off.
College Junior,2,Safety is a precaution considering the surrounding area of the school. Anything can happen at any time so you have to know how to protect yourself and stay alert at all times. 
College Junior,2,"Students need to be more responsible for their actions. I don't smoke or drink so i wouldn't want to be around that stuff at all. No real peer pressure, a no is a no. "
College Sophomore,2,"There are many rules and regulations for my particular school that really affect the lives of the students. For instance, when it comes to visitation is certain dorms, it is sometimes either allowed at a certain time or not at all. These rules are enforced a lot but at times seem to be not really paid attention to depending on the time of the year or how the head people are feeling the specific day."
College Sophomore,2,There isn't transportation for my specific campus. The only time there is a shuttle bus is when there is an event at another school or at a nearby club. There isn't transportation coming from our campus to another campus or school in the area that is convenient for the students at my institution. It would be very good if there was a reliable source of transportation on my campus outside of taxis and the public transportation outside of the university.
College Sophomore,2,"The weather where my school is located is very confusing and can really affect the daily lives of us students. For instance, a couple of days in the week will be pretty warm and fair and then the rest of the week would be chilly or rainy. During the fall especially, the weather tends to change on a day to day basis. The weather one week would be warm and feel like that of spring or summer then the following week would be extremely cold and feel like the weather during the winter time."
College Senior,2,"The café is always open until 8 p.m. The café does not offer very many selections. It is like we eat the same thing everyday. We do not have any late night options, so if you get hungry, you are on your own."
College Senior,2,VUU is a HBCU. There is really no diversity in the  school. This is also a pricate school with the belief in christianity. 
College Senior,2,"Poor record in the last past years. 
Don't take their education seriously ( I have witness being their classmate)"
College Sophomore,2,"As a freshmen we had curfew which got in the way of our party times, but it didn't affect us that bad as long as we did what we had to do during the week, our RA's were pretty lienent. However our campus police were very oblivious to what was going on and they would shut down the wrong events. For example at the end of first semester, a lot of fights broke out and it wsn't until a huge crowd gathered that city police came and then when things died down, campus police came around to the dorms. But when our sororities wanted to do a step show during the day campus police shut that down immediately."
College Sophomore,2,"I would say the most unique thing my school has is it's history. They are literally a from ashes to riches school, coming from slavery to becoming a growing HBCU."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus life gives a great experience and there are many opportunities using ""Panther Track""  that the school gives to help with internships and future careers."
College Freshman,2,The male freshman dorms aren't great.  The bathrooms and showers are very dirty and nasty.  It is always trash on the floor of the hallways.  Same with upperclassmen and some female dorms as well.  Its just because a lot of people in the dorms doesn't have any home training.
College Freshman,2,"There are fast food restaurants around the area, but if a person wants a good meal you have to travel a little more out to find something good to eat. The food cost is cheap but the quality is poor at times. Student discounts around the area is limited and the best places to check out is New York fried chicken,     captain D's and burger king."
College Freshman,2,Just have cool parties nothing more to really say. There aren't many on campus so it really isn't all that big
College Freshman,2,A lot of guys are rude and disrespectful. They are inconsiderate as far as dormitory living. Nasty bathrooms and showers all the time. The females are okay probably an even amount of good looking females to not so good looking. The females are cool though
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid is kind of a hassle. They'll tell you one thing and then its another when you get there. Although the may run out of funds such as work study, there are a lot of other scholarships they offer such as choir, military, returning students, and etc. Its harder to get a scholarship if you are a transfer student that is coming in during the spring semester."
College Sophomore,2,"I give the food and dining rooms a C because, the food areas are no bigger then my former high school cafes and the food choices are repetitive and half the time not even good."
College Freshman,2,There aren't a lot of facilities for students. Very boring.
College Freshman,2,"The weather is really bipolar in VA, but I already knew that because I'm from Virginia Beach, but Richmond is much colder."
College Sophomore,2,"Being that my school is a bit older and has alot of history behind it, I think they're hesitant to just reconstruct the entire campus for loss of sentimental value and the amount of money it'd take to do so. Although the facilities we have now are decent, they aren't all up to par and I think could use a make over!"
College Sophomore,2,College housing is average on the campus.  Many students prefer to live off-campus after their first year at school.  SInce a new property was recently built near the school many students are attracted too living there.  Also the student housing can be very strict for freshman who have curfew.  The laundry facility is actually a plus though because they do not charge you to wash your clothes which is very convenient.
Sophomore,1,"Horrible school. Waste of 30,000 dollars. Your degree means nothing from this school. Pass most students along. Dorms are dirty, smelly, molded walls. Cold showers, no air conditioning. Very judgmental staff. Collecting checks no hard work around campus. Horrible cafe same food daily. Unsafe anyone can come on campus and do anything . STUDENTS ROBBED MULTIPLE TIMES. Drug dealers everywhere students do nothing but smoke smoke smoke . Very bad environment. Not the typical college experience. Just taking money from less fortunate African Americans just to say they have a degree no activities for students . All boy dorms.  All girl dorms. No visitation . curfew pretty much jail without shackles"
College Sophomore,1,I do not recommend this school for anyone this school does not live up to the cost the dorms are awful the professors (some) are unprofessional & unorganized. The safety of this campus is a big issue anyone can walk into this campus & there are not any food choices on campus but the cafeteria. School definitely needs to be remodeled.
College Senior,1,"Living on campus is the worse ever. The dorms are not good, there are mold in the rooms, talk about  the shower, gosh it's worse I have no word to describe it. The buildings are old, and it's costly to live on campus, the recently build a new dorm which cost more but the rooms are not that big."
College Sophomore,1,"Everything at this school is bias. If you dont act a certain way you simply wont get in certain programs. Everyone here is judgemental and usually stick to their own group. There is not many programs, activities, or meetings that sparks an interest in me. There is no variety here."
College Freshman,1,ANYBODY CAN WALK ON CAMPUS !
College Sophomore,1,Housing is terrible. To get into the only good building you have to be an athlete or have a high gpa. Anything under that building (for male dorms) would be up to if not considered the projects.
College Sophomore,1,I don't think co-ed should ever be taken away.
College Sophomore,1,It's terrible. The FA office rarely answers.
College Sophomore,1,The fact that we do not have cable in our dorms is the worst. The fact that our campus is no all that safe.
College Sophomore,1,"I would like to live off campus, but it is more expensive than staying on campus."
College Sophomore,1,It is hard for me to get enough money for school.
College Freshman,1,This school has the worst dorms I've ever seen.
College Senior,1,It is every man for himself when being on the Campus. We have to find our own ways to hospitals and etc. Even the ones with the school insurance.
College Senior,1,I will never step food in another dorm after living in the dorms at Virginia  Union University. 
College Senior,1,"Food is very nasty.
Poor choices"
College Senior,1,"Public transportation is not safe
School doesn't provide transportation"
College Sophomore,1,"Food on my campus needs to step it up 100%. Food choices are limited and food is greasy, pizza everday is not a healthy diet."
College Sophomore,1,"While the dorm I lived in has nice size rooms, and air circulation is great, the cleanliness of the buildings are terrible. In my dorm we were subject to getting rats, roaches and spiders throughout the year no matter how much cleaning we did. In another dorm, they did not have AC so all throughout the hotter days they either melted in their dorms or had to buy their own portable AC. Our last female dorm, was said to have bed bus, and fly roaches. The cleanliness of the campus is terrible and it is starting to trickle into our living areas."
College Freshman,1,"As long as your low key with what ever you do, you won't have anything to worry about."
College Freshman,1,The teachers can't be taken seriously; they are too easy on the students. The classes are repeats from middle and high school; students aren't challenged enough.

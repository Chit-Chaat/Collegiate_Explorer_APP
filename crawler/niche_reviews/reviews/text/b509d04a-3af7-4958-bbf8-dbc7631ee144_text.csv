Freshman,5,"Vol State is amazing when it comes to atmosphere, I feel like I am always enjoying my time spent there because of the positive atmosphere. My peers are extremely supportive and helping when it comes to assignments."
Sophomore,5,"Volunteer State Community College is an exceptionally refined school. I attended after graduating from high school, and found that Volstate served as an excellent segue into studying at University. 
The teachers are top rated and the student body is diverse and peaceful.
The campus is well laid out and easy to navigate, and classrooms were, for the most part, a decent size for the student capacity.
Volstate offers many clubs and organizations that any student can participate in including the Volunteer Club, The Green Team, and the Settler Student Newspaper.
Overall, my experience at the school was amazing and I would recommend attending to anyone looking for a quality, affordable education."
Sophomore,5,internet classes weren't very interesting or engaging. I love going to class and sitting in a lecture with open discussions and peer critiques. these online classes strip that from me which is really my own problem but oh well.
Sophomore,5,it's a great school with teachers who care. The campus itself is maintained every day. We have tons of activities throughout the semesters. The cafeteria is stocked with all different types of food along with a made to order. The school itself offers a wide variety of majors and classes and the staff helps you aachieve every goal you set.
Sophomore,5,"Although the classrooms were sometimes a bit too small or too big, the professors always made sure that you as an individual was able to get/see the material."
Sophomore,5,I’m not a huge fan of online schooling but the setup (once you get familiar with it) is easy and understandable. The teachers are always available
Niche User,5,"During the COVID-19 quarantine, all of my classes with Volunteer state were moved online. This was a difficult transition for all parties involved, but the professors and faculty did their best to continue meeting student needs. I had taken some online courses before and I could not tell the difference between the courses designed to be online and the courses that had to be modified because of COVID. I was very impressed by the versatility of the professors, faculty, and online learning platform."
Freshman,5,The professors are amazing and are willing to go above and beyond to make sure you succeed. This school even offers free tutoring and a learning commons center. If ever there is a problem you can always reach out to someone for help!
Sophomore,5,"I believe community college is a great option to save money and figure out one's  ideal major. I thoroughly enjoyed Volunteer State Community College. The staff and employees at this college really do care about their students. With smaller classrooms, I found it was easy to learn and created a positive environment. I would highly recommend Vol State."
Sophomore,5,I love this college. I wish it were a four year college so I wouldn't have to transfer. The staff is extremely helpful. My advisor goes above and beyond to help me get my graduation requirements done.

Niche User,5,Great Duel Enrollment program. Volunteer State Community College is known for being very clean and safe.
Sophomore,5,"I believe that anyone who plans to seek higher education should  transfer from a community college. Volunteer State has prepared me for my future. Not only has it prepared me, but at a low low cost of nothing. Thanks to the Tennessee promise, I got 2 years of school free and I earned my associates. I feel confident that when I transfer, I will succeed."
Sophomore,5,Its a wonderful school! I am very happy to be graduating from this school. They have lots of help in every area needed and lots of different degree choices.
Sophomore,5,Students and faculty are extremely helpful! Professors proactively helped to make sure you are given all the tools possible to succeed!
Freshman,5,"I like Vol State because it is a small school so the professors can be more in tune with the students. The only thing i wish was better was the athletics available. For instance there isn't a soccer team, and I really wish that was included."
Sophomore,5,"The campus is in excellent condition with a huge library and academic help for all students.  The programs offered are relevant to workforce needs, such as Mechatronics including programming logic controls and Sleep Study technicians."
Freshman,5,"So far, I've been attending Vol State since the beginning of this fall. The moment I entered campus I was in love. Vol State has the perfect size campus for a community college. It is really easy to find your way around campus and the faculty and staff are so friendly and willing to drop everything to help you with what ever you may need. The campus buldings are very well kept and clean and the campus itself is gorgeous."
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere of the school itself. I love the diverse community that’s in it. Overall it’s a joy going to school everyday!
Freshman,5,"I love studying at Volunteer State Community College. The advisors and professors are extremely nice. They always willingly assist me when I need help. Facilities are also quite good, too."
Sophomore,5,"The thing about Volunteer State Community College is that many people overlook it simply because they think they need to go to something better. However, while I have only been attending for a year I have found that the campus is beautiful and is shown much care. Not only that, but the teachers I have had have all cared more about the fact that I am learning than most of even my high school teachers. While it may seem like Volstate is a college that should be avoided, it is often said by students that have returned from other colleges that Volunteer State Community College is much better, more affordable, and the classes are more rewarding."
Freshman,5,"I love Vol State. It is a great community college that provides an excellent opportunity for a great education, but some of the professors don't care to fix issues on certain things that are out  your hands and are in theirs, but other than that, it's a great school to go to."
Sophomore,5,"What I enjoy about Volunteer State Community College is the accessibility of resources on and off campus. The professors are kind and willing to help their students. Their office hours are always posted and they will always try to make time to meet with their students. The campus itself is beautiful and comfortable, every resource is with reach which is very helpful and convenient. There are many opportunities fro students to engage in clubs on campus. One thing I would like to change is the engagement of students on campus. Being President of the Civitan Club, our main goal right now is to have students participate more and engage in activities the campus and clubs host. Overall, Volunteer State Community College has given me a delightful first year of college and I am looking forward to my second year!"
Sophomore,5,"For a state college, I'm pretty happy with the staff. They were all very helpful and remained patient with me. My advisers also helped me with learning about CLEP exams, which was huge."
Freshman,5,"This is my first year, and I love my college! I am glad I came here instead of going directly to a four year university. It's smaller, therefore it's easier to get around the campus. Also, easier on learning more on communication/interaction skills among students."
Sophomore,5,I love going to Volunteer State Community College. They offer a ton of resources to help me succeed. The teachers actually care about you learning and succeeding. It is apparent that every member of the staff wants to see you achieve your goals.

Senior,5,"Volunteer State Community College, it's a college that I can double major, which in one hand it's great because the 2 majors I want to major on it's Art and Nursing, which Vol State has it. Another reason why I love this college it's because like I have TN Promise, I will have my frist two years free of financial of college."
Freshman,5,It’s an amazing start to your college career. The staff here are guaranteed to help you whenever needed. Classes are easy to find on campus. The cafeteria prices are reasonable.

Alum,5,"I loved the food, the professors were really good at their jobs and they cared about the students, and the campus is really gorgeous."
Sophomore,5,I love the campus and all of my professors are amazing! I’ve never had a problem at Vol State. If i could change anything it would be the student life on campus. I would love to see more people attend the games for our athletics.
Graduate Student,5,"An amazing College. People are helpful and kind, professors will take the time to help you. All the staff works with you and helps in any way that they can. Campus is great, they have remodeled a ton and it is up to date."
Alum,5,I enjoyed Vol State when I attended school there! It was great because it was close to home but still gave you the college feel! I do wish that it was a four year college but I am ready to come back to take some more courses!
Freshman,5,"I really love the staff at Vol State! I’ve been to other colleges & they just didn’t seem to care about your success as much as they did your money. The professors & advisors are so helpful in making the transition from high school to college, as well as the transition from Vol State to another school very easy & not so overwelming. I feel like Vol state genuinely cares about seeing you succeed, & like other schools, aren’t just concerned about your money."
Freshman,5,"The staff members are all very friendly and helpful. There are so many resources to ensure your success, such as the learning commons, tutoring, and free calculator rentals. Also, there are plenty of clubs and events on campus for those who want to get involved- it truly enriches the college experience. This is a great place to get a valuable education."
Senior,5,"I've had an excellent experience at VolState. The campus is clean and easy to navigate, there's plenty of parking, and the equipment and resources are all up to date."

Sophomore,5,The campus is amazing it is just as big as a university. The variety of food there is endless from healthy to junk that will help you through the day.
Freshman,5,"My experience in Volunteer State Community College was like no other. My first day of college was a successful and stress-free experience. Every corner of the school was someone to help you out. The school offers the best services for tutoring and for no charge! The professor help you a lot more then you think. If you have any questions, they'll always answer it no matter how embarrassing or dumb the question might be. The College breakfast and lunch are one of the best meals I had in any any other school and for the right price."
Junior,5,Volunteer state community college is great. They have great teacher and staff. I wouldn't change a thing about this school.
Sophomore,5,"I had a great experience at Vol State. I am currently finishing up my last semester, but I wish it was a four year university. The teachers are amazing, there's many tutors, and it is just a friendly environment."
Sophomore,5,I enjoyed the small campus that allowed me to be in a classroom with only about 20 or so students. It allowed me to build a relationship with my professor which makes a huge difference in a semester.
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at the Volunteer State Community College has been amazing so far. All the professors that I had previously had the pleasure of listening to, have always kept my attention and taught me many new things about the subjects. If you are currently about to graduate from high school, I highly recommend coming to the College. It is a great place to get used to the new experiences that you will get when leaving high school."
Alum,5,"This school puts the community in community college. Everyone is a friend, a study buddy, or a mentor. The teachers take time to meet and help those that struggle. The food is mouth watering and the scenery is breathtaking. Everyone works hard at this school, from the gardeners to the professors to the students themselves. I would not change a thing about it. Best two years of my life."
Junior,5,"Volunteer State Community College is a really great school to attend. You may not be going to a university, but when you step on campus you will definitely feel like you are at one. Professors and faculty are always on call to help students. There are always functions going on that welcomes both students and staff.  Coming to Vol State you will definitely feel at home & welcomed."
Junior,5,"Professors are very open and friendly for the most part. There's one every once in a while that seems to keep it too serious and is fun, but not quite as loose as some of the others. I like that they treat us as people, and not a job entirely. It's nice to feel human and not like the interaction is because we're paying them to be there."
Niche User,5,This is an excellent school. The teachers care and are more than willing to help if needed. They also have an excellent tutoring system.
Sophomore,5,"All of the professor are extremely helpful. They make sure that you understand the material and if you are struggling, they give you plenty of resources to use to help get you back on track. It is a very helpful and amazing college!"
Niche User,5,"I love vol state because they help me when I need it. I have an advisor in case I need the help, they have open tutor hours to help you when you're falling behind in the library. Their financial aid goes out of the way to help me and keep me in school."
Sophomore,5,Vol State is a great community college for anyone just out of high school or wanting to return for a college degree. You can take care of all your basic necessary classes for a much better price then at a regulator four year university. Even though Vol state don't offer housing/dorms; a lot of people do travel for the college. The campus life is active and Vol state has a great cafeteria with good food at a good price. The Vol State campus in Gallatin offers other restaurants to choice from if you feel like eating off campus. The staff at the college are always nice and the library staff are always around to help you with homework and papers. We also have a learning commons that can have a individual tutor help you with anything you need. The professors are pretty good and helpful when you need them. Vol State is a great community college for anyone and everyone to get a first hand look at what a college experience is like.
College Sophomore,5,I have taken many online courses and have found all of them very easy and convenient.
College Sophomore,5,They are very caring about getting you into another school.
College Sophomore,5,Small classes and everyone knows the information they are teaching/being taught.
College Sophomore,5,Everything is easy and straightforward. They care about if you are enjoying problems and if you have any problems.
College Senior,5,"Sometimes working your schedule around other needed classes can be difficult, but the same problem is everywhere. An easy solution is always available, whether tak8ng the class online or going to a neighbor site to take the class."
College Senior,5,"Returning to college after almost 20 years, I was terrified. I quickly learned that my teachers and professors cared that I succeeded. They are easy to talk to and understand what we as students are going through."
College Senior,5,Professors push you to succeed in classes and with goals moving you toward graduation and beyond.  Education classes prepare you for the classroom.
College Senior,5,"A great group of professors, tutors and office staff, who have a united goal of making sure that students succeed."
Freshman,4,I never missed any information received online and the staff was excellent in keeping me updated. I was emailed and notified whenever something new was posted so I never stressed about missing something crucial like due dates.
Sophomore,4,"As school online is a new learning experience for many students, the teachers at Volunteer State Community College have been very kind as to help students adapt to this new wave of education. Professors have been very patient and informative."
Niche User,4,"Volunteer State Community College was a great place to start my college journey. The environment was welcoming from day one and the staff was always ready to help. I had several professors that went above and beyond what was required to assure that their students received a quality education. The facilities were always clean and available. There were several on-campus clubs, Long Hollow Young Adults and Phi Theta Kappa, for example, that were very active and helped to make my experience great! I would highly recommend this college for anyone looking to earn their associates degree, earn a degree in one of their specialized 4-year programs, or looking to go back to school, really anyone living in middle TN!"
Sophomore,4,"Overall, the Volunteer State Community College experience was really amazing. The professor was respectful and taught subjects in fashion manner."
Junior,4,"Volunteer State has a nice and calm way of life, I wish the campus was bigger. Anyways, it is a nice community College to attend."
Junior,4,I like how they have many options for people even though they are a relatively small school. Teachers are more personable and understanding of everyone’s personal situations. I do wish that the administration was a little more organized in some areas but they are otherwise helpful.
Freshman,4,"What I liked most about Volunteer State Community College was its passion to encourage students to get a higher education after high school, and to pursue after a hard-working lifestyle. Overall, I enjoyed my time at Vol State!"
Freshman,4,I like the environment that surrounds me at Volunteer State for so many reasons. The professors and the people you meet there are so friendly and always willing to help. I enjoy how convenient it is for me to go there because of its' close distance to my house. The campus is clean and there is always security around which ensures me how safe I am while being there. The change that I think would better my experience at Volunteer State is additional parking. There is a lack of parking at school which makes it stressful to get a spot guaranteed and make it to your class on time.
Niche User,4,The Dual Enrollment Program is super helpful in getting a head start on college life and the education I want to earn.
Sophomore,4,The faculty have always been very helpful. For a small community college I think they are pretty nice.
Alum,4,"I would recommend Volstate as a community college.  It was easy to navigate, great education and the tools to help every student succeed. You get the same education at a discounted rate, it definitely is a good school to get your feet wet if you are pursuing a bachelors degree."
Freshman,4,Vol State has great academics and a great location for a community college. Loved my time taking classes there!
Sophomore,4,"Most has been great, but open scholarship opportunities up to non-US citizens to and you'll get 5 stars!"
Sophomore,4,"Vol State has always been good to me. I've never had any major issues with the college. Always staffed,  clean learning environment, good professors. The one thing I would like to see changed is more representation for STEM students. Some classes weren't available because of the lack of students interested in taking the classes"
Sophomore,4,"It is a very clean campus and well kept. I always feel very safe when I go on the campus. They offer the TN Promise and Reconnect and offer many different degrees. I am going for the PTA program and it is one of the best in the state. They are always trying to get students involved on campus and in the community. The professors are very nice, helpful, and have lots of office hours."
Freshman,4,"I was first drawn to how close this school was to my home and community. It was a quick and easy process, even for someone like myself who's been out of school for 10+ years, to sign up and get enrolled into classes."
Freshman,4,"So far it’s going great, I’m almost done with my spring semester of my freshman year. The campus is really pretty and has a lot of cool hang out spots from what I can tell. I’ve only ever been on campus a few times because I have had to take my classes thus far online, but I can’t wait to actually attend this fall!"
Freshman,4,"The campus is very modern, and the professors are very clear in what they expect in all of their classes. The parking is a little small, so make sure you get there early if you want a good space!"
Niche User,4,Volstate was a very friendly college with  professors who had a variety of teaching methods. Some professors were hands on while others were more technological wired.
Freshman,4,"Volunteer State Community College is an amazing place to learn and grow! It is a small school with enough room to flourish while still retaining a close-knit, family environment. The professors are always happy to help students in any way they can with academics or personal struggles. Buildings are easy to navigate and the campus is lovely, especially near the student garden. I am glad to have begun my college career at  Volunteer State!"
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed Volunteer State Community College. It’s close to my work, and the staff and students are friendly and helpful. There’s not much I’d like to see change."
Alum,4,"While my opinion of VolState is slightly raised by the fact I had gone to the abysmal Gallatin High School for the latter three quarters of my senior year, the school is legitimately great; the staff all care deeply about their subjects, the campus is beautiful (if somewhat small -- but it IS Gallatin, after all), and the overall ""vibe"" was very positive. As a disclaimer, I did attend as a TN Promise student, but the price was right on the courses I paid for myself."
Sophomore,4,"The professors at Vol State really care about your success in their class. There are plenty of resources for you to be successful and basically anyone who works on the campus are willing to help you in whatever way they need to. Advisors are amazing and are a lot of help when it comes to registering for classes. The only down part is that it is very similar to high school. Every one already has their ""friend group"" so it's hard to make new friends."
Sophomore,4,"It is a good step up from High School, just an easy transition. Convenient for people who live in the Tennessee area and really good food! The teachers have all been very helpful!"
Sophomore,4,"The school has many scholarship opportunities and has a wonderful support system for students.  Because most students who attend here also work, there is not much time for social interactions.  It is small enough to have a relationship with your teachers, but large enough to attract good teachers.  It has a beautiful campus and a great cafeteria, book store, and library."
Sophomore,4,Volstate community college is in gallatin TN. It is a good community college. I wish the online class weren't so hard.
Niche User,4,Volunteer State Community College has a great EMT/Paramedic professors and program. The program is very affordable and job placement outcomes are very high.
Junior,4,I am still attending the school for one more semester but for a community college I love it here. I would like to see a bit more class options but the financial aid office especially Sherrie Cannon is absolutely amazing.
Alum,4,"A good school with professors that care about their students. The classes were small in size, with teachers that were free for any academic help."
Sophomore,4,"Volunteer State Communit College is great for students looking for a smaller, more connected experience with their education and professors. The classes are designed for the best learning experience possible and the professors genuinely care about your education."
Freshman,4,"i enjoy it a lot at vol state. volunteer state isn't a party school and I like that a lot, its very diverse, for the most part, professors and  students are friendly, helpful, and kind in all aspects. most teachers are very helpful and on point with their job and teaching students, producing an education in a way that I feel is right. small, local campus, I like it a lot"
Freshman,4,I think Vol State is a very great community college. It for sure was a great choice to start out here on my part. I think somethings they need to change is making the campus more lively. I feel like I walk to class and then leave right after I don't connect with anything. I would also like if they had more selections of sports or even intermural sports so everyone could get connected.
Sophomore,4,"After 3 semesters at Vol State, with one to graduate with an associates, I am extremely grateful for the opportunities Vol State has given me. Attending Vol State has also given me a large potential for several transfer scholarships. I have taken some extremely easy classes, as well as some extremely hard ones. The main thing I have noticed about the professors and faculty at Vol state is that they all want their students  to succeed."
Freshman,4,"This school has been so great so far. Ive had several amazing courses, and the people have been fantastic. I enjoy having the freedom of being in my home city while being able to attend classes. This school has gone past my expectations for sure."
Freshman,4,The professors care and are willing to work with you if need help. The ones I have encountered understand that their class is not your only or most important class.  Hard work is mostly rewarded. Good place to start the journey of higher learning.
Alum,4,"I had to work really hard to get my degree through Vol State. The courses are challenging, but there is a lot of resources to lean on for students. I wish I would have taken advantage of them sooner and more often. There are a ton great professors, and a few horrible ones. I especially had a horrendous English professor one semester. Overall, I would go here again  before hitting a 4 year university to save some cash."
Freshman,4,"Volunteer State is a great college to step right into. It is very spacious, so chances are you won't hear the people in the class beside you. The professors are alright. I believe they can alway improve."
Niche User,4,"VolState is an excellent community college that offers endless educational opportunities. Although the school is relatively small, it is filled with helpful, caring staff and friendly, optimistic students. Go Pioneers!"
Sophomore,4,Vol State is great for anyone who is unsure of what career they are wanting. It is a good place to start before transferring to a four year school. I love it at Vol State.
Sophomore,4,Overall I think this campus has a lot to offer for it's size and support.  I was pleasantly surprised by the academic standards that are held in every course.
College Sophomore,4,Many of the professors care about what they teach.
College Senior,4,"This school is filled with amazing professors who go the extra mile to make sure their students understand and fully engage in the college learning experience. The actual campus at Cookeville is a little small, but other than that, it is truly great."
College Junior,4,Online courses can be easy or can be very hard. It's basically all about teaching yourself. And I enjoyed it I felt like I moved at my own pace but still pace to do your work.
College Senior,4,"Ok so there were a few classes where I was SUPER frustrated, but it all comes with being in college. Overall, my experience was great. I made some pretty great friends who I hope will be lifelong and learned things I never thought I could learn."
College Senior,4,"You know, to be honest, I'm not really sure. I haven't met anyone else with the same major as me and the school system had my major messed up. So I'm not sure what's it like to be my major. I know I really want a career in it, but that's about it."
College Senior,4,"I made some really great friends and overall, had some pretty great professors. I learned a lot, and really looking forward to next semester."
College Senior,4,"I feel that I do better in the classroom. I like the classroom interaction better and feel that I get more out of the classroom, but I have gained much knowledge from the online courses that I have taken. The online courses that I have taken have been easy to maneuver in and the workload has always been adequately laid out. All of the classes have had much peer to peer interaction as well as good communication between the professor and students."
College Senior,4,They prepare you for upcoming events; going onto bigger colleges and prepare you to be ready in your career down the road.
College Senior,4,"Since Vol State is a community college there aren't any options for internships, but they do offer a great support network of tutors, colleges to speak with, and events with career services."
College Senior,4,"Teachers worked very well with my work schedule, and travel for different things. I was able to work around my schedule and school see everything done in a proper and timely manner. I was very thankful for this at my school."
College Senior,4,"I have not looked much into the postgrad side of college I'm just kind of going along with it, and taking us about a time"
College Senior,4,"I have had a good experience with all of my teachers, except for one. I've enjoyed going to class, they make it fun, exciting, and encouraged me to do very well in school."
College Senior,4,"There are so many good communications classes, since I'm studying radio and television broadcasting. They had a wow does not allow me to work in the field I am interested in, haven't given me much experience and what I love to do."
College Senior,4,"I love every opportunity I have been given at Volunteer State community college. It is challenging and they work hard for my success, and encouraged me each step of the way."
College Sophomore,4,"Not perfect, but definitely flexible. A++"
College Sophomore,4,School tries to work with you and helps you out.
College Sophomore,4,The professors actually care about their students
College Sophomore,4,"Workload - Average

Info - Actually matters in life"
College Sophomore,4,This school is a friendly and open campus.
College Senior,4,"I haven't used the programs at school for an internship for the school, but I do like that every semester there is at least one career fair for the student to make the student shown out there. The work load on the average student is very low especially if you use one of the registration programs to even out your classes."
Freshman,2,Between having to run around from building to building trying to get simple information and long hold periods on telephone calls just to be hung up on or told no helpful information I recommend going to a college who actually cares about your future and bettering your education.
College Junior,2,Again I really have no idea. I've never heard anything about the post-grad services.
College Junior,2,"I honestly don't know. I've never actually noticed any of these. That sounds terrible, but I've never seen any internship prospects, and I have no idea what the alumni actually do. As for employers on campus, the only thing I know to say is that the library hires students to help out when they don't have classes."
College Freshman,2,I do not anything about the alumni network. It is okay.
College Sophomore,2,"I honestly know nothing about how my school accomplishes any of these things, or if they even do."
College Sophomore,2,"I am only eligible for Hope Scholarship due to what my parents make. However, it is not taken into consideration that I do not live at home. Neither of my parents pay for any of my living expenses and it is not fair that it is also based on their income. The people at the financial aid office are nice, but I am not eligible to claim ""independent student"" because of my mom caring insurance on me. Yet Obama has the health care act where she can't not carry me, and it is the same amount she will be paying either way. Yes, My mom pays my heath insurance but no she doesn't pay for my car insurance, tuition, fuel money to drive their, rent, food, cellular device, or many other miscellaneous fees that I have. The fact that I have a cousin thats parents don't make as much as mine (they pay for everything for him) and he gets paid to go to a university, but yet I've got a loan that collects over a dollar a day in interest and will be in debt. How is it fair that some students are paid to go to school and have parents assistance in everything they do, but someone from a divorced home can't even be able to get any assistance from either due to the fact that they make a lot of money. "
College Senior,2,"I have come to find that in being enrolled at Volunteer State Community College, I am unable to meet the requirements for my associates degree due to the lack of classes available.  Vol State does not offer all classes that are required for an accounting major."
College Junior,2,"There aren't really any impressive characteristics to speak of that put VolState above any other community college. Just your standard cookie cutter public ""higher education""."
College Junior,2,The facilities are decent. It's not a campus students live on so student life is not particularly important for the administration.
College Sophomore,2,"Set My School Apart – My school is really average, not a lot of things to set it apart from other schools."
College Freshman,2,I thinnk Volstate can grant a little more money than what they provide for their students.  I also think the prices for the tuition are a little too high for a community college...not considering that student have to pay for books and supplies as well.
College Junior,2,"Like many who choose to go to Vol State I am planning to transfer out and attend a university. I came here to recover my GPA after a serious illness caused me to be unable to attend my classes at my previous university and I failed my courses. While I had high hopes to recover my GPA and replace my transcript fails I quickly found that not only did Vol State have very few classes to choose from, but from their rotating class options I was unable to make up one of my more basic classes British Literature. I also was dissatisfied by the lack of help they offer the students academically if they are struggling in a class. The only good thing about Vol State was that my professors were very engaging and I enjoyed their classes."
College Freshman,2,It is a good place to start if you aren't sure what career or school you want to pursue.
College Junior,2,My Past School – I am only going back to this school because they now have a vet tech program I am interested in.  I need a scholarship because my GPA was not high enough to get finacial aid.
College Sophomore,1,My school does not have any of these networks that I am aware of.
College Sophomore,1,"As much as I respect some of the instructors and other faculty for their hard work and dedication, I must say this school has a few issues. For one, I made a complaint about a staff member and rather than deal with the problem his higher up breached my privacy and shared information about the complaint with an univolved friend and aquaintance outside the school. Over the same issue I made a visit to the office to another staff member, only to overhear her snickering outside the office about it with her secretary. Also, some of the staff at Vol State do not correspond in a timely fashion, so it's best to keep a written log of all communication or email the person you are trying to reach. Like I said, there are a lot of dedicated, caring and helpful faculty in the school, and I applaud them. However, a little professional courtesy goes a long way. A few bad apples can spoil the whole bunch. All in all, I have mixed feelings about my Vol State experience, thus far."
College Sophomore,1,"My Time and Energy Wasted AGAIN – This financial aid office seems determined to keep people from getting financial aid and will inflate amounts to make sure that you don't qualify for grants that you are eligible for; If I'm going to have to get into debt with loans, it will be at a school that has it's act together, not some 2nd rate school with a not so good reputation!"
College Sophomore,1,"The Usual 2Nd Rate – The financial aid dept. doesn't seem to want to help with anything where grants are concerned; they went in and made changes to my fafsa that resulted in my not getting a grant that I qualified for; whether this was on purpose or not has yet to be determined, but with this bunch, it wouldn't surprise me any.  As well as this, they cannot own up to making a mistake (tried to say I was the one who made the mistake), and, if I'm going to have to get into debt by taking out loans, I would much rather go to a college that I actually WANT to go to!  I'm more than fed up with having my time wasted by grown up children"
College Junior,1,"I HATE ONLINE MATH!!! I have taken 3 math classes at volstate now and in every class you do all of your homework, quizes, and even tests online. I absolutely hate it!"
College Junior,1,Cant Get Anything – It is not right that they can deny me getting finacial aid now because my GPA there 10 years ago was not at a 2.0.....I really need to go back to school now and it is not right I am going to have to pay for it.  I am not working now and it is going to be hard on me.

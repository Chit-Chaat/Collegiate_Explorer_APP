Freshman,5,"I have only been at Cornell for a couple of months now, but I love Cornell! The block plan allows for an intensive and in-depth education on each subject. The professors are amazing and are so willing to help students all of the time. The resources at Cornell are very helpful and easy to obtain. Cornell is a freeing place and allows people to be themselves with no judgement. Cornell is a judgement free zone and accepts everyone for who they are. Cornell has allowed me to meet some amazing people and friends, make important life-long connections, and set me up for a successful future. I'm making the most of my Cornell experience, and I'm very happy that I chose to attend Cornell over my other choices. I'm excited to continue my education at Cornell, and I can't wait to see what the next four years have in store for me!"
Freshman,5,"Wow! The professors really know how to teach online! Prof. Semieshirt sure knows his ways around zoom, haha!"
Sophomore,5,"I have taken 2 online classes so far at Cornell. In both cases, the professors used a combination of online lectures, discussions, and course work that were fairly comparable to in-person classes."
Sophomore,5,"Cornell is notable for its block plan, in which you only take one class at a time for 18 days. This method offer the ability to really delve into a given topic, and not be trying to learn 4 different classes at a time."
Alum,5,"Cornell College was a wonderful place to earn an undergraduate degree. My professors, advisors, and coaches were all extremely supportive and encouraging, and I felt that I established strong and lasting relationships with them. I made friendships for life at Cornell and created so many significant memories. The environment was conducive to learning but also filled with a variety of academic and non-academic opportunities, ranging from sports to Greek life to literary groups."
Niche User,5,I haven't taken any course yet but I want to pursue this master degree in Epidemiology in order to fight and prevent future outbreaks.
Freshman,5,I love having a block plan. The teachers are nice and we’re a very close knit community. I love being a member of Chess and Games and they have plenty of vegetarian options in the cafeteria!
Niche User,5,"It has a beautiful campus and it is very safe. The people are very nice and the food is very good. I don't attend, but it is a great school."
Freshman,5,"Cornell college is full of diversity. You get to meet people from all aspects of life. The college does the Block plan which is one class at a time for 18 days. It helps to be able to focus on one class and excel in it. You get very close to your professors also.  Cornell offers lots to do for college life outside of class. You have sororities, fraternities, Athletics and clubs/organizations.  Cornell is a close family orientated college. I made a great decision in choosing Cornell."
Niche User,5,They are very friendly the admissions councilors are very helpful and the campus is nice and small. They people there are very friendly and welcoming. The small class sizes are good to have 1 on 1 with your teachers
Niche User,5,So far my experience on cornell has been astounding with the amount of helpfullness and care I've experienced in joining the college.
Niche User,5,"On my college visit day I did not contact the coach before hand. While I was on campus the coach found me as he seen my name on the list to visit. We ended up having lunch and a great talk.
The students were great and LOVE the small community campus. Very friendly staff"
Niche User,5,I took a visit there and it was extremely nice. Very nice dorms with up-to-date athletic facilities.
Senior,5,Cornell College is a great school for small classrooms. It's about 15:1 student:teacher. Coaches are supportive. Looks like an Ivy League School.
Sophomore,5,"Cornell College is my second home. Thanks to the friendly teachers, staff and peers, I find myself much more confident and sociable. The campus scene is beautiful all year round. I am the only Vietnamese kid on campus, so sometimes I can feel small and lonely, but no, in Cornell College, I have sources to reach whenever I need. If you are bored after a long day of classes, the best thing to do is to sit on the grass and relax. Cornell College campus scene is beautiful all year round, spring, summer, fall, winter, I never get sick of it. 
The food is diverse, much much better than it used to be around 4-5 years ago. Now everyone can enjoy new variety of food everyday, including Asian, Latin, European food. 
My friends on campus are friendly with LGBT, black and international, so the atmosphere makes everybody feel comfortable. I am very glad that Cornell chose me. My special 4 years <3"
Graduate Student,5,it’s the school of my dreams! My favorite place to be! I love ❤️ Cornell!!!!! I know it will be the best place for you! Especially if you are magoring in Science!
Freshman,5,"CornellCollege has a unique block schedule, one class at a time.  We attend class for 3 1/2 weeks, then break 4 1/2 days, then next block.  We have an amazing 4 year graduate rate and higher than average acceptance into the Med and Vet schools.  Our small school is fun, energetic and a great place to learn."
Freshman,5,I love the environment and faculty here. I appreciate the acceptance and the push of others to help them succeed. I don't have anything negative to say about the school because I am an incoming student who has not experienced the school as much as I would like. I appreciate the welcoming attitude of my peers.
Junior,5,"From my very first block at Cornell, every class pushed my mind and expanded my reality by forcing me to step outside of my own vision of the world. I have spent three years discovering not just how beliefs arise within individuals and cultures, but why they are created and how that relates to the society at large. By encouraging students to look beyond their own world, Cornell provides us with a safe place to experience the unknown, welcome that knowledge into our lives and then share it with those around us. Cornell has always understood my unconventional background and encouraged my drive to help others. My professors never doubted my desire to apply my studies to outside fields, and supported my goal of working abroad with HIV/AIDS projects."
Freshman,5,Cornell is a small family school. You get close with your peers and I just love how small the town and school is.
Senior,5,I love it! The small community and the willingness of the the faculty. I think ensuring a good campus climate and giving more financial aid can help.
College Junior,5,"Greek life is very important and there is a noticeable divide between greeks and non-greeks. Because we aren't nationally affiliated, the groups feel very unique to Cornell."
College Junior,5,"The students and professors here truly make the entire experience. If I were reviewing based solely on the administration I would say not to go here, but because students run so many aspects of the school- it feels like home and as if there is a true sense of community throughout campus."
College Freshman,5,"They have many different classes on all different subjects and with the one course at a time, it really enables students to dig down and really grasp what they're learning."
College Sophomore,5,"I come from an area in Michigan that fits the stereotypical upper-middle class of predominantly white outlook. Everybody here wears designer outfits and drives nice cars and quite frankly are pretentious snobs. As soon as I arrived at Cornell for my visit during my senior year of high school, I immediately knew that I didn't have to pretend to be that kind of person anymore. I could be exactly who I wanted to be and everyone has been fantastic for me so far. Not to mention the One Course At A Time is amazing. Admittedly, difficult to adjust to but once I got the hang of it I never want to switch back to a traditional schedule. Being an athlete out there as well provides an even better and more in-depth experience. I get to see and interact with some parts of the school that those who aren't athletes aren't able to. I can't wait to go back!"
College Sophomore,5,"Becoming a part of a sorority was one of the best choices I made this year. We throw a lot of parties, however most of them are invite only, because sororities are not allowed to have houses on/off campus, meanwhile frats can :( However you don't have to be a part of a greek group to party, there are plenty of open parties held by frats."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I loved my time a Cornell. It was exactly what i needed in a college, where i could have fun but still focus without being overwhelmed."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Block Breaks are awesome, its a great time to just hang out with your friends without any obligations.

Freshman dorms really let you meet people because everybody needs to live in them. Everybody was friendly and ready to meet new friends.

Classes are challenging but professors help you through them and care about you."
College Freshman,5,The careet tours are especially helpful; I feel prepared here.
College Freshman,5,I love my professors! They are so kind and caring.
College Freshman,5,This school has a very welcoming environment and easy access to help. It feels like a home away from home. The one course at a time makes stress easy to manage and getting involved easy.
College Freshman,5,One course at a time really allows you fully immerse yourself in the class. It also really gives you the time to pick up some extracurricular activities. The people you meet are also very life changing.
College Freshman,5,"One Course At A Time, Block Program, Study Abroad"
College Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at Cornell College so far has been the best experience of my life.  Although it was one of the hardest transitions, moving away from friends it family, it helped me grow up and get out of my comfort zone that I was in during high school.  What I love most about Cornell is that even though there are only about 1,100 students on campus, I can meet someone new everyday.  What also makes my school unique is our block program.  Not many people have heard of the block program because Cornell is one of two colleges that do it throughout the country.  The block program, also known as one course at a time, is one of the main reasons I chose to attend Cornell.  We are only in one class at a time, for 18 days Monday through Friday.  After those 18 days are up we get 5 days off and start a new block that next Monday.  If I could do it all over again, I would choose Cornell College over any other college in the world."
College Sophomore,5,The school has a great sense of community and the town loves Cornell.
College Junior,5,"I have had the best experience at ,y school so far because of the overall atmosphere. Everyone is so nice including the professors, they truly want to help all of their students and because we have the one course at a time program it is easy for them to assist everyone who needs help.  Only taking one course at a time is sometimes harder because the work load can get heavy but it also helps because I only have to focus on the one class. Also being a student athlete, I only have to focus on making up work for the one class when we travel. If I could do it all again I would definitely choose my school again, it was the greatest decision of my life to attend Cornell College."
Recent Alumnus,5,I absolutely loved Cornell and would go back in a heart beat. College is what you make it. Be open minded! Try a sport or an organization. My very best friends are those that I met at Cornell!!
College Junior,5,Safe but still very fun
College Junior,5,They give great financial aid.
College Senior,5,Professors are amazing and so are the courses they teach. I don;t think I could have been happier with my education. Cornell really helps you to see the interdisciplinary connections.
College Senior,5,"They gave me an amazing financial aid package due to my inability to cover the costs. Each year, tuition is increased by about 2%, but my need-based aid still covered the hike."
College Freshman,5,"It's really good in my opinion, and yes with everything it can get a little tiring, but compared to some place it is good."
College Freshman,5,The school was really good about finding a way for me to be able to attend this school. Pretty much everyone I know here has some scholarship from the school.
College Freshman,5,"I always feel safe on campus, even late at night walking around alone. I know that if I go out, there will always be someone there who can help me out if I don't feel safe. If someone crosses the line in what they say or do, most students have no issues with letting them know that it's not acceptable."
College Senior,5,"As an active member of the greek community on my campus, and having seen other greek groups at larger state schools, the greek community here is wonderful. It's such a small campus it's impossible for real rivalries to exist and everyone is friendly with each other. The groups are also smaller (the largest of which being only about 60 or so people) so that means better environment to develop and maintain lasting friendships AND a better chance of becoming close with your alumni. Greek life here is great!"
College Senior,5,"The Block plan is great! It prepares me to absorb a great amount of information in a short amount of time to create reports, essays, and presentations of high quality."
College Sophomore,5,"Cornell offers a unique One-Course-At-A-Time schedule that allows students to go in-depth in their class for the 3-and-a-half week period and pairing this with classes in your major makes for the ultimate learning experience. It leaves little time to forget any information and connections are made throughout the course through discussions and projects with lecture class periods being very rare. 

As an education major, the OCAAT schedule also gives me an advantage being able to student teach without being any conflict with other classes, go into classrooms for observation for an entire day, and go on field trips. Due to the condensed schedule, workload can become heavy, but professors are extremely easy to contact and encourage feedback on assignments to make sure your academic success can be realistically maintained. 

Cornell has a very old campus that is listed on the National Historic Registry so the faces of the buildings cannot be remodeled, but the insides of the buildings are nice and have excellent wireless internet, audio, video, and projection capabilities. It makes for a very beautiful yet academically up-to-date campus.

There are countless internship and job opportunities for Cornell students during the school year as well as summer, and of course after graduation. There are work study jobs available in Admissions, at the Sports Center, in Dining Services, and countless others. There are even non-work study positions available on campus as well as off-campus at restaurants, bars, nursing homes, and babysitting. There are internships that can be applied for with help from the college and talking to a professor or an adviser will help you tremendously to find options that will fit your specific interests."
College Senior,5,"The science and language programs are intensely structured, but most others aren't at all."
College Senior,5,"One Course At A Time truly changes your life for the better. One of the school slogans that really holds up is ""I can do anything in 18 days."""
College Senior,5,The academic experience here has been the greatest gift I could ever have given myself.
College Senior,5,"If the One Course At A Time system works for you, it works like a dream come true."
College Freshman,5,"The Greek community here is very prominent, and the different sororities and fraternities definitely stick together more. They aren't, however, purposefully rude to none members, and they're very accepting of everyone."
College Freshman,5,"We have a lot of students from all over the world going here, and for the most part they and their cultures are accepted without argument. However there have been insistence's of derogatory drawings showing up in some of the bathrooms, but the dean was quick to send out emails about it."
College Sophomore,5,"greek life here is different than most schools, but it is still extremely enjoyable. socially very active with many opportunities to be involved in the community"
College Sophomore,5,Amazing professors who love to teach.
College Sophomore,5,I love it here. You just gotta deal with the cold
College Sophomore,5,"I'm in the psychology program and I love it. All the professors are super accessible and friendly, and the classes are rigorous and interesting. Most of them do research that students can help with. Most of the majors have a lot of opportunities for research if applicable. "
College Sophomore,5,"We have a nationally ranked education program and have plenty of opportunities early on to observe and partake in local elementary school classrooms. The program does quite a bit to ensure we are competitive when entering the work force and are currently working on adding a reading endorsement. In addition, there are options to complete your student teaching in chicago or abroad. "
College Sophomore,5,"Mount Vernon is just Cornell love. From the Silver Spider shop to Polly Ann's antique store, and the fantastic old middle school that houses a little of this and that, Mount Vernon is an amazing little town (this is coming from an East Coast, big city guy). There is so much character in all the little shops and stores all around the town, and the people are absolutely amazing. This is probably because most of the people around the school are or were affiliated with the school (yes I have run into the former President of the School, and several current professors). Its absolutely amazing, and the only place you could find anything like this is probably Hogsmead Village."
College Sophomore,5,"The biochemistry/molecular biology program at Cornell is taught by fantastic teachers and prepares you for the MCATs, as well as medical school. The facilities are not limiting, despite being a small school, and they offer many internship and job opportunities."
Freshman,4,"So, far some of my classes have been online for the 2020-2021 school year. My professor contracted Covid right before block 2 started, so all of block 2 was online (it was supposed to be hybrid). Professor handled the situation well, though, online learning is less than ideal. However, online learning allows for safety and precautions to ensure the health of everyone. Online learning is pretty easy to work and understand, and the learning platform, Moodle, is set up to increase learning. An online education is also very flexible and allows for students to have less stress related to class. Personally, I don't mind online learning, but, of course, in person learning is better. I am willing and happy to take classes online until the pandemic is under control to ensure everyone is safe and healthy."
Alum,4,"While Cornell does not offer any online degree programs, their website was very easy to navigate and helpful throughout my college career."
Alum,4,"I loved my professors, and I felt that my classes were appropriately challenging.  the OCAAT system allowed me to take classes outside my major and to explore other interests.  It was a great experience."
Niche User,4,"I have arrive to Cornell at a school trip and for what I have saw so far, it is a very comfortable college tour experience. I was Surprised on how welcoming people had been, the scenery was beautiful, the unexpected library and snacks that the college had inspired me to want to know more about Cornell. The study sessions are very interesting, the majors one on one talk was very informative and the current college students have introduced their experience which I found was the beginning of Cornell being my top College chocie"
Sophomore,4,"I like the small atmosphere and the education system known as the One Course at a time. I believe this is one of the best education curriculum's I have been in, and it's a shame more schools are not using a similar type of education system. Also the college has a very friendly enviornment it really helps that it is such a small community as well. The professors are helpful, the programs are amazing and it's a liberal arts education that really tries to help you for the future."
Junior,4,The block plan is very different then high-school and other colleges. It helps by becoming fully immersed in the subject and there are more hands on ways of learning as well as more one on one with the teachers compared to a normal semester style college.
Sophomore,4,"I love Cornell college, I love how the teachers are. They want everyone else to succeed and people are always there to help. The atmosphere is great and the sports are very good. I love the coaching staff for volleyball and how the school is teaching me more than skills for my job, but skills for my life. I would like there to be better food in the cafe, air conditioning in all buildings, and to be allowed to live off campus after the first year."
Sophomore,4,"Overall a good school. Great professors but the small size leads to problems in opportunities. The one course at a time is very interesting and I find it quite enjoyable, but it is clearly not for every student. It can be hard to adjust to, and if you don't adjust quickly.. well, in the first month after having completed your first class, if you had a D or lower you will likely drop out (in the past 5 years, everyone with a D or lower in their first course has not completed their degree)."
Freshman,4,It is a great school full of potential. It was and is my first choice to study I;m vety happy on being here. It offers you a lot of opprtunities in a lot of fields. bl bl b bl b b b b b b b b b b b bb l  ll l l l ll l l l l l  l ll  ll l l  ll  ll l l l l l l l l ll l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l j j jj j j j j j jj j j j j jj j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j jj j j
Sophomore,4,"As a sophomore here, I have so far very much enjoyed my experience here.  I will admit, the block plan is not for everyone.  But if it works for you, I highly encourage at least taking a look here."
Junior,4,"Overall my experience has been good with Cornell.  My major is very challenging, and the block plan is both good and bad when it comes to hard courses.  Some of the professors are excellent, are willing to put in as much time as it takes to help you learn and pass, and a very few do not have that in them.  It is hard if you have them for a course you must take. I don't feel that you have much choice when choosing classes, that I would change.  Otherwise, I love the small town, I have made many friends and the school is beautiful.  Some of the dorms are updated, some are falling apart.  I hate that they charge you every nickel and dime for someone puking or overflowing a toilet.  It gets ridiculous."
Junior,4,"Cornell College is a small liberal arts school in the tiny town of Mt. Vernon, IA. It's small size helps provide a sense of family and community. The block program is a fantastic way to learn and immerse yourself in your studies. The only thing I would like to see improved is the residence life department. They can sometimes be described as a bit lackluster."
Alum,4,Cornell College is an excellent school for preparing yourself for graduate level work. The block plan is demanding and requires students to remain focused on their education goals. You will learn how to manage lots of information in a short amount of time. I am excited to see the expansion of the science building and would be happy to see the school expand its options and support systems for scientific majors.
Freshman,4,"Cornell College is a wonderful place, with very little in terms of distraction but still plenty of opportunities and things to do in Mt. Vernon."
Freshman,4,Cornell College is small school with a strong sense of community. Taking one class at a time along with the support of your fellow students makes learning and studying fun.
Sophomore,4,"The block system is great!  It does allow for a lot of focus on one class.  Be warned though, you can't procrastinate because of the fast pace."
College Junior,4,"I love Cornell and wouldn't want to go anywhere else. This doesn't mean I'm blind to its major flaws, but the good outweighs the bad."
College Junior,4,I don't know much about this since I haven't graduated yet but it seems like I'll get a job...?
College Junior,4,"It could be worse, it could be better. Air conditioning for upperclassmen would be nice."
College Freshman,4,"Their are lots of parties that go one, I don't think all of them have alcohol. I don't party, so I wouldn't have first hand experience with it."
College Freshman,4,They have many different things going on at night but I'm usually asleep.
College Sophomore,4,Love the small class sizes and the professors are really attentive to students. Most of the classes I have taken are really interesting and engaging. In Bio classes we get to go on a lot of field trips.
College Sophomore,4,The campus is pretty safe
College Freshman,4,"Of the teachers I met, they were great."
College Freshman,4,"From what I heard, it's better than most schools safety wise."
College Freshman,4,New kitchens in every dorm!
College Freshman,4,"When I went to visit, I was in complete awe."
College Freshman,4,"The overall experience as a freshman was amazing. You either hate the block plan, and transfer, or you love it. For me this plan works very well, because I like to concentrate on one subject at a time, and if you don't like the subject, you know that after 15 days of class you won't have to think about it anymore. Another plus of the block plan is that it could allow you to explore many majors and minors, as well as will make double/triple  majoring with a minor possible. The social life here is a little compact though - Cornell bubble. Everyone knows each other and there is not much option."
College Freshman,4,It is what we need to survive the block plan.
College Freshman,4,The academics here are very rigorous in some majors and they require a decent amount of work.
College Freshman,4,I've never felt threatened on this campus.
College Freshman,4,This is a very good school and therefore the career options are also top tier.
College Freshman,4,Professors are very nice and easy to approach. They help you when you need it and are almost always available when you need them.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Some people do drugs at Cornell, because they are fun. I never knew people that pressured others into joining. Its all up to you."
Recent Alumnus,4,I attained a career job 6 months out of college and I didn't even try very hard TBH.
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are a variety of options that you can choose from, from singles to apartment style (though the apartments can be hard to get). 

Living in the dorms could be a lot of fun because your friends could live right down the hall."
College Freshman,4,Campus Security itself is fantastic but the way the school handles sexual assult is horrific.
College Freshman,4,I have a fantastic RA.
College Freshman,4,It's great besides a slightly clicky student body.
College Freshman,4,There is a big seminar for all incoming freshmen to talk about consent and sexual assault so the safety is a big deal.
College Freshman,4,The professors really get to know you and the small class sizes make sure that you are not just another grade. The teaching is very personal and not just lecture but rather a give and take with the teachers and students.
College Freshman,4,The programs are designed to make sure everyone has an opportunity to explore career choices and what they want to do.
College Freshman,4,The greek life is very accepting and its not a big deal whether you join or don't
College Freshman,4,"The coaches are very willing to help every sport and the facilities are beautiful. Athletes are very welcoming and supporting of each other, but it is also not a huge deal if you are not in athletics."
College Freshman,4,"We all have to take an Alcohol Ed course before we attend. Also, we need to take a second part after being in school for a month. There is also a zero tolerance."
College Freshman,4,"My major is very popular at Cornell, and I do not feel lost at all. I also feel comfortable about finding an internship when the time is needed."
College Freshman,4,"I really like the one course at a time. In a way, it gives you less to worry about. Plus, after the 18 days, there is a block break.  So far, the course I have  taken are interesting and would love to take them again."
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of places to study and get help. Class are a little challenging due to having to learn a lot in 18 days.
College Freshman,4,"I have been to a couple pre-pledges, and I have met a lot of cool people. I am looking forward to pledging."
College Freshman,4,You will be busy from sun up to sun down
College Freshman,4,"small class size, great professors,"
College Freshman,4,The atmosphere is great and so are the people. The one course at a time is an awesome challenge.
College Junior,4,Wish they had more milk-allergy options
College Junior,4,"Freshman dorms used to be awful, but are redone"
College Freshman,4,"What has to be understood is that ""it's college food"", it all usually sucks. But, Bon Appetite does actually make good food, repetitive at times but decent. We have a lot of options and the cafeteria is beautiful, its just not like food from home. And if you are hispanic and want to eat from the Latian Station lower your standards it is not Abuela's cooking."
College Freshman,4,"At Cornell College everyone lives on campus. The freshman dorms where just redone this year so they are in excellent condition the upperclass man dorms are also pretty nice and have a lot of opportunities for suite style living. My personal favorite is Bowman Carter, the only ""Girls Only"" dorm on campus. The building is from the 1800s and is absolutely goergues. There are some downsides to Bowman, it is in slight disarray and won't be getting renovated until 2018 and there is no elevator and an incredible number of stairs. But, its perks far outweigh its downfalls. It is centrally located on campus and only a few yards away from the Commons (and food), the rooms are spacious, have hardwood floors, and sinks, and there are rarely disturbances (you can go out and party and come home and sleep, watch TV, or study in peace)."
College Senior,4,"For Environmental Studies/ Biology we have great off campus courses and some scholarship to help you pay for them. We have a field station up in the Boundary Waters, Minnesota and a few classes go up there every fall. We get off campus a lot into the field since we only have the one course so we get some great hands on research"
College Senior,4,"I feel like I am familiar with a lot of concepts and am eager to apply my knowledge, but unless you use your education and connections to get internships, you will most likely not gain the practical skills necessary for a job after graduation"
College Senior,4,"Everyone has their own look, and other than usually first years, everyone just does what they want. You're in college and dressing to the most recent fashion couldn't be cared less about."
College Senior,4,"When you get to know the staff and professors, they are wonderful. but there is always the exceptional few people that seem to always be having a bad day. Out of my four years on campus I can only say I had 3 bad experiences with professors (out of 33 classes) and can think of 4 staff members who were just b*tchy all the time. As for policy, so long as you stick to guidelines and aren't a s**t about things, you'll get along just fine. TALK TO STAFF AND FACULTY!"
College Junior,2,the sexual assault policies need serious work. campus safety does not deal with things well and has been incredibly detrimental to many of my friends.
College Freshman,2,This is a PWI (Predominately White Institution) There is definitely a culture shock for some people.
College Freshman,2,"Everything is great about our living conditions our floor gets along very well, but our RA takes his job way too seriously it's almost on the border of harassment."
College Freshman,2,"Sexual Assault accusations are rampant around campus. Whether they're true or not, it's scary because if it is true this famous is very dangerous, This Insitutions does not do enough to fight against and prevent sexual assault. The Health Center is very accessible, however the staff seems to not be qualified to actively diagnose a serious problem. If you have the common cold they can easily tell and they will give you OTC medication. From personal experience, they do not look close enough and will most of the time out you off and over exaggerating. I was diagnosed with a serious condition, but when I visited the health center the nurse wrote it off like it was nothing and would not write a referral to a doctor. They're not experienced enough to adequately make me feel safe with my health concerns."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life isn't that big on campus. The fraternities and sororities are not nationally recognized so if you have friends at other Insitutions, they won't know what feat or sorority you're in. Pledging is different than at other schools also, because pledging starts during second semester, but there are pre pledge events."
College Freshman,2,"It's a DIII school so athletics isn't that big a part of every students life. It's mostly like high school, those who are involved stay in that clique and then there are others that aren't. Athletic events generally don't have much attendance."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There's very little off-campus housing to go round, and it isn't worth the hassle of obtaining much less maintaining."
College Freshman,2,"There are 3 restaurants within walking distance not including the 3 bars and the coffee shop. The Palisades, a higher class family diner, The Lincoln Wine Bar which is a very fancy establishment and The Skillet which is primarily a breakfast place that closes around 3. There is nothing open in the town after 9 other then the bars. There is no pizza delivery other then Paul Revere in the next town over which has no posted hours online and is usually closed by 11 anyways. The only way to get to other food is to drive to it. Within five minutes (15 if walking) you have subway, dairy queen, hardees and a mexican place. If you want options, drive to Cedar Rapids or Iowa City."
College Freshman,2,"Quality? there really isn't quality, just gross dirty basements and drunk messes. Prevalence? The same people are at the same houses partying each weekend and on Wednesday nights, that's pretty much what you have to choose from. The best parties are probably the prepledges but there is a lot of social pressure happening there as well. Hook up culture is strong here and many people see their random partner walking around the tiny campus for the next four years."
College Junior,2,off campus housing is not allowed until senior year for most students. the only exceptions are those who live at home and commute and people with special living requirements (both cases have to be approved by the school and often times are not)
College Junior,2,"Receiving the initial aid when I was first accepted was not too troublesome. But in regards to outside scholarships and renewing them, it can an irksome process. The workers in the financial aid office can be rather unhelpful. If you try for additional aid from the school in a different form (work study, merit based), they can be very unaccommodating. In particular, finding an on-campus job that is open to people not eligible for work study is difficult. It's also a trying process for international students, as they are usually even more limited in their options. 

Some students try to earn extra money by finding jobs off campus, but it's only feasible if you have a car and it's not too far away, but jobs in town and surrounding area are not too common."
College Junior,2,"Campus safety is there when you call, but their presence is usually not overbearing. An encounter with them can be pleasant or unpleasant depending on which person you get when you call and/or which person they send to assist you. 

There have been several bias-related incidents on campus. There have also been many incidents of sexual assault/harassment on campus. Neither of these have been dealt with well by the administration or campus safety. If caught, the culprit usually receives a light punishment. For sexual assault, the most likely resource would be the feminist group on campus, Third Wave Resource Group, which provides a safe space for victims. But there aren't very many other safe spaces on campus, and the student body is not very sympathetic to victims either.

Most students feel safe walking around campus at night. However, even after incidents, there have not been very many steps taken to up the security. There are very few surveillance cameras on campus, and lamppost lights don't always work."
College Junior,2,"The only sport the general student populace really cares about is varsity football. But they're not - haven't been - that great - the team, that is. For years now. 

Only people who care about football/sports to begin with and the whole ""Friday night lights"" kind of thing follow the team. Which is a decent chunk of the student population. Administration is also fond of the football team. They recently re-turfed and added new lights to the (small) football stadium on campus. 

Athletic facilities are decent. The Small Sports Center is pretty old, but has an indoor track, basketball court and such other things that belong in a sports center. The renovation of the Commons included an exercise room, which many non-athlete students use. Much more accessible than the Sports Center due to its location."
College Senior,2,"I hear that the nurses are a joke and assume pregnancy for every female that walks into the door. Cornell has a great student organization called TWRG that addresses sexual assaults but I don't see the school take action for any reports. Over all, the student body doesn't think that sexual assaults on campus. Everytime the ""Clothesline Project"" is up, the school reacts with surprise."
College Junior,2,"Most non-athletes are pretty apathetic about sports here on campus. Some athletes, mainly football players, like to think they're a bigger deal than they are, but I've had professors make jokes about the teams. However, volleyball, women's, basketball, and softball are all great, and I'm pretty sure baseball had a fantastic season recently. Most athletes pretty much talk only to other athletes, but there are quite a few who are friendly."
College Junior,2,"Mount Vernon is a tiny town. There are a few places and most of them are somewhat pricey.The pizza places are nice, but are often closed before their posted closing times. There are a few fast food places, but they're further out of town, so anyone without access to a car is kinda screwed."
College Senior,2,"We live in a small town in Iowa, so the campus has no need for a shuttle. Taxis and public transit are usually out of Cedar Rapids, but honestly it's more convenient to just have a car or find someone who does."
College Sophomore,2,Snows a lot and windy and cold
College Sophomore,2,"There's really not a lot. I heard the mayor doesn't allow non-local businesses in town so aside from a DQ, Subway, Hardee's, and Casey's on the edge of town, there are just a couple restaurants and most have weird hours. Cedar Rapids, Iowa City, and Marion are all pretty close and they have a lot of options. As far as delivery, you either have Casey's or Paul Revere's Pizza, both of which are pretty good."
College Sophomore,2,Nearly everyone lives on campus and there's not much choice for off-campus and hard to do.
College Sophomore,2,"Cornell College does not have many off-campus housing options. It is a very small town so most of the housing options are on campus. However, Cornell has been buying as much property as possible so there is more campus housing, such as old houses and they just bought an apartment complex last year. However, since they are buying the properties it is still considered on campus housing.
"
College Sophomore,2,"There is no off campus housing. Not really. If you want to live in housing not affiliated with the school, you have to receive some special dispensation from the school (idk). The school does, however, own several off campus dormitories and housing opportunities: Tenth Avenue Apartments, Welch Apartments (opened in 2013) are sort of houses owned by the school that students live in. They're pretty great, and not on the hilltop. Then there is New Hall, which offers suite style housing for the Living Learning Communities that are created by students at Cornell. Finally, there is the Sleep Inn. Yes, Cornell College has an agreement with the Sleep Inn in Mount Vernon, where students can live on the top floor in hotel rooms, with access to a pool and all the other amenities that will keep your friends visiting."
College Senior,2,"Mt. Vernon, Iowa is smack dab in the middle of nowhere. There are things in town to do, but the town is literally one street long and it get really old really fast. The best thing to do is go to either Iowa City or Cedar Rapids where there are stores, malls, restaurants, etc. The best place to go in my opinion is the Lincoln Wine bar, where they have live music on Tuesdays and Thursdays, gourmet pizza, and gourmet wine."
College Senior,2,"Well the computer labs are nice when they are not crowded. The computer labs get crowded during the end of each block when we have finals and they usually start getting crowded during the middle of second week and stay crowded until the end of the block. If you have your own laptop, ethernet ports are available in the dorm rooms, and wifi is available all over campus although the connection usually has a hard time working and the wifi runs very slowly."
College Junior,2,The athletics at Cornell are not very good. Our teams are full of nice people but they don't win very much. Cornell students don't support the sports teams very much but everyone who does play on the teams seems to have a lot of fun.
College Sophomore,2,"Cornell College is located in the Midwest which means the weather can get cold and snowy, but also a little hot too at the very beginning and very end of the school year. Most of the dorms and classrooms stay warm all year round and since its a small campus its still easy to get to class in the cold. Just dress warm when its cold out and you should be fine."
College Junior,2,"Cold, Icy, Windy – I don't love cold weather. It is mostly cold and windy in Iowa. But the spring is gorgeous. I have left Cornell, but I sometimes miss the spring there. The campus was beautiful, and the weather was perfect. However for the 6 months it is winter it can get very depressing because there is nothing to do."
College Junior,2,"Not Much to Choose from – It is a very small school and small campus. Dating, and life in general is scarily ""highschool"". You will know everyone after 2 months, and the pickings are slim. There are probably a couple attractive people who mostly hang out together and are in committed relationships already."
College Sophomore,2,"The Off-Campus Housing at Cornell is very limited, and you're basically on your own if you would like to live off campus.  It's highly recommended that everyone try to live on campus, and since Mount Vernon is so small and limited in housing opportunities there isn't much of a point to live off campus in the first place."
College Sophomore,2,"It's incredibly hard being a vegan at Cornell College, Sodexo is pretty open about not wanting to cater to the vegan population. Cornell is also not racially diverse, which poses a problem with trying to find others of the same background- I still have not met another Native American on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Network Reliability and Speed – The network reliability and speed at Cornell College is very poor, the connection constantly drops, and it is generally always slow."
College Senior,2,"oh, occat. There is something fantastic about only doing one class at a time, but it speeds up life. It isn't that the course work is harder per say, but the pace will make everything seem like the end of the world. The students while insane are generally some of the nicest people you will ever meet. Just be aware that when they listed it in the top 100 schools that change lives, change is a neutral word."
College Sophomore,2,The weather is very unpredictable here. It can be hot one day and raining the next. Winters are very cold and brutal.
College Freshman,2,"The Famous OCAAT – Cornell only offers one course at a time, meaning you will take one course for 3.5 weeks followed by another 3.5 week course after that. The pre-med program is really good; most students score high on the MCAT's and get into a med school of their choice. The business major and psych major are really good here. Professors are REALLY invested in your education; they take it very seriously. Cornell is a small school in a small town, so campus life isn't that vibrant. You will probably find yourself to be bored most weekends. There is nothing to do in the town of Mt. Vernon, so you will have to drive to Iowa City or Cedar Rapids."
College Freshman,2,"Long Distance Trasportation – If you have a friend that has a car you can get the rides from that person if you want to go in the city. The school doesn not provide shuttles very often because they are booked. So if you have a friend with a car, use that person."
College Junior,2,"Nice and Bland – Cornell has several intercultural life programs that are worth commending.  However, on the whole, I find that Cornellians, while very, very nice people, are not particularly interested in helping people beyond their social circle that exists in other parts of the world.  (It's referred to as ""The Cornell Bubble."")  If you're looking for a thriving activism scene, go somewhere else."
College Junior,2,"Nothing to Do – EVERYTHING closes early. Every day. If you want to do anything after 5 or 6pm, you have to drive half an hour into Iowa City or Cedar Rapids."
College Freshman,2,Transportation at Cornell is nearly obsolete. There are a few programs which allow people to go out on the weekends to malls or amusement parks or movie theaters. The only way to travel when you want to is to bring a car on campus or have friends who have cars.
College Senior,2,"There is a reason why some of the students who attend Cornell refer to the college as CornHell. Yes, I'll admit Cornell has some great opportunities. I mean, going to the Bahamas in February?! Come on, it doesn't get much better than that. But there are many down sides to Cornell. One, the time commitments and work loads for class lead many students into making ""bad life choices."" Out of all the students I know at Cornell, over half take part in substance abuse. Many prefer alcohol, and it's not just on the weekends. It's not abnormal to find a group of students drinking on a Tuesday night. Alcohol isn't that big of a deal, because everyone does it at Cornell. But, I've found in the last year and a half there has been an increase in marijuana and harder drug use. SO many students smoke weed and no one even knows about it. It too is not that big of a deal, but most of the students I know who used to just be ""pot heads"" are starting to use harder drugs, like cocaine. I don't know why these people do this, if it's just to act cool, or because they actually have a problem, or if it's just something to DO (there's really not much to do in The Middle of Nowhere, Iowa.) The time commitments and deadlines for one class at a time ARE tough, but the OCAAT isn't for everyone. I guess each student just finds their own way to deal with it...whether it be good or bad. 
My friends have a saying about CornHell: ""Cornell does offer many extraordinary opportunities...Opportunities in addictions!"" Many students I know turn to substances to deal with everything. But, there are also many students who stay away from that scene, and make it out perfectly fine!"
College Junior,2,Cornell College does not allow students to live off campus unless they have very persuasive reasoning.
College Sophomore,2,"Few and Far Between – Very few seniors are allowed off campus. We are approximately 98% residential. There is actually a lottery to get the few off campus spots offered. However, in a town as small as Mount Vernon, there are not many places for people who wish to live off campus to go. If you have a house, or are married, you are allowed off of course, but otherwise, most students remain on campus where there are a variety of different housing options. I think the college would be willing to help with finding an apartment or other option, but most students chose not to go this route. The apartments in town would be convenient, as they are about two blocks off campus. The rent is variable, depending on the owner, and most apartments are located above the shops on main street."
College Senior,2,Currently the student support for athletics is very poor.  Generally it is only other student athletes coming out to support their fellow athletes.  The athletic facilities are due for an upgrade is several areas.
College Junior,2,"There Are Good Days and Really Bad Days – It really depends. The things that remain consistant no matter what is we always have a salad bar, a vegetarian section, a cook-it-made-to-order (called exhibition), vegetarian and regular chili, and a bagel/cereal section. The quality, however, really varies. 
Most days there's always something to find that will satisfy me, but I'm not your average chicken-nugget lover - I gravitate toward more of the healthy things that are offered on a regular basis. 
Their meat is often suspicious looking, so things like meatloaf or fried pork patties really gross me out, but I guess some people like them. 
I dunno, a lot of people complain about Sodexo, but I think it's decent."
College Junior,2,"The Cornell College campus is on the historic registrar. This means that all of the buildings are rounding 200 years old. On the outside they're charming and gorgeous, perfect for hanging out outside in the amphitheater listening to cute boys play guitar or for long walks in the fall when the leaves are all changing. That being said, it's not so fun to live inside them. These are really old buildings, not hotels. You get used to it, but you quickly realize it's no palace. The Commons and library are quite nice though, with workout rooms and plush reading areas. It's mostly only athletes that use the sports center, but if you happen to be an athlete it's really very decent overall."
College Junior,2,"We Don't Really Care – * No one goes to football games. Not even the homecoming game.
* Some support basketball and wrestling
... our teams aren't very good, and no one really cares all that much one way or the other"
College Junior,2,"* The school doesn't allow many kids to live off campus
* There aren't too many places to choose from for rent
* People who live off campus tend to be isolated from the college experience a little"
College Junior,2,"Campus transportation is very limited on campus, which actually isn't too big of a deal since Cornell is pretty much a residential campus.  Student Senate does sometimes offer shuttles down to the Iowa City area for students to escape small-townness, which is positive, but I feel not as frequent as it could be.  If you do not have your own vehicle, you pretty much have to walk everywhere in Mount Vernon, which can pose challenging in the winter months."
College Sophomore,2,"While there has previously nothing beyond having your own car or friends with a car to get out of town, there is now a shuttle that sometimes goes into the city for a day over breaks. It's free! It's also new, so should be getting even better."
College Sophomore,2,"While Cornell wants to be diverse, the majority of ethnic diversity comes from foreign exchange students, which is fine, but we just don't attract a wide array of non-whites nationally.
Religious groups and services are available, as well as our Chaplain, who is awesome. There is not a lot of obvious vocal practice, but there are places to worship for major religions.
Sexuality doesn't seem to be a very important to most people. I would not say we have a real gay community, but there is a support system, if not very obvious.
Political beliefs are mostly liberal Democrats, though we do have Republicans, and there isn't any obvious conflict."
College Senior,2,"Poor Buildings in a Landscape of Beauty – Most of the facilities at Cornell are very outdated.  Some of this may be that the entire campus is on the National Registry of Historic Places, BUT this does not mean that the insides need to be old too.  Also the living spaces are small, cold, and extremely outdated.  When renovations are made they are made the cheapest way possible and that shows when paint peels only a couple days after a semester renovation is finished and heaters do not work properly after a whole new residence hall is built and then nothing is done to accommodate or fix it."
College Senior,2,"We Play Because We Love to Play, Not to Win. The athletic program is okay at best. There are a few teams who succeed in their sports, however the football team is the joke of the campus. Unfortunately, they receive more funding than the majority of other teams on campus combined. There is no longer a swimming and diving team on campus, the pool was cracked and being used for storage for the longest time, until it was filled in and turned into the wrestling room. The athletes you find on the court are usually the individuals who chose an education over athletics, they were good in high school, and even pretty good on the college level. But the fact is, they came to college for a degree, not for athletics."
College Freshman,2,"Way Below Expectations – I came to Cornell for numerous reasons, however, none of these reasons have even come close to being reached or carried out by this school. My first reason for choosing Cornell: Every single tour guide informed me how EVERY professor was willing to do what they could to try and help you out. I do not know if it has just been poor luck on my part by not getting those highly touted professors, but I have not had a single professor go out of their way to help me outside of class with my questions. I am treated as though I am wasting the professor's time and am rushed out of the room. 
My second reason was the affordability. At first glance the 37 some thousand of tuition here may have seemed intimidating, but initially I received a fantastic financial aid package. However, after my first semester here I received a notice that the grants and other aid (not including the scholarships I earned) had been cut and therefore lowered. This forces me to have to make up for an additional $5,000 to account for that were never even in the picture. 
My third reason: the ""block plan"" or One Course At A Time, was famed to help you focus and be able to learn more easily. However, in practice, the workload expected by every student is on a thin line of unreachable levels. I have never met so many students that are depressed and as anti-school as the students at Cornell College."
College Senior,2,"There are three main restuarants: Subway, Hardees, and a local Mexican restaurant. Hardees has a student discount which is nice. I wish there were more mainstream businesses in town. The bars and cafe's in the historical strip also serve food."
College Sophomore,2,"Off-Campus Opens up, but Availability Is Down – If you live off-campus at Cornell you must have fought for the apartment you have, or the house you're sharing, because a lot aren't available. Good luck with rent or conditions because many landlords around here don't care about their renters."
College Freshman,2,"Students complain about the dining – The absolute number one thing Cornell students complain about is the dining. Personally, I don't mind it. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that I like it, but I've heard enough people grumble otherwise to comment. Meal plans are pretty inflexible, and the menu repeats every month I think. Quality/variety can be an issue. But they really try. Workers are nice."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not that many parking spots that are next to your dorm. If you're lucky you might get one, but most of the time you have to walk a good ways (from a small town point of view by the way) to get to your room. It's pretty expensive too. You don't need a car that bad, but if you can't find a ride to Walmart or something (30 min. drive) you're screwed."
College Junior,2,"It's Cold and You Always Have Class. It seems as though Cornell never shuts down, some students have never had a snow day, depending on the professor. It is freezing in Iowa in the winter, expect snow and ice storms, and to have to walk in them. Luckily it's a small campus."
College Junior,2,"Sports Aren't the Greatest. Cornell isn't really known for its great teams, except for maybe wrestling. And IMs have fallen apart since the director position was cut."
College Senior,2,"Wireless Access is difficult. Three labs on campus, all with early 2000's machines. Some offices have older computers."
College Senior,2,"Small Selection – Hardees, Subway, Local Mexican, Lincoln Cafe, Scorz."
Niche User,1,"Care for students needs much improvement. I was in a car accident late 2016 and was disenrolled to avoid unnecessary tuition fees while hospitalized. When I returned to the college hoping to reinstate my enrollment I was told I would not be able to until my balance was covered in full. I had a broken back, hip, pelvis, hand and two torn rotator cuffs, I asked the school to help me with any school funds to cover anything on my balance, they refused. The school did not let me stay in my dorm despite the fact that all of my belongings were there. I had to sneak into my friends dorm and eventually convince a student RA to allow me entry to my room until my flight a week later. I had no money and no meal pass so I struggled and went hungry. I had no way of sending my clothes home due to my finances & had to leave my belongings with a local church pastor for several months until I was able to have him sent to me."
College Freshman,1,Almost everyone is liberal and sides with the minority.  The intolerance occurs if you are not liberal and you do not always take the minorities side.
College Freshman,1,"The education is subpar at best. The professors barely teach, it's mostly self learning from readings. One Course at a Time is more stressful than it is a relief. The amount of homework a night exceeds what a normal institution will have. Once you hit 300 level classes, you will have 4-7 hours a night. The location is terrible because of campus activities aren't a thing. It is very humid when it's warm and also very dry in the winter. There are a variety of different students on campus, diversity is the only plus to this institution. I highly recommend you stay clear of this college."
College Freshman,1,"One Course at a time is one of the biggest factors for my dissatisfaction for this institution. At first, before coming I thought it would be great to really focus on one class and the work load wouldn't be as heavy. I was completely wrong, I talk to others at different institutions and I have more work than anyone does. Homework for 300 level classes take anywhere from 4-7 hours. 100 & 200 level classes will take you 1-3 depending on the professor. The professors do not actually teach, they expect you to read the night before and then class discussion is your teaching. 

The location is the second reason to not come. It is a small town, with unfriendly town people. There is nothing but a couple of bars and some little shops. Mostly everything you will do is on campus, and that is still little. If you do not like the winter, do not come here. 

Overall, this institution isn't valuable. You do not get your money's worth. You get a subpar education, terrible location, and the Internet is the worst I've ever experienced. This institution is ridiculously expensive for what they provide. I highly recommend that no one should attend."
College Sophomore,1,"There are few places to dine off-campus in Mount Vernon. If you are willing to make the drive to Cedar Rapids or Iowa City, decent restaurants can be found, but for students who do not have a car, dining off-campus is fairly out of the question. A few local restaurants on main street offer some variability, but are not typical hot-spots for the college community."
College Sophomore,1,there is no provided transportation on campus mostly because the campus is so small
College Senior,1,"The financial aid is really bad here. If you want your aid to look about the same, then every year, you need to win an outside scholarship of about $3,000. The tuition goes up about $2500 every year, and they usually increase the student activity fees and meal plan fees. What sucks is that they don't give you more financial aid to make up for the increase in tuition, so you end up paying more and more every year."
College Senior,1,"The only facilities that are upkept are the Commons and the Sports Center, the residence halls are, for the most part, terrible, and the college charges ridiculous fees at the end of every year for supposed ""damages"" that are almost always present before the student is placed in the room. Make sure if you go here to write down a very detailed description of the poor state of the room (trust me, there will be something wrong with it) so they don't try to make you pay for it later. As a prospective student they will try to make you think everything's wonderful, and tour guides are not even allowed to show prospective students one particular dorm in which the black mold problem was ""solved"" by painting over it (the paint faded, revealing black mold still present underneath within about a week)"
College Senior,1,"There is very little parking and almost none near classes. The student parking is commandeered at the administration's whim for irrelevant events. The parking pass is not worth what we pay for it. There are not enough parking spaces to accommodate nearly the number of students who have cars. Students who do not get parking passes can park in more places, especially if you have a friend off campus. The visitor parking is deceptively nice, students are much worse off. Tickets are given out often by campus security, but rarely to first-years, as though they are trying to make it seem like it doesn't suck. In fact, everything is like that the first year."
College Sophomore,1,"The majority of students on campus are white, Christian people from the midwest. There are a few people from different ethnicities, religions and the like, but there is still a very big gap between them and the majority. Diversity is more an abstract idea here, not a reality."
College Junior,1,At Cornell they have a no tolerance policy. This means that if you are caught with drugs on campus you are kicked out immediately. The firstyear dorms are substance free buildings so no one can have any alcohol or drugs on them even if they are 21 or older. There is no good samaritan policy so if anything goes wrong at a party everyone gets in trouble if someone gets help. In the upper classman buildings you can not leave your room with a open container. If you miss enough classes the college will send your parents that you are missing class. If you drop below a 2.0 you are put on academic probation.
College Junior,1,This gets such a low review because there are deffinately not a lot of good places to park that are near dorms. The campus safety are real sticklers on giving out tickets and will even give student vehicles tickets if they park at the PUBLIC library paking lot when they are at the library. During big events on campus all of the visiting people take up all the empty spots and student can never find parking spots and the lots are in complete disorder and are hard to manuver in. Permit costs are relatively cheap and first years can have a car on campus as well. A car is not necessary but is nice to have because the town is small enough and classes are close and you might have a friend that has a car you can borrow.
College Freshman,1,I didn't get enough aid. I had to apply for a private loan
College Sophomore,1,"I've heard bad things about it, not a lot of people are granted off-campus housing."
College Freshman,1,There are no Greek houses; the members live in the resident halls with everyone else. The Greek students are seen as somewhat annoying to the rest of the student body. Parties aren't big.
College Freshman,1,Nothing to Eat in Mt. Vernon – The cafes are over-priced. There is only a Subway and Hardy's (neither conveniently located) and the local pizza place is mediocre.
College Freshman,1,Area Attractions – Their are none at this school. If you are a big city person such as myself it is going to be hard to adapt here. Everything is within miles in this school so.. you better have a car in order to findd a decent store.
College Junior,1,Clique Groups Ruin Community – I used to be a part of Greek Group but quickly realized it was not for me. I believe they hinder rather than help the community at Cornell College. They do throw fun parties but this is greatly out weighed by the negative rivalries between groups and pretension exhibited by groups.
College Sophomore,1,"In Need of Shuttles – If you don't have a car and need pretty much any personal items, you are stuck begging for a ride."
College Freshman,1,"There's Not Enough Work-Study to Go Around – They offered too many people work-study to make up about $1,500 of their tuition, and as a result, you might only work for 3 hours a month at minimum wage. It's impossible to reach the amount you are intended to receive. I had to get several other jobs outside the school to keep up with the cost. Otherwise, they're good about giving you big scholarships that you didn't ask for and they really do try to make it affordable. Trying isn't always enough though, so be sure to get on your great-great-aunt's good side and be included in her will."
College Junior,1,"Nowhere Close to Go – Awful. There are only a couple of close restaurants, with everything else at least a 20 minute drive away."
College Sophomore,1,"Residential Campus – Cornell is a residential campus, so most students live on campus. There is such a small window for those allowed off, it's easy to just say there isn't anything."
College Sophomore,1,"Need for a car on campus is average, like you can survive without one but its nice to have one because Cornell is located in the middle of no where and its nice to escape every now and then and everything is 10 miles +.  Permit costs are good, ticketing and fines are stupid, availability to park close to where you live isn't that convenient especially in the winter time, when they don't plow the parking lots and you can break your face walking to your car!"
College Sophomore,1,"Parties:
Sorority and Frat 
Some parties at athletic houses (e.g. soccer house, basketball, etc)

Afterward, all go to the bars in town - very limited.
Everyone mostly parties, with similar people, of age and under.

Transportation is not a problem - we're a small campus and in bumbleville."
College Senior,1,There is no transportation unless you provide it yourself.
College Senior,1,"The only nightlife that exists at Cornell are the parties that exist in students' rooms. Pretty boring but a lot of alcohol! Every once in a while you can find a good party where there is actually dancing happening. There are a few local bars in town, but nothing to special. If you want to go to real bar or a club you have to drive at least 40 minutes."
College Freshman,1,"The only reason I don't transfer away from this school is because of sports (I play football and run track) and for the quality of a degree from this place. I want to get into pharmacy school and I feel this place is what will best prepare me. However, with that being said, there is nothing else to even partially enjoy about this place. No campus social life, no events ever go on, no fun. Everyone is so busy trying to cram all the 6 hours of expected homework into 4 hours of available time. Cornell is the definition of stress!!"
College Senior,1,"Security is incapable – I believe security is incapable of protecting me from any threat. They are obese, lazy, uneducated, unarmed, and incompetent. The sidewalks and parking lots are dangerous and are not shoveled frequently. Safety has cameras but still rarely catch car break ins."
College Junior,1,"You Need a Car, but There's Nowhere to Park It – There are very few decent parking spots, and not much discrimination about who can park where. I feel like after 3 years of having a car on campus, I should have priority over freshman as far as where I can park. Even with the little bit of separation as far as who can park where, there aren't enough spaces available, and you often have to walk a very long way to get anywhere. Unfortunately, having a car is also pretty essential on campus since it's so far away from everything."
College Junior,1,"No Variety, No Taste, No Excitement – Our dining options stink. None of the food is ever good in the cafeteria, and it's usually crowded because it's our only option other than the Ratt, which is highly overpriced. The only time we get good food is on preview days or alumni events. Salad stuff sits out all day, as do things like butter and cream cheese. There are only a small selection of times when you can eat."
College Sophomore,1,"Only for Seniors – If you're a senior, you can apply for a lottery for the ""privilege"" of living off campus. Cornell is a residential campus, so you have to be lucky or married if you want to live off campus."
College Sophomore,1,"The get out of town program is great, but it is not regular enough."
College Freshman,1,"Off campus housing isn't an option until senior year, or if there are special circumstances. When one is a senior, one has to enter into a lottery, in which one may have a slight chance of gaining off campus housing."
College Junior,1,"What Dining Options? As a school that is something like 90% residential, you have to eat here. Your options are limited to two places: the cafeteria and the Rathskellar - which is owned by the cafeteria. Want food after midnight during a late-night study session? Hope you have groceries, or friends who don't mind driving to Taco Bell at 2 a.m. (I do have these friends, thank goodness). It wouldn't be so bad if the food here wasn't so bad, but it is - they have the exact same menu each month (everyone knows, first Monday of the month is pretzel night - gross...). Sadly, we pay about $4,000 for this crap."
College Sophomore,1,"No One Cares – Not only are the sports teams sub-par at Cornell, but no one really goes to watch the games. It's not a big deal on campus. We do have IMs, but they aren't huge either. It's actually kind of nice to go to a school where sports aren't the focus."
College Senior,1,6 to 9 months of SNOW – 6 of 9 months on campus have the chance of snow. It's almost always wet and cold. I want to move to the desert after undergraduate.
College Senior,1,Sodexo --  homemade ramen is the way to go – It's a catering service that primarily works for prisons and colleges. Many nights homemade Ramen is the way to go.
College Senior,1,"Just Awful – Cornell has a football team with one of the worst records in conference. Also, academics take a much larger role in student life than going to or participating in sports. Drinking and other on campus activities are more appealing for the majority of students.

IMs were good, but lack of Greek participation and the loss of the director of IMs due to budget cuts have reduced participation in IMs overall."
College Senior,1,The Campus Safety Officers Here Are Lazy and Don't Provide a Real Service. The campus safety sucks at Cornell. The only thing they do is drive around in their Gators and occasionally give a ticket. Rules are not enforced by them so there really isn't a point to buying a parking pass because they rarely check and it is overpriced for lots that don't even have cameras or patrolling officers. The only thing campus safety is good for on this campus is to bring you a light bulb when the one in your shower goes out.
College Sophomore,1,"The Scramble Is a Mess – I am not at all impressed with Cornell's dining. It is difficult to find something at all edible in the dining hall, it is messy, has little flavor, and not very healthy. Deserts are yummy though."

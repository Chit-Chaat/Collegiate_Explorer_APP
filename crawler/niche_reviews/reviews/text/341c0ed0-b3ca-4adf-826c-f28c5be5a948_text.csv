Niche User,5,"Even though I have not yet attended Carroll yet, my tour there was the best experience. Out of all of the colleges I toured, Carroll made sure that you are cared for. They treat you like family, are very kind, and don't try to rush through the tour. I felt like a V.I.P. through my tour as I was able to see all the things I wanted to see."
Sophomore,5,Carroll provides good technological support and materials. They have done an excellent job with online learning an adjusting with every student. they provide a whole unit of workers to help you accommodate to the best possibility.
Sophomore,5,"Carroll University provides excellent resources and continuous help for your college journey. If you ever need anything you just have to ask. Everyone is guaranteed success as long as you use your resources. Also very good usage of technology as well. you can even rent materials such as laptops, rooms, and exercise equipment as well."
Sophomore,5,"The professors here at Carroll have been doing an amazing job when it came down to online classes. Currently, the university is doing hybrid classes to make sure classrooms allow social distancing, but also allow students to have valued in-class time to improve their education. So far, I am enjoying how smoothly everything is going."
Sophomore,5,"I just recently moved all the way from Wyoming to Wisconsin to attend Carroll University. I was drawn in by their amazing marine biology program that they offer! When I made the transition to Carroll, I was welcomed like family and felt to safe and included. I was greeted by a wonderful amount of diversity and culture that I was not exposed to before my transition to Carroll University, which I have been enjoying so much. This University has been so uplifting to all of their students, and also making us feel safe in context of COVID-19 by taking extra steps to ensure our health. Although I am not far into the school year, I am already in love with everything this University has to offer."
Sophomore,5,Great school with a homey feel and professors that don't just treat you like a number! The small feel ensures each student gets individual help and the attention they deserve
Sophomore,5,All of my professors did everything they could to provide me with the amazing education that I was expecting as I applied as a freshman. The whole process was organized well
Junior,5,Excellent staff and a wonderful welcoming campus. Always new activities to keep students interested. Full of resources to help students achieve their best academically.
Senior,5,Love carroll great college to attend! So far experience has been better than the best! I don’t think anything needs to change when it comes to Carroll University!
Senior,5,I did not take any courses online. Half way through the semester all courses went online due to the virus and Carroll did a great job transitioning and attending to those in need!
Senior,5,"My three years at Carroll University have been nothing short of amazing. Not only is the food amazing, the dorms large, and the classes small, the overall community engagement is nothing like I’ve ever experienced before. Carroll staff and administration honestly care about students and their needs. There are countless services aiding to students, whether it be sports, academics, spiritual life, etc. my favorite part of Carroll University, however, is the direct admit DPT program. It has been the greatest challenge in my academic career, but the staff is adamant to see us succeed. Knowing as long as I keep the criteria, I have a seat in grad school is a huge relief."
Freshman,5,I have not yet attended. I will be going in as an animal behavior major. Next school year will be my first year.
Freshman,5,"Great school.    I will be attending Carroll in the Fall and I'm super excited! 
I've heard great things and can't wait to experience it for myself!!"
Freshman,5,"The school was amazing, the school was nice and close, everything was super convenient. The people there are so welcoming and always willing to help."
Sophomore,5,"The second I walked around campus I knew it was for me. Carroll's smaller campus allowed me to continue my athletic career. With the small campus comes small class sizes, In my class I have around 20 to 30 students. This has allowed me to get to know my professors and ask for help. I love this school and have no regrets coming here or want to leave anytime soon."
Freshman,5,"Carroll University is a wonderful university. It is small, with a good sense of community. It has many places to study, ranging from group work areas to silent areas. The advisor staff and professors are very helpful when planning classes or for any other issue. I commute to school each day, so parking can sometimes be an issue if I'm running late."
Freshman,5,"The professors and other staff at Carroll University are amazing. I love my classes and this university offers a lot of resources to help me succeed in every way possible.  They seem expensive, but if you do well in school they offer great scholarships to help bring the cost down"
Alum,5,The learning experience if very student-focused. Small class sizes allow for more engaged learning experiences. You really get to know your professors and they know you.
Niche User,5,Carroll University has small classes where you get to know classmates and professors.  The campus makes it very easy to find your classes and administration is very helpful.
Freshman,5,"Love this school, great professors and academics. The campus is beautiful during every season. They also give lots of financial aid to students in need. 100% worth the money."
Sophomore,5,"I like how small the campus is and the professors are amazing. There are plenty of activities to do and the university is good at telling everyone about their activities. The activities are typically free and a lot of fun. Also, public safety is amazing we all have their number in case we have an emergency. The service is open 24 hour seven days a week to ensure our safety."
Sophomore,5,"I am a Transfer student at Carroll University. I had a tour when I was on the search for a new college to attend. My tour guide was very personable and made me feel like I was one of her friends. I felt so welcomed and comfortable there. I am also a commuter so I can't say much about the dorm life, or the party scene. However what I can comment about is the Academics and Student life. It really an incredible community of students coming together to better each others lives. They have free tutoring and Supplemental Instruction groups that will help you understand the class discussions and apply the course content. I feel as though the local area is also very welcoming. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance if you live on campus and there are also fun things to do in the area like taking pottery classes, or yoga classes as well as local gyms in the area."
Junior,5,"I am a junior nursing student and so far I've loved Carroll. We have AMAZING health science programs, whether it be physical therapy, rad tech, sonogrophy, athletic training, etc. All the programs are highly ranked and I feel the rigor they put us through, especially in the nursing program, will have prepared me well for the NCLEX and real nursing experiences."
Sophomore,5,Carroll University is the perfect place for any student who wants a smaller school environment than big public schools. Carroll provides students with an excellent learning environment with smaller class sizes so that students have the ability to ask questions and receive hands on learning. Carroll University is home to intelligent and giving student and staff that take pride in being a pioneer.
Freshman,5,"Carroll offers a lot of academic support to help all students be successful in their toughest courses.  Additionally, Carroll provides many opportunities for students to give back to the community through volunteer work.  The campus is beautiful, cozy, and safe."
Sophomore,5,I transferred here my second semester of freshman year and it has already been proven to be the right move to make. This school really focuses on hands on learning and I already feel confident going into and pursuing my major.
Senior,5,"I felt like Carroll was my home away from home. It is a small school so you get to know people and see them around. All the professors I have had want the best for you and take the time to make sure you understand the material. 
There are a decent amount of food options and are all pretty good. The dorms were a good size, definitely not too small. There is always something to do on the weekends and about a mile down the road there are a lot of stores and restaurants."
Niche User,5,"the campus is beautiful and has such a great atmosphere, the waukesha area is amazing and always buzzing with activity"
Junior,5,"Phenomenal campus with professors who care deeply about student success. Both students and professors have resources to accomplish what they need, and there is a great respect between teacher/student."
Junior,5,I love this school. great nursing program. great environment and people. staff is great and helpful. all over the great place to study.
Sophomore,5,"Carroll University is a great school that offers a beautiful campus, a small student to professor ratio, great curriculum, and a welcoming atmosphere."
Sophomore,5,My experiences so far at Carroll are wonderful. The staff and atmosphere of the campus is warm and welcoming. Everyone is friendly and willing to help no matter the circumstances a student is in. The events that are planned around campus are culturally informative and school-spirited.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy Carroll University. I am in the nursing program, so my courses are pretty straight forward and laid out for me, but the advisors and school support are very good in determining the best classes for each individual student. I am currently living in the apartments through Carroll and I really enjoy having the option of making my own food, but still having the ability to eat on campus. I enjoy that Carroll is a smaller school as well."
Niche User,5,"I love Carroll University so much mostly because of their excellent communication skills. During my college search, they have easily been the best at responding to my emails and questions, even over the weekend. They also have the top nursing program in the country at the moment because of their 100% passing rate on the NCLEX exam. Finally, they offer so many scholarships that attending Carroll is easily affordable."
Sophomore,5,I love the location! It gives you the big city feeling but at the same time still gives you a small city home feeling.
Sophomore,5,"Carroll University in Waukesha, Wisconsin is an excellent school for students serious about obtaining a quality education.  The professors are superb and the small class sizes assure attention is paid to each student.  The campus is beautiful and full of history.  I would not trade the education for anything. The location is great: a one mile walk to downtown Waukesha and a close drive to Milwaukee and Chicago. I would definitely recommend that you check out Carroll University!"
Sophomore,5,"Class sizes are small, with great teaching and invested professors. Greek life on campus is disappointing due to its diminutive size."
Senior,5,Carroll has a very good DPT program and their undergrad exercise science major is also very well. The professors are invested in the field and want to do what they can to help. They are very eager to share their knowledge and work with you on various projects.
Niche User,5,"The campus is super chill. There's a lot of really cool people that attend. The dorms are bigger than most colleges, which is amazing so you're able to have more room."
Senior,5,Carroll feels like a home away from home. I enjoy my classes and the professors. There is always something to do on campus and there are multiple places to eat. There are recent changes on campus and buildings being built/restored.
Sophomore,5,"I just finished my freshman year at Carroll University. I really enjoy this school so far. The classes for both my major and the gen-eds are very interesting, engaging, and informative. The faculty that I have interacted with are very approachable and helpful, and it is clear they know what they are doing in their respective fields. I would like to see a bit more diversity and campus-wide events and activities that cater to a larger variety of students."
Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere at Carroll University. Since it's a rather small school, you get to see people you know much more frequently. More importantly, however, your class sizes are pretty small and lots of your professors know you by name. All the professors do an outstanding job of preparing us for exams and making sure we learn what we need to. They really do care about you and how you perform academically."
Junior,5,"I like all the professors I've had so far, along with the quick walks to classes.  Everything is close by and easy to find. I'm a student athlete and I work on campus and it's really easy to balance everything out here."
Freshman,5,I have not attended yet but I intend to. Their tutoring opportunities are incredible and plentiful. Their campus is beautiful and the professors are lovely and helpful.
Junior,5,"I have had a fantastic experience here. With the small class sizes I have had countless opportunities that I never would have had at a state University. As an Art Education Major, Carroll allowed me to be working in classrooms since my freshman year. Also allowing for countless extra curriculars, professional opportunities and development. The professional staff here is so friendly and you are more than just a number to your professors here. It feels like home."
Freshman,5,"I am so pleased with their nursing program so far. It is direct admission, so I won't have to reapply my sophomore year and hope I get in. I keep my credentials, and I am already working so much farther into the depth of nursing than many other programs. Last year, 30 students from carroll took the NCLEX nursing licensure exam, and every student passed. This boosts my confidence for my program so much, and its because of how phenomenal my professors are. They aren't rude when you need help, they take the time to help you perform a skill with you, rather than just verbally instruct you or get frustrated. I can say that Carroll is wonderful, its quaint, quiet, yet such a blast."
Freshman,5,Super nice to not have to walk too far to get to class in winter. Also love how clean campus is all of the time. Definitely would recommend to others
Sophomore,5,"Carroll is a small school with a large university look.  Classes are small and personal with great professors. There are a lot of university housing types from your typical double dorm room with a community bathroom, to apartment suites.   Everything is well kept and clean.  There are many offering for socializing and sporting events.  At Carroll you are a name with your professors and among administrators - not a number.  The cost of the school, being private, is higher than your public universities.  However, the school has scholarship opportunities and grants and can help find financial aid.  Payment plans are offered and many textbooks can be bought online."
Freshman,5,"I love that it's a small campus so it doesn't take more than a 10 minute walk to get to class. Also, I love the small classroom size. It's so great to get that extra help from a professor who actually cares about your success. You're not just a number to them, you're a student. THEIR student."
Sophomore,5,"I love Carroll, the people are amazing, the classes are engaging, the atmosphere is perfect, and you feel safe and at home when you are here. They could improve on some teachers."
Niche User,5,"I love everything about Carroll University, couldn't be happier about pick a great University. I can't wait to call Carroll my home for the next six years."
Junior,5,I currently am a student at the university and I believe it is an exceptional school. The physical therapy program is very well set up and one of the best ones out there.
Junior,5,"First Carroll has a beautiful campus and downtown Waukesha is picturesque and just the right size. The public library and dozens of restaurants anr a five minute walk and the campus is small enough that you can get from one end to the other in just ten minutes on foot. The food options are pretty decent with the main dinning room, ABP (a bread and sandwich shop open whenever campus is open) and the coffee shop in the library. I am in the choir program whitch unlike most colleges is open to all students, so I can be a Computer Science major and still be in the top choir. The program is growing rapidly and is too much fun to pass up. Also the small school community makes class sizes supper small and teachers really dedicated. The largest lecture hall holds 150 but the average class size is like 15-20. I love my professors and every single professor I have had knew me by name."
Sophomore,5,"Carroll is a great school. It is small enough to get a great connection with all of your professors, which really helps with the learning experience and the quality of my education. It is still big enough to make a great group of friends, and get to know friendly faces. It is in a great location, and resources are great."
Graduate Student,5,"Carroll University has been an extremely welcoming, resourceful and professional school throughout my attendance.  The faculty are extremely passionate about their respective subjects and want to see their students succeed; however, they're not afraid to push students to their full potential."
Sophomore,5,"Carroll University offers students a ""home-like"" feel once you take your first step on campus. CU offered a variety of majors, minors, and activities to accommodate students' needs, wants, and desires. As a Not-for-profit school, Carroll University offers multiple scholarships for students in need for financial aid. As a final review, Carroll University gives and will continue to give students the adequate education and college experience."
Freshman,5,"The campus is absolutely beautiful. All of their staff are so nice and easy to talk to, plus extremely helpful. Cannot wait to be back in the fall and make memories!!"
Junior,5,"Carroll University is the perfect school for me! Everyone is friendly, the landscape is beautiful, and the teachers are amazing.  Truly blessed to go to Carroll."
Freshman,5,"After my freshman, year I am very happy with my choice to attend Carroll University.  Their classes, student organizations, and campus all make it a great place to live and learn."
Sophomore,5,"Carroll University has given me a great college experience for many reasons. The administration is very friendly and helpful, there are many resources for academic help, the campus feels like a community, and there are always social activities held on campus. It's a nice environment for making friends as well as studying hard."
Junior,4,"Carroll bring together a great community and has an awesome orientation planned for incoming students. This school also has a lot of opportunities for students to get involved. It’s also right by downtown Waukesha, so perfect location!"
Sophomore,4,My online learning experience with Carroll was good. I felt that I could engage more easily and not get as distracted as I would if I were in a room with other people.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, my experience with Carroll is pretty good. I am provided with great education for my major, however, the way some policies and procedures are carried out for students can be questionable. Otherwise, Carroll is pretty good."
Junior,4,"Online learning was facilitated with many new recources professors presented us with. We used Microsoft Teams along with countless other online resources to make our adjustment to online learning as easy as possible. As everyone knows, online learning is a big adjustment and they did not have the best circumstances to change us to online learning. Under the current world situation, Carroll did they best they could to streamline classes!"
Junior,4,Carroll University is a great college. They adminstration and teachers there prepare you for your future career and are very helpful is you are still figuring that out. Things that still need to worked on is the overall diversity of staff and students and also in the culture of the school.
Junior,4,My online expierence was good. My professors adjusted quickly and were also available to answer questions.
Senior,4,"I have had a wonderful experience as a Carroll University student and would recommend to any upcoming college students in search of a university with small class sizes, great opportunities, and professors who go above and beyond."
Senior,4,I have taken many online courses through Carroll University and highly recommend. CU's online courses allowed me to accelerate my learning process and graduate a full academic year early.
Sophomore,4,"Almost 100% of homework is done online, with the only exceptions being math/diagram related. Quizzes and Exams were taken online for some classes, while others were scantron. The move to completely online schooling due to COVID-19 hindered learning to a degree, but it was still manageable."
Sophomore,4,"Carroll community is one where you will always see people you recognize, and some people you don't. Campus is small enough to the point that it is hard to be late to classes, and many classes may reside in the same building depending on the major/minor."
Senior,4,"Online learning was definitely a challenge, but overall it was a good experience. Most professors were very flexible and understanding of varying circumstances that students may have found themselves in. I only had one professor who continued hard grading  after switching to online learning."
Junior,4,Some professors are better than others which is similar to other colleges. But each professor has their benefits. There are a wide range of professors who have different types of teaching styles which is extremely helpful. If a student finds the perfect professor for them it makes college so much easier.
Junior,4,Carroll is an amazing college. It's small community allows professors to get personal with the students. It also is small enough to gov the college experience without overwhelming you.
Alum,4,"I loved my time at Carroll. I've made friends I'll have for life and I still talk to my professors and I graduated three years ago! I would've given them five stars, but they've let certain members of their faculty go over the past few years, and I don't believe they should have done so. They were amazing people. Beyond that, Carroll is a great school with small class sizes."
Sophomore,4,"Carroll was one of the first schools I applied too. I just loved the environment and how Carroll is represented. The professors and the people are friendly. There is a lot of activities and events to be involved in. The academics are high standards, I feel I learn a lot and they prepare us for bigger things. It's a nice community where I'm happy to call home."
Niche User,4,"I have yet to attend Carroll however the support I'm recieving has been mostly pleasing with minor hiccups. The phone calls I've had while trying to visit th he campus have been informative. Likewise, I felt very supported and hopeful when I was accepted and recieved a significant scholarship! My only concerns regarded a program mishap where my application was lost. However after contacting Carroll they were very speedy in retrieving it and getting me a response within a matter of 2 days! My other concern lies with some misinformation when attempting to get dates for visiting the campus. This was rather frustrating but was resolved once I recieved the proper information. Overall, great support and service and I look forward to attending."
Sophomore,4,"Overall Carroll University is a good college to attend. They make you feel like they want you to succeed by having many options for getting help, such as writing and math centers, tutors, and SI groups. The professors can either be a hit or miss, but many of them have a reasonable amount of office hours in case you need help or just want to talk. Also, Carroll makes it easy for you to get on the right path for you to graduate on time and find the career you want. They do this by assigning you an academic advisor in which you meet with every semester before registration to make sure you are taking the right classes. They also provide a career information section for you to seek help with resume writing, interviewing, or just learning basic information about the career you are interested in."
Junior,4,Love the small town feel and individual attention available from professors if you want it. The campus is a bit boring on the weekends but with Milwaukee 20 min away there are always places to go.
Niche User,4,"I am an ECCP student which means I am a senior in high school who takes classes at a college. I absolutely love Carroll, and am going to go there after high school. The teachers are great and always help when needed. Overall, it's just a great experience."
Sophomore,4,"Carroll University is a very historic college and while it is small it has a great atmosphere and the students and staff are all very nice and welcoming. If you're planning on coming to Carroll, make sure you know the requirements for graduation though because it can sometimes throw off a students plan. Personally, I love that Carroll is invested in exposing their students to different cultures and cultural experiences through their courses and programs."
Graduate Student,4,"Overall, good small school with opportunities to get to know everyone on campus. However, not very diverse. General education program could use some work when it comes to allowing credit for AP courses."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy Carroll. Its right inside a community which gives it a home like feeling. The faculty here are also amazing and they always put students needs first.
Junior,4,Carroll is a beautiful campus filled with opportunity to learn and be successful. The university goes out of it's way to make sure that the students are diversified. As a student I am able to engage myself in other cultures besides my own because of the emphasis on culture that the university provides. Here I am able to engage with peers who are different from me and I am able to learn about them as they are of me. Without going to Carroll I wouldn't get the cultural experience that I believe is beneficial to have in today's society.
Freshman,4,"I love the small campus and friendly environment! There isn’t much I’d change about Carroll, it was a perfect fit for me and I’m sure many others can speak to the same standards."
Sophomore,4,Although it took me time to adjust to the culture Carroll is a beautiful campus filled with many friendly students and staff. there is something for everyone to do whether its through a sport or club.
Sophomore,4,"Carroll University does an excellent job at being a rigorous, but very fun school. All staff works hard to make a relationship with their students and the small class sizes are very welcoming. The only down-side to CU is the price, but you do get your money's worth with the education received."
Sophomore,4,I thoroughly enjoyed my first year at Carroll University. Carroll is filled with the most helpful and insightful professors and faculty. The campus is beautiful and filled with plenty of areas to sit and study.  The only thing that Carroll could improve is by installing air conditioning throughout the dorms.
Senior,4,Carroll was the best choice for me academically. I love the small class sizes and every single professor I have ever had knows me by name.
Freshman,4,"The educational part of Carroll is excellent, there is a lack in social interaction throughout the campus."
Junior,4,"I enjoyed the small campus, I could walk from class to class in under ten minutes. Most professors and advisors are focused on helping you succeed, in class and with your future career. However, the food is not the best and there isn't a lot to do on or around campus for fun."
Niche User,4,"Carroll University is not the largest university, but that happens to be one of my favorite parts of the school. Having the school not being overly large allows its students to have stronger connections with their professors, making it easier for students to approach their professors when needing help with the subject matter. As well as this, the town that the university is situated in is fun o things for students to do living on campus. The downtown area is filled with different places for students to eat, and places to study."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the atmosphere of the campus that is created by having only a couple thousand students, but I wish there was more dining options as the food can get boring after a while."
Junior,4,The students are all really nice. The teachers are friendly and easy to talk to. They really care about each student in the class and want everyone to be successful.
Senior,4,I don't think I've been on a campus that felt more like home than Carroll. The small class sizes and the personable professors make it more tolerable to want to show up to class.
Niche User,4,I liked the atmosphere and environment along with the feeling of diversity and creativity present all around. It is a very sophisticated and prestigious school with lots of opportunities. It is also close to home and I have been able to tour it multiple times.
Junior,4,"I love that it’s small, and that the professors take a personal interest in your future, and really care about your success. As a campus, they are also very cognizant of the environment. The Eco club in campus is very active, and have raised lots of money to put towards awareness and various eco friendly equipment. They have also implemented many changes on campus including a plastic straw ban, reusable to go containers for the cafeteria, and solar panels that have allowed at least one of our buildings to be self-sustaining. 

Unfortunately, I have often noticed that communication between departments is not always good, and I have had to do some running around in regards to some administrative stuff."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Carroll is a great school! The entire staff from professors to advisors to counselors etc. are so focused on the well-being of the students. Everyone there wants to see you succeed, and there are so many resources to help you! Because it is a smaller school, students get that one on one connection with their professor, and there's tutors and sessions for every class to help. The only thing I don't like at Carroll is that there is not a lot to do on campus. When I'm not studying or in class,  I find myself constantly bored and at a loss of what activities I could go do. If you have a car on campus though, there's great options in nearby areas. Milwaukee is pretty close. Overall, I love the atmosphere and student focus on Carroll University!"
Junior,4,I loved the Science Buildings for both PT and Nursing Students and how much the teachers push us to do our best to be the best DPTs and Nurses! Also how Carroll requires a Cultural Experience and courses related to Culture! Incredible experiences created :-)
Freshman,4,"I haven't spent much time in Carroll University, but from my first year here, I think it's a great college. It's small, which I like, but it's expensive. All my teachers were good. I live locally, so I commute to save money. I can't really tell how the dorms are, but I'd imagine it to be decent. Downtown is pretty fun, too. I like the parks here. The food that is served in campus is amazing.  I'm an introvert, and I can't really say much about student life or the party scene."
Freshman,4,"It’s crazy, obviously being a first year college student it’s hard to know if you’re actually going to like a colleg or not and if you want to put so much money in it, I’ve looked at hundreds of colleges, taken tours in many in and out of state and carroll is honestly the best choice for me. Everyone who know someone me says the same thing! Its small and hands on teachers and help everywhere you look it’s amazing! I’m excited to start and end my 4 years at this school."
Junior,4,"I really enjoy the atmosphere in this college. All of my current professors and advisers aim to help me succeed and will help me in any way possible. The campus is small, making it easy to get from building to building in a timely matter, and is always clean. I am a commuter so I have to drive from my house and Carroll everyday. I save money this way, but  I would enjoy being a commuter much more if the parking lots were larger, included more parking space, and if all of the major pot holes were filled. I am tired of trying to find parking on the streets and having to avoid pot holes in the parking lots when my tuition is $29,000 a year."
Graduate Student,4,I really enjoy that Carroll University is a smaller college and allows for one-on-one student and professor interaction. I believe I have greatly benefited from this opportunity to get to know my professors on a personal level. Each of my professors has always encouraged and pushed me to achieve greatness. I would not be where I am today without the help and knowledge of the faculty at Carroll University.
Freshman,4,It's easy to become disconnected from campus (it's more up to the student to be involved on campus).
Sophomore,4,"Carroll is a nice school if you like quaintness. I don't mind it, but others might if they are looking to get lost in a sea of people their age. But, Carroll has a lot to offer for being a small university, and not to mention that the nursing program isn #1 in the nation right now."
Sophomore,4,"Carroll university is a smaller school, which is a turnoff for some people, but should really be seen as a perk! I used to think that saying a small school with close faculty contact used to be something that people would say almost as a consolation prize. But now, it is something that I would not trade for the world. Each of your professors are invested in your future and success, and are devoted to helping you learn what you need to learn, and provide you with the resources that  you will need to succeed. Not to mention that man times they will be able to help you get connected professionally. 
However, Carroll is very slow about getting renovations done, and often they need to be nagged before a building gets renovated or something gets fixed."
Junior,4,Overall Carroll has been a great environment to go to school in. It is very safe and offers a variety of programs to study that are not offered at other local schools. It is fairly expensive though and I feel that we should be getting better food variety and housing for the price we are paying or prices should not be so high.
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, I have had a great first year at Carroll. It has a wonderful learning environment, lots of academic resources, and countless ways to get involved and have fun on campus. I am very satisfied with my education so far and can't wait to continue through my time here."
Freshman,4,Carroll University is a good school to go to if you are entering the medical field. The campus is really nice and the side walks are always shoveled in the winter before you have to go to classes. Carroll is a very clean school with a lot of diversity. I recommend going to Carroll if you are going into the medical field.
Freshman,4,They have many resources available to their students to provide help. The professors are knowledgeable and care about what they're teaching.
Senior,4,"Carroll is a small university but the professors and academics are top notch! The smaller class sizes allow for a more personalized learning experience with easy access to extra help if needed. Speaking of extra help, Carroll offers a variety of studying assistance such as peer led study groups and easy to access online library. The  classes can be tough, but at least you'll know you're paying for a great education."
Graduate Student,4,"It is a very small college which I like because that was how my high school was. We learn about diversity in our studies, but the majority of the students who go there are not diverse ethnically. Carroll offers cultural courses and a Cross-Cultural Experience trip that all students must go on. You can travel all over the globe. Carroll has a lot of adjunct professors, some who were very great and some who were terrible. The professors who have been there the longest know how to teach and are very smart. I graduated early due to credits and so far it has been hard to find a job. It has been a month and I applied to 40 jobs. So the ""return on investment"" is lacking right now. I'm going to graduate school for OT. So, later my return will be much greater. Making friends and having consistent friends is easier when living on campus. I lived on campus for one year and commuted the rest. Thus, I have many acquaintances."
Junior,4,"It has been a gratifying experience up until now with the campus being small it allows one reach their classes relatively easy and if one were to be lost the students would be willing to help you out. That being said class sizes are relatively small allowing for easier student to teacher interaction granted the teacher knows what s/he is doing. One thing I would like to say is that the food being served in the MDR could be better since its usually a hit or miss and that's probably one of the reasons I'm happy I'm a commuter. On the topic of being a commuter your first year will be tough on forming connections since you do not have the privilege of being on campus, so I would recommend joining a club/sport or going to the events they host for commuters to at least know people on campus. But I'm guessing that's not just a Carroll thing. Either way I do not regret the years I have put in so far at Carroll."
Sophomore,4,"Carroll has been a wonderful experience for me. I've met many people here, and all of the professors were more than helpful."
Sophomore,4,I like the small campus atmosphere. The campus' buildings are being renovated very often giving the campus an updated look. Academically I am challenged and the teachers do give their all to educate the students of the campus. Athletically the school is on the rise as it is in a new and more competitive conference the CCIW.
Junior,4,"Small class sizes allow for individual attention to be met. However, the admission process is overambitious and is allowing too many people to be accepted into the school when there is not enough room to house them."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the small town feel of the Waukesha/Carroll area. You will always see someone you know while walking around campus. I also enjoy how small campus is. The furthest walk you'll have take is ten minutes.
Freshman,4,I enjoy that the teachers are extremely helpful. The students are very welcoming and the food is of great quality. I can't wait to start this upcoming fall.
Sophomore,4,"Carroll University has the best nursing program in the state. The small class sizes are amazing and allow you to connect with professors, which definitely gets you a head start. Gorgeous campus with relatively nice dorms."
Freshman,4,Carroll University is a great school if you are looking to focus on academics. The diversity of the school isn't that great but if we have more minorities apply it'll make the campus even better. Professors are always helpful and are always there. The resources Carroll offered is fantastic. The many places to study and eat is great as well.
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, Carroll didn't waste any time making sure students felt connected or apart of something that the campus had to offer right away. I personally love the small school and welcoming atmosphere. I wish there was more guidance, however, for undecided students. "
Freshman,2,"I would only recommend this school to nurse or pre PT/OT students. I am currently a freshman here going for marketing and I will be transferring after this year. The business program is definitely a second thought to the university and there is nothing impressive about the program. I have not had great luck with teachers here for a variety of reasons, and have heard similar stories from my classmates and friends here. The location of Waukesha is obviously not great. Nothing to do in the area unless you want to drive to Milwaukee which never ends up happening. The only modern buildings are for health science majors. They do offer good scholarships that bring it down to around $20,000 a year for everyone. The campus is small and a lot of people go home on weekends. I didn't plan on leaving every weekend originally but quickly realized there was no reason to stay. I am looking forward to transfering next year!"
Niche User,2,"I loved the size of the school, but sadly, the professors and advisors don't really care for their students."
Junior,2,"I really like the small campus community, one thing I would like to change is their residency requirements."
Niche User,2,"The majority of the Faculty was good. The professors in the communications department were very helpful and instructive. However, each class at Carroll is worth 4 credits instead of the traditional 3 credits, which makes trying to transfer out a nightmare. Class registration was poorly structured with times going on a lottery basis instead of GPA or enrolled major."
Junior,2,"This is a small school with a high school mentality.  The dorms are expensive and it's hard to get into the new suite-style dorms.   There is NO off campus living available and the college makes its hard for you to get save money and live off campus.  It's ridiculously hard to keep a car there too.  No activities on the weekend, the summers and breaks are dead.  Many commuters go here."
College Sophomore,2,They're too small to be important
College Freshman,2,"I lived in a double in South Bergstrom. The windows in the hallway outside my room leaked water everywhere early in the semester. The university caulked it, but it started leaking again only a month or two later. We ended up setting out bowls to collect the water from soaking the hallway and radiator. There was no air conditioning in the building. Temperatures widely varied within rooms, from extremely cold to unbearably hot, even in the middle of winter. The same fluctuations occurred with water temperature in the showers."
College Sophomore,2,There are no Greek houses on or near campus. The Greek life is only known for the volunteer or community based events they throw. Mostly all non-Greeks think that Greeks are just people that do good for certain organizations.
College Student,2,Promised a certain amount and first week of classes they said computer error.
College Student,2,"The food is greasy, cold, and very unhealthy"
College Sophomore,2,"I don't typically party but when I do, it's in someone's crowded basement among several other sweaty, wasted young adults."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not a wide enough variety of different foods available.  The meal plans are very expensive for the quality of food that we receive.  If it weren't so much more expensive, I would rarely or never eat on campus.  The smallest meal plan is not small enough, I always have a lot of meal swipes and dining dollars left to spend at the end of each semester."
College Freshman,2,"Not too much of a party scene that I know of in Waukesha, you usually have to know someone to get into a party and I wouldn't know anyone who would go. Better idea to go to Madison or Milwaukee for parties."
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot of variety in the food, and the food they do have is very bland. For how much we have to pay (over $2800) I'd like better quality food."
College Freshman,2,"The Financial Aid department wants students to be able to handle most of the financial aid process on their own. They are actually unfriendly about parents being involved and helping out. While I understand that a lot of parents require their kids to do all the work themselves, those who want to help their kids out with the process and/or paying for tuition shouldn't be discouraged from doing so."
College Junior,2,"While the dorms are expensive, off-campus housing that's close by is much worse.  Not only is it hard to find a place that has openings, but they charge much more than the apartments are worth.  It can save a lot of time, money, and frustrating to start your search for housing about 10-15 minutes away from campus."
College Senior,2,"Out of the three colleges I have attended Carroll is the only establishment that has changed my award seven times. This included after the semester started which went from me receiving a refund prior to the start of fall semester, but three weeks into the semester I was left owing $1,500. This makes it hard to manage expenses for they must not understand what it means to be a student, and how money is planned. I don't feel this ever would have happened at Marquette University based upon my experience at Marquette."
College Freshman,2,There is little to do off campus. It is a small town
College Freshman,2,"Only one fraternity is considered ""cool"". Others have negative stereotypes. Greek life isn't considered a big deal since they don't have official and separate houses."
College Junior,2,"Parties are very isolated to different groups of friends. If you don't have many friends, you will have trouble finding a place to party."
College Junior,2,"There are only three sororities and two fraternities on campus, and no one really pays any attention to them outside of themselves."
College Sophomore,2,"It's boring, it's repetitive and mder sucks"
College Sophomore,2,We can't even be off campus until senior year?!
College Sophomore,2,"Carroll is really only bad with ethnic diversity. It's a very white campus, and most of the people are of Christian or Catholic background. I use to think that the people here were very wealthy, but a lot of people are from lower-income families. I've met a fair share of people with other than hetero sexual orientation, and people are of all kinds of political beliefs. We're a very accepting campus, though."
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly, this is a small school. There are not going to be a lot of parties. If you're going to school for that, go to Madison or Milwaukee. Most of the people I know who drink a lot just have a get-together in their room and drink there. There are some pretty nice bars I've heard that are downtown, so not too far away from campus. A lot of people I know really like them."
College Sophomore,2,Financial aid sucks because I can barely afford paying what I am and I'm gonna be buried in loans as soon as I graduate. I'm constantly wondering if it's worth it.
College Sophomore,2,The whole campus will be covered in snow and every other school in the area will be closed but we're still expected to go to class even though half of our student population is made up of commuters.
College Sophomore,2,I think I would come into college with a different major if I knew it was this ridiculous.
College Sophomore,2,We have to take classes that don't seem remotely related to our area of study (physics for athletic training?) and if you don't get a certain grade you're booted from the program.
College Sophomore,2,The Greek people don't outwardly act any better than non-Greek people but most people think it's pointless to be in Greek life (unless you're in it). They get all the awards at banquets though.
College Freshman,2,"The local area surrounding campus is average, the area is not very good and there seems to be a high rate of crime.  Many people don't feel very safe when walking by themselves at night and it seems like there are always police sirens going off. Overall, the main campus is very safe."
College Freshman,2,"Diversity on campus is not very prevalent. There are international students and a few of ethnic background other than white but they are few and far between. I do not know about political, religious and sexual orientations."
College Sophomore,2,This has been the coldest winter on record. I honestly cant stand it. I just cant warm up.
College Freshman,2,I've heard of horror stories and most people live on campus anyway.
College Freshman,2,We live in Wisconsin but we had a day with -40 degree weather and we still had to go to class. They also need to be better about salting right away since I have fallen several times this year already. A couple of the buildings have heat problems as well.
College Freshman,2,The wifi at Carroll is not dependable it will just randomly cut out when your sitting in your room.  Also the school makes students pay to print and it is not that cheap.  The school provides students with some money for the year but when you run out of that it comes out of your pocket.  I would think that since I'm paying extremely high tuition that printing would be included.
College Senior,2,"Parking is always costly. If you are a commuter parking in the overflow lot, you better get to school pretty early because there are never enough spots. "
College Freshman,2,There is not much to do on campus.
College Junior,2,"Carroll is near downtown, and a lot of the places downtown close on the weekends early. This leaves only about 3 places to choose from. There are other restaurants, but if you don't have a car, it is very difficult to get to them--they are quite a walk."
College Junior,2,Noone really cares. Highschool sports had better turn outs than Carroll does
College Junior,2,Parking is also a joke-too expensive for what you get 
College Junior,2,"Carroll's Public Safety is not one of the highlights of Carroll. I personally believe too much money goes to Public Safety. If we have firealarms, the public fire department usually shows up before public safety does. They spend most of their time driving around in the shuttles, wasting gas and money. They are not very strict, and do not necessarily enforce rules the best."
College Junior,2,"There really isn't a nightlife at Carroll. Waukesha is not big enough to have clubs, and although it is close to Milwaukee, not everyone has transportation to Milwaukee or surrounding areas. Most underage activities are either at houses of athletes, or in the resident halls."
College Senior,2,"I don't like the bars.  Most of them are trashy townie bars. If you want good night life you have to go to milwaukee. The waukesha police and campus are really strict on house parties, and most of the good houses are gone."
College Senior,2,"The majority of people at Carroll are white.  Carroll tries to promote diversity, but there's not a lot of racial diversity on campus.  The school does have clubs that promote diversity."
College Senior,2,"I like campus parking because it is so cheap! But the overflow parking lot is always packed and it needs major work with filling pot holes. The dorm room parking lots are also cheap, but hurry because they fill up quickly!"
College Sophomore,2,"Only upperclassmen can have cars on campus, unless you want to pay $100+ for city parking 15 minutes from campus. Even if you need a car because you're far away from home, administrators make no accommodations for you. Even though there are plenty of open parking spaces, and upperclassmen that let their cars collect dust from lack of use, this parking thing will continue to be an issue."
College Sophomore,2,"There are three sororities and two fraternities at Carroll. Their reputation isn't great with those not involved with greek life. Those who are involved say they love it and the ""experience"" they get from it. Greek life at Carroll isn't really known for their parties. There is an unassociated frat that hosts parties quite frequently but they are in no way associated with Carroll and are not favored by the police."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking honestly isn't that great. Most of the lots fill up quickly during the day, and one lot in particular is in poor condition, with plenty of potholes. Freshman are not allowed to have cars on campus, though there isn't much need for one unless you are a science major with classes or clinicals off campus. Otherwise, walking is a viable option or Public Safety will transport you up to a mile off of campus."
College Junior,2,"There is a very low guy to girl ratio at school. Last year (2012-2013), there was one guy to every five girls. So there are not many relationships on campus. At school, everyone has about the same look. Most of the school comes from around the same financial background. So there is not much of a diversity on campus. Pretty much everyone on campus is focused on their grades and competitive since it is a very tight nit community."
College Sophomore,2,Carroll students are not good at sports. We are division three.
College Sophomore,2,Carroll is very small and there is not much to it.
College Sophomore,2,Most of the students were what I would consider average in their social life. Hardly anyone partied or went out and the majority of the students focused so much on their school work they were not very social. Most of the students are Carroll seemed to take plenty of time on their appearance each day and sports players walked around in groups like they played on Division one teams.
College Senior,2,"If you live in a dorm and have a parking spot by said dorm, you will always be able to find a spot. Parking permits range from less than 100$ to aout 200$. For commuters or those who have a permit for the overflow parking lot, parking during the day is a massive mess. It can take over 15 minutes to find a spot in the parking lot, or if you choose free street parking, you may have to walk a mile to class. On campus freshman are not allowed cars, but that didn't help much with the parking issue."
College Freshman,2,Students don't get too involved with the sports teams. Many times students don't even know about the games or when they're happening.
College Freshman,2,"Almost everyone at Carroll gets some sort of scholarship and most people have financial aid. When you're attending a $40,000 school, you need it."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus seriously, never closes. People(meaning staff) think that since they got here at 6 am perfectly fine, and it wasn't snowing, that we as commuters should get here too at 6 pm when the roads are slippery, unplowed and it's been snowing since 10am. The weather is a huge factor in me attending school considering I live off campus and 25 min away. Schools were closed today and its not even snowing there but here I waukesha roads haven't been plowed, it's still snowing and we still are required to be here."
College Sophomore,2,The printing here is ridiculous. We as nursing students receive 60-150 page syllabi that are required in class. As of a few days ago we were informed our tuition was being raised $2000 and also students are being charged for printing starting in August.
College Junior,2,It's primarily white students and all white professors. There are few minorities that are students. There is a diversity lounge that has a glass panel to look inside. It makes those who go inside feel like zoo animals because people often look that direction as they are walking past.
College Junior,2,"Some professors at this school do not care and will even call their students dumb if the students don't understand something. Most are willing to help when the lecture is over but at the end of a lecture, a student should have a clear understanding of what they learned and what they need to do next. Most lectures are boring and filled with jargon that is barely clarified for those who don't know what is being said."
Alum,1,"Carroll University was unlike anything I expected.  Academically, it reminded me of high school, where anyone could cheat to pass.  If you want an easy A, then this would be a good school to attend but keep in mind that it will not benefit you in the real world.  Socially, this school was terrible.  With it being a small school, there were many cliques and the people were not really open to change.  Again, reminiscent of high school. The school has no diversity aside from the foreign exchange students.  The Waukesha area is dirty and there happens to be a heroin epidemic in the community.  There really is no party scene because there are cops and public safety patrolling the areas where parties would be thrown, especially on the weekends.  The only thing good about Carroll University is their food.  Overall, I was very disappointed in attending Carroll University."
College Junior,1,"Carroll Housing is by far the worst part about Carroll. The dorms always have problems: work orders are not completed in a timely fashion, faculty do not make an effort to sympathize with students when problems occur. Housing is not a good value whatsoever-it feels like an utter waste; but I need to live somewhere."
College Junior,1,I have had lots of problems with the financial aid office. They won't process my loan for an amount so that I can receive the books I need for my classes. I will not be able to attend school this semester if they don't get it straightened out. There is also never seats left in classes so you can never get the classes you need to get your degree.
College Sophomore,1,There is no such thing as nightlife
College Junior,1,Greek life is a joke- it's nothing like in movies.
College Freshman,1,"It snowed here a lot and also rained a lot, and it was always very cold. Its hard to walk to classes sometimes because it's so cold, and if you have a class early in the morning, sometimes they haven't even salted the ground if it is icy. And it gets very slushy around here."
College Sophomore,1,"Since we are in Wisconsin and also very close to Lake Michigan it is either very windy, rainy, or snowy depending on the time of year.  Although everything on campus is fairly close together it still is no fun going to class and being frozen by the time you get there or drenched by the time you get there."
College Freshman,1,Campus housing for underclassmen are pretty bad. Most freshman get placed into triples in rooms sized for 1 or 2 people. The buildings are old and outdated and it takes quite a while for things to get fixed or replaced.
College Freshman,1,"The school just recently refused to allow freshman students to park on campus with the only alternative being to park off campus in a city lot, where even if you pay for a permit they will still give you a ticket if you let your car sit in one spot for too long. Very dumb. For commuters, finding parking space is very difficult, especially close to campus. Other than that, I've never heard any complaints from buying a school's permit and parking at the dorms for those who live on campus."
College Senior,1,"The cost of parking permits is pretty cheap compared to what I've heard from other campuses, and commuters get a free parking pass. However, if you get to campus any time between 9am and about 2-3pm, you won't find a spot to park. There simply aren't enough spots for the number of students, and the parking lot is full of potholes. Also, freshmen that live on campus aren't allowed cars, unless they fill out a special circumstances form. On the other hand, the newer residence halls have underground parking (for an extra cost), which is a nice option."
College Junior,1,"Between 9:00 am and 1:00 pm, Monday,Tuesday,Thursday, and Friday forget about finding a spot. Also, don't resort to parking in a fire lane because while the university will let you park in one up to five times then give you a $21.00 fine, you will get towed after 5 fines. The contracted tow company with every business in Waukesha including Carroll is Elder's and they charge $385.00 per tow. The overflow lots need work as there are potholes and metal pieces sticking out of the ground from old poles. It also needs to be cleaned as there are glass shards from beer bottles, wrappers, condoms, and other garbage."
College Freshman,1,"There is a multitude of Caucasian persons on campus, although the administration goes to great lengths to emphasize cross cultural interaction. There is a fair representation of other races and Religious beliefs, but one must really search to find them because there are not that many individuals on campus that  are diverse."
College Junior,1,"There are mostly white, conservative females who attend Carroll University. Mostly everyone is accepted, which is nice because you meet such a variety of people. While it is a private, expensive school, many young adults are being supported by financial aid, grants, and scholarships."
College Freshman,1,"Parking can be difficult at Carroll. There are only a few lots and I know that many commuters complain of not being able to find a spot to park in. If you do end up getting a parking pass, you can usually find a spot, sometimes it's just further away than you would like."
College Senior,1,"AWFUL Facilities! I am appalled at the state of Carroll's facilities. The main gym is hot (it isn't air conditioned), crowded and half the time half of the machines are broke. The dance studio where fitness classes are held also is hot and frequently crowded. The pool is not open very long or at convenient times. Carroll makes it hard to keep in shape using the facilities."
College Junior,1,No Spots – Parking on campus is extremely expensive and you are not guaranteed a spot. People are forced to park around campus (in the city) and get tickets because they cannot move within the 2 hour time period.
College Sophomore,1,All White – Trying to find an ethnic person on our campus is like playing a game of Where's Waldo. Theres not really problems with racism we just happen to have a ton of white middle and upper class people.
College Freshman,1,Mostly White Students – There are a handful of foreign exchange students. Most of the campus in white students. There are very few African Americans or hispanics that actually attend.
College Freshman,1,Alot of the greek life boys are very sketchy boys who only want to get into a girl's pants. At Beta it is known for getting drugged and/or in the position of getting raped. You do not want  to go to their parties. The greek girls are stupid stuck up girls that have mommy and daddy pay for everthing. I am not one of the Greeks nor do I want to be.
College Sophomore,1,"Empty Campus – I don't really know why I chose this school in the first place. I thought a small, nice campus was good for me. I was dead wrong! This school is a huge commuter school and almost everyone goes home on the weekends. So it's pretty much an empty campus, no school spirit, and the clubs are a joke. There isn't anything to do! The teachers are also sometimes hard to get a hold of since they work outside the campus.
This is not a school to go to if you want a social life and don't want to sit around every weekend. Apply at your own risk of social suicide!!! I got out of there as fast as I could and am definitely happy to have left. This school has a lot of people transfer, like me, after the first semester or year, if that says anything..."

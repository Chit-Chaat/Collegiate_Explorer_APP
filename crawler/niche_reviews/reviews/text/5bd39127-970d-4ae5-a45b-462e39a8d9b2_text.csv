Graduate Student,5,My experience has been overwhelmingly good as a student who wants to study interdisciplinary arts with a non traditional focus.
Alum,5,"I am 68 years old and it was one of the most wonderful and enlightening experiences I ever encountered. Choosing what and how you are going to learn makes you a phenomenal researcher. It trains you to adapt to all sorts of experiences to your learning. The people were so extremely bright, wacky and quite unconventional. The collection of people there were all so different and  accepting of others. It is a profoundly accepting and nonjudgemental place. The only downside is that people leave so frequently due to not being able to do much of their academic work on their own.  I was there for all four years with only one other person who was a freshman. You either learned to motivate yourself or you dropped out. A lot of students dropped out. 
You would get close to people because of the dorm time and being far away from everything and having time to relax and talk together.  It was one of the best experiences of my life and I am pretty old! I graduated in 1979."
Works Here,5,"A truly democratic institution, students come first and their voices are heard! Individualized learning with the flexibility to experience life."
Graduate Student,5,"Their innovative approach to education is extremely refreshing. One must be prepared for somewhat of a homeopathic culture, but their accommodations of students' needs and goals is downright amazing."
Junior,5,"I love Goddard! Go maroon!! Everytime I step onto our campus, I feel an overarching sense of pride and joy. The academics are great and it has provided me with everything I have wanted in a college."
College Sophomore,5,People respect each other completely.
College Junior,5,"There is no Greek life at this school, which suits me fine."
College Junior,5,The students look super great. You only meet for a week or so per semester so do what you can with that.
College Junior,5,"Advisers Find Ways to Coax Best Work from Students – at goddard college, most of the work is done at home by oneself. every 3 weeks, a ""packet"" of writing is due to the students adviser, and the adviser responds within a couple of days with a lengthy response. goddard has no grades and does not believe in evaluation either, but an enthusiastic and thorough reply does signal that the student delved deep into their study. this sort of communication is a a bit of a positive feedback loop. i found my adviser this past semester would give me more and more suggestions for source material as we went, and she came to anticipate my course of study well. i love the one-on-one style of pedagogy."
College Junior,5,"most of the students at goddard are either older returning students or are youngsters who are enthusiastic about the optimism and creative approach the school offers. for this reason, drugs play a very minor role there. at the last residency, i was aware of some moderate drinking some evenings, but more often than not, i encountered other students engaged in deep conversations in the dining hall or strolling about the campus. others were ensconced in their rooms with books and laptops open."
College Junior,5,"Low-Residency Program Allows for Working People of All Ages to Study on Individual Terms – goddard college no longer offers full-time on-campus study. twice a year for 8 days, we meet on campus for an intensive residency. during this time, we attend workshops and presentations by graduating students as well as faculty. we are assigned an adviser for the semester, and we meet with them in small groups to hash out our study plans for the semester. many wonderful conversations can be had both in these workshops and meetings and informally. the dining hall is a great place to hang out, get to know the other students and faculty, and work on one's study plan. after residency, we go home to spend the remainder of the semester doing our work and communicating with our advisers via email and phone calls."
College Junior,5,"at goddard college in vermont, we are only on campus for 8 days twice a year for an intensive residency. this is a magical time that exists outside of everyday life. the campus is a beautiful, serene, and peaceful place that seems to encourage intense conversations and new discoveries even for jaded older students such as myself. there are a few buildings that were designed and built by students during the 1970s back to land movement. most of these are currently closed, but they are quite wonderful to behold as you stroll around the campus. i look forward to going back soon."
College Student,5,"Free Spirits Come Here – at goddard you can study pretty much what you want and also earn credit through the things you did that were not college credit related, but related to your degree in order to get credit. it's very open minded to the most strangest of interests and that's the best thing ever!"
Senior,4,"the format is amazing for people like me (non-traditional student, live out of state), and the leadership and self-direction required for this type of learning has taught me above and beyond the course of study, but I would have loved for the instructors/professors to have been more proactively supportive of us as students."
College Sophomore,4,"Goddard College gives me the opportunity to study in my own way, on my own time, with the ability to collaborate with my fellow students outside of the classroom environment. It is the future of higher education."
College Senior,4,Small campus and everyone is very friendly.
College Senior,4,Local and organic foods served.
College Sophomore,4,They were very kind and helpful.
College Sophomore,4,All housing is quaint and nice.
College Senior,4,It does snow but it is gorgeous in the mountains so you don't really care.
College Senior,4,The computer labs were spacious and not crowded at all.  Printing is free!
College Senior,4,The residency dorms are nice but this is not a typical campus housing situation.  They are for short term stays.
College Senior,4,"The Vermont Extremes – Residencies take place in summer and winter. Seasons in Vermont tend to be extreme - Vermont summers are hot and humid and this past residency was no exception. Days reached almost 100 degrees. Nights were uncomfortably sultry at times. Winters offer snow almost every day, with daily temps sometimes dipping below 0. You have to love the extremes to live here. Weather never affects workshops."
College Senior,4,"Campus Incident – At a recent residency there was an incident regarding a (presumably) local town resident who was found peering into a female resident's dorm. Because of the tight community atmosphere of the campus and student body, as well as Goddard's security, the residency continued without another incident, as students watched out for each other and everyone felt much safer. There were no further incidents."
College Student,4,Every Dorm Has Rules – different dorms have different rules. some dorms you are free to drink and others you are not. there is a lot of freedom at this school and since everyone is very mature no one seems to overdo it.
College Senior,2,Very rural - few dining options.
College Student,2,You Leave on Foot or by Car – if you have a car you have the freedom to leave campus and go where you need to if you can find time in between study plans and events. otherwise you are stuck or have to ask someone for a ride.

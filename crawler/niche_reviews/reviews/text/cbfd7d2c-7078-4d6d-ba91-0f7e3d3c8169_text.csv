Junior,5,"Point Park professors have made online learning an easy transition for me, and they have been very flexible overall."
Junior,5,Point Park gives students so many opportunities to get real-world professional experience in their chosen field!
Junior,5,"Its pretty good, most professors are nice and the other students are pretty neat. The campus is located right downtown by market square so there's no shortage of food options if you got the cash and are tired of campus food."
Sophomore,5,I am a dance major here and it is top 5 in the country and it shows so much they create such amazing and versatile dancers to go out into the professional world
Sophomore,5,"I love Point Park! The campus feels huge since it's in the middle of downtown Pittsburgh, yet small because of the greenery and set up of the buildings. The students are all inclusive and support one another no matter their major or status. The campus is welcoming as well as the faculty.  I have never felt ignored while talking to a staff member. The campus is located in the city so there is a lot of access to public transportation. Overall, Point Park University has the right feel for what anyone and everyone is looking for."
Sophomore,5,"Point Park was my number one choice when applying for schools.  It has been an amazing experience and I have already have had opportunities to work with professional choreographers and dancers.  The school cares about the dancers and offers guidance in classes, training and health.  It is an open environment and the instructors actually care about the students.  There are many ways to get assistance if it is needed such as tutoring and the dance studios are always open."
Freshman,5,I like how point park is a small school. I’m able to learn one on one with teachers with out the distraction of a huge class.
Junior,5,"Point Park is one of the best things to ever happen to me! They do not just give you the academic knowledge surrounding your field, they force you to obtain practical experience in it as well, which is wonderful when it comes to internships and jobs. Point Park also offers a ton, and I really mean A TON, of opportunities for you to earn that experience, whether it is through club activities, volunteering, or jobs. Basically, if you want to do something, Point Park offers you the chance to do it. An added bonus to all of this is also the fact that the students and faculty are friendly and helpful, and because it's a small school, you'll get to know a lot of the people there pretty well. 

That said, I caution prospective students in attending this school if they are primarily interested in STEM. We thrive in business, arts, and media, and while we have an interesting program in Forensic Science, STEM is just not our specialty. Be open to it but look further into it."
Junior,5,"I only transferred here this semester. So far it’s great; the professors, counselors, and close to many public transportation sources. Also very diverse student base."
Graduate Student,5,The online program is great and allows me to work while getting an education and the professors give good feedback and care about students.
Senior,5,"I love taking classes online. I can have a perfect balance between work, life, and school. Point Park University offers a wide selection of majors and online classes.  The professors are very knowledgeable and the Academic advisors guide you where you need to be. This university provides real world scenarios which not only helps to add to your portfolio to show to future employers but also helps make the learning process fun and memorable. 

This school is local to the Pittsburgh area and at one 1 in 5 graduates in Allegheny county were alumni of Point Park University. Go Pioneers!"

Senior,5,"I have enjoyed every moment at Point Park University. Professors have been wonderful, I've never had a problem with making friends on this small and close-nit campus. Multiple campus clubs are very open to new members and hold events, there isn't a day that goes by without something fun happening on campus because of students, or students venturing just blocks from their dorms into the heart of downtown for more fun and memorable events. I also feel that I have learned so much about the career I am pursuing in such a short time through my classes and campus organizations."

Graduate Student,5,I am an online student and have had a wonderful experience in a  non-traditional forum.  Balancing the military and work along with school Point Park has assisted me in continuing my education and making it as simple as possible.
Freshman,5,"I am a current freshman at PPU. Point Park makes me so happy. Maybe it's the creative, friendly students. Maybe it's the unique clubs I have joined. Or maybe it's just the Point Cafe quesadillas. Of course it's not all sunshine and rainbows -- the classes aren't challenging, and I'm paying way too much. But at the end of the day, I can't see myself growing as much at a different university as I currently am here."
Freshman,5,"I like Point Park University. It's cool and all; However, it lacks certain potential for certain Majors like IT. Information Technology is a growing major in the Business world and Institutional establishments. This why Campuses like PPU should have a step higher for IT majors as well as Classes in my personal concerns."
Freshman,5,"Point Park offers students large financial aid packages, a spotlessly clean environment, and a safe community protected by graduates of the police academy and secured .buildongs.  Additionally, the campus is well designed, including elevators and ramps for physically challenged students.   While the  curriculum is quite diverse, the administration offers numerous organizations and counseling to ensure the success of the student body at the university."

Junior,5,"The main thing I love most about Point Park University is the great amount of diversity there is on the campus. Students from difference races, backgrounds, cultures, beliefs, and goals surround the school. While attending Point Park University, you gain an appreciation of what such a place like this school can do for you in a personal way. You are learning while experiencing something that only you can take in and really see what a person you can become. I have gained many friends that have influenced me to and during political times in our country understand where they are coming from because of what they have gone through in life with where they are from. The only thing I would change about Point Park University is the security. Being that the campus is located in the center of downtown Pittsburgh, safety is a must at all times in order to protect our students, faculty, and school."

Recent Alumnus,5,They welcomed every student with a sign! how cool!
Recent Alumnus,5,"Amazing, i mean like really nice housing. Freshman year wasn't too good, but i mean after its like a nice hotel."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I love my school. Small atmosphere in a big city. Always something to do. The school was always alive. People were chilling in the hallways of the dorm floors, everyone was out doing something all the time."
College Freshman,5,The professors are kind and respectful of questions and concerns you may have. They guide you in the direction you need.
College Freshman,5,"With my major as Dance, Point Park is rated number three in the country for their Dance program. The program provides you with the materials to get a job after graduating."
College Freshman,5,"my experience overall was amazing so far. The studios are giant studios with great space and beautiful facilities. the teachers are very one on one and really get to know you as a dancer, and person, they want to there students to really excell in the dance world, and all they want is the best for us. They offer a variety of corses, from ballet, to modern, jazz, and even tap. they also allow there students to doble major and they help out the students in anything they need."
College Freshman,5,it is a great safe aea with lots of security
College Freshman,5,"I first experienced my school in the summer for only three weeks, and within just three weeks i was in love! I grew so much with in the shortest amount of time. there is no doubt that with in four years I will be the best at my major, and I will learn everyting i need to know, and even more."
College Senior,5,"Point Park's Police work closely with that of the city of Pittsburgh to ensure that everyone is safe at all times. Safety issues rarely happen and the police force are always willing to walk you home at night if you feel unsafe. There are many ""help"" buttons around campus that you can press that immediately contact the police in case of an emergency, and their response time is lightning quick because there are always enough people on duty. They are all very friendly as well."
College Senior,5,I love being a student at Point Park University. I can make my experience my own and make the most out of my time in college. I have made strong networking connections in my field from my professors and from our neighboring downtown community of businesses. The entire university's staff and faculty is kind and dedicated and I feel like I could go to any one for anything and they would go out of their way to help me.
College Sophomore,5,The professors are very generous and very understanding when it comes to deadlines as well.
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love my Point Park University. Their dance program is the best and I am so thankful to be a part of it. Their core curricular classes are not that challenging, but the classes for my major are very challenging and has made me grow as a dancer just within one year as a student here at Point Park University."
College Sophomore,5,They're are RARELY any issues on campus and we always have campus police around. It's a safe place to be at any time
College Sophomore,5,The professors are very nice and professionals. Very exspirencd. The courses they offer are good. They are easy to understand and get a good grade in. Our class sizes are great. Biggest is about 30 people so you are noticed and do not feel like just a number to your professor. They know you by name
College Sophomore,5,"The school has a really good program in my feild of study. The professor are very exspirencd and help a lot. Also the location is very nice. Living in the middle of downtown is awesome. There are a lot of things to do, point park makes sure we all take advantage of the city life."
Sophomore,4,"Point Park provides students with a unique opportunity to be downtown in a working environment all while creating unique classes and majors for students to take. While technology is a minor problem in most cases, such as a lack of stable wi-if or good video streaming quality, Point Park provides a great career readiness program and helps put those who attend in better chances to succeed. However, the culture and atmosphere has failed to meet their own claims as the treatment of clubs and majors creates a high school-esque environment with the typical popular kids versus the “losers” but instead of sports or social media determining that status, it is what major you are. Also, the recent rape allegations and the administrations failure to properly protect students and punish others stands out like the yellow seats of Heinz Field."
Junior,4,"The only online classes I have taken so far were ones when covid hit and they sent us home. I do however have an online class next semester. But, the classes I had for covid weren't horrible. After a brief adjustment period things seemed to work out."
Sophomore,4,The teachers were really understanding with due dates and when students were overwhelmed with work they worked things through with the students
Freshman,4,"Point Park is located in downtown Pittsburgh which gives students access to a lot of choices for eating out, shopping, and things to do. The campus itself creates short walking distances from one building to another. It's more of a vertical campus than it is horizontal. There are plenty of things to do both on and off campus, a lot of which is within walking distance."
Alum,4,"Point Park is an overall good school. It is a great choice for a foreign student. Their tuition is reasonable plus they give scholarships even for international students. I felt supported and safe there. After graduation I received a job offer within a month. Academics is good for such liberal arts school; although, I would like to see the science department grow more."
Freshman,4,"The atmosphere downtown is very welcoming, everyone is friendly. The classes aren't super demanding. The only thing I would like to see is more sports teams."
Sophomore,4,"Very diverse and the people are nice, only thing I don't enjoy is the food in their cafe could be better"
Freshman,4,As a dancer my courses and schedule are intensive and are teaching me not only better technique but the more business aspects of dance. I love living in the city.
Freshman,4,As a freshmen I can say that Point Park is a very great school with heavy connections in majority of the majors anyone wants to go into. The University is in the city which is better than most because you're exposed to the real world. It's a fun and great opportunity to go here.
Alum,4,"I would like to give a quick note about the Point Park University campus. With Point Park being in the center of downtown Pittsburgh, students are a small walk from nearly anything one could imagine. Whether it is a store, food, events, or even a good view. The con about this is the Point Park campus is not divided from the city and doesn't have its own parking. If you have a car, you will have to deal with the often packed and expensive street parking or park somewhere cheaper, taking a bus or walking."
Sophomore,4,I love the classes here but the food isn't all that great I would love some better food options. the professors are extremely nice and help you with anything that you need. everyone here is very friendly and nice.
Senior,4,I've had some really great professors here. Some are really helpful and get you prepared for what will happen after college.
Senior,4,What I like about Point Park so much are the professors and staff. They are so friendly! I would probably like to see some of the campus buildings improve.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Point Park has been interesting so far. The staff is nice, the students are nice, and everyone has a genuine smile on their face, like they're happy to be a part of the university's family. That encourages me and ensures I can wake up the next morning to smiling faces and encouraging teachers."
Freshman,4,Good education but the food is awful. I am gluten free so their aren't really that many options.  But as a theatre student I feel it is worth it. The professors are great an d all have the students best intreats at heart.
Freshman,4,I like the professors and the atmosphere. This university has very good classes and the professors take the time to help their students in the class.
Junior,4,"During open house, we met a few staff and professors. Reviewed the university’s safety guidelines and policies. Also had opportunity to speak to upper classmates to ask them questions about academics and student life on campus."
Freshman,4,"Point Park has really good staff that has worked/ is working in the field of your interest. The dining services could improve because the food gets boring. Also, the dining hall's and cafe's hours could be more flexible."
Alum,4,Very good undergraduate and graduate business programs prepare students for a competitive marketplace.   Facilities get better every year and school culture and alumni network are starting to coalesce.  Great to have a quality university in downtown Pittsburgh.
Freshman,4,"It's a very LGBT+ friendly campus with excellent teachers. The food and dorms could be better, but education wise its great."
Sophomore,4,If you are big into athletics this isn't the school for you unless its for sports marketing because there is a lot of internships point park gets you involved in. As a dual athlete with basketball and track I learned that this school is not sport focused .This school however is perfect for Copa students and is extremely diverse and very little judgment between piers.
Sophomore,4,"It good, but it could be better, like more activies for commuters and students that are no longer freshman"
Senior,4,"The professors and students at this school are very invested in their time spent here. The students want to learn, and the professors want to teach. Most professors at this school have real world knowledge and experience, which is a huge asset and very much appreciated. I've been to two other schools since attending Point Park and there is no where else like this school. It is by far the most comfortable place to learn I have ever been."
Sophomore,4,"I love attending Point Park, the classes and very small and the professor know you by a first name base. I love the location of the school and its urban dynamic. The only thing I would like to change about Point Park is that they should have art classes and clubs for non-copa students to participate in or let non-copa student be allowed to participate in copa activityes."
Graduate Student,4,"I've been a student at Point Park for two years now, and I really enjoy being a student here. I have great professor who are super supportive and really take the time to get to know me and my personal interest."
Sophomore,4,I liked that Point Park is such a diverse school with a plethora of clubs and activities. I don’t like how much they try to shove other ideals down your throat.
Sophomore,4,"Point Park has a very diverse and inclusive community. I found it has a very welcoming atmosphere and I enjoy the area. The food is not the best but there are many places to eat that are close to campus since it is in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh. I haven't had any problems with any of my professors, they have all been very helpful. The university offers tutoring which is something that is very useful."
Freshman,4,"Just finished up my first year. It was good. I commute, but I've heard lots of people complain about the housing. Teachers are professionals. Administration could use some work."
Sophomore,4,"Very good school, being a non traditional transfer student, made the transfer easy to do, and very fast acceptance."
Junior,4,The professors are very caring and want to see their students succeed. They will go out of their way to make sure that they are setting their students up for the best opportunity.
Junior,4,"Point Park has amazing faculty and since it's a relatively small but growing campus, the class sizes are perfect. There aren't any lecture halls so there's more one on one time with the professor and most professors are still in their field or have copious amounts of experience in their field. The diversity on campus isn't as diverse as they claim and the food isn't all that great. The campus build upwards since it's in the city but there have been pipe breaks since most buildings are old. The campus has campus police which makes for an extremely safe campus, there is no fear walking around campus at night and there is instant response if a student is in need. The local area is safe, you're more likely to find a good party scene off campus which is unfortunate but it gets you familiar with the city of Pittsburgh. Student life is pretty chill."
Senior,4,"I like it a lot! Just too expensive! Nice variety of courses, nice teachers, nice staff. I really liked everything I went there for"
Niche User,4,"The atmosphere carried good vibes, and was surrounded by very kind people with inspiring things to say. I don't see why this school wouldn't be a fantastic choice for any dedicated student striving for a bright future."
Sophomore,4,"I adore Point Park University. This school has brought me so many wonderful opportunities. The professors are nothing but wonderful. Class sizes are small and it makes it easy to get to know everyone on a first name basis. Academically, the school isn't overly challenging, but PPU gives students a chance for real world experience and application."
Junior,4,"Point Park seems like a great school. Since I live in the Pittsburgh area, it is located conveniently downtown by Market Square. There  is accessible public transportation. I can catch the bus from home straight to school and back.  The college offers a variety of majors within the arts, business, education, culinary,  and  the sciences. I am a science major attending the school so I had to tour the campus. I love the closeness of study halls and the small classes. The campus is diverse and offers a variety of sport activities. I am excited for a great experience at Point Park!"
Sophomore,4,Point Park is in Downtown Pittsburgh and the city is great. Its a walking distance to PNC park and Heinz field. The teachers are all very respectful and nice and everything is very close to the school.
Freshman,4,I love the location of my school. I love right in the heart of the city which creates a lot of opportunities for me to have fun and market myself. Overall lo wish sometimes my professors were more invested in the student. Sometimes personal matters disrupt the flow of academics and having a helpful hand is better than just a listening ear.
Freshman,4,"The education at Point Park University is well rounded and beneficial. The professors have hands on experience in the fields in which they have taught when it comes to Cinema Production. All the needed equipment is also provided along with spacious rooms and work spaces. The city of Pittsburgh is an amazing location to go to college as you can utilize the environment for your many needs. Although the education is good, the few drawbacks is the food is not always great and the staff is lazy. Besides that, I would recommend Point Park University."
Junior,4,"The overall atmosphere of the campus is great! At times it can be frustrating to make a schedule especially if a class is only offered for one time slot, but other than that, they are very commuter friendly and the class sizes are perfect. It fits about 20-25 people per class so you get a real one on one experience."
Sophomore,4,"My experience with this university is amazing. I get to study and hang out with amazing people. The professors here are so kind, helpful, and understanding. The food could be a little bit better, but I still like it here."
College Freshman,4,"Love the air-conditioning in Thayer, don't mind the shower sharing."
College Freshman,4,"I miss home, but I love how passionate everyone is."
College Freshman,4,"I personally am not apart of any athletic sport or activitiy. However, many friends of mine say that they love the sports at our school. I might join one this year. In the past I had no available times to attend."
College Freshman,4,I believe my university has professors that hold your attention for your entire time in class. A lot of them really make an effort for each student to talk and to get to know each other so all students feel like their class is a family.
Recent Alumnus,4,It's a good school. I live off of campus so parking is very expensive. Overall I would still choose to attend.
College Senior,4,Point Park is great for artistic students!
College Junior,4,Point Park offers a great variety of courses to help you get the most experience and exposure you need for the real world.
College Sophomore,4,I've loved it at Point Park University so far.  The dance program here is top notch and allows students to work with experts in this field.  I would definitely choose this school if I could do it all over again.
College Freshman,4,The security on campus is awesome. Yes we are located in a city but I know i can freely walk around and not be afraid.
College Freshman,4,The campus housing is ocnvenient and comfortable. It is close to most classes and the atmosphere is welcoming.
College Freshman,4,Pittsburgh is a beautiful city and the character it brings is so exciting for new students to come and learn.
College Freshman,4,I haven't enter to the university yet but the advisors and staff helping student to enter point park universities have been nice and always helpful towards me when in need something or asking for information.
College Freshman,4,The school is definitely unique.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of work opportunities on campus and off. wether it has something to do with in your feild or just a side job you need to make a little extra money they have it.
College Freshman,4,"the housing is perfect distance from classrooms, and cozy"
College Senior,4,"There are so many internship opportunities right near the school. We get emails daily about new internships or jobs that pop up, and they tell Point Park first because so many people from our school have taken them in the past and it has been successful for them. There are constantly employers posting jobs around campus or even setting up a booth letting students know they are hiring. The career services office puts on several Career Fairs each semester which are so giant that students from other schools attend them too! They are a great opportunity to get your name and face right in front of employers."
College Senior,4,Many of my professors are real professionals in my career and can actually help me with what I want to do for the rest of my life. They really care about me as a person and it really makes going through school all the more worth it.
College Senior,4,"Since Point Park is a vertical campus, everything is very close together which makes living on campus very convenient. And with the sky-bridge that connects Thayer Hall and Lawrence Hall, many Freshmen don't have to go outside to get to many of the school's main areas, including laundry, the Registrar and Financial Aid offices, the mail room, or even the Cafeteria. College dorms are never the best, but I loved living there even as a freshmen. I living in both Thayer and Lawrence, and they were both very livable. Thayer has air conditioning but no private bathrooms, and Lawrence had no air conditioning but private bathrooms. I honestly really enjoyed them both! And if you really hate your roommate, there's always a lot of places to get away to in order to get some work done without having to be in your room."
College Senior,4,"I am not really a big sports fan, but Point Park is perfect for someone who isn't into sports or someone who is into them. We don't have football, but we have basketball, baseball, softball, rugby, soccer, and even cheerleaders. If you want to get involved in either playing or spectating a sport, the opportunities are abundant, but if you aren't so into them, there also isn't an overbearing focus on them, which makes it the perfect middle-ground for both sides of the coin."
College Sophomore,4,"I did have one teacherthat obviously only cared about getting their quota in for grades as far as students go (he took test questions straight from wikipedia, Used the study guid as the test and left the room for 10 minutes during our final exam) but other than that all my teachers have seemed to really care about each and everyone of us getting good grades and if we didn't  then they would do everything in their power to try to help us."
Alum,2,Do notbhep much with careers nor job placement support bbn or direction their Homeland Security Program. My son graduated as tedvtwo years ago with a degree in homeland security and national intelligence and cant get BBC a job in M his field. They never offered him opportunities via job referrals and internships. He has a 4 bgg year degree and hasn't heard one word of support or encouragement from t hff e department head. Many students like him have very little support post graduation.nor job opportunities their senior or junior year. The school will n.v take your money and even offer scholarships p.o switch no doors for jobs for college graduates in Homeland Security and N as tion as Intelligence.
Alum,2,Dies not support students with careers for graduation and opportunities for jobs. My son nd daughter graduated from this school and struggled to get jobs in their field. My son m.j is still looking and has a degree in homeland Security and National Intelligence. All they do is take your money or maybe give you a grant or a scholarship. But in the end you'll be graduating walking down the hour with no offer of employment inside and no support from the career development office that's supposed to be there for students and provide them with opportunities like internships and on-the-job training and/or employment in Homeland security and National Intelligence. My daughter has a degree in journalism and communication and never ever got any support from the school after graduation. She had to find her own job and secure her own internship. I think the school just take your money and then after that you are on your own.
Sophomore,2,"Point Park university has the potential to be great. However, the diversity within the faculty, racially needs to improvement. 
The communication between administration and students needs improvement.

If you are a person of color and are looking into Point Park as a school, keep in mind that you will be in the minority and there will not be many students who as also people of color, in fact only about 14% of students are of color out of the entire school population. 

lastly, if you are a preforming arts student, this school HEAVILY focuses and prioritizes students of the preforming arts. However, if you are not intended on that direction for you major, you will NOT be prioritized in any way. And will feel as if the Preforming Arts department are more valued."
Freshman,2,"Unless you're a COPA student, don't expect much. Classes go up to three hours long and are only held once a week, professors are monotone and uncaring in their lectures, and little guidance is given to students in smaller majors. Freshman housing is less than adequate. Living in Lawrence hall you will see a few mice and roaches, as well as scorching heat during the first few weeks of the fall semester. Dorm rooms are small, but do have the advantage of a private bathroom. The food is inedible unless a tour is happening on that day where potential students will be invited to eat in the dining hall. Those with dietary restrictions are almost never taken into consideration, and the food is often stale, cold, or spoiled. the only reason I would give Point Park 2 stars is because COPA students do get a valuable education, but if you're going for any other major, just don't."
Freshman,2,"After about a semester and a half here I'm ready to transfer. As a film major, I'm particularly disappointed in the classes as I came ready to be challenged, learn new things and make productions but instead found myself in a bunch of beginner/introductory classes that seem to bore me. A semester and a half in and I haven't even made a single video. The professors seem knowledgeable and have some pretty neat backgrounds however the classes just dont reflect that. Being a commuter as well surely does not help as there is no campus parking, free parking in general downtown, and public transportation is not free for PPU students like most of the surrounding Pittsburgh schools have.... a huge disappointment and cost. Living on campus does not seem worth the money at all to be honest, however the other students are all very accepting and nice making the experience a tad better."
Niche User,2,Don't go to PPU if you're interested in ballet. It's a generic ballet class you can pay for at Millennium which just opened up. About 45 minutes from campus. Go to PPU if you're interested in Musical theatre. Phenomenal talents and faculty. I guess the best dance concentration is jazz. Mainly because there are a lot of alumni that graduated with a jazz bfa. I like the community but I regret going here for dance
Niche User,2,"Very displeased with the dance conservatory! My daughter got injured with a knee injury and no physical therapy was provided! Didn't call or anything! She has to wait to heal so she can get back dancing. Now she sits in classes for hours a day!  She enjoys the program because of friends who attended before her (juniors. She's a sophomore) but after this, the faculty left a bad taste in my mouth."
Freshman,2,"When I first enrolled into PPU I was so excited. I knew lots of dancers and MT majors, but going into my sophomore year im very disappointed. It feels like high school. At first, I thought I could just stay with the dancers but it gets old very quickly. Yes, it's in a safe city but everything closes at 6 pm and we're still rehearsal. We'd have to commute far distances to get something relatively healthy at 11 at night because the dining hall is not good at all. The studios are beautiful and I love a couple of the faculty but the conservatory program isn't what they seem to be. It seems point park has been declining through the years. They also don't have levels. It's just the whole concentration in one class. They accept a lot of dancers who just have potential but no rigor previous training. My first year felt like they were teaching half the class how to dance. On the good note, we got a lot of audition opportunities but freshmen are usually overlooked by faculty."
Sophomore,2,The politics of the school often bleed into the educational environment making it very difficult to feel in control of your education. Administration seems to be more concerned with money than they do their student's education.
Freshman,2,"I am a student in the photography department at Point Park.  There is definitely a lot more emphasis placed on COPA majors as well as broadcasting.  There are also a lot of unnecessary courses that are part of Point Park's core curriculum.  As a photo student, I really expected a more arts-focused curriculum, considering that Point Park is known to be a arts-oriented school.  Planning on transferring after this semester."
College Junior,2,"The university should consider upgrading the rooms.  Also, Lawrence needs air conditioning."
College Junior,2,It is not a school for the athlete.  The support is minimal and not heard of.
College Sophomore,2,Point Park doesnt have high review for jobs
College Freshman,2,"The career center will help you if you reach out, but I'm honestly beginning to think that a degree from Point Park means absolutely nothing."
College Freshman,2,"There are pretty much no courses offered, the professors are extremely loose with grading, but the class sizes are relatively small."
College Freshman,2,"We don't have a football team, our basketball team sucks, and soccer and volleyball teams do moderately well."
College Freshman,2,"Everyone here complains. And unless you are a performing arts conservatory member, it's easy to see why. From the condition of the residence halls, to the quality of the food, to the absolute ease of every class I've taken here, it's hard to believe this is a real college."
College Junior,2,Some of the professors OK but I just don't like the school there's no sense of unity know where to have fun tell him to bond with
College Junior,2,Greek life could give a boost to the culture of the school
College Junior,2,"Each day here I think about how much I hate the school. My experience as an undergrad at slippery rock was way better than the school, not to mention how much better the facilities and campus and people are"
College Freshman,2,They need to come up with more healthy options to eat. The majority of food options are fried and those that are healthy are not fresh.
College Junior,2,We don't really have Greek life at our University. It's not a big thing on this campus.
College Junior,2,"Point Park's Dining Services is awful. This is the one thing I do not like at the university. Although some of the workers are very nice and try their best to accomodate students, the food is awful. Sometimes, the grease is not changed giving the food a bad taste. Other times, food services runs out of supplies thus leaving students with limited options. They have, however, shifted to offering more healthy options for students, especially in the Point Cafe. Another problem is that food is only good when perspective students and their parents come to see the school. It's not fair to the students who attend the school."
College Freshman,2,Noise can get out of control and nothing is done about it.
College Freshman,2,"You have to choose between no air conditioning with your own bathroom or a community bathroom but with ac. If you choose to have your own bathroom you also get overhead lighting and carpeting. If you choose ac, then you do not have lights or carpet."
College Freshman,2,This school does not have the major that I want and no matter who I talk to no one will help me either figure out something else or find a school who has what I want to really do.
College Junior,2,"Downtown Pittsburgh is a business town, so almost everything closes around 5 PM and isnt open on the weekends. You have to leave the city to find places and things that are still open at night."
College Junior,2,"Point Park is not much of a party school... if you want a nice party school, then you should go to Pitt."
College Sophomore,2,You really cant park on campus without paying.
College Sophomore,2,"The dinning is hall is really terrible. However, the Point Cafe is fine, that is until you get tired of eating chicken fingers and grilled cheese twice a day everyday for five months."
College Sophomore,2,"This past winter was terrible. Everyone was so depressed and bored because it was gloomy outside. Even the little bit of green we have in the city was gray and dead. It was pretty sad with everyone staying in the dorms, and of course things hit the fan in terms of drama with everyone being cooped up for months."
College Freshman,2,"The school is a private school so the cost is very high, the financial aid is not enough to really help cover tuition."
College Junior,2,I hate the classes here
College Sophomore,2,"I don't drive, but from my classmates they say its hard finding parking downtown, free parking."
College Sophomore,2,"It is almost impossible to connect to the wifi. Once you do get connected, it's very slow. The printers are always out of paper, and numerous students print things at once. The labs are often very busy."
College Sophomore,2,Students can virtually find a way to get away with doing anything on campus. Especially since the school is located in the city and not separated into its own campus.
College Sophomore,2,"During the fall and spring, I enjoy Pittsburgh, but during the winter everyone gets depressed. The winters are way too long and cold here."
College Sophomore,2,The parties are not really parties.. Its not like a typical college experience
College Freshman,2,"Varsity sports generally aren't that important. The gym isn't really anything great, either."
College Senior,2,No one pays attention to sports.
College Senior,2,"Computer labs are excellent because you can always find one and a computer will be available. Printing on the other hand, NO. We used to have more money to be able to print but they've cut that in half. Wifi....I don't even know why 

Point Park has it because it doesnt work. Depending on the weather, the internet can be average or super slow. Never fast though so don't expect that."
College Senior,2,"I should have listened when I was warned about coming to Point Park for biotechnology. While the professors are knowledgeable and passionate about what they teach, the school pretty much gives this major the short end of the stick. Because there are not many students enrolled in this program, some classes are cancelled for the semester due to low enrollement or there are classes that are not offered for several semesters in a row, preventing people from graduating on time and by the time you realize you've been screwed, it's too late because you are so far in the program and taken so many classes that if you went else where, you'd just have to take more which means you'll be in school for even longer. Point incase, do NOT come here for biotech. You'll only end up being EXTREMELY ticked off with the lack of everything for this program."
College Freshman,2,It was -2 degrees one day and school shut down because of it.
College Senior,2,"Pittsburgh weather is the worst. It's either snowing, raining, or super hot."
College Freshman,2,"The internet is slow, and the dorms are wired. If you do get into a wireless zone, it takes forever to log in and the internet is sooooooo slow. But we have nice desktops in our labs - both Mac and PCs."
College Freshman,2,Its bad it can go from 70 and sunny to 30 and hailing in an hour. 
College Senior,2,"I heard about bugs, and the elevators are always broke or full. 
"
College Senior,2,"Although there are a lot of Cultural events, it costs money to go to them. There aren't many stores to shop at in town, so that blows. The bus system is terrible, and it can be expensive and time-consuming to go to the better shopping areas off campus. The nightlife isn't that great either; you see the same people all the time. Again, the lack of transportation is responsible for this. Crime is like any average metropolitan city, you better be careful!"
College Senior,2,"Food quality is poor. The cafes run out of stock of popular items, the staff is extremely unfriendly, and the quantity is not worth the amount we pay for the services."
College Senior,2,Very poor academics. Professors are mostly poor quality instructors.
College Senior,2,There's a federal lawsuit there...
College Junior,2,"The price is very expensive for students living on campus, but it's expected since it is downtown living. "
College Freshman,2,"The taxis are completely unreliable; I ended up stuck somewhere until 3 in the morning waiting for a taxi to arrive. The bus schedule is difficult to follow, especially if you are new to the city. Additionally, the buses do not often arrive at their scheduled times.  The campus shuttles are easily accessible, but only run until midnight every night, including weekends, and do not have a large amount of choices as to where they take you. Overall, public transportation/Point Park transportation is not great."
College Sophomore,2,"We have a campus shuttle that most people use from a specific area, but other than that, most people walk or take the bus."
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you decide not to take a bus (which is reasonable- they don't go everywhere, and the hours aren't the best), then you'd better be willing to drop a lot of cash to park at one of the numerous parking garages around the city! Many are close to campus- which is great- but the price is ridiculous."
College Sophomore,2,"It is very gray in Pittsburgh most of the time, which makes it difficult in wanting to go outside or go to class. Class was cancelled several times last year, which was highly celebrated with sleep."
College Sophomore,2,"Because the school is downtown, there are many apartments that are available, and couple of them can be affordable with a roommate. There is cheap housing that is further away from the school in Oakland, but you have to commute longer to get to school everyday."
College Sophomore,2,"I have never heard of Seton Hill's athletics winning anything, to be honest.  The players tend to be rude and not pay attention in class, and they rarely have any wins to show for it.  The lacrosse incident shows that Seton Hill has a strong sense of community.  But that does not influence the team's successes."
College Junior,2,"Point Park has yet to make a deal with the public transportation system in pittsburgh. Which is upsetting to alot of students. We do pay a dollar less on weekends, but that doesnt compare to the bus passes that are offered at neighboring schools, like Pitt for example. We do have a shuttle system, but honesly, it isnt run very efficiently. Shuttles rarely follow there 15 minute wait schedule, and drivers tend to take smoke breaks on the regular. which causes to students to be late for classes, rehearsals, and interviews. It could use some improvement."
College Junior,2,"Honestly, there arent that many sororities at Point Park. Point Park is dominated mostly by COPA, which is the conversatory for the performing arts. That in itself is a sorority of sorts. Dominated by film, photography, and performance majors. I sure there are a couple of sororites, but they don't have alot of influence at Point Park."
Junior,1,"Recently appealed grading. School up held teachers error.. claimed assignments were weighted incorrectly.. online Schoology showed B, recieved C on transcript. I was 1.74 points short of a b claims instructor.. Unorganized.. Not in favor of students.. bad overall experience.. even in getting all of my credits transferred. Terrible"

Alum,1,"I know so many people who dipped after one year because it’s just not it, including myself. The education is elementary. You don’t actually learn anything. Horrible, wish I never committed there in the first place"
Niche User,1,"My only comment about my experience with Point Park University is, Ripped-Off of $21,036!

PPU had a capstone program, my case was the Saturday Fast Business program.  About 2/3rds of the way through this program, I ran out of money to attend, so I took about 5 years off.  In that time, not knowing that AIP lost its accreditation and that PPU canceled its capstone programs, I reapplied to finish this degree.  At that time I learned that my formerly accepted credits would not be accepted and the Saturday Fast program no longer existed.  I was told that I would have to essentially start over, as a Sophomore.  Added up I would have to spend over $40,000, on top of the already spent $21,036 to complete this degree!  It would literally take me 6 years to achieved an undergraduate degree from Point Park...feels really dirty and unethical, ultimately a complete waste of time and money.

Be carful what you put your money into here, things can and will change without notice."
Freshman,1,"This school is very racist  and does not give two shits about your major unless you are copa. They do have excellent professors though, that is the only good thing but does not mask the lack of diversity in students and faculty. Along with horrible classes for your major, don't even think about coming here"
Freshman,1,"The dance program isn't all that. Unless you're from here and know faculty or were a competition dancer, this school is not for you. Attending their tour and researching their facility and program,  I loved the studios but the training at PPU is terribly weak. Classes are too big because they don't have placement levels. Your whole graduating class are ALL in the same class. I will say, the dance teachers are nice but generally have terrible training for COPA students. Wouldn't recommend."
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,"School is not very welcoming, along with classes being very self taught and if you wanna be an athlete, better start practicing on your own, not too much of that happens while being here."
College Freshman,1,"If you are not a performing arts major, Point Park is an absolute joke. I do not feel confident that a degree from here holds any value, and it is painfully easy to get into. The academics section on here says it scored a B, but a D is a better score. I am looking to transfer at the end of this semester. There is no greek life, no party life because you have to go to other schools in Oakland, food options are bad and I am not a picky eater, professors are hit or miss, not a real college campus, and if you are not performing arts they all judge you as a subordinate. The classes here are terrible and upperclassmen agree. There is a reason the retention rate is bad. The only good thing is the area because downtown Pittsburgh is nice. In a few months I have already encountered numerous situations where people and future employers do not take Point Park seriously. Do not go here! The only thing longer than the lines for food is the line to transfer."
College Freshman,1,There is no 'party scene.' You have to go to another campus to get to a party.
College Sophomore,1,I wish we had Greek Life. I want to pledge but I can't because there are no chapters.
College Freshman,1,"we have no greek live here at point park, the closest thing to having it would be Pitts greek life and thats not even ours."
College Freshman,1,It is a performing arts school. We do not even have football. I wish we had sports.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no on campus parking. Parking in Oakland is slim to none and expensive, unless you live in Oakland and have a parking pass then street parking is free but hard to find. Parking down town is expensive and hard to find. The parking meters that are near the school only allow a 2 hour limit."
College Freshman,1,The winter never ends… we all have seasonal depression… we are happier when the weather is nice which is rare!
College Sophomore,1,"Point Park does not offer free bus fare like many other schools do, so many people drive. It is extremely expensive to park, but there are plenty of garages and lots around."
College Sophomore,1,"Sports are unheard of. Nobody pays attention to them. Since the majority of the school commutes, nobody stays around after classes to participate in extracurricular clubs."
College Freshman,1,we do not have greek life
College Freshman,1,No wifi in the dorm room is really annoying when you have an ipad or iphone and do not have unlimited data.
College Senior,1,"Rain, snow, or cold...that's the other three seasons. Summers are rainy and hot. NOT a good combination for those who want to go swimming or sunning."
College Senior,1,"It's hard to get a spot, and it's expensive to park in town. The meter system is horrible, and you WILL get a ticket. The garages fill up fast, so I don't even try it."
College Freshman,1,"As an ex-worker with the dining services and a current student, our dining hall and cafe are awful. There are several hours during the week when there is absolutely no food provided by the campus. When we do have food it is often leftovers from days before and it is very apparent. The food has very often made people sick."
College Senior,1,Need to come up with something better for students.
College Junior,1,There are not any fraternity or sorority available. 
College Senior,1,"If you like the rain, then this is the place for you. Pittsburgh gets a LOT of rain, so your summers are WASTED. I had a summer pass to Sandcastle (local water park), and could barely use it due to the horrible weather."
College Senior,1,"They actually do not give out software, which they do at other universities. That's another cost you better take into consideration. The labs are TERRIBLE; you hardly ever find a working printer. Further, you have to PAY to print items after you use up your pre-set limit; I feel that should be free, too. In order for them to become copmpetitive in the collegiate community, they need to step their game up."
College Senior,1,"Most of the other local universities include a Port Authority bus pass in their tuition, so you can get around, but Point Park has dropped the ball on this one. As a commuter, it is really unfair that I have to spend 1,000 per year on transportation. ESPECIALLY when the tuition is already  really high!"
College Senior,1,"Downtown Pittsburgh closes early, so there is NOTHING to do in the evenings."
College Freshman,1,"The computers at Point Park are awful. In the dorms, there is no WiFi and an Ethernet cable has to be used, which is extremely inconvenient. The computer labs are extremely slow, and I have not had a single decent experience using the 24 hour computer lab to print."
College Freshman,1,"If you are looking for any sort of Nightlife, do not go to Point Park. The only place to go and party is Oakland, and shuttles stop running to and from at midnight. Everything around Point Park closes at 6 pm. I'm sure the nightlife is fine for 21 and older, but until then, it is completely nonexistent."
College Freshman,1,"The local atmosphere is terrible. Everything around campus closes at 6 pm, providing nothing to do on the weekends."
College Sophomore,1,"The school is downtown, so there is very limited parking. The parking here is expensive as well. Most people take the bus or walk"
Recent Alumnus,1,"If you decide not to take a bus (which is reasonable- they don't go everywhere, and the hours aren't the best), then you'd better be willing to drop a lot of cash to park at one of the numerous parking garages around the city! Many are close to campus- which is great- but the price is ridiculous."
College Junior,1,"Because of my married status and I have no children the only option they gave me for scholarship is fastweb and college prowler, I've applied for many scholarships (even though I am not eligible for much) I have yet to receive anything."
College Freshman,1,"I am not a big fan of the dining options here at Point Park. I usually eat off campus. The only thing that I like is the meal exchange at the Café. However, you can only do that after four. The cafeteria isn't bad food it just isn't my cup of tea so to speak."
College Freshman,1,"There is no provided parking and the cost to park on the street or in a garage is ridiculous. Living on campus is much easier because there is no need for a car- you can walk, take a bus or a Point Park shuttle just about anywhere you need to go."
College Freshman,1,"The food here is generally terrible. Recently, we acquired a new chef and the program is changing. But, there are more unhealthy options than healthy and the food begins to taste the same after awhile. The salad bar is generally not very fresh either. Don't let the advertising for the food fool you. But don't let it be your deciding factor either."
College Junior,1,There is no parking. Lot parking is expensive and are full midday. For a school that is mostly commuters this is very frustrating.
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is nonexistent. We are an urban campus that is still growing. Unfortunately we are also downtown which creates a parking nightmare. Parking is available very close to campus which is convenient but also pricey. Hopefully in the next couple of years Point Park will build their own student parking lot. Until then students are stuck commuting on Pat Authority busses, or leasing a spot for $300.00 a month. Though once you're on campus you have no need for a car."
Recent Alumnus,1,It is very difficult to park downt town and you will find your self coming out your pocket when it comes to meters and parking garages

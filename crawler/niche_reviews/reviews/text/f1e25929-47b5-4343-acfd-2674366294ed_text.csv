Senior,5,"Online classes were easy, and very reliable and put together. The teachers are always there to answer any questions that you may have."
Senior,5,"Bryan College of Health Sciences is such an amazing college. The smaller class sizes and it being a small college lets you build long lasting relationships. Instructors and the President of the college know your name. It is like a family. Plus, it being attached to the hospital gives you amazing clinical experiences that most colleges cannot have. This college also has a 100% passing rate on the NCLEX. The college staff care about you!"

College Junior,5,"I have learned so much already at this school. It's awesome because the school is directly affiliated with Bryan Health Hospital. All of the employees at Bryan Health are familiar with the college, and I have had all good experiences with the staff. The instructors at Bryan are even better. There have been days where I have needed to speak with an instructor just to keep myself sane. They are all so encouraging and welcoming."
College Sophomore,5,"I have a previous degree.  One class the school required me to take was ""Nutrition"" and I had previously taken that as a requirement for my previous degree.  I filed a petition asking that I be relieved from taking the class and it was accepted, so I no longer had to take the class and they accepted my class as transfer credit."
College Sophomore,5,"Registering for classes is a breeze, as you literally will sit down with your advisor and put together your schedule.  Instead of spending hours trying to get into certain classes or figuring out your schedule, the whole registration time takes maybe fifteen minutes."
College Sophomore,5,"Every few months we have a job fair on campus, which gives students the opportunities to apply for jobs on the spot.  The hospital really ""takes care"" of their students, as many of the newly graduates find themselves working for the hospital."
College Sophomore,5,"The coursework is tough and demanding, but that is expected with any degree.  The professors are incredible.  They truly want to see you succeed and are there to answer any questions about anything.  Some professors even talk about their families in class, which makes them all the more personable."
College Sophomore,5,"Every few months, there is a career fair on campus to provide students with opportunities to apply for jobs before they graduate.

College Junior,5,It is a great school to attend. The number of clinical hours and resources available to you in order to better yourself for the healthcare field are amazing.
College Junior,5,"Bryan is a great school to attend! I am in the Biomedical Sciences program, and I absolutely love it. It is a smaller school, which gives you the opportunity to get to know your professors on a more personal level. There is never a day when I walk in to school and a faculty member doesn't greet me by name. It is a great college to go to with more to offer than just a great education. It offers you a home away from home that helps to shape you in to an honorable student and a admirable person."
College Sophomore,5,The Academics offered are the best around in regards to the Science and Health related fields. The classes are very small and there is the opportunity for a lot of one on one communication between students and instructors.

College Freshman,5,"Bryan is a health college, and i am currently majoring in nursing. Classes can be tough, but I leave with a lot of new knowledge. All my electives are health orientated which is great, because i can apply them to my career. I would say the workload is about average for a college, and we are connected to the hospital which i think is sort of cool."
Sophomore,4,"Bryan College of Health Sciences is more geared towards the academic side of college. There are no dorms, no place for just students, or very many activities for students. The academic side of things is great and why I chose Bryan. The professors have worked in the same field, have the knowledge and will help you learn it too. There are a lot of opportunities and experiences offered here."
Sophomore,4,"The academics are excellent and the professors truly care about the students. All of the campus staff are welcoming and the atmosphere makes you want to learn and do great things. I think that the school could improve on helping students find housing. Bryan doesn't have dorms or agreements with other schools to rent dorms. They simply hand you a list of very expensive apartments in the city and tell you good luck, figure it out."
Junior,4,I really enjoy attending this college.  The students and faculty are really great and you always see smiling faces when you are on campus.
College Freshman,4,"Classes are flexible and professors are helpful. If you are not able to attend your scheduled class, professors will often allow you to come to a later or earlier class."
College Freshman,4,"The work load for online courses are manageable, but more difficult when many are taken."

College Freshman,4,"I am majoring in nursing science. There is a lot of work, but it is all for my benefit."

After knowing I've passed classes it gives me extra confidence to continue on with the program. It is very tough and it is important to rely on your peers to help you get through. The program at Bryan is well laid out and the progression allows for the best learning.
College Junior,4,The professors work with the students on a one on one basis and it allows for increased learning. They care about their students education and are willing to interrupt their schedule to help us. It's a great school and I highly recommend attending.

College Freshman,4,I am very pleased with my school. They do a wonderful job making me feel welcomed and I know I am getting a world-class education.
College Sophomore,4,"The classes are somewhat flexible, and the faculty is understanding when you have to miss class or have to leave early. Transferring my credits was easy and was able to become advanced placed when first starting there."
College Sophomore,4,"My experience at this school has been great. I feel like I have learned a lot already and I know I will continue to learn more. My favorite experience thus far is the skills lab classes that we have were we perform different procedures that we will be doing as nurses. If I could do it all over again I would choose this school again, now that I am attending there I couldn't see myself going anywhere else."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors have done research on how some students learn the best, so they try and alternate their lectures, sometimes into group activities and others with power point lectures. There are a variety of different courses offered in order to meet student's needs. The class sizes are somewhat large but the skills labs are small so that the professors can have more one to one with students."
College Sophomore,4,"The value of a degree from this school is high. This school is a well known school and known for their academics and the qualified nurses that have come from this college, so the chance of getting a job after graduating will be high. Jobs look at where you received your education and training and seeing a highly accredited school can mean a lot."
College Sophomore,4,"There are many students from different cultures and everyone that I have had the experience of being around is accepting of everyone regardless of ethnicity, gender, race, religion, etc. I cannot give a description of a typical student because all of us are different, the student body is made up of different ages, ethnicities, and races. I have not see any challenges in regards to diversity, our college, in fact is helping us to be more culturally competent, and aware of different cultures."
College Sophomore,4,"The education that I am receiving is worth the tuition that I paid, my experience thus far has been amazing and I have learned so much in the short time I have been there. The financial aid office was very helpful in informing about taking out private loans to cover the rest of my tuition and whenever I had a question they had the knowledge and could give me the information that I needed."
College Sophomore,4,I haven't gotten that far into my program to know a lot about that yet.
College Sophomore,4,"The clinical hours that is required for my program is why I chose my college, I feel that by having so many clinical hours it will allow me to gain the experience I need when I graduate and find employment. The workload a my college is quite a bit but the resources that they provide help to ease the workload and not make it seem so much. Job opportunities are wonderful at my college, they allow you to be employed there while you are going to school so that you can gain experience and allow you to somewhat practice in the field that you are going to be going into."
College Sophomore,4,"The academics offered are wonderful. The faculty educate you in every aspect of your program, the curriculum is well organized and ties all of our classes together.  The class registration process is easy because an advisor helps you with what classes need to be taken and can help find times and the schedule that is right for you. They provide tutors free of cost to students that are struggling with certain classes because they want to see you succeed in your program of study."
College Sophomore,4,"The library is very helpful whenever you need help finding a book, citing sources, etc. The student writing center is very helpful in helping someone with writing their papers. The faculty at the college is more than willing to spend extra time to assist you in whatever you may be having trouble with in your education."
College Sophomore,4,"All my classes are Monday through Friday, usually during 8-5pm but labs can go as late as 8pm."
College Sophomore,4,What makes Bryan unique is its commitment to the quality of not only the courses offered but also admitting the right students who possess the skills needed to succeed at this school.

College Junior,4,"Online classes are very convenient because of the flexibility of when you want to study and you decide your own hours. Professors will still contact you, help you, and answer questions via email or face-to-face."
College Junior,4,Because mostly girls/women study nursing this school has a majority of girls with guys being the minority.
College Junior,4,"There are times where representatives come from different places and are able to talk to them about any questions, possible job opportunities and other things related to careers and the jobs available out there."
College Junior,4,"There are many resources available to students most of the time. Resources such as Student Success Center, personal peer tutors, and the writing center are my personal favorite."
College Junior,4,"They require you to take some unnecessary and quite pointless courses, but the ones that count have good content and make you think critically."
College Junior,4,"Bryan has a great campus and access to both medical centers associated with the college. Absolutely all of the faculty and college staff know the students. Though pricey, Bryan gives you a clinical based education that is worth every penny. The only things that are lacking are athletic centers and available resources like a gym for students to attend."
College Senior,4,Most of the students are friendly and outgoing. They are a team always willing to help out classmates/each other. There are different activities from sports groups to church groups that all are welcoming.
College Senior,4,"The majority of administration is willing to help you. They also take time to get to know you on a personal level, which makes you feel less like just a number."
College Freshman,4,It's a fantastic school for anyone who is interested in the medical field.
College Freshman,4,The field is the number 1 most in demand and the staff want to make sure that you have a job lined up before you graduate.

College Freshman,4,Some of the best and most knowledgeable staff and the MOST clinical hours of any nursing school in the state of Nebraska.
College Freshman,4,Most of the courses will NOT be online but those that are are every bit as valid and cared about as those offline.  You will experience this if you try one.
College Freshman,4,"It's small and non-traditional if you're looking at a bigger campus.  This doesn't mean it's bad, it only means that it's probably not what most are expecting.

The instructors and faculty are top-notch and care greatly for the students and want every single person to succeed."
College Sophomore,4,"We don't have a really good athletic option, but the library, student center, and activities options are good."
College Sophomore,4,"Or wireless can be iffy sometimes, that that happens. or Tec support is always available. "
College Sophomore,4,"We are all driven towards a the same goal of a BSN degree, so we all work together to get there."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't get any Financial Aid because it's a smaller school, and they are focused on helping other, more needy, students get in. But The tuition and financial aid staff are wonderful."
College Junior,4,"I am in the nursing program, and it is a hard programs, but it's suppose to be hard. The workload is hard and they give you assignments that are tedious and unrelated to the major. Clinical experience is great"
College Junior,4,"Tuition is still expensive, but not as expensive as other private schools. "
College Junior,4,"The majority of students are nursing students. The majority of students are female white, followed by male white, the the diverse ethnics. "
College Junior,4,"This is primarily a health college. They just addded the Biomedical major which is good, but if you were looking too double major it would be impossible as a student half way through the program. i"
College Junior,4,"Access to wifi and computers are good. Printing is cheap, even though I believe that if I'm paying 12g's I should be able to print for free. "
College Junior,4,I like working with the faculty. They are very knowledgeable. Clinicals are great and you get the full experience. 
College Junior,4,"Since the college is directly affiliated with the hospital, it's great for internships and networking. Staff and faculty are very helpful, but the academia is very hard, which for nursing should be the norm because you are taking care of patients. The downside to the school is all the rules and ""dress codes"". At any other campus you could probably get away with coming in flannels, but not here. Also clinical uniforms are very scrutinized. "
College Junior,2,"While understandable, they have a tight clinical schedule and core nursing class schedule. This means they have one time specified for those classes and clinicals, which is hard to schedule work, etc around."
College Senior,2,It is a lot of teaching yourself. Instructions are often unclear and grading does not correspond with the rubric or instructions.
College Sophomore,2,"I was not at all impressed with the one online course that I took, hence, I will not take on again if I don't have to."
College Junior,2,"Campus life is okay. There are no dorms, so literally you just come to class and study and that's it. It doesn't always feel like the stereotypical college. There are no athletic programs here, but they do offer health promotion classes. Library times are okay. Any campus activities done have to go through a long process because the college is SO affiliated with the hospital. "

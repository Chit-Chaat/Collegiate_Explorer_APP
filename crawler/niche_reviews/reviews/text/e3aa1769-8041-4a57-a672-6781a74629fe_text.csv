Freshman,5,Professor are active in their office hours. You receive as much support from them and they gladly help you. Just ask for help and they will schedule a day to go over problems you are having.
Freshman,5,I love the way I am informed about everything that is going on at the university even though I am doing online courses. The professors are very committed to their job and I love the atmosphere.
Freshman,5,"Very nice school. It’s has a variety of things to do, and the majors and programs are all great. You’ll feel very comfortable, it’s very homey and you’ll love it. Very diverse and people are very friendly. You’ll enjoy yourself and still love the school environment. It’s not far from central New Jersey where I live so it’s very convenient for me to go home on weekends."
Sophomore,5,"I liked about Felician University was the parties, and also the students in class were very helpful and nice to one another. Everyone was polite, Teachers were very nice. I'm really happy I decided to come here. I've choose a good college and also this Scholarship will help me with my classes and residence life."
Sophomore,5,"I took classes online, The professors were really good. During the pandemic it was very well organized and we were still going with the classes. not once did the professors cancelled class. One of my professors were very nice and extended assignments during the pandemic."
Freshman,5,"The experience at Felician has been amazing. Even with the Global Pandemic occurring the staff still offer us all the assistance they can. During these difficult times they try the best they can to be there for their students and that is greatly appreciated. I don’t believe there is anything I personally would change from the way the school is being run, especially now."
Freshman,5,Due to the pandemic the classes have been run online and I have to say that the way it is being run is amazing. I get even more help now that before. The teachers are doing the best they can and I as the student am learning alot from my classes even online.
Senior,5,Felician University is a wonderful school where I have been provided with many opportunities. This school has taught me so much and allowed me to practice my skills to become a nurse. The nursing resource center is extremely modern and open to students to study anytime. There are two campuses both located in my neighborhood and show the heart of the town. Felician has many resources and tutors that have allowed me to be successful in the program.
Senior,5,"Everyone has adapted to the online experience at Felician. Through the tough times we have all been experiencing, Felician has made the online experience very easy to adapt to."
Graduate Student,5,"Felician university thought me so much about love and friendship. I got to learn more about myself and learn more about what I want to do with my life. It was an experience that I would never would have imagined. Over all, it was one of the best experience in my life. Thanks to my teachers for giving me what I needed and wanted to learned about my future. Now I am on the rise to get my career job, which is nursing."
Freshman,5,My experience at Felician University has been great. Professors are helpful and make the classes interesting. There are many resources to help you if you are struggling in class. Everyone is welcoming and guide you into making the correct choices!
Sophomore,5,I’ve had positive educational as well as sociable experiences at this school. Both campuses are the perfect size for those looking for a smaller and more personable school.
Sophomore,5,My experience at Felician University has been very pleasant because from the beginning the people that work at the school are very helpful and willing to help students succeed with their career. I love how much effort and support everyone gives to the students.
Freshman,5,"Although I haven't started this particular college, I attended an open house in Jan. of 2019 and was delighted at the fact at the class sizes, student to professor ratio, and how nice every single staff member was. I fell in love with the campus and grew to understand why I wanted to attend the university in the fall. As soon as I was accepted I felt my whole body become overwhelmed with joy because not only was the campus beautiful that day I got a small taste of what my future looks like. The faculty deeply cared about the students education and that to me shows true performance of a college or university."
Junior,5,"Felician university is not about being flashy , it’s a humble school with humble kids and professors who really go the extra length to make sure you succeed in getting a proper education. There’s not one day where I don’t get asked how are my classes going , or how is job searching going or even if I ate or not. It shows a lot about what the university is about and I appreciate that dearly. I would really like to see a change in diversity"
Sophomore,5,My experience at Felician University has been great. The teachers are very helpful if you’re struggling in class or don’t understand the lesson they help you out. In my opinion I don’t think anything should  change at Felician University expect for the fact that commuters should be able to have a student meal plan as well as people staying on campus
Junior,5,"It’s a great nice place to study and relax.
 The food in the school and Towns nearby are great. The staff is super nice and understanding and are willing to work with you . It’s the best school I have been too."
Junior,5,"It's a small college but it's very family oriented.
The people here are friendly and the teachers and faculty are helpful."
Senior,5,"This school is so lovely and quaint. It's quiet and small, but has community at the same time. I love the small classes and the closeness of everything from building locations to teacher relationships. They work hard to see the beauty in yourself. The only thing I wish was different was the social aspect. They need more Greek organizations to further expand their reach."
Freshman,5,It's an amazing school with extreme diversity. It is a catholic school yet you are not pushed on religion. This school is open and has two nice and small campuses. It's very rare to get lost unless it's your first day! You'll get a hang of the school shortly after. I enjoy this school and everything about it.
Freshman,5,My experience at Felician University has been going very good so far. Being on the soccer team is fun. I'm glad to be apart of something not many can do. All my professors so far are easy going and are willing to go the extra mile to help me and other students. Class sizes are small which is another plus. I know the Dean of the Business school and the President. Not many other students at other universities can say they know the President or the Dean of Business. Their's not much I would change but if I had to change one thing it would be the school activities. Their are many school activities but no basketball. I love basketball so I wish there were activities for it. Other than that I would not change anything at Felician.
Junior,5,"This school is very flexible with the scheduling, very good at helping you look for classes, and the classes are a great size. Average students per class are about 20-25 students. The professors are very helpful and always offer other ways of helping!"
Sophomore,5,I like that students have easy access to staff to help them with any of the problems they may have. What would make things easier for students is if they offered more courses in the fall and in the spring.Not just certain classes per each semester.
College Sophomore,5,The campus and university in general is an extremely safe enviornment
College Junior,5,"There are students of every race and diversity. No-one is treated differently. There is no judgement and everyone is accepted. Economic background, political beliefs,religion, and/or sexual orientation is strictly confidential. Unless a student wants to talk openly about such subjects. I have not witnessed any prejudice."
College Junior,5,"I, personally have never been approached by drug dealers. Nor have I been offered alcohol. I have not witnessed any criminal activity at this school. There is a very strict professional conduct code and security is strictly enforced. Due to students being more educated today regarding peer pressure and the ill effects of alcohol and drug usage, I think students are more confident not to succumb to such negative influences."
College Junior,5,"Felician college is one of the top rated universities in New Jersey. Job prospects after graduation are excellent. The recruiters are very friendly, efficient and helpful. Internships are readily available to interested parties."
College Junior,5,"The professors are very well educated and explain problems very well and concisely. They are very approachable. Therefore, the students feel free to speak without judgement even if their viewpoints differ. The class size is very small, whereby each student receives personal attention. The equipment and technology is up to date. There is a need for more left handed seats as I am left handed."
College Junior,5,The security on campus is excellent. All students have a criminal background check and are drug tested. I have not witnessed anyone as impaired or inebriated. The Lodi police make frequent rounds. There are security cameras everywhere. It is a very safe environment and non-threatening.
College Junior,5,"Although, I do not live on campus, I've heard nothing but good things about the accommodations. The students are happy and the social atmosphere is good and special. The amenities are very good. It is good value for the cost. Security is top- notch. It is a safe environment to live in."
College Junior,5,"The staff is very helpful and approachable. The students and staff are very mannerly. The class size is small, which allows for personal attention. No question is ""too stupid."" The college has a strict conduct and dress code. I , personally believe that good manners are essential. "" Good manners don't cost anything."" There is no bullying as everyone is very friendly. There is a strong sense of respect. It is a private Catholic college. I've always attended Catholic schools in Ireland and was trained by nuns. Those ""old school,"" values are evident at Felician college."
College Freshman,5,Have accommodated me very well. Helpful around campus. Good campus life.
College Freshman,5,Since Felician is a small school everyone knows each other. The security guards are excellent at their jobs. They actually do their jobs by following the rules and taking action.
College Freshman,5,I love how small most of my classes were. I had a very good connection with most of my teachers. They need who I was and this made me participate more and made learning more easy. The professors always offer to help. They were really into their field which made learning fun.
College Freshman,5,No one judges people here.
College Freshman,5,Everyone is dedicated to what they do. No playing games here.
College Freshman,5,Everyone is smart and sincere so that makes everyone feel safe at my school.
College Freshman,5,I love attending my school. I look forward for the next four years.
College Freshman,5,I am blessed to go to a school that actually helps me get to where I want to be in life.
College Freshman,5,I love it so far!
College Junior,5,It was super easy to get into my program. I submitted all the paperwork listed in the requirements and I was accepted. The admission process is the easiest I have ever had at any college! They get 5 stars for admission. (The best part was that they were friendly and helpful!)
College Student,5,The campus is very strick. You can't do anything not even have a smal get together. You are only allowed 4 person in a room and you can't have any alcohol. After a certain time you can't be noisy and visitors who want to stay over must be the same gender and you have to let them know a head of time.
College Freshman,5,"I had a friend who live off campus during the Spring semester and he said that he saved a lot of money living off campus. Since he is an international student, he prefer to live off campus since the room is cheaper and he can cook his own food. It is not far of a walk from East Rutherford to Rutherford."
Recent Alumnus,5,"With a Catholic college, I expected a lot of the same. I was pleasantly surprised."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The RN to BSN Nursing program was great. We had the same faces throughout the entire program. People ask about you when you're out. They happily communicate what you missed. If you're missing a day with a test/quiz, they are happy to reschedule or have you take it early."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Some professors stick with you more than others. No one was really mediocre. Some went above and beyond to make a good experience for you. Participation is key. Workload can be a little heavy at times depending on how they group your classes, but it's doable. With dedication, papers can be done in 1 night (I encourage a second day closer to the due date for revisions 'cause they always need them). I was never a fan of group projects, but they're not that bad."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I don't recall having any problems. Once you get accepted you have to prove your immunization history and/or titers by a certain date, but other than that everything was fine."
College Senior,5,One thing I can say about Felician College is that they are VERY diverse. Everywhere you turn there is either an exchange student or transfer. Its actually amazing.
College Senior,5,My major is really hard. The classes needed are really hard to get through but the teachers are a great help. The workload is average but HARD.
College Junior,5,Alot of variety atleast within a twenty minute drive or walk.
College Senior,5,I have not seen anything in my years at Felician
College Senior,5,I love the Criminal Justice Program. I cannot complain I have learned so much.
College Senior,5,They welcome diversity. I love it.
College Junior,5,"Felician College is very diverse. The people that you encounter come from different parts of the world. You meet a new person every semester. Eveyone is very friendly and open to learning about your ethnicity, culture, and backround."
College Sophomore,5,There is a large variety of males/females. There is such an abundance of diversity. You literally meet someone  new everyday. The boys are mostly athletes which make it all the more better and the girls are also.
College Junior,5,"Friendly professors, very warm atmosphere,"
College Freshman,5,Felician is a Dry Campus. So there are little to no alcohol and no drugs at all.
College Senior,5,Financial helps alot....jus fill application and provide required documents. You will get decent amount of financial aid.
College Junior,5,There are cameras in the parking lot along with 24 hr security staff. Both campuses are surrounded by nice neighborhoods.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Excellent! Clean, neat and helpful. Hours are convenient."
Junior,4,I like the small class sizes and every student there seems eager and determined to learn. The professors are able to focus on each student and really provide better teaching. There is a great community feeling here.
Junior,4,The online experience is pretty good. With this pandemic I feel like Felician adapted really well and made the best out of the current situation. I can really see that the administrators at Felician really care about the students.
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed the fact that the classes were small and the facilities were clean. The atmosphere was of a productive campus.
Niche User,4,"Through several hours of research through college planning, as well as mandatory school virtual tours by our high school,  Felician University ranks on the top tier list of universities for students for higher level education."
Sophomore,4,"I love the school environment, the friendly attitude of the staffs (They are so wonderful, accommodating and nice). And also, the school is among the safest in the States 🙂"
Junior,4,I love the people who make up Felicians community. I would like to see more consistency among classes in terms of what is learned in curriculum.
Freshman,4,Felician university is located in new jersey offers a vast majority of majors and minor. I was very impressed with the accelerated bachelor of science program in nursing online. That is why i applied and got accepted my advisor was great walk time to make sure i had all the documents i need to start
Sophomore,4,my experience at felician was very enjoyable. I love all the different types of activities they have on campus and the leaders who interact with the students also. they have a friendlier background.
Senior,4,"It is a great university. All the professors are extremely helpful and involved in helping students succeed. There is a very diverse group of students, which makes the school feel welcoming to all."
Niche User,4,"Felician university is a very good school it has small classrooms, lots of clubs you can join, and a close knit community. Things that could be improved is the food on the campus where students dorm. There needs to be more activities targeted for young adults and they should get input from the students attending on what could improve their experience."
Sophomore,4,"Felician University was one of my first choices when applying to colleges. I was very nervous entering my first year as a freshman. Once my first day of the classes were over I realized how quickly I had adjusted to the school. I love how small the campus is and also how close it is to my house. The teachers really care for their students, and the staff is always there to help."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Felician is that, the professors challenge you to do better within every set goal you wish to accomplish."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, Felician seems just like high school but from experience from upper classmen says other wise. The philanthropy and culture are very respectable. The campus gives off a safe vibe."
Sophomore,4,i have been there for two semester so far. the teachers very good and care about you and want to help you succeed. it is very pricy and look wise not the best campus.
Niche User,4,"Nursing program...  hard program and rightfully so.  Big issue I have is the weight of the  HESI for your final grade.  You can bust your butt all semester... give 200% +, have an 85+ grade going into the HESI, and flunk out of the program.   Sophomore year it's 30% and junior year it's 40% of your final grade.  Worse yet, material on the exam isn't not what your professor(s) prepared you for.  The ""blueprint"" for exam is a joke too.  Frustrating because you know you will be a great nurse, you know you are a great nursing student, you know you couldn't have studied any harder for the HESI, then BAM, they stab you in the back."
Freshman,4,"I feel like most of the professors are down to earth and willing to help if you need it.  Campus life, everyone gets along. I would strongly suggest to have the same food at Rutherford as you do in Lodi."
Senior,4,I love Felician College because it gave second chance in life and this time I want to make it life. I love the small size classes compared to other big colleges and also you can have one on one with your professor.
Sophomore,4,"Yes this is an expensive school, but your education is a huge investment for YOUR future! Help is always there, YOU have to look for it because we cannot be spoon fed everything. This is a medium sized university it used to be small, but Felician has grown in numbers. Since Felician is growing, they also have a new dean in the school of business, Robert Evans, someone who worked in the corporate world, with no education background, is helping bring companies to Felician to have students meet with."
College Student,4,"I feel extremely safe walking around campus. Since it is a relatively smaller campus, you are rarely ever walking alone and somebody is always near by just in case something were to happen. Also, the security office is always monitoring."
College Student,4,"So far, college has been great. It's all a new experience which can sometimes be overwhelming but I feel like I was spoiled and everything seems to be going smoothly. My school is very diverse and I feel very family and student oriented. Everyone supports each other. I think it is very important to have a group of strong-minded and motivating people around you because it inspires you to do better and Felician University does exactly that."
College Sophomore,4,The school considers each and every degree possible. The internships are as great as they are often talked about.
College Sophomore,4,"My experience was great. There will always be difficult moments but with the help of the professors and more time going over my work and studying enough, its usually easy to pull through."
College Sophomore,4,Its extremely comfortable and spacious.
College Sophomore,4,The sports teams are fantastic and dedicated.
College Sophomore,4,"This university is honestly an amazing place to learn. The professor's are great with communication as well as making sure their students learn the material well. They are very struct with the college rules, which is a great thing. They interact with each and every student. Its an overall amazing place to learn. Also, the academic programs are a plus."
College Freshman,4,The career development center has is giving me lots of options for jobs and internships.
College Freshman,4,So far I am able to communicate with my professors.
College Freshman,4,Its very good and teaches you independence.
College Freshman,4,They care about a lot of stuff around the school community and volunteer their hours in school.
College Junior,4,"The sports facilities are very good at Felician college. A lot of students participate in sports and have a great team spirit.

They strongly support their teams. They have a lot of family support. Their friends frequently attend their games/competitions. There is a strong camaraderie between students and professors at Felician college which boosts the morale."
College Freshman,4,We are a dry campus.
College Freshman,4,"Compared to other campuses, the dorms are decent looking."
College Freshman,4,"The security on Felician is good, they have security guards moderating the security cameras on campus. Also to get into our dorms we have security guards at the front door our the hall."
College Freshman,4,Professors are very helpful and get to know their students. Classes are small enough where the professor will know who you are.
College Freshman,4,"Moving in was warming, people were very helpful. My roommate and I get along very well. They have a study section in every floor and lounge to hangout in. They have reasonable quiet hours and the RAs do a good job to enforce quiet hours."
College Freshman,4,Felician has caring and very supportive and helpful professors. They are willing to help to their best abilities. The people are very friendly and their is always help when you need it. I would choose this school again because the have a excellent education program and they help me achieve my requirements.
College Freshman,4,Felician is very diverse. It is like a microcosm of New Jersey. The main way it lacks diversity is its gender divide; women greatly outnumber men. I think that only 27% of students are men.
College Freshman,4,"As far as I know, there's very little crime on campus. You also always see a security person walking around."
College Freshman,4,"The education professors are very knowledgeable about their field, and they really work with the students to prepare them for their chosen profession."
College Freshman,4,"I do not dorm, but my friends do. The room looks great."
College Freshman,4,It is not for me.
College Freshman,4,"Felician is what I expected it to be. It's small, which I like, and it gave me the biggest scholarship offer. I'm finding my classes to be doable and the professors are really nice."
College Sophomore,4,"Even though it's a very small school, I absolutely love it. I have met so many people that I grew to love so much. My roommate was amazing and became one of my very best friends. This school experience is amazing and I would not have it any other way."
College Freshman,4,I love the options off campus! they're cheap and delicious!
College Freshman,4,The staff & faculty take the rules and regulations seriously.
College Freshman,4,"On the Lodi campus, the cafeteria is spacious and the staff is super friendly. There's always a hot meal and the food always seems fresh. Even the freshly baked chocolate chip cookies."
College Sophomore,4,The Lodi campus has fabulous options. My personal favorite is the sandwhih deli on the Lodi Campus because the deli picks are fresh and made to order. The nice and convenient staff is a plus!
College Student,4,Financial aid office helps you with fafsa and have scholarship option to apply for.
College Student,4,When you first move in to your dorm is a little scary. I wasn't use to being away from home but after a while you start feeing comfortable and you meet new friends. You have RA who help you out around the school and help you get feel at ease. The food is different to what you are use to but after a while you get use to it.
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of off campus restaurants on Park Ave and it's a easy five minutes walk from Rutherford campus. However, almost all the restaurants does not accept students discounts and the students cannot use their meal card at any of the off campus restaurants. There are a variety of ethnic cuisine such as Cuban, Greek, Chinese, and Japanese food. Some of these restaurants even delivers so the students does not have to even walk there to get food and can simply enjoy on campus."
College Freshman,4,"Since I am in the Nursing program, the professors are very strict about nursing students attending class on time and not to miss any class. If nursing students missed two or more class with or without an excuse note, they will be dismiss from the program. Also, in order to stay in the nursing programs, students must have an average of 2.7 GPA with an average of B- in all sciences and nursing classes. Students will be allow to retake one class and be on probation until the grade is brought up the following semester, if not the student will be dismiss from the program."
College Freshman,4,"I had to go through several process in order to get the financial aid I need. Although I didn't have to pay anything for the tuition, the school did not really give me a lot for living on campus. I paid more for living on campus than paying for my tuition."
College Freshman,4,"The school have two campuses with a dining hall in each campus. The dining hall in Lodi Campus served better food, the food over there is more fresh and healthier than the food on Rutherford campus especially the deli. Since the food is better over there, there is no all you can eat option unlike the one on Rutherford campus. In the Rutherford dining hall, lunch and dinner is all you can eat including the fountain drinks, salad bar, deli, soups and even the ice creams. Both dining hall provided variety of options but sometimes the students get tired of them since it basically the same thing everyday. Also, the snacks that are sold on both campuses and in the nest are always pricey. This is how the school drains the students meal card by charging them overpriced food. Overall, the services isn't to bad."
College Freshman,4,"At the very beginning, I hated living on campus because of my roommate. She is disrespectful and will do everything her way not caring how I felt. For example, she would bring in guys into the room and at night when I'm trying to sleep, she would play her music on speaker and would turn on the lights. At that point, I regret living on campus. I request a room change but Residence  Life said that the building was full and cannot moved me. I did not get a new roommate until three weeks before the semester ends and I requested two weeks after the semester began. I could finally moved out after I talked to my RA several times and a different RA who was in charge of another building. Now, I loved my new roommate for the Spring semester because she is very considerate. I am glad that my nightmare was over and didn't regret to dorm the second semester."
College Junior,4,Its quiet and peaceful on campus. The Rutherford campus is super close to Newark so there is a lot available just a short distance away.
College Junior,4,The students love their sports and so does the rest of the college.
College Junior,4,I was on campus for a night class and I felt safe. There was always security around if I needed them.
Recent Alumnus,4,Would have received a 5 if not for the organization/communication issues at times.
College Senior,4,I like it. There are many interesting people in thus program and you learn so much its incredible. The professors help plenty.
College Senior,4,"The HealthCare Administration program was pretty easy to get into considering my grades. I am a B+ student and you need a C to get into the program. My program is pretty hard, the Health field was never really simple but its manageable. Just be prepared and ready to work! Always buy the books cause you WILL need them."
Sophomore,2,Campus life is pretty dull. The food is nasty and the falcons nest doesn't have enough food. The professor are very helpful but some of the advisors have bad attitudes. Since the college is small we don't have a lot of campus activities. We can't have parties which makes everything even worst. The dorm rooms are very nice we just need more room since they accept so many students. For the price we should way more.
College Sophomore,2,The Greek life at my school is very amateurish.
College Freshman,2,"Needed help financial and Instead of helping with other options than the obvious ones that could not work they haven't tried to help me,and that's a great downfall when I student is willing and motivated to get an education the right thing to do is try your best and help. This is a reason I wouldn't pick my school again if I could do it all over again"
College Student,2,Felician University rarely has Greek Life and when their is an event the neighbors complain so the shows are rarely good.
College Student,2,Felician College is a over-paid college isn't worth it. The staff here are racist and highly disrespectful.
College Freshman,2,There is only a fraternity on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Our teams are mediocre. While some people go to some games, they don't seem well attended. Our gym is tiny."
College Freshman,2,"Supposedly, there is a big marijuana problem in the dorms. As a commuter, it doesn't really affect me, but many people ignore the rules regarding drugs and alcohol on campus. However, if you do get caught, there are strict policies."
College Sophomore,2,"SGA needs to be improved because getting the word out about events and club activities is a hassle with them. Additionally, starting a club on campus is just ridiculous! So much paper work and it takes a year or two to actually build one up!"
College Student,2,It's hard to get an off campus housing because landlords don't really trust students with there house. You would also need a job to pay for rent monthly. It's alot more stress on a students who is full time.
College Student,2,For off campus we don't get students discount. There aren't that much restaurant. All you have close by are fast food restaurants. Many good restaurants were a long drive.
College Freshman,2,"Since this is a small college, there isn't a lot of parties going on and the school will know if you are throwing a party in someone's room. I haven't been to any party yet, I heard a lot of crazy things happening at the baseball house."
College Senior,2,"There are no places even open past 9pm. There are just regular stores such as Burger King, Wendys, Subway, etc."
College Sophomore,2,Nightlife on campus is very rare. This campus was built in a residential area so no nightlife but if you want to go out there are spots 10 to 15 minutes away to enjoy yourselves.
College Junior,2,The school just started  a chapter last year.  There's not much going on with the Greek life on campus.
College Junior,2,Around the Ruthford camps there is a small shopping area in which one might choose to have lunch. The Lodi campus does not have any activities or attractions.
College Senior,2,They have a few options everyday. Food is a little pricey. The staff are very nice.
College Senior,2,"They are very strict about drinking and drug use no matter what age.  Visitors cant stay past 2 am in the dormitories or they will throw them out.  They are also strict with their academics especially nursing, which is a good thing.  Anything lower than a 77 is failing."
College Senior,2,"The guys I seen around campus are respectful and decent. They dress okay The girls around campus are also okay, nothing out of the ordinary. Everyone seems pretty easy going."
College Freshman,2,"The off-campus dining isnt really all that. Walking distance choices is mostly chinese food, a thai restaurant, frozen yougurt place which is awesome called Yo-Lish, Italian restaurants, the bacis like-- subway, wendys, burger king, popeyes and arbys in the area. On route17 you have better choices like Ihop, Sonic, Red lobster, ect."
Alum,1,"I didn't take online classes, so I really don't know what to say. I'm just writing this to fill the word count."
Works Here,1,I didn't take any online courses but I'm positive that it was as terrible as in person classes. The professors aren't good for the most part.
Freshman,1,"Do not waste your time with this school. I wasted a year here, and now my credits for my new school are all messed up and I am starting as a freshman. The staff is NOT HELP. I have reached out to so many different departments for so many different things on SO many different occasions, and nothing and nobody ever helped. There is nothing to do on campus, it smells, the people are rude. The professors are some of the worst educators I've ever experienced in my entire school life. The only remotely okay professors I had were adjuncts. So much work needs to be done here. The kicker is- when they show you the campus, they only show Rutherford Campus. Meanwhile, most of the classes are taught at Lodi Campus, which is next to a cemetery and strip club, in a horrible neighborhood. Please trust me and do not go here. I want to do everything in my power to shut this school down for good and help out others."
Graduate Student,1,"This college puts money first before the students and so does the staff.  Very unprofessional behavior from several staff members, especially those in nursing. They put their reputation first and do not provide a nurturing educational environment for the students."
College Sophomore,1,"Felician college is using students to make money. how can school fail students out of the program when they have three months to graduate, simply because they are looking to graduate specific number of students."
College Sophomore,1,Felician college is not the picture they presented to the public. Nursing program in Felician college should be closed down.
College Sophomore,1,Felician College is not a party college
College Student,1,There isn't any party scene at this school. Students make a get together at there dorm but not something big. In order to go to a party is to go to different schools. It's a catholic school so it's dry on party.
College Junior,1,I have never heard of Greeks before. I don't think they are on our campus
College Senior,1,"I'm not even sure if there IS a Greek life. Maybe there is, its not really known or supported so, no."
College Senior,1,"This is suppose to be a Franciscan Campus but I don't feel like their helping at all. I had to pay the money owed out of pocket and I'm still paying for last semester's bill. They claim they give an extra aid (which was like $500 compared to the $3,246 I needed!)"
College Sophomore,1,"This school has an honor code and Felician values that they ""keep"" but its horrible. There is no one here that really cares about you, just your money. They have plenty money to distribute for those in need but do they help nope. I get financial aid but some people who need it aren't even eligible here ti get it. Its weird and unfair this school is no help to people who need it. They rather you drop out then help you be eligible to register for next semester."
College Freshman,1,"Unfortunately there is no greek life at Felician, but there is talk about a sorority coming about."
College Freshman,1,"It is pretty scrict, you get in trouble for drinking/smoking on campus, be surrounded around drugs even if you are not doing it, for having evidence of use. They are no parties allowed, unless it is ran by the school. You have to sign people in even if it is of same sex. No one can be any in anyones room after 1 a.m. unless they have a overnight pass."
College Sophomore,1,"BOYS ARE IMMATURE – the boys are stuck in their high school jock status. its like the movie ""accepted"""
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking on campus is a challenge, especially during peak day hours. It would be helpful, if additional parking became available. It is much better later in the evening, but at the start of evening classes, it is tough trying to find a spot."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Strict Guidelines – Felician College is very strict with drug and alcohol use. Though I do not live on campus, I am confident that these are not tolerated. Any other issues, plagerism, fighting, violations of honor codes, and any other issues as these, are given immediate attention to by administration or security. A student can be dismissed or suspended."
College Sophomore,1,No Greeks – There are no Greeks that are on campus. This college does not have any fraternity houses or sorority houses. I do not know if this is because this is a Catholic College or if there is another reason why they do not want these houses at my college.
College Junior,1,No Greeks – There are no sororities or fraternities because it is a catholic college. Some of the sports teams do hold parties but that is not very often.
College Student,1,"Way to Harsh! The police force can be pretty strict about underage drinking and drug use. First-time offenders get a letter sent home, and second- and third-time offenders are in danger of losing their housing. It's pretty serious if you get caught, so my best advice is to do everything discreetly and not to be obnoxious about it. If you're going to drink then drink, but don't start advertising keg parties in your room. You will get busted"

Sophomore,5,Northland is a very nice college. The people are friendly and the teachers are very reasonable. I never thought of a school being more awesome than northland.
Sophomore,5,It was simple. The teachers guided me through it to help me understand more. It was confusing but the teachers understood and gave extra time and all during the covid sessions
Alum,5,Great school and beautiful area of the country. School is located a couple of blocks off the shores of Lake Superior. Highly recommend this school to anybody looking to study here.
Freshman,5,This college is so welcoming and everyone truly cares about you as an individual. There are small class sizes so you get one on one attention from the professors.
Senior,5,"Small class sizes and involved teachers. Extra help was always available, and teachers were willing to work with students individually as much as necessary."
Junior,5,"Northland has a unique atmosphere, centered on creating a sense of community through multiple studies with a focus on the environment. The Northwoods provides a one of a kind experience for those interested in alternative ways of learning, in and beyond the classroom."
Freshman,5,"I like the smaller campus as professors know you by name, not a number. Northland College offers and accepts diversity as well as many opportunities to be a part of the community in Ashland. P"
Niche User,5,"My son and I just visited the campus this December. We were very impressed with the full spectrum sustainability initiative! The campus was minimalistic and exuded a great community feel and seemed to teem with creative energy. From my perspective, the students seemed to have a be deeply passionate about creating a better world(in a functional sense in the region, not an idealistic type o' shtick). Very impressive faculty, too!!!  Northland has my vote for my son."
Freshman,5,"Overall I really enjoy Northland, it has some great experiences as long as you are willing to go out and be involved and work in the community at large. This is a great location and there are tons of super cool and interesting people here, lots of club and actives for everyone."
College Senior,5,"I think our campus overall is very safe.  Campus safety is there when you need them, but they are also not overbearing."
College Senior,5,"I think the professors at Northland have been, for the most part, amazing.  They really care about their students."
College Senior,5,I've had a very good time in my time at Northland.
College Freshman,5,"Northland College is great for anyone pursuing environmental studies, outdoor education majors, and anything to do with the humanities. Everyone on campus is very accepting of whoever you are as a person, as long as you are a nice person. Professors are on first name bases with all students and always try to include everyone's thoughts. If you're looking for a more personal feel to the college experience, Northland College is the way to go!"
College Freshman,5,There are excellent people leading Northland!
College Freshman,5,Northland gives great financial aid! Kind donors
College Freshman,5,"No matter your lifestyle, Northland delivers!!!"
College Freshman,5,I got an amazing financial aid package!
College Senior,5,"I would argue the biology program is a very unique and hands on learning experience to be found. Both summers I have acquired internships, of which the biology department staff have assisted in finding and applying for. The program gives you an all around learning experience to connect as many topics as possible to open a plethora of job fields. The staff work towards giving you unique learning and hands on opportunities to make you desirable for graduate school and job field. I couldn't ask for a better learning experience."
College Sophomore,5,"Northland is known for it's environmentalism, as it includes it in every aspect. No matter what your major, you will find that everyone around you is pushing for it to be a great place! :)"
College Sophomore,5,"we don't have greek life. we do have themed houses though. House of the Rising Sun - music house, Gia's Cradle - LGBT/Feminist/Social Issues house, Sportman's lodge - hunting/outdoors, Ultimate House - frolf/outdoors, Art House - exactly how it sounds, Mosaic - diversity house

All are very welcoming and awesome"
College Sophomore,5,Northland does a great job on making sure everyone can afford a college education
College Freshman,5,There is a lot of variety.
College Junior,5,"There are many labs on campus, and the brand new wireless is awesome"
College Sophomore,5,Housing here is sooooooooo cheap.  Unfortunately they only allow you to live off campus senior year.
College Sophomore,5,"The scholarships here are incredible.  Apply, apply, apply!"
College Sophomore,5,"As far as I know, Northland is the only school with a Sustainable Community Development Major."
College Sophomore,5,"For such a rural area, we have great public transportation.  If you call the Bay Area Rural Transit, they will usually take you where you need to go (within reason)."
College Sophomore,5,Northand is a great place to go to school because the community is small and caring.
College Sophomore,5,Northland is not strict at all.  The RAs and Campus Safety are friendly and understanding when they do their job.
College Sophomore,5,Northland is so small that there is virtually no crime.  Campus safety is very friendly and helpful and they will even jump your car in the winter if it won't start.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Yes! I loved my Northland experience. It's hard to think of any negative experiences that I had on campus. The professors were great educators that drew you into the course work,  and the staff worked with you through the good times and always treated you like an individual not a number. 

I had continuous opportunities to get involved on and off campus and not always just outdoor recreation either. I will always look back and love my time at Northland."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I absolutely loved the Outdoor Education program at Northland. The hands-on courses gave me plenty of experience in the field, while the professors guided and advised me into opportunities for internships and careers. The campus location made even more of an impact and we incorporated field trips in almost every week.

The curriculum focused on hard and soft skills to give you all of the aspects that you will encounter while in your career. And we also had past graduates visit campus and show off what they did with their education.  "
Recent Alumnus,5,"Northland is a Liberal Arts campus so the academics reflect that focus. You start off with some interesting general eds that allow you to pick the topic of study and bring together different programs. It's hard to describe, but its basically 10 courses that are broken into 2 course blocks, like Sociology and Outdoor Education, and you learn about both courses and how they relate. One course I took was called Making Sense of Misfortune - it was basically analyzing why do bad things happen and how do we make sense of them once they do?"
College Senior,5,"The winter semester can be really cold! However, I really enjoy the cold weather because I grew up snowboarding in the rocky mountains. If you live on campus, they shovel the snow for you so you don't really have anything to worry about. "
College Senior,5,The people on campus are really easy-going and they don't really exclude anyone. The majority of students aren't judgemental or rude. 
College Senior,5,The campus is really safe and I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary. 
College Senior,5,I transferred from a college that used to ticket students if their tires were even touching the white parking lines. At Northland they don't do anything like that. 
College Senior,5,The students on campus are here to work hard and graduate. I haven't noticed anyone abusing alcohol or illegal drugs on campus. 
College Senior,5,"There are so many computer labs on campus. If you didn't have a computer on campus you wouldn't be doomed, but I have owned one for a long time and I couldn't imagine being without one. "
College Senior,5,I am extremely happy with the biology program i'm in. 
College Senior,5,I'm a transfer student and I wish I would have started here. The professors really make the experience memorable 
College Senior,5,There are so many options available on campus. They have the Chub for a quick purchase or else you can stop by dining area on campus. The dining hall on campus has several options available and they always try to mix things up. 
College Senior,5,I love the local dining places near campus. There are good prices and the food is great. 
College Senior,5,The teachers really want to make sure students show up to their classes. 
College Senior,5,I enjoy living on campus because it makes life much easier. 
College Senior,5,A lot of the science books in the library are pretty old. That's really my only complaint. 
College Senior,5,I love the small classes and my professors are great! 
College Senior,5,Most of the people on campus are well rounded and easy to get along with. I can't complain. 
College Sophomore,5,It doesn't exist! I love that!
College Sophomore,5,"There are numerous computer labs around campus, and printing is free, which is a big deal! I've never had any issues accessing a comp on campus when I need one."
College Freshman,5,Transportation provided for the school is awesome. Northland works wtih the Bay Area Rural Transit (or BART Bus) and student I.D.'s will get you almost anywhere realistic.
College Freshman,5,"Northland is a very safe place to be. Located in Ashland, the crime rate is pretty low. Being a girl myself, I know I would not feel safe walking across campus alone at night at many other schools, but at Northland I do. Security is always willing to help, along with the student population."
College Freshman,5,"The professors really care at Northland. With the smaller class sizes, professors actually get to know you as a student and not just as a name. If you are struggling they are most likley aware of it, and almost all of them will make an effort to help you out. Many of the professors have side projects, and often encourage students to get involved, showing their dedication to their field."
College Freshman,5,"There's a wide variety of people on campus from different backgrounds and different circumstances. Each person I've met has been completely unique and this college is the best place to fit in. Everyone is very accepting and kind to everyone, there's no discrimination or anger that I've yet to see--the college is like a big family and here everyone fits. It's actually really cool, I have a hard time imagining that there could be anything better."
College Freshman,5,"The health office on campus is amazing, and the woman who runs it is super nice and will help you with just about any medical concern you may have. If you need to go and see a doctor she can also help set up that first appointment and tell you what to do with your insurance and so on. And my safety is pretty much guaranteed on campus. I feel no threats, everyone is incredibly nice and friendly and even walking back to my dorm at night I feel safe as can be. The security personnel are constantly walking through campus and ensuring our safety and they as well are really friendly and helpful. I couldn't ask for better security."
College Sophomore,5,Northland gives out amazing scholarships and that is ultimately what lead me to decide to pursue my education at Northland.  Make sure to apply for all the scholarships that you can.
College Sophomore,5,There are tons of open parking spaces on campus because not that many students drive.  The parking lots are close to both the residence halls and the academic buildings and parking permits for the year are $50-$75.
College Freshman,5,"Everyone at northland is different!  It is wonderful.  There are people interested in art, sports, music, design, and really anything that you can think of.  Also, everyone is very open when it comes to religion and sexual orientation.  It is a very accepting community."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Campus strictness from security to student life treats students, as they should, as learning young adults. There are consequences for students actions, but they use them as learning opportunities. But push your luck and your gonna get in trouble, laws are still laws. Staff is very friendly and when in the residential halls give the RAs and RHDs respect and they will respect you, they do hand out warnings."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Wow! Good, homemade, local food with a huge selection and variety. They have vegan, vegetarian, carnivorous, gluten free, dairy free, and organic options. They really care about the quality and access to food. Very affordable too. Buffet style - once you're in the cafeteria, eat till your heart's content."
Freshman,4,"Northland college is a small liberal arts school. When I say small, I mean small. It’s about 600 students.  Faculty and students care deeply about the environment and hope to make a change."
Freshman,4,I like the professors and the students. They are very friendly and accepting. The professors won't hesitate to help you if you ask. The admissions team is super friendly and they'll remember you even after you're a student. I'm not to happy with residential life though. My room mate never showed up and I received an email that seemed to be accusing me for having a room to myself. They gave me a list and told me to find a roommate or they'd  make an assignment. Isn't that their job? Other than that I've really been enjoying this school.
Sophomore,4,Northland college is the different from other colleges. From the energetic and caring people and staff. Also the beautiful winter and summer here makes it worth it. It had a wide variety of majors and minors for all!
Sophomore,4,Northland College is a wonderful school. The students and staff are all very friendly and welcoming. The classes are small which makes learning and getting help much easier.
Freshman,4,"I love Northland College because of the outdoor aspect. I love being so close to nature and the amount of people here who also love nature. Everyone here obviously cares about the environment. Also Northland is such a welcoming environment, walking to class you can always count on someone stopping to say hello!"
College Senior,4,"I think that my career prospects are very good after Northland, because I have worked hard while I've been here.  I've also been able to participate in research related to my field.  I wouldn't say that a degree from Northland is all that special on a resume, but if you get the hands-on, individualized experience that is opportunity that is offered here, that might say something to potential employers."
College Senior,4,I think about a quarter of students are athletes.  We just got a beautiful new fitness center and they are almost finished with a new soccer/lacrosse field.
College Sophomore,4,"Northland is a great school to start thinking differently. Since coming to Northland my social skills, ability to understand people,   and understanding of social constructs has improved drastically. And although I'm a Sustainable Community Development major with a duo minor in biology and geology, my overall knowledge of religion, sociology, and psychology has improved just as much. Northlands environmental focus to all the majors are outstanding, because as science has come to show us we have to change the ways we live if we wish to continue as a species. Northland's campus life is also outstanding, the small student population makes great for a family feel community. The class sizes are small and 90% of my professors I've had are very approachable and seek to form relationships with you at an individual level. This makes attending classes, listening, and striving for success that much easier."
College Sophomore,4,"Northland is a wonderful small school school and the connections with professors are very one on one.  My class sizes are typically average around 20 students and professors have easily accessible through office hours and email. Northland is heavily environmentally focused with exceptional field programs. The student body is heavily involved in sustainability programs, student government, and athletics. Northland also has many connections with international study programs as well as the facts that is a member of the Ecoleague that alows students to transfer within a system of around 10 private schools for the blanket tuition. I would definitely choose my school again because they provide so many opportunities and connections all within a tight knit academic community."
College Sophomore,4,"Northland is small, Northland is isolated, and Northland is weird.  If you're still reading, it may work for you.  If you're still hesitant or curious about these qualities, that's OK too– my subjective assessment may help shed light onto why ""small, isolated, and weird"" could be positives for you.  That being said, this is not an ad.  I'm not a tour guide, nor am I a pennant-wielding fan; I see both positives and negatives in my institution, but know that ""perfect fit"" doesn't exist.  Only you and you're gut can decide what the best-fit-for-circumstance is. If you don't feel it in your gut, don't waste your time.

Northland is small.  600-ish people at time of post or under 1,000 cap. for future readers.  It's hard not to know your whole class or at least recognize everyone's faces in the school.  It took me about a year to find my people, but once those relationships were forged, I was comfortable with seeing the same faces every day. Also, when visiting, notice the lack of faces in phones.  People here, genuinely care about waving, saying ""hi"", or checking in with people they don't know.  We are normal undergrads with normal relationships to entertainment and technology, but people here are more game to go on hikes or go stargazing than many other places– you kind of have to be in a place this small.

Northland is isolated.  Ashland, WI is a fairly normal Wisconsin mid-size town.  I'm from a city, and know that Ashland lacks heavily in year-round walkable cultural events/places and is relatively economically depressed.  Friends from small towns do tout the activeness of the town (things like farmers market, shops, Washburn theater), but I think they're missing the point.  Northland is, if you want it to be, is a cloistered four-year cocoon to examine the inner journey.  Or, if you're not into that- its got great wilderness.

Northland is weird.  Like ecotones, the fringes of institutions is where you'll find most diversity. Damn character limit.  Just visit."
College Freshman,4,Ashland is small so there isn't a lot available
College Freshman,4,Different local restaurants keep it interesting!
College Freshman,4,I have been very pleased! Kept clean by staff!
College Freshman,4,"Not really into that stuff, but the gym is nice."
College Freshman,4,People are super chill here.
College Freshman,4,"Well, the thing is, you kind of have to be in with the right crowd. It's such a small school it's weird if you just drop in at a party where you don't know many folks. Especially if you're an underclassmen and it's an upperclassmen party. But if you are in the party kid crowd, there are some goooood parties. There's one called Qweeb on October 28th in the middle of the woods with chili and live music and that's a good time. Anyone can attend, alumni go too."
College Freshman,4,"I live in Fenenga, so that's the only building I can really speak for. I love Fenenga, the atmosphere is great, the building is fairly home-y and usually quite clean, and the common rooms are nice. And there's a room in the basement that's like a little dance studio that I like to exercise in."
College Freshman,4,"If you love the outdoors, you will love it here. Lots of snow."
College Freshman,4,"They try to be very honest with us and provide the things we need like condoms, female condoms, pregnancy tests, etc."
College Freshman,4,The housing works out pretty well and it is a nice thing to see work smoothly. They try to accommodate your interests and what not with the person they stick you with.
College Freshman,4,"There is a wide selection and it tastes pretty good. They also have different days where special things are served, which is pretty cool."
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of majors that you can choose from and there is always someone willing to help you out.
College Freshman,4,the process was really effective and it worked for me.
College Sophomore,4,"If you are willing to push yourself and the do the best of your abilities you will receive a great education. However, you can do okay with just skating by too... If you attend Northland, put your best foot forward and work hard. It will most definitely pay off. The faculty are amazing. We often hang out with them outside of class and eat dinner at their houses on special occasions. Very cool."
College Sophomore,4,"The Ashland Baking Company, The Black Cat, Second Street Bistro, New China, and the Deepwater Grill are a must try. We also have multiple pizza places, Micky D's, Arbys, Subway and Culver's soon to Arrive!"
College Sophomore,4,"LGBT community on campus is wonderful. However, there is very little diversity on campus, which of course could be improved upon. Northland is a very tight-knit community where everyone looks out for everyone and knows everyone. It's great. :)"
College Junior,4,I love all the people and the small classes.
College Freshman,4,"Nice town, beautiful old houses, close proximity to main street compared to campus."
College Freshman,4,I didn't encounter any difficulties and if I did there was always someone to help me along.
College Freshman,4,The overall experience is positive.
College Freshman,4,There are always parking spots open.
College Junior,4,"This is a very beautiful area, lots of parks and places to canoe and hike nearby"
College Junior,4,The campus is very tolerant and respectful of all people.
College Junior,4,There is more than enough parking on campus for everyone with a car.
College Junior,4,"There are many houses in town where you can rent rooms or split the rent with a few friends.  They are all convenient, and within walking distance of the college."
College Freshman,4,I love going to a college in a small town even though it sometimes has it's dull moments.
College Freshman,4,Students ride the BART bus for free.
College Freshman,4,There is usually something to do during all seasons.
College Freshman,4,The professors love to talk with students and are always open to questions.
College Freshman,4,Nothing ever gets too out of hand. The RAs and RHDs are always on top of things and know how to handle situations.
College Freshman,4,It's not much of a hassel and people are always available to help with questions that you may have.
College Freshman,4,"There is something happening nearly every weekend. There are mostly house parties, sometimes with live local bands. Everyone is invited, including underage students, because all parties are bring-your-own-beverage. Transportation isn't an issue because everything is within walking distance, the longest you'll ever have to walk is maybe 20 minutes."
College Freshman,4,"There is a lot of open discussion about drug and alcohol culture and how to stay safe. Drinking is the most social aspect here and if you don't do it, it sort of limits who you socialize with. However, there is a large part of the student body that does not partake in anything. The college has a strict policy with underage drinkers, if caught you will get a ticket."
College Freshman,4,"There is a lot of scholarship money available. Almost no one would be able to afford Northland without financial aid. There isn't really a trick, you just get whatever you qualify for. However, I recommend coming to visit before your semester starts. If you do that, you will be awarded a visitors grant for about 500 dollars."
College Freshman,4,"There is no Greek life on campus but we do have theme houses where a group of people live together and organize events on campus related to their theme. Right now, there are seven theme houses that live in both the on campus apartments or townhouses."
College Freshman,4,"My major is Sustainable Community Development. The program itself is unique because it is relatively new. The faculty are wonderful and always eager to help; they assign a lot of work but it is always manageable. The field of study is broad so the curriculum covers a lot in order for the student to choose their own particular focus. They occasionally offer opportunities to have an internship with one of the professors, but it is rare."
College Freshman,4,"They have the rules in place for our safety, but the enforcers are reasonable. In the dorms, RA's will typically give warnings before writing anyone up. In the academic realm, professors set individual rules for attendance and cheating. Most will not do anything if you show up late, but if it's repeated or if you stop coming to class they will kick you out. If you are caught cheating on exams, they will kick you out. It's a no tolerance policy."
College Freshman,4,"The majority of off campus housing is in really close proximity to the campus which is a definite pro. You have to apply early because there are limited spaces, but if you do it's easy to get what you want. The school only allows students to live off campus once they have stayed on campus for four semesters. Most spots have either a driveway or a parking lot provided by the campus for students to leave their cars. This biggest problem one would have with the off campus houses would be heating in the winter time. The houses are old and not properly insulated so they can get somewhat drafty."
College Sophomore,4,The facilities here are pretty nice.  People don't really hang out in the student center though.
College Sophomore,4,The Sustainable Community Development major is fairly new and pretty easy to complete in 4 years.  Northland offers a lot of great opportunities for SCD majors.
College Sophomore,4,"If you want to go into an environmental field, Northland is the place to be."
College Sophomore,4,The student life here at Northland is nice.  The facilities are comfortable and they reflect the history and environmental focus of the college.
College Sophomore,4,"If you want to play sports at Northland, you can. They accept basically anyone onto the teams. 1/4 of Northland students are on a sports team."
College Sophomore,4,"Ashland is a beautiful little town that attracts many tourists for weekend getaways.  Since we are right on Lake Superior, there is great natural areas readily available to students."
College Sophomore,4,"The weather up here on the Big Lake is pretty cold, but it's a fantastic place to live if you love autumn colors and winter.  Ice fishing, nordic and downhill skiing, and snowshoeing are all great opportunities here during snow season.  Sometimes school is even canceled because of the snow."
Recent Alumnus,4,"For Ashland's size there are quite a lot of food options. The town has about 10+ restaurants with some ethnic options included. Just out of town there are some other fantastic places to eat like Da Lou's - an Italian brick fire pizza place, and Delta Diner - which has been featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. 

Plenty of fresh fish options from the lake, and if you have a taste for vegan or vegetartian or gluten free foods the local co-op and the Black Cat are amazing options."
College Senior,4,The locals around Ashland are very friendly and really easy to get along with. I love living next to Lake Superior and my professor even got me interesting in fishing! 
College Senior,4,It can be difficult to register for certain classes during the semester. This is due to the fact that it might to be avaliable that semester.
College Senior,4,"It was kind of frustrating because I had to get a private loan, and I had no idea when I would get the money I need. Otherwise, the people are really helpful and nice. "
College Sophomore,4,There isnt much available concerning workstudies in meteroology.  The professors are well knowledgeable in their professional and they are dedicated to ensuring that you get as much information as possible while attending the college.  Its really great that Northland is a smaller campus which means smaller class sizes to assist with more one on one time with the staff.
Niche User,2,"I'm currently a senior. College visits are the best ways to see if the college is a fit for you. Northland College was one of my top choices. They had an admitted student overnight stay. At first, I thought this college was so sweet that they're willing to pick us students up for the college visit. I live in Saint Paul, MN. Which is pretty far from Northland College. Northland College was one my top choice because they're an environmental college, which is what I'm planning to major in. However, when I went to visit, my experience wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. The host I was with was very different from me. She wasn't big into sports, and the college wasn't big into sports neither. The campus life seemed really dead, and everyone just did their own things. The student population was very small, but since it was smaller than other schools, I was hoping for everyone to come together, and do fun activities together. It turned out to be very quiet, and nonactive campus."
College Freshman,2,Eh. Small town. Nothing's open late.
College Freshman,2,"Nice town, but nothing here, closest city is 2 hours away"
College Freshman,2,lame parties people just sitting around playing pong and chilling.
College Freshman,2,Walk in to a dorm and all you can smell is weed. no one really gets busted for drugs or alcohol.
College Freshman,2,There are some good local restaurants but nothing is open late good luck getting a meal after 9PM
College Sophomore,2,"The internet here is so slow, and the dorms don't have WIFI.  We live in the stone age basically."
College Sophomore,2,There is no nightlife.  The bar/club scene is nonexistant.
College Sophomore,2,"I would say on the whole, okay. Check out the Alley and the Deepwater Grille. The best place to go is the Black Cat coffehouse and the Ashland Baking Company next door. (They make the best cinnamon rolls ever)."
College Junior,2,"Honestly I am not big into athletics and neither are a lot of the students at Northland. Northland is an environmental college so a lot of emphasis is put on that instead of athletics. However, a lot of athletes get scholarships to Northland (we are division 3) and so there are some students who are into athletics. The most popular sport is intramural ultimate frisbee and D3 hockey."
College Junior,2,There are a few bars in town and a few in neighboring towns. The best one is the Office Bar which is walking distance from campus and it gets bumpin' on wednesday nights because its 5 dollars for unlimited beer. Other than these few bars nightlife isn't very big at Northland. Mostly people throw their own parties and usually everyone on campus is invited because there are only 500-600 people who attend Northland. Most places that you want to go to at night are walking distance or biking distance which is great.
College Sophomore,2,Most residence halls at Northland are still not set up with WiFi except in the lounges and each residence hall is equipped with only two public desktop computers.  If you are coming to Northland you basically need to own your own computer.  The printers are often slow and difficult to connect to personal computers.  The only upside is that all printing is free.
College Student,2,"Short fall, early winters. It gets cold. That's to be expected in this area of the country. There's usually snow on the ground until April. Good thing you can study abroad in Africa."
College Freshman,2,"Pricey and Repetative – The food here is often the same things over and over again, most of it isn't cooked very well, though there is always SOMETHING you can eat that tastes good (you might have to search really hard or make it yourself). Some days the food is really good, though, and the desserts are almost always tasty. There are a lot of vegitarian and vegan options, which is cool, and a salad bar that has vegtables grown by students at the College. There is only one dining hall run by Chartwells."
College Sophomore,2,"I run cross country at Northland, and I love it, but it is definitely not what I expected out of a college team. It is not very structured, not too demanding, and to be honest, we are not a super good team. But that's alright because we have fun! Most of the other sports here are the same way. We have a pretty good hockey team this year, though."
College Senior,2,"Ashland Housing – Housing off Northland College campus is medicore.  There is not much for selection, and although the places are very inexpensive they are also not very nice."
College Freshman,1,COLD COLD COLD!!! negative weather for three months. snow for six months
College Freshman,1,No options if you dont have a car you need to find a friend to drive you somewhere.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life nor do we need it.
Recent Alumnus,1,D3 School – Northland is not known for their sporting teams and selection is slim.

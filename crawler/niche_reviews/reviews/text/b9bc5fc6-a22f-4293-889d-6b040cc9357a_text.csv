Freshman,5,"Most of my classes are online. In the beginning, it was very stressful because I am a first-generation and also freshmen at St. Catherine's. I didn't know where to access some of the stuff. My professors were very helping and they guide me through to make sure I understood."
Freshman,5,I love saint Catherines because the professors are very understanding and supportive despite the whole pandemic going on. I love that they focus on empowering women and leading them out to the world to make a change.
Freshman,5,At this time nearly all classes are based online and those that are in person follow strict guidelines. Professors are extremely understanding of technical difficulties. Each class uses different platforms to meet if need be although some classes are asynchronous. We use D2L on a daily basis to receive and turn in materials as well as to discuss topics.
Freshman,5,They really care about their students. There are many resources for assistance and tutoring for free on campus. There are no streets running through campus allowing you to get around campus safely with no delays. There are constantly on campus events for students so its hard to get bored. The class sizes are small meaning the professors get to know you and teach to your learning style. There are no student teachers or teachers assistants so you really form a relationship with your professors. It is a beautiful and quiet campus but if parties are your thing St. Thomas is down the road and U of M is only a bus ride away.
Sophomore,5,"For my spring semester,  I went to campus for my classes. But that all changed around march. Around march, all of my classes were. I can tell that my professor felt a little pressure to move online since they never experience this type of situation but they all work around it. As well, the professors reached out to the student if they ever need help or need someone to talk to. They were there for us."
Sophomore,5,"My first year in St. Catherine University was so welcoming and awesome. St. Catherine offers many opportunities for their students like clubs, jobs and activities."
Sophomore,5,"I will be doing online courses through St. Catherine University this fall, so I don't have a review of that yet. However I am very excited to do online this fall!"
Freshman,5,"St. Catherine University is top notch. From the beginning of applying, the advisor has been more than welcoming to me. She has been helpful and has answered so many of my ridiculous questions. The financial advisor has also been very helpful. I am excited to start school there this fall."
Freshman,5,"I have not started my online classes at this time. I still have about a month until then. But, seems everything is set up great and it will be a good experience. Everything seems to be set up for students to have success."
Sophomore,5,"Going into my first year, I did not have friends at St. Kates. However, I was overwhelmed with the positive spirits and good people. There was a program called MIPS that I have heard from fellow classmates. I joined the program and was assigned to a mentor. I felt a sense of community and belonging at St. Kates. One thing I like about St. Kates is the diversity amongst students. Faculty and staff are welcoming and are always informative. There are a wide variety of student clubs and organizations that make it easier for students to choose one that fits them best."
Sophomore,5,"During half-way through the second semester, we had to move to online classes due to the circumstances we have gone through as a society. My professors were understanding and adaptive to new challenges. Professors have worked so hard to make online learning as beneficial as in-class learning. Online resources such as Collaborate has been the center of all classroom lectures. Assignments, quizzes, and exams were turned in on D2L just like before. Most of my classes used Lockdown browser for exams to ensure that honesty remains. If technical difficulties were to occur during exams or quizzes, professors were understanding and considerate."
Sophomore,5,"St. Catherine's University is a very positive, diverse, and welcoming environment. The professors help students in any way and there are many helpful resources available. The only thing I would change is the food on campus, specifically the cost of the plan."
Graduate Student,5,"Yes, most of the time we used Collaborate. Sometimes we used Google Meet. A couple times we used Zoom. My least favorite was Zoom because the faculty member could control my Mic and if I didn't open my Mic fast enough they would click it for me thus disabling my ability to turn my Mic on so I could not contribute to the class. Also, in Collaborate we would break into small groups for discussions. Last, we presented power points and verbal reports. I think they did a great job!"
Graduate Student,5,"The faculty cares about the students, the topics they are teaching, and the students success in the class. They are highly responsive to emails. I hope the return on investment is monumental, but I won't know until after graduation. Also, I work full time so I don't have time for extracurricular activities so those questions don't apply to me."
Freshman,5,"I love St. Catherine University because it is one of few schools that offers a Occupational Therapy Assistant program. This is my dream job, and the educational experiences I get to grow through is an opportunity I will not turn down. I believe that everyone should be able to find a school that suits their dreams exactly how they want it to, and that's what St. Catherine is doing for me. I have never experienced the help that I received here while getting started with classes. The people are kind-hearted, and want the best for their students."
Junior,5,"On the campus of Saint Catherine University, no matter who you are or where you come from, you feel welcome. Diversity and acceptance are key components in this universityâ€™s atmosphere, as you will find groups of students like your self who you can soon call family. When I first stepped on campus, I never felt more at home. I never felt out of place or like I didn't belong, as there was always some one like me in the classroom, across the cafeteria, or in the dorm next door. Saint Catherine is a university I will always recommend to any woman looking to further her education and excel in whatever she wants to do, as Saint Catherine University will help her every step of the way."
Freshman,5,I love the diversity and different majors that it offers to students. It has been a great experience. Professor are easy to reach out to and I'm glad that I made the choice to attend St. Catherine University.
Sophomore,5,St. Kate's is an amazing school! They have brilliant professors who are truly passionate about what they teach and who love to share what they know. The campus is beautiful and the people are friendly. Though it is an expensive school they offer good scholarships and financial support.
Senior,5,Fantastic if you are not interested in boys and parties! Classes are very small and you grow really close to the classmates and professors in your department.
Sophomore,5,I love studying through St. Catherine University because the online learning platform is easy to follow and the professors are very eager to help you succeed. I would recommend the OTA program to anyone.
Freshman,5,"I really love St. Kate's because there is a lot of diversity! St. Kate's is a very unique university because of the diversity and it being a all women school. The staff and students make you feel really comfortable and welcomed! It feels like home instantly, everyone gets along with each other. I know I made the right decision in choosing St. Kate's!"
Niche User,5,"I found the campus very welcoming. Of all the campuses I have toured, St. Kate's is the one I felt the most comfortable on. It was the first campus I could actually imagine myself at someday. The staff was super helpful and willing to answer any and all question I had. I have received many things in the mail regarding everything from financial aid to visit days. They do an excellent job at keeping in touch and making sure all my questions are answered. My parents and I are planning on doing another visit soon, My mother was unable to attend the one I went on this summer and now that this is one of my top two schools and I will most likely being attending in the fall she wants to schedule another one so she can see the campus as well."
Freshman,5,"My first semester experience at St. Catherine was very good. At times when i was struggling many of my professors where very helpful and encouraging.  At St. Catherine there is also many clubs to fit in and many programs to help students such with writing, reading, math and science. It is a very good college to attend."
Freshman,5,"The community is amazing, the professors and kind and knowledgeable and I feel like I'm in a place I belong"
Sophomore,5,The professors and coaches are absolutely amazing. Very great about communication and clear understanding of what is expected from us as the students. I believe the things that needs to change is less focus on the core classes.
Niche User,5,"My academic success coach is very helpful. I find the online portal straight forward and even though everything is online,  the material and teachers are inclusive and make you feel like you're in the classroom."
Junior,5,"I transferred to St. Catherine University from a community college. I was feeling very stagnant at the first school I attended- like I didn't care to be there and they didn't care to help me succeed. After my very first meeting with a counselor at St. Kate's, I felt so much better. I was hesitant to even consider St. Kate's, due to the cost, but my counselor made me feel so welcome and provided me with so many helpful resources- the total opposite of my previous school. I absolutely love St. Kate's. Transferring there is one of the best decisions I've ever made. I love that they empower women, I was provided with a degree evaluation/ plan within a few hours of walking into the school, I feel very safe there, I've met many friends, and now I'm much more excited to go to school every day!"
Sophomore,5,"The campus is beautiful. Being a smaller university professors are willing to help and will most likely know you personally. The school is diverse and even though there is no party scene on campus there is plenty around campus that would fill that party scene void especially at the U of M which is about 12 mins from the St. Kateâ€™s campus. Highland park is a couple of blocks away and is highly convenient for students with a movie theater, salons, coffee shops, express target, Panera, etc. Being an all girls school there is the culture that women support other women and you do really feel that at St. Kateâ€™s. There are a lot of option for students if youâ€™re searching for a club or daytime activities on campus. The dorm community is supportive of one another even though the environment is quieter."
Graduate Student,5,"This is a great university with amazing resources. They are always available to answer your questions and  advisors are there to guide you. The school is located in a convenient place, close to minneapolis."
Freshman,5,St. Catherine University has excellent staff and they are so very helpful throughout the admissions process. I am so excited for this next journey!
Niche User,5,"Overall I have had a great experience with St. Catherine University. I have applied for there Occupational Therapy assistant program, and they have help me in the best way that they could. I was able to get all of the assistance for all of my questions applying for this program. I'm so ready to start the program and excel in my dream career."
Freshman,5,St. Kate's is a wonderful school! The professors are always willing to help and even ask that you come in so they can help you. There are many benefits to going to St. Kates. They take academics very seriously and have learning centers to help if you need it. Overall the people at St. Kates to everything they can to help you succeed!
Freshman,5,"This is my first year at this University and out of my past college experiences, this is definitely my perfect fit. The professors and advisors are great and I have enjoyed all of my classes."
Junior,5,"I am a new student at St. Kate's University and my experience so far has been wonderful! My admissions counselor has been helpful and she responds to questions and emails extremely quick. I follow a Facebook group with fellow Katies and they always speak highly and are available as well to answer questions about  discussions, professors, etc. so this does bring comfort as well! I am super excited to begin my journey at St. Kate's in their Occupational Therapy Assistant program."
Freshman,5,"The staff is Great!  They are also very attentive to my needs as an online student.
The instructors respond quickly to all of my questions or concerns.  They have  multiple avenues available for communicating.  You can chat, email, or call and actually get a person to assist you.  The support staff continues to follow up with me and assist me as I continue in the occupational therapist assistant program.  They help to ensure I'm registered for the correct classes and ordering the necessary books and supplies that I need for each course.  All the books I have ordered for these classes have been delivered in a timely manner.  I have always been able to obtain any assistance that I need whether it is in regards to the classes, assignments, registration, and future requirements and plans that I need to be prepared for."
Alum,5,I went here recently to get my masters in social work. This was an incredibly welcoming school with great staff. I always felt safe at Saint Catherine University. Thank you!
Alum,5,Incredible and supportive community. I was able to find and create  a strong community here. I was offered ample opportunity to challenge myself and knew each of my professors personally. It was a fantastic place to spend four years.
Junior,5,St. Catherine gives me the opportunity to take ota online so I am still able to keep up with all my other responsibilities.
Freshman,5,"I completely love the campus. The Professors are extremely knowledgeable when it comes to pronouns, sexual orientation, racism, and etc. The campus overall is extremely safe and students are encouraged to be active on campus and are empowered.  The campus also makes sure to have a lot of amazing events to educate students and keep the motivated in their studies. I highly suggest this college for students who want to learn!"
Freshman,5,I like how everybody makes you feel welcomed. The professors actually get to know you and help you in so many ways
Senior,5,I love this school. The professors truly care about your education. The campus is beautiful and safe. The area is easy to get around with or without a vehicle.
Graduate Student,5,I have had a very good experience at St. Catherine University.  I would like to see more diversity there.
Niche User,5,"my sister told me about it, it is really great college. the school is a diverse school, they have so many opportunities. they  have so many things"
Graduate Student,5,Iâ€™m enrolled in the online OTA program and all staff and professors are very helpful and encouraging!
Senior,5,"5 States for the teachers because they care and they really connect with students. From my experience, I have had great interactions with teachers and the opportunities, have gotten great aid and help financially and scholarly, and benefits of being at this school have definitely been worthwhile."
Sophomore,5,I very much enjoyed my first year at St. Catherine University and am greatly looking forward to the coming school year. I felt a strong sense of community at St. Catherine from day one and was extremely grateful to be immersed in such a diverse and open-minded university. St. Catherine feels like home to me  because of the relationships I have been able to make there and the comfortable atmosphere on campus.
Freshman,5,St. Catherine is a loving and welcoming community full of such amazing people! The campus is perfect size for that small feel. People and staff are so amazing and helpful with anything you need.
Sophomore,5,I have loved my time at St. Catherine.  The professors are all very helpful.  Their curriculum is challenging and I am very appreciative of that.
Freshman,5,"St. Catherines is a religious and private college that focuses on academics and success of their students. I have never experienced such a welcoming and helpful place as this school, they are committed to their motto and encouraging everyone from all different backgrounds. Another really good thing about this school is the health insurance that they provide, even though the mandoatory cost added on to your tuition can be an added stress if you are coming out of pocket for payments. They also offer monthly payment plans to help pay for course work, but it seems that if they allowed you to make payments after graduating it would be way more helpful to a full time student. Other than a few minor things that could be enhanced to help low income students, the overall experience of the school is outstanding! The staff and teachers of this school go above and beyond their job titles to make everyones experience extraordinary."
Senior,5,"I felt like I was challenged but I still felt at home.  It was nice being on a small, beautiful campus.  I do wish they offered more science classes in their weekend program"
Freshman,5,"I   am a new transfer to this university and I  love it! All the staff and professors are truly amazing and really understanding, coming from another university where the professors didn't care about their students and if they were actually understanding the material, St.Kates is incredible and such a great place to get a degree from"
Graduate Student,5,"I am a transfer student that has recently got accepted into the online OTA program. I like it so far, my advisor has been very helpful with the process in getting me registered. I am excited about my education while attending the St. Catherine's University Online program and feel I am being guided with all the right tools to be successful. I am eager to get started and have already registered for all my summer courses due to my advisor scheduling a conference meeting this past weekend. I do love the flexibility of the program, it's been a dream so far!"
Alum,5,"I sought a school that didn't waste my money on men's football and I wanted access to a lot of social activities that were not part of the stereotypical ""party"" scene.  How foolish of niche to demote St. Kate for possessing those desirable traits.  
St. Catherine University is a beloved institution to me.  I grew into a strong, intelligent and capable woman in my time there which made it possible for  me to succeed in graduate school at the University of Minnesota, where I earned both an MS and PhD in the field of conservation."
Freshman,5,St. Kates is an empowering community focused on making the best of your future. Professors here are dedicated to helping you succeed and support you with aspirations in life.
Freshman,5,The amount of support from campus faculty and staff as well as peers is so great. Many courses to choose from and my learning experience is always growing.
Sophomore,5,They try to provide many different activities for everyone to get involved in with this being such a diverse campus. Great professors that care for there students and want them to succeed. The cafeteria quality is going downhill and is often hard to find food to eat on campus when you have certain needs or are picky.
Freshman,5,"I love everything about St. Catherine University. The atmosphere, the people, and the focus on education was exactly what I was looking for. I love their nursing program. They not only have a wonderful program, but they also have an a amazing nurse practitioner program. I have only been here one semester, but I have already been presented with so many fantastic opportunities."
Freshman,5,Everyone at St Kates wants you to succeed. They have also been a big help in navigating the admissions process as an adult college student.
Sophomore,5,"The diversity among students and staff was great! Really enjoed learning about others through different assignments and activities in the different courses that I took. One thing I would change would be the events for students and thier families. Most of the event's that were held at school would fall on nights or weekends. This made it very difficult for me to actively participate in most of the events at school, which there were quite a few last fall that I would have loved to be a part of. They other thing that needs work is the parking situation on campus. There are not a lot of spots to park, most are tiny, and when you do get a spot, you may have to walk to the completely other side of the campus just to get to class! Other than those two things, my experience with St. Catherine University has been great thus far. I would highly recommend  this school, especially to those women out there, wanting an education."
Freshman,5,"In High School, I have my top two schools that I wanted to attend are the University of Minnesota and Saint Catherine. At first, I was thinking of attending at the UMN because it's much cheaper than attending a private college for women. That is what I had thought but, University Saint Catherine University is an excellent college for the woman. They have a lot of great programs with a lot of great professors and students. It a small private college compared to many other colleges. However, I feel welcomed by a small community, and everyone is friendly.  I did not regret attending at SCU and wanted to continuing on this path and will have to face many more obstacle in this journey."
Junior,4,The first year of college was stressful and exciting. The staff that works on orientation were very helpful and shared very useful information about safety and budgeting. Another interesting thing about this school is that the students from other colleges are able to take classes here and vise versa.
Junior,4,When the pandemic occurred and our classes were moved online the teacher made sure that every student was able to have access to the class. It is also very useful since most of my teachers record the class session so the students who weren't able to make it can watch and look back on the lesson.
Sophomore,4,I love that it's a college based for women! It's very personable. The professors and faculty are extremely nice and helpful. They want you to succeed
Sophomore,4,"After the COVID outbreak, I had to transition all of my classes online. My experience with online classes was overall Very Good, the teachers were very helpful and the material was delivered in an appropriate and understanding format."
Junior,4,I have had the best professors so far at St. Kate's in my online courses. The teachers of their online courses really seem to have the best understanding of modern college for adult life! They are helpful and understanding when you need something. I have not been in school for awhile and it seems like my on campus professors have less helpful bones in their body for those of us getting back in the groove.
Freshman,4,I loved how inclusive and nice everyone is on this campus. Even though its all girls it doesn't feel that different from a co-ed university.
Freshman,4,St. Catherine University is a unique University with many resources for all students. There is a home for each student here. And professors give direct attention to students. Faculty is flexible.
Freshman,4,It is a very inviting college and a great place to continue education. The education is top notch and I transferred because other schools weren't good at all. I live off campus so I don't have a full understanding of the things on campus residents see compared to me who goes home. I would recommend coming here for a good experience because here you are valued. It is quite expensive and even I have issues paying the bills but they help you manage your life and whatever else you need help with.
Freshman,4,"It is clear that students are St.Kate's number one priority. They show this by giving students the support they need, even if the student isn't officially a part of the St.Kate's team yet. This is shown by the consistency of the admissions and academic counselors."
Niche User,4,"Very expensive, but my experience in my time at SCU was amazing. Great professors, interesting classes, and found my group of lifelong friends. Diversity is 3/5 stars due to the fact they don't admit trans women to the university due to the ""incorrect"" birth marker on trans womens' birth certificates. This is an issue that needs to fixed asap. Most people at the school come from similar financial backgrounds, so diversity in that sense is not varied."
Junior,4,"The professors are amazing and the campus is beautiful.  I have had a hard time with registration and financial aid, but the courses are great and we cover interesting material.  I look forward to graduation in 2021."
Sophomore,4,"St. Catherine University is excellent academically. Professors and other staff do an amazing job of preparing students for the work force and life after college. I would highly recommend this school for anyone who is looking to make a difference, challenge society, and fight for justice for all. The university is inclusive and accepting of all, regardless of religion, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, beliefs, or identity. Although I would like to see more events and community gatherings on campus, I believe that the experiences and opportunities at St. Catherine University are exceptional."
Junior,4,"Almost all of the staff and professors have been great. Going back to college is never easy, but I have had a great experience for the most part."
Sophomore,4,So far I have really enjoyed my experience at St. Catherine's University. One thing that would be great is having open study groups for different subjects that students could go to for help.
Sophomore,4,I'm new to St. Kate's OTA program online. I should begin in January 2020. So far I've had a great experience with admissions and explanation of the program I'm entering.
Sophomore,4,"I love the diversity of St. Catherineâ€™s. Iâ€™ve met so many different people in my first year attending college. The community is very close and welcoming! I would however like to see more activities happen on weekends. When winter comes and it gets especially cold, people start to go home on weekends. I happen to be from out of state, so I canâ€™t go home. I think having more activities to do would motivate more people to stay on campus over the weekends."
Sophomore,4,"I just signed up for classes yesterday as a transfer student.  The staff was very friendly and helpful with the questions that I and my parents had.  If they could not answer them, I was directed to someone who could help.  It is a beautifully manicured campus located in St. Paul Minnesota. I chose this campus as it is one of 3 in the state of Minnesota that offer the DMS program that I am interested in.  It is a smaller college where I hope to receive  a great education and not get lost in the crowd as one may in a larger school."
Sophomore,4,"I wasn't set on any specific college when I started looking, so I kept my options open and St. Kate's was one of them. After a few months been here with St.Kate's, it changed my perspective. One of my number one reason I chose St.Kate's is how it Empower women. I also like how diverse it is and the school always trying to bring students together with many different events."
Junior,4,"I am working as an international admission assistant at St. Catherine university, and I helped many students to get in. Actually, I think that St. Catherine is the place for every young girl to be in. Women education helped me gain confidant, and believe in myself as a women. It is important for every women to feel that way, so we can fight for our rights, and have more women in the industry. What I love about St. Kate's that everyone tells me you will get a great job because you attended this school"
Junior,4,"The experience and diversity at this school is amazing! I receive scholarships from the school, and they are very helpful with students with disabilities, students with financial instability, and student-parents."
Sophomore,4,Teachers are very helpful and knowledgeable. However some classes that are required seemed unhelpful to those with varied life experiences. As a all women college it is very it is very empowering. As a college the food is sub-par like most.
Junior,4,"A very diverse school which is eye opening and nice. There are good academics 
and the classes make you learn and challenge you. There is not much social/party life on campus besides what's put on by groups/clubs."
Niche User,4,"Im an OTA online student, just starting my labs, they have been easy to work with and very helpful in helping me to achieve my career goals."
Alum,4,"I loved the mission of educating women to lead and influence. St. Kateâ€™s cares about feminism and social justice, which is deeply rooted in its curriculum. If you care about the same things, you will enjoy seeing that here at this University. Like every other place, St. Kateâ€™s has its issues that need resolving. Some of these problems have been swept under the rug, which has been disappointing, seeing what its mission statement is all about. Thatâ€™s part of becoming a person here, and not just a student. You learn about the things you do and donâ€™t want to carry over as a leader after you graduate. It is a great school and Iâ€™ve met some of the greatest friends a person could ever ask for. I love that we all support each other in our shared interests surrounding feminism, social justice, sociocultural awareness, diversity, and overall empowerment."
Junior,4,"St. Catherine University is grounded in helping women achieve the highest degree possible. St. Catherine University teachers are willing to help each and every student that they can. This school is full of opportunities and helps students in any way that they can. There medical field is very demanding and has many expectations for students and takes that field very seriously. Even though St. Kates can be very expensive, they help students with Money Management programs and others resources like scholarships to help students pay for there schooling and have ways in which students can save and find ways to help the expense of college a little easier."
Graduate Student,4,I like how there is an online program for a career in Occupational therapy and the program is flexible so you can work full time. The school is also religion based so there are classes youâ€™re required to take that are based on Christianity and I really like learning more about my faith. The program provides some tutoring and resources to provide preparation for licensure once you graduate.
Junior,4,"My school experience is good, but they don't keep up with the dorm buildings that are on historical list. I like the focus on helping their values and the liberal arts in their classes."
Niche User,4,The campus is gorgeous and the ceremonies are wonderful! The cost is ridiculous but I suppose you pay for what you get! There was a financial aid advisor who was the absolute worst and hope is no longer working there.
Freshman,4,"This is only my freshmen year, but I am really enjoying it here at St. Kate's. I love that we are in the city, but the campus feels like it is in the middle of nowhere. If you are looking to go to parties, St. Thomas and UMN are right down the road. The professors are very accommodating and understanding. The only thing that I would want to change is that everyone leaves on the weekend. St. Kate's and St. Thomas are suitcase schools. It gets really quiet on campus during the weekend unless some event is happening."
Freshman,4,"I feel that the professors and faculty really have an investment in me and my education. As a traditionally liberal arts school, I am a little disappointed that much of the school's focus has been shifting away from the fine arts programs, and I do hope that the university gave more focus to what it was founded on."
Freshman,4,"I love St. Catherine University! My aunts went there before me, so that's how I got my love for the beautiful campus. I love the liberal arts program, especially since I plan to become an English major. It's also a good college for people who plan to study nursing and American Sign Language."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy the education I am getting at St. Catherine University. I feel like the professors care on if you succeed or not. I have had a positive experience going to this school.
Freshman,4,"I loved St. Catherine University. Professors truly care and want their students to succeed. The student to professor ratio is very small, so you really get to know your professors. This campus is truly beautiful. I love the fact that I live in a big city, but I feel like I am living in a small town."
Freshman,4,I love St Kates! I only wish that the classes were more affordable and that there were more lab locations for the OTA program. The staff is super friendly and helpful.
Freshman,4,"I love the welcoming environment and how kind everyone on campus is. The classes are very engaging and there's always something to do. Though, I think they can do better with their housing options for upperclassmen. There's nice options, but are limited. Or if anything they can fix up the old buildings."
Sophomore,4,I love the academics of St. Kates -- I don't think I would get such a quality education at a bigger college. The professors really care about you and work with you to make sure everything's going well
Junior,4,The professors are amazing and the campus is beautiful! I always feel very welcomed on campus and there are plenty of opportunities for students.
Graduate Student,4,"I really enjoy my professors and classmates at St. Kate's. I am on the Minneapolis campus, so there does tend to be limited resources (i.e. there is no food service other than vending machines). Otherwise, from what I understand, the St. Paul campus has plenty of resources! They also responded very thoroughly to the shooting in September and are always working toward keeping campus safe."
Freshman,4,"St. Catherine University is one of the most wonderful places to go to claim an education for yourself. The environment is safe and welcoming and there are so many people there to help you through tough times. Everyone on campus is like your family, there is no judgement and they welcome you with open arms. There are plenty of classes and clubs to choose from and there is never a dull moment. Even though this university isn't a ""party school"", there are still many ways to have fun off and even on campus. The only downfall is missing home-cooked meals and being broke half the time, but that's always included in the college experience. Altogether, St. Catherine University is a fantastic place to be."
Senior,4,"Attending St. Catherine University has been an amazing experience. The connections and experiences I have gained changed me forever as a person. There is a real women power culture, and you feel at home when you are on campus. I would recommend this University to anyone who wants a strong and enriching education."
Alum,4,Great professors. Patient and knowledgeable. Class sizes per student was sometimes alot but it worked out ok.
Sophomore,4,The education I'm getting I believe is not comparable to any other school. It's unique and feels tailored for me.
Freshman,4,I have found that tuition is very expensive and it is challenging to come up with the money. Especially when I will be receiving no support from my family to cover the cost of school.
Junior,4,"I wasn't into extra curricular activities, so my review will be based on the professors that helped me through my years here. Most of my professors have been a hit or miss. You have professors who don't really care about you and you have those who do. I really appreciated my professor last semester because she reached out to me and never gave up on me. She really knew what she was teaching and she had ways to help me understand the material so much better. I feel like having professors like that really help motivate me. They make me want to attend class and learn."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I love St. Kates. I'm a social work student, and have had nothing but good experiences with my profs. All of my professors in general have been fairly good. Food could be better, but what college student doesn't say that? Living on campus is convenient, but some places do need an update. Temperature in certain buildings (esp. residential halls) always seems to be off. But I love the diversity and the friends I've made here. It's a very supportive community."
Niche User,4,"Nice college with good classes. Must take The Reflective Woman, a feminist class :)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman this 2016-2017 year. Academics are wonderful. I live on campus and my major is Public Health with a community health worker concentration. I have made wonderful friends and utilized the academic resources given to me. The only downside is that the weekends are pretty dead. However, the surrounding colleges are fun."
Freshman,4,The professors are simply amazing. They are so insightful and give wonderful feedback all the while pushing you to your highest level. They really help you grow as a student and can influence your major of choice. They are so supportive and empowering in their own ways. One thing I would like to see change is more diversity in professors and updated dorm halls for the older versions in the future.
Junior,4,I love going to and learning from St. Kate's. Overall it is a great community and a wonderful place to learn. I feel that I've grown so much as a student and community member here.
Freshman,4,"So far, my experience at St. Kate's has been great! The professors genuinely care about the success of their students and the university is very proud of its history. I would have given it a five but not a lot happens on weekends at school. I'm not a partier but it definitely feels like a suitcase college. Also, I love the all-women aspect since it is all about women empowering one another. However, I do miss seeing the male gender. I wish there were more men who took classes at St. Kate's."
Senior,4,I love the faculty and how they make it a welcoming place to learn. I also enjoy having small class sizes that make hands on work easier.
College Freshman,4,Couldn't have chosen a better environment to be at. Everyone is helpful and welcoming.
College Freshman,4,Filled with great people and a lot of helpful resources.
College Sophomore,4,"While Minneapolis can sometimes feel unsafe, and there are reports of physical and sexual assault in the area, I feel St Kate's Minneapolis campus is relatively safe and there are campus escorts available to students when traveling to/from their vehicles."
College Sophomore,4,"An associates degree for Occupational Therapy Assistant from St Kate's will open many doors for me to work with children, adults and the elderly with disabilities, mental health diagnoses, and recovering from injuries."
College Sophomore,4,I can tell that campus housing is nice at St Kate's but I live off campus.
College Junior,4,I have never felt unsafe on campus. My campus has many emergency placements throughout campus that are easily assessable. The school employs very help security officers.
College Junior,4,"My program is a Master's of Social Work, and this school has one of the highest rated clinical social work programs in the nation. I am honored to be a part of it. The program is also very helpful in assisting in finding internships and completing your clinical hours before graduation."
College Junior,4,"I have never been involved in the Greek life, but it seems the Greeks focus on service in the community and building themselves up professional. They do not appear to have a bad reputation."
College Junior,4,"I've heard nothing, but great things about the athletics at my school. They are famous for their baseball teams, and I'm even friends with a couple of the softball players. The athletes are just like any other students, and are very approachable. The school definitely portrays a healthy amount of school spirit in which the students are more than happy to be a part of."
Alum,2,Not impressed with the education and experience for the price of it. Was told I'd have more resources and support and found the opposite to be true.
Niche User,2,I am enrolled in St. Kate's online program for an associates in occupational therapy assistance. There is very little communication between professors and students. The lessons don't feel like they're preparing you for actual employment and their fieldwork 1 study program was uninformative.
Niche User,2,"My wife just graduated with her Master's in the medical field with over $100,000 in student loan debt to be offered a job in the $50,000 range. I, being a teacher, also only make about that much with similar amount in student loans.

When I e-mailed St. Kate's and asked what their goal was for reducing the burden of student loans on the people who go there, their answer was basically ""nothing.""

Good school with good professors, but do yourself a favor and get a more affordable education. Mine and my wife's economic outlook and potential to do anything remotely reasonable with both our MS level education is abysmal and depressing. Save your money and chose a different college."
Niche User,2,"As someone who had a bachelor's+ degrees I was looking into enrolling in their OTA program.  I spoke with their admission's counselor & sent over my transcripts.  I was appalled, they were going to make me repeat all the prerequisites needed, even with a bachelor's degree for their OTA.  I realized it was a scam & they were not going to work with me.  I decided not to pursue this program."
Freshman,2,"If you are looking for a school that gives you the whole ""college experience"", st.kates is not for you. There is virtually no campus life because there is nothing to do on campus besides sit in your dorm with your friends or walk to the cafeteria. Being that st.kates is all female, you miss out of college football nights and coed activities. I also believe I pay way to much money to go here for the quality of living we get. The dorms are old and cramped (which I know is typical), and the campus food service lacks variety. I do however enjoy all of my professors I've had here. You can tell they want you to succeed, and they are just genuinely nice people. Overall, if you are looking for a safe and quiet school to focus strictly on academics, this may be the place for you. If not, don't bother."
College Junior,2,I rated Greek life as it's bad because the school doesn't have fraternity or sororities.
College Junior,2,Barely any parties. Like I said every quiet campus not a lot going on
College Junior,2,I feel like being minority as St. Kate's can sometimes make you feel like you are alone and will have a hard time making friends.
College Junior,2,I feel like public safety workers don't take their job serious. They have a type of careless behavior. I really don't feel safe knowing that those are the type of people trying to keep us safe.
College Junior,2,Only one offered on campus.
College Senior,2,It's hard to find a job in your major and reaching out to get help was unhelpful.
College Senior,2,"If something goes wrong in you room like mold, it's not convenience for the student at all, it's a hassle. You don't even get compensated for the process fairly."
College Senior,2,"There has been a couple good things about this school. However, most of them have been bad experience. The school brings more stress than is needed. The mission to to inspire young women and stand up for yourself. Being able to get justice and find your own identity. I feel that some faculty on campus don't help with that and aren't good role model. Using a business analogy, as if I was the customer, I would be very unsatisfied customer. There are many things that is wrong with this school and they need to improve on. I wouldn't recommend this school unless you want to be part of a major that school is known for."
College Sophomore,2,"The first year, the stoves were from the 50s. Second year and up could choose to live in the ""apartments"" where stoves were not included, the fridge was mini, and everything was college furnished."
College Senior,2,No parties whatsoever unless you're in with a small crowd.
College Senior,2,"It has been very hard to get the aid I need to go to school here. I am paying for college alone and FAFSA does not take that into account, but St. Kate's is not willing to do anything to help me even though I am struggling to get my extra loans cosigned every semester."
College Freshman,2,"They do not stay open long enough. Also, i wish they had an ice cream machine."
College Senior,2,"Off-campus housing, I would say is not the best. It can be difficult to find housing near the university. Not only that but pricing in that neighborhood is oddly high. Apartments are decent, they lean in favor in your favor if they know you're a St. Kate's student, depending though. But its not easy to get a vacancy or an available apartment."
College Freshman,2,There are no parties that I know of at St. Kates.
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is unfair, and the steps to get in are ridiculous. They aren't culturally accepting, and they keep to themselves."
College Sophomore,2,Too much butter and grease in everything. There also is the exact same thing every day of every week. They almost never change it up. It gets boring really fast.
College Sophomore,2,"When I went last year to ask about internships in my major, Musical Theater, they looked at me as if I was from another planet. I'm very worried I'm not going to be able to find an internship position because they don't have any connections for my major. 

I am the Promotions Manager, House Manager, Box Office Manager for the Music and Theater Department, I also was a tour guide."
College Sophomore,2,"Public Safety is a joke. Their only job is to walk around and hand out tickets to cars parking in the wrong spot, if they can do that! My family got stuck in an elevator and they did nothing. My mom had to call the fire department to get them out."
College Sophomore,2,We have 1 sorority nobody likes because all they do is drink and get money for being in a sorority
College Junior,2,There is one sorority and I don't really know anything about them
College Junior,2,Wasn't much of a night life.  Also lots of dumb quiet hour rules and guys can't stay over night.
College Senior,2,"Since St. Kate's is very small and filled with women there aren't many parties at campus! Actually, there are NONE. Downtown Minneapolis is about 20 minutes away and you can access many nightclubs."
College Sophomore,2,"The cost of the permit was a little high, the tickets are obnoxious especially with the weird hours and limited spots in a decent location. I have found myself parking off campus to get closer to a particular building vs on campus."
College Sophomore,2,There really is no place to get anything other then the cafeteria on the campus
College Sophomore,2,The parking is ok as long as you are early. If you are running a minute late you will not get a parking spot. It's worse when there is an event going on. Then you have to park a distance. I usually have an early morning class and there really isn't anyone on campus yet.
College Sophomore,2,You have to create your own fun. Lots of dorm drinking or off campus partying
College Freshman,2,There is never anything to do and nobody is very social. It does not feel like I'm in college.
College Sophomore,2,"I know very many students who struggle to pay for their tuition. 
St.Kate's is a great school but a great school also comes with a great price tag.
The tuition may not be affordable to a low-middle income student.
The financial aid process may not be a difficult process to go through but 
the amount of aid that is awarded may not be enough. "
College Sophomore,2,"I am in the graduate program, and was told there was no financial assistance for my program. They were rather terse about it, so I really didn't press for more information."
College Senior,2,We are right by St. Thomas and MAC but we do not associate a lot with them. We have the ACTC bus and all but I wish we did more events with them because we are an all girls college. Sometimes there will be ACTC students on campus but we don't interact much and they don't really know much about our campus.
College Senior,2,"There isn't a lot of parties, bars and nightlife at St. Kate's. I'm pretty sure you can find a little bar or something around the area but I'm not familiar with any. I wish that we did provide shuttles and buses to students though just so our students can come back safely from a night of drinking. The best way to get off of campus is to have a designated driver or to call a cab."
College Senior,2,I can't really rate off campus housing because I have no idea where I can even find anything. The school doesn't help student find off-campus housing probably because they want most students to stay home campus. I also do not know many people who lives off-campus at an apartment that is close to campus. 
College Senior,2,There's not much off-campus but Jimmy Johns an Cleveland Wok is pretty popular. There's also a Menchie's here too that a lot of people go to. I haven't really explored the off campus dining but I know at night it gets pretty busy.  I can't say that it's bad but I can't also say that it's good.
College Senior,2,"I haven't heard any complaints about public safety and the use of alcohol and drugs on campus but I have heard a lot about them giving out parking tickets! But, it isn't our fault that the school doesn't make enough parking for everyone and I don't understand why we have to have guest permits or even permits at all! The public safety here is very slow on things and whenever they are called to a scene, they take forever."
College Senior,2,"I haven't don't my internship yet but I heard that many internships were unpaid and very time committed. I guess if you are lucky enough, you will be able to find one that is willing to pay you. I know some of my friends who are at their internship probably almost 40 hours a week and don't get paid a single penny. I know that having an internship is good for your future but how can we afford to pay our student loans and bills if we're investing all our time at an unpaid internship? I also heard that some departments don't do a good job with helping students look for internships."
College Junior,2,It snows alot here and most of the time parking is far so you have to walk in the snow a fairly long distance. They rarely cancel classes because of the snow. Not to mention that they will tow your car if its a snow emergency.
College Senior,2,Public transportation is not sufficient and is difficult to use. ACTC bus only goes between campuses.
College Senior,2,"Saint Catherine University has an only girls undergrad program.  Therefore, there are very very few guys at St. Kate's.  A lot of girls on campus gripe about the lack of men.  Overall all of the girls are wonderful and St. Kate's offers a very tight knit community for a university."
College Senior,2,"It is very hard to find housing off-campus if you are not planning to live there for the Summer.  Much of the housing requires a lease for a longer period of time.  Also, St. Catherine University does very little to help with off-campus housing."
College Student,2,I love St. Kates but parking and walking three blocks in winter isn't really fun.
College Freshman,2,"There are only a few Sororities on campus, but the students who are in them really like them."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Parking is not so great, even if you pay for a parking permit.  If you take night classes, don't bother paying for a parking permit - you can park anywhere on campus permit-free after 5pm.  Otherwise, prepare to hoof it from the main parking lot on the far side of campus, or from 3 blocks away on city streets (most of the immediate streets are city-permit parking only.)"
College Junior,2,Safety is a concern. Worse than other schools. The Minneapolis campus is in a bad area and there is near no public safety around to escort students to and from their cars (no rap to park in). A St Kate's student was raped not long ago in the morning while walking to class from her car.
College Freshman,2,"It's Minnesota.. it's freezing cold like six months out of the year. But other than that, the weather here is great! I love the fall and spring weather. The campus looks really pretty during all seasons."
College Freshman,2,"The nightlife at surrounding schools is great, but there is nothing ever going on at St. Kate's.. sorry but it's true! There are literally no parties and most girls go home on the weekends or are partying/socializing off-campus. It's really no big deal because going off-campus is fun! You just have to be prepared to go out of your way to have a social life."
College Freshman,2,It's sort of ridiculous but it's not a huge deal. Lots of people complain about it.
College Freshman,2,"Most of the facilities are in good shape! Some of the facilities are a bit out-of-date, but nothing is majorly wrong with any of them.. except for the gym.  In the gym, there are literally 8 treadmills.. so if you like to work out, you'll probably have to wait in a line!"
College Freshman,2,"Sports aren't exactly a huge deal here. We do fairly well as a school, but we're not exceptional in anything. We don't have a football team, so there's no tailgating on Saturdays and no big stadium. If you're not a student athlete, you probably won't think twice about the athletic department. Students don't really go to the games unless they're there to support their friends once in a while. We don't have a homecoming or anything. It sort of sucks.. but you can always check out a St. Thomas football game or something."
College Freshman,2,"One of my biggest pet peeves is when the girls here complain about not being able to meet guys, yet they sit around in their room every weekend and/or commute back home to their family. Obviously, it's a women's college, and there are no male students who live on-campus.. so you're not gonna meet guys if you don't go out of your way. But if you do what everyone else does and party/hang out at the surrounding schools on the weekends, you will meet guys. It's actually way easier than you think, and really fun."
College Freshman,2,"I am a woman of color and I feel like some people can be rude. I don't pay attention to them. I have friends who are of different races and it's not like I'm alone. But, there are some times where people just stare."
College Senior,2,"its becoming more diverse with other cultures, but could use more"
College Senior,2,"it snows here, classes are cancelled in the worst of cases"
College Sophomore,2,"St. Kate's is not a large campus, and the Minneapolis campus has terrible parking--they actually recommend parking on the St. Paul campus and taking the shuttle over so you're guaranteed a spot and your car doesn't get broken into. I am not a commuter student, but everytime my family visits we do find appropriate parking quickly. Signage can be a little confusing however. Living on campus you have absolutely no reason to own a car. All amenities are available on campus and we are located on major metro transit lines as well."
College Junior,2,"Minneapolis Campus â€“ There really isn't much at the minneapolis campus other than classrooms. There is a couple study lounges and a cafeteria, but nothing really to do with any down time (like a rec area, etc..). They could also upgrade the bathrooms! Often, multiple toilets won't work at a given time."
College Freshman,2,"Everyone goes away from campus for the whole weekend, and there really isn't that much to do. It's hard to find parties considering that there are no boys and you don't many people of campus"
Graduate Student,1,"This school does not are about its students at all.  The school screws students with financial aid, not advising students correctly, and charging more money than items are worth."
Graduate Student,1,"This school does not are about its students at all.  The school screws students with financial aid, not advising students correctly, and charging more money than items are worth."
Junior,1,"Horrible experience, they will call you nonstop UNTIL you enroll. Then faculty and the professors will completely disappear. I had emailed my professor 6 times over the course of two weeks and she never responded. Then the professor decides to take time off and not show up to class. 
Getting refunded for classes and the insane amount of fees they charge was impossible. If you do get a response from facility they wonâ€™t even read your email they will reply with one or two words and then you are forced to send 2-3 more emails again requesting that they actually read your email and respond. 
They only want your money- do not waste your time with the horrible college."

They only want your money- do not waste your time with the horrible college."
Sophomore,1,The lecturers and Professors in the Occupational Therapy online program are very biased and does not help students to pass. Most of the students  does not have support and they treat white students better than the students of color. If you are a Black Student this school is not for you. The OTA faculty is not a good for anyone that wants to succeed in the profession. They are so strict and not helpful. They charge students exorbitantly and even charge you for fieldwork that the faculty do not teach students during the process. I don't recommend the program for anyone. It is a ripoff.
Sophomore,1,Hated it. Massive layoffs created the horrible staff. Do not come here if you have any different opinions. Felt like high school drama all over again.
Alum,1,"I started my nursing program here at the Minnepolis campus. Faculty was absolutely horrible except a few. I hope they change this program or no one will want to go here, let alone pass the NCLEX."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The reason why I said it's the worst is because we have no Greek life on our campus.  I don't even think there is a sorority unfortunately, and if there is one it must not be that big of a deal because I've never heard of it."
College Sophomore,1,Nightlife? Ha ha ha. There really isn't any to speak of.
College Freshman,1,There aren't fraternities or sororities because its an all women's college
College Freshman,1,I dont really see any parties around here
College Freshman,1,Less food for lots of $. Meal points just disappear
College Senior,1,"There's rules, and it's a hassel if you just planning a little gathering. Not even considered a party. You'd have to get through this process of talking to your Resident Advisor and get everything approved. There's not at all any parties or gathering among the residents. If you're looking for a night scene you will not find it at St. Kate's. The organizations do hold a few gatherings and dances here and there but for academic purposes."
College Sophomore,1,"WE HAVE NO SCHOOL SPIRIT. I am never informed on when there are athletic things going on. Sometimes I stumble into them and go, ""Huh, wish I would have known about that sooner."""
College Sophomore,1,"I had forgotten all about the Greek Life before this survey. AGAIN, they do nothing!"
College Sophomore,1,There is literally nothing to do around here on the weekends. Everybody goes home and so does all of the fun. The thing that people do on the weekends here is study... That's just sad and pathetic.
College Sophomore,1,It's an all girls school.
College Sophomore,1,I only received the aid I did because my parents low income and even the aid given to me isn't enough. This is the 32nd scholarship I've applied for and I still haven't won a single one yet. My tip would be to get a job at 16 and don't spend any money you get until college.
College Senior,1,"I don't see them often and they don't have that many people working. It's kind of sad! Either way, I have always felt safe!"
College Senior,1,"Financial aid department is HORRIBLE! They will not help you! In my experience, they have never helped me and when they have tried, I already knew the answer! Not a huge fan of financial aid. They are also very rude!"
College Sophomore,1,I hate snow and this winter won't end!
College Freshman,1,There is nothing fun to do on campus. You have to go to other colleges.
College Senior,1,"There aren't a lot of spots for people to study especially commuters. The CDC is pretty much empty once it's dark outside. The recreation center is okay, but I think they could expand it more. The library can be kind of creepy but they have small spots for people to study but it's not opened for long. We have a student center but I barely know what it is. I've seen it before but they don't really reach out to the student community."
College Senior,1,"I definitely HATE the dining services on campus. I mean yeah, sometimes they have healthy options such as fruits or a salad bar but they do a horrible job at keeping things fresh. The greens and veggies at the salad bar are all dead, fruits seems like they've been sitting out for a while and the rest of the food they have are just plain greasy! Also, the dining room closes at certain hours while the Pulse opens up. But it gets so busy at the Pulse that commuters like me who has to catch the shuttle, have to wait 15 mins just to buy an already made sandwich."
College Senior,1,"There are not a lot of spaces for commuters to park their car. I mean, there are already a lot of people living on campus that has cars so us commuters are left with the spots that are far away. Parking permits are also very expensive!! But we have no choice but to purchase them because there are parts on the street where you have to have parking permits too or else there are very limited areas where you can park without a permit (plus they are far!). "
College Junior,1,The St. Catherine Minneapolis Campus is no located in a very safe part of Minneapolis. I wouldn't recommend going to the clubs out here.
College Sophomore,1,"This school doesn't have a nightlife.  After 7pm you will hardly find anyone even out walking around.  There are no parties and the closest clubs are not very clean or safe.  If you are looking for a nightlife, you will have to go to a different school on the weekends."
College Sophomore,1,"The Residence Hall Association is very strict about polices. RA's are held to very high standards and are not able to be lenient for risk of losing their position.  No guests are allowed to be unattended in the halls.  This means that if you live in a dorm without bathrooms you have to walk your guests to the bathroom.  Also, if you are caught with drugs on campus you will be kicked out of student housing and not even allowed to return as someone's guest."
College Sophomore,1,"The college will NEVER be closed, regardless how much it snowed. But that's Minnesota for you. The professors individually though are generally more understanding and care for your safety--so as long as you email them ahead of time, you should be good to go."
College Freshman,1,The campus dining system is AWFUL compared to other schools because of the ridiculous prices. Meal points go very quickly; you may even need to get two meal plans per semester so that you don't starve. The food itself is actually above average-I wouldn't say it's bad at all! The prices just suck. I wish we had a buffet-style system or something.
College Freshman,1,"There is NO ""Greek Life."" There is ONE sorority, but they're not a typical sorority at all.. they don't even have a sorority house. Not trying to put them down or anything-all the girls in it seem super nice, and I'm sure they have a lot of fun! However, if you're interested in the typical sorority life (i.e. going to parties/exchanges, hanging out with frat guys, etc.), don't look here."
College Freshman,1,"Since I am taking bus to school, weather has a huge impact on my campus experience. my arrival time depends on the bus schedule, which is dependent on the weather when a storm hits."
College Senior,1,parking is horrible!!!!  If you cannot afford to pay for the ramp you are trying to find street parking and walking a long way to campus
College Junior,1,Almost non existent on the weekends if you're under 21
College Junior,1,The computers are very old and slow. I've found tech support to generally not be very helpful.  The internet in the res. halls is also very slow. Often it is hard to connect.
College Sophomore,1,"FIXX is the school's facilities that you call when something is broken. It can take weeks for them to come by unless you call daily and irritate the heck out of them. My heater was broken my first year and it took them nearly a month to come and give us a space heater, which normally aren't allowed. Normally, this wouldn't be terrible, but St. Kate's is in MN, and we had a corner dorm with windows that wouldn't fully close until they fixed them. I love my school, but this is one thing I would want to change."
College Freshman,1,Hard to Get There â€“ St. Kate's Minneapolis campus is hard to get to and isn't known for their parking. The traffic getting there is horrible.
College Sophomore,1,"Impossible to find an on-campus job â€“ If you aren't assigned an on-campus job as a freshman, it's nearly impossible to find one. They promote KatieClick where people post jobs but nobody ever posts and it's mostly for graduated students. Even asking around, bosses will say ""We only hire freshman"". The campus is so small that there are probably only 200 spots open at the beginning of every year and if you don't get one, you're out of luck for your entire college career."
College Freshman,1,It can get expensive to have a car on campus. Freshmen can't have one unless they petition the school to. There is very little parking on campus. But having a car is almost a necessity.
College Freshman,1,"Nothing Here.... at All â€“ We do not have sororities... Well there is one sorority, but it's not like your typical sorority, it's more like a volunteering group of women."

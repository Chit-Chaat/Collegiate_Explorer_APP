Niche User,5,"A ""small, diverse, private, Catholic [college], with a large commuter population,"" Iona College is known for ""its proximity to New York City"" and its ""quality of education,"" all delivered in a picturesque suburban setting. In many ways, students say Iona features ""the best of both worlds with the suburbs down the street in one direction and downtown city in the other."" Iona's ""beautiful, quiet"" New Rochelle campus ""has that New England feeling to it"" but offers big city opportunities. Students at Iona feel like they are ""getting the most for [their] money."" Many flock to the school for its excellent business school and generous scholarships. Iona combines ""a great commute,"" ""a beautiful, loving campus,"" and a ""warm, welcoming attitude."" Professors at Iona can be hit or miss. As one student says, ""I found that the professors that taught me my major were professional and well-organized. The professors teaching the core classes were mediocre at best.‚Äù"
Freshman,5,I have taken most of my classes online due to covid. Most of the professors help you feel welcomed and open to opinions to make our experience better.
Freshman,5,"I love my school, it provides me with all the tools I need to aid my education. The professors are very well versed, in all aspects of their teachings. The academics and curriculum are perfect for me, the right amount of homework and tests."
Freshman,5,"I was able to visit Iona last Fall.  The experience was very rewarding.  I am from Long Island, N.Y. and the Campus is close enough if I decided I would Like to enjoy a Home Cooked Meal.  The size of the Campus also impressed me.  The Dorms are located across the street from the Campus and the campus itself was very inviting.  I am very involved in Bagpipes and Iona has a great Bagpipe program.  I also play Ruby and Iona has a Ruby club team.  I cannot wait for the Fall to get here so I can start my College experience at Iona."
Sophomore,5,"Iona is a beautiful campus and offers a variety of courses to help each student figure out what they are passionate about.

The professors and staff in the advising and financial offices are extremely helpful; you will never feel alone."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Iona College. I am enamored by the college. I love almost every aspect of the college. If you plan to only do academics, the college has a great number of courses for the academic path you choose to follow, and the professors are well-educated in their field. If you choose to get involved with sports, Iona College has a great number of sports teams you can do tryouts for."
Niche User,5,"I have been following Iona since my Junior year in high school, it's been a school that has shown their interest in the students and that's what I want in the college I would be attending. They have helped me by giving me easy access to their campus and helpful sources to know more about their academics and student life"
Sophomore,5,"Not too big, not too small. A little preppy but not over the top. I like my classes and learn a lot from the profs. I'm 1/2 Italian and 1/2 Irish so appreciate the pizza nearby. Mostly Catholic classmates, friendly and generally nice. Good community overall."

To anyone who is thinking about attending Iona college , i totally recommend this school . You will have the best 4 years of your life ."
Niche User,5,Great Catholic school. Academics are good and nice atmosphere. Lots of places to eat just near campus.
Freshman,5,"I love Iona! There are so many opportunities to take advantage of and all of the staff I've come in contact with is super friendly and understanding. There are opportunities to work on campus, clubs to participate in, nation and international mission trips each aimed at helping communities in different ways, a career building center, tutoring center, and more!"
Sophomore,5,"Very easy to get involved! Professors are very caring and want to see their students succeed. There is never nothing to do on campus,  students always want to be doing something."
Freshman,5,During orientation every student at Iona College treated the incoming freshman with respect and answer all our questions.
Senior,5,"Iona College has granted me a lifetime of opportunity through the education and experience that they have given me. A small campus, but everyone is friendly and open to meeting new people and building lasting friendships. There is almost nothing that I would change about my experience here."
Niche User,5,I loved the family atmosphere and how everyone was friendly on campus. There are so many clubs and activities to stay involved and meet new people easily. The factually are very approachable and understanding.
Alum,5,"This college is most comparable to a family. Students of all types and characters fit in. The professors care about you and want you to succeed. Everything is beautiful about the school and is dominated by students from around the New York metropolitan area. Also, the new dorm is state of the art. This is a place where you can succeed and meet incredible people, both in the classroom and out."
Junior,5,Great diversity with exceptional class sizes. Iona offers so many connections to get your career started!
Freshman,5,Iona is a very excellent school. The campus is very clean and nice. It has a small class size so students can have a better chance to communicate with the professors.
Freshman,5,"Iona College is not just a college but is genuinely a community that feels like family. Going to a school with so many different types of people, I feel like at home despite the variety of people at the school. Iona puts their students in an enthusiastic and motivational environment where the students get to join many programs and take part in fun activities. Not only do I feel at home at Iona, but I feel like i am apart of something bigger."
Freshman,5,"When I first applied to Iona I didn't really know much about the school but now I feel like I can write a 2 paged essay about it and my experience. I am from NYC so anything else that isn't the city is foreign to me. I have learned so much through the people I have met and the caring professors. Every single staff member at Iona College insures that every student is safe and their needs are met. At Iona you are not just a number, you are you and you will never feel less than that."
Freshman,5,Iona is a wonderful school!!! The staff is fantastic and extremely helpful.  They will guide you every step of the way. The campus is beautiful and very safe.  You can walk to restaurants and stores - walking distance a plus. I feel very comfortable being here and the students are great! There is always someone to lend a hand. I'm very proud to be a student of Iona.
Sophomore,5,"I personally find Iona College to be a great fit for me. The faculty is always will to help you in whatever way they can. It's in a very nice area that has plenty of things to do. No place can be perfect, but Iona is as close as one can get."
Sophomore,5,"For the past two years at my stay at Iona, I have learned so many things. Not only will you learn academic wise, but you will you learn about other people and develop lots of ethical values."
Freshman,5,"I currently attend Iona College as a Freshman.  I enjoy the student, it seems like there's an event happening everyday; never a dull moment. The academics are somewhat on the higher scale, but there is a huge acceptance rating. Currently I am an A student, but I do put  in the work. Attendance is required here, and missing 5-6 classes will give you a F (Fail) in the class. There are 2 (3) dorms freshman can be put it, although it is not impossible to be put in one of the others if doing a suite. East Hall is the nicest of the freshman dorms, perhaps all the dorms, except the recently built North Ave Dorm. "
College Sophomore,5,There is always someone available for sexual assault victims. During oriention they also gave us a small lesson in what to do if we ever become victims or if we see someone who is about to become a victim.
College Sophomore,5,"I have not experienced it yet, but I have heard it is good."
College Sophomore,5,"Overall I love this school, teachers are good, classes offered are great, class sizes are perfect. the only issue is the food, we need more variety and vegetarian/ vegan options."
College Sophomore,5,The dorms are comfortable and they are convenient for the students. It is located right across campus and the housing process is simple as well.
College Sophomore,5,The school receives wonderful fan support from the students and others. the teams perform at their highest level and there is plenty of school spirit as well.
College Sophomore,5,The school is wonderful and so is their staff. The campus looks great and so far my experience has been great as well.
College Freshman,5,Mostly sports houses have the best parties. The frats and sororities have a lot too. Day drinks are the best.
College Freshman,5,The school spirit is very high. Basketball and rugby have big turn outs.
College Freshman,5,Sports at Iona are apart of the experience MAAC Champs!
College Sophomore,5,"At Iona we are the only non Ivy school on the East coast to have an indoor rowing tank. Not only is that incredibly impressive, but our gyms are beautiful and are redone every few years."
College Sophomore,5,"Finding Iona was a godsend. I really was only partially considering going here, but once I stepped on campus I knew that this was home to me. I am excited to be on campus, and try to be as involved as possible."
College Sophomore,5,My major was ranked #2 in the US for return on investment and (depending on graduating GPA) can provide me with advanced standing for grad school
College Sophomore,5,"Love the courses I've taken because they're different. 

Some professors do a discussion based class, some do lots of online/take-home stuff, some lecture, some are very interactive. The diversity makes each class exciting. We also dive into a lot of current topics, no matter the class-which makes me feel prepared to enter the real world.

There are lots of diverse classes in the majors, but not for the core. The core are the basics, like psychology, math, philosophy, english. But the MOST amazing thing in my opinion is how willing the professors are to meet. Every single one of my professors emails back and forth with me and is always willing to meet for extra help. They love to see that the students care."
College Sophomore,5,"For the 2016-2017 year- Iona will have six resident halls. There is housing offered for all four years, so seniors don't have to worry about being kicked off, but most seniors like moving into an apartment to ease the transition from college to the real-world. 

East Hall is a freshman dorm that has almost all doubles and some triples. It is 3 floors, has A/C, a kitchen, and a clean laundry room. Since it is communal bathrooms, they are cleaned very thoroughly 2-3 times a day! Because of the small size, it is known for making a tight-knit community with two lounges. It is also in the center of campus.

Loftus Hall is a freshman dorm that has suites of two rooms that are doubles. It is 10 floors, has A/C, a large kitchen with microwaves on each floor, an a huge laundry room. It has one bathroom per suite that needs to be taken care of by those in the room. There are also two lounges and a prayer room.

South and Conese are dorms for sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Both are 6 floors with A/C. Both have suites that include three rooms of doubles and one triple. Each suite has a common room with a fridge, freezer, couches, sink, and stove. There are two bathrooms per suite that the residents of the rooms take care of. 

Rice is the oldest residence hall and it is almost all singles but the farthest from campus. It is also the only hall without A/C but has the communal bathrooms cleaned 2-3 times a day thoroughly.

As of the new school year, a new residence hall will be completed that will be for sophomore, junior, and senior students. It will have A/C and suites of two doubles, or four singles. 

There are also houses in the area that students can rent, along with apartments."
College Sophomore,5,"I personally LOVE Iona. It wasn't my first choice, until I came for the tour and now I am the happiest I've ever been.

I say this because I had went to both public and private school before and felt that the private school had a more community feel- where you always have someone who's got your back. On the tour, I could tell the students walking to class would be yelling ""hi"" across campus and people proudly wore their club/team T-Shirts. With that, there's a train station in walking distance so I can go to the city anytime I want for $7 (and it's only a 15-20 minute ride). 

The nightlife is perfect because there's bars to go to or sorority/fraternity/sports houses to go to every few weekends. It's the type of school where you don't NEED to go out, but there's the opportunity if you wanted to! 

The workload is not hard, either. You'll get essays every few weeks (sometimes every few months HA) and the professors have office hours and will literally give you a good great just for visiting/showing you care. 

Basketball and rugby games are a blast to go to, and the campus is BEAUTIFUL- brick buildings surrounded by trees that bloom pink flowers in the spring and have the New England fall colors in autumn.

If you get involved- IT'S SO EASY TO MAKE FRIENDS. The people who don't enjoy Iona NEVER GOT INVOLVED! If you want to make friends- join a club or team you like or do the mission trips (Student Government, Biology Club, walk-on rowing team, Baking Club...trips to Peru, Africa, New Mexico...).

Small schools will always become more of a home than big schools, and the location and atmosphere of Iona makes it the perfect college experience."
College Freshman,5,The academics at Iona college are the best for many reasons. For instance the professors put in great effort to make sure student understand the content. Also the workload isn't to heavy which allows students learn and practice concepts and ideas much more easily.
College Freshman,5,The saftey and security are very good and i find it very hard to believe if anyone was mugged or beaten up by a stranger.
College Freshman,5,Greek life is encouraged a great mount and it is very easy to become part of one if one wishes to.
College Student,5,"My school is amazing! I love the friemds I have made! I love how Iona helps keep the commuters involved. I would not want to go anywhere else because  I know, at Iona, I am home."
College Sophomore,5,"I am very pleased with the school that I attend, Iona College. I have got the chance to meet with very helpful professors and they continue to help their students outside the classroom, and for that I am forever grateful."
College Freshman,5,"Iona has a beautiful campus, everything is close to each other so you won't have to worry about getting lost much or walk to buildings that seems like it takes forever to get to. The faculty are friendly and helpful. Orientation day did a good job with helping students get to know each other with organized groups and activities, as well as introducing us to the college system. Can't wait to attend this fall!"
College Freshman,5,The food selection is amazing
College Freshman,5,"I have a great nightlife at Iona. Every Wednesday through saturday lots of people go out. Me personally, I went a few Wednesdays but every single thursday-saturday"
College Sophomore,5,I love the business program
College Sophomore,5,"great roommate, classes, people and location."
College Sophomore,5,Iona is known for its business program.
College Junior,5,I will be living off campus and I love the place I am moving into!
College Junior,5,I am from Maryland so it is easy for me to get home using the Gael Express (Iona shuttle) and getting to the train station.
College Senior,5,"Feel very prepared for grad school, love the teachers"
College Junior,5,Excellent especially if you're a business student
College Junior,5,"Everything is convenient and nice, except Rice Hall."
College Junior,5,"School pride is major here, especially with basketball. Almost every sports team here is good and is nationally recognized."
Senior,4,I love it this school but slowly my love is disappearing. Great professbut the school always worried about money
Senior,4,Online is not as bad as I thought.  Professors are willing to work with you. I wish zoom wouldn't freeze or kicked people off though.
Senior,4,"I like how small Iona College is. It's not overwhelming like a big university, it's comfortable and breathable. The atmosphere is as if you were home, which is why so many people adore Iona College. It's friendly, inclusive, and quaint."
Senior,4,"For my first three years, I took all the in-person classes. Of course, due to COVID-19, the online learning experience was new and unsettling because I, and thousands of other students, are used to the traditional in-person classes. Regardless, my professors made to make the Zoom calls as if we were in class, which helped me succeed."
Alum,4,I liked the campus and the friends I made outside of class. Also like the local spots to eat off campus.
Freshman,4,"Iona College is a great, small, Catholic college in the New York Metro. The campus is beautiful, with 45 Acres for the students to explore and learn. The food is okay, normal cafeteria food, but there sometimes is a surprise in the dining hall. I've made a lot of friends here, and we are like a family. The professors are always there to help, and are very approachable. I am a Criminal Justice/History Major. I picked the school for it's famous Criminal Justice program. I believe that I will have the right materials for my career(s). I do however can say that Loftus Hall, the freshman resident hall, is outdated, and does need a renovation. Security is on another level, being the best I've ever seen. I do also believe that the heating and air conditioning in Loftus could be fixed, as well as a MAJOR renovation for the bathrooms in dorms.
Despite that, I really love being at Iona. I can stay here during the week, and be able to get home Via the Metro North and LIRR in 2 hours."
Freshman,4,"Overall Iona College has a pretty chill atmosphere. it's a small college; the majority of classes are under 30 students. You'll see similar faces on a day to day basis across campus. Academics-wise, it depends on your professors for the semester. There always help on campus, in academics, health, mental and emotional, etc.  

bonus: it's easy to get into the work-study program"
Freshman,4,Its a wonderful institution to attend.  Professors and staff of this college are friendly and always ready to provide you with assistance. The campus is beautiful and accomodations are being tended to which can be seen with the construction of a new business center. This school has a great student comunnity with many sports teams and clubs that students can be appart of. Iona is a door way to coutnless opportunities and a great place to recieve your college education.
Sophomore,4,My first year was amazing academically and I made amazing connections with professors and other students. The downside was the size of the campus feeling a little too small sometimes but otherwise super convenient.
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Iona is the resources that they have. The school always makes sure the textbooks for every subject are up to date and have current information. Also, how some teachers and staff members want to see you succeed. They offer extra help and they give lectures and advice on how to deal with the stress for the college atmosphere. How to deal with the stress, balance your time, and give tips on how to study your notes and write your notes for class."
Sophomore,4,"What I most like about Iona College is the size. If you‚Äôve come from a small high school like I have, you‚Äôll appreciate the atmosphere that this school presents. There are no more than 25 students in a class so you have the opportunity to form a relationship with fellow students and the teachers. The faculty and staff are quite helpful too. The area is really nice and not too far from shopping areas."
Freshman,4,"Through the few months I have attended Iona, I have been able to get a feel for what the next four years will be like. One thing that will catch one's eyes immediately is the campus. The campus is very well kept and has a mix of modern and neutral style architecture. The professors are serious about their work and are willing to help any student at any time. The only department I see a downside in would be the math department. From my experience and what I have heard, professors seem to be rude, intimidating, and not willing to help. Having difficulty is always normal and always available are tutors for any help with class work or extra help. Students at Iona are friendly, willing to talk and become friends. The only downside I have noticed with Iona so far is the diversity."
Senior,4,"Iona College is great for students who love small class sizes and can interact with professors. The student environment is friendly. Our plan offers an off campus selection which is great, but more money is placed on campus. The food on campus is not great quality, and the school only offers $10 a day on campus. It is not enough money to eat 3 meals, so I eat breakfast and dinner."
Junior,4,"Because it is a small school and their focus is the business program, the science facilities are lacking. I would like to commend the professors they hire. With a small school environment it is extremely easy to build connections and relationships with many of your professors. Also for that reason, it is easy to get extra help in difficult classes and succeed as an overall student."
Junior,4,"The campus is huge and super beautiful. Here at Iona you really feel at home and there are countless friends to meet. The student community is very friendly and I do not regret being a part of this wonderful institution. The courses are challenging but the resources offered at this college are top notch which makes it easier to handle classes. From the libraries to the computer rooms and even the student lounges, Iona offers many locations to make students feel comfortable while they work or study or even just want to hang out. Iona College has been a truly fun and intellectual experience for me to have."
Senior,4,"No parties, small school. Everyone knows everyone. This can be great or horrible. Once winter hits no one is outside."
Junior,4,"So far my experience with Iona has been well and I truly enjoy being at the school. The thing they lack most in is student aid. I know many and have been a victim myself in the lack of help and the difficulty in getting aid. The school itself is overly expensive and many struggle just to pay for it. Once in the school, it is very challenging to get any more help and when you do transfer none of your credits transfer as well. Iona College credits are just recognized as their credits and its hard to find a school that would take these credits"
Senior,4,"I like that I have met a diverse group of people and that Iona has a lot of activities and chances to meet them. In addition, I like that some activities are either discounted or free for students along with off campus meal options."
Freshman,4,I love the environment. Everyone is so friendly and always ready to help you with anything. The professors are always accessible and want you to do well.
Sophomore,4,"The professors are actually very good, but certain rules the school has imposed such as submitting an eportfolio‚Äìa subsmmission of an already completed assignment‚Äìis a bit ridiculous. If you like small sized Liberal Arts college in a diverse suburban/urban setting, Iona is the place."
Sophomore,4,"Iona College is a great choice if you want to attend a college where the professors know your name, care about you and your performance in their classes, need any additional help for any of your classes, or just want to attend a pleasant and safe college."
Senior,4,"Students at Iona are able to develop long lasting relationships with their professors which helps with a range of decision making from course of study to career path and even personal development. Small class sizes allow students to really take advantage of this network opportunity as well as acquiring thorough knowledge on their field of study. Improvements can be made on the detailed majors available to students. For example, Accounting students can benefit even more by having a program focused on Taxation alone."
Sophomore,4,"Like any college, your experience is what you make of it and I know from getting involved in a number of clubs and activities that anyone who is serious about college will learn a lot and have a great time at Iona."
Graduate Student,4,Iona College is a great school! It's a close knit community and very spirited! It's easy to get involved and meet people. Class sizes are small and you always have access to professors if you need help. It's an awesome place to be.
Alum,4,"Great campus feel, tons of activities and great college town. The classes are small and allow you to get to know your professors. Over the years they have built more of a dorming community but there is lots to do for commuters or dormers. The dorms could be bigger but it is college after all."
Niche User,4,Fairly diverse student population; very extensive liberal arts programs; very good sports and athletic rep and teams
Freshman,4,I like the amazing and understanding teachers that know us by our first name and not as an alumni due to the teacher to class size  ratio as well as the small campus that gives us the opportunity to get to know one another on campus.
College Freshman,4,"Sports teams at Iona College are exciting. The teams are very competitive and sitting in the bleachers, watching them, makes it worthwhile!"
College Freshman,4,"2 months ago I had no idea I'd be attending Iona College. Today, I am a freshman who's very happy with their school and could not love it any more! Iona College is the perfect school for anyone looking for a small-sized school with a community-like feel. The students are welcoming, the staff always greets, and most importantly, it's fun! Gael nation has made it very easy to enjoy academics yet still being able to attend the soccer games and events!"
College Freshman,4,It's really beneficial in making friends and helping others out
College Sophomore,4,All the professors are very helpful and are concerned and are willing to help you pass if you put in the time and effort.
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is good for the students who dorm and for the commuters that are close and have a car because things can get hectic during rush week.
College Sophomore,4,I made a wise decision in going to Iona College everyone is friendly and they professors are great !
College Sophomore,4,"Alumni are an active community at Iona College, internships and jobs are opportunities available for those who reach out for them and seek the help of those surrounding them."
College Sophomore,4,"College is exactly what I had imagined, with life on campus, class styles, class sizes, courses offered and professors."
College Sophomore,4,"Before entering college, we are asked to take a mandatory course based on prevention of irresponsibly drinking and  alcohol leading to sexual assaults."
College Sophomore,4,"Life on campus teaches you multiple values aside from being independent, helps you unite with those from different ethnics and cultures, you open your mind up to many options and opportunities."
College Sophomore,4,"As a D1 school, sports play a big roll on campus life, making you feel apart of the team as well. Chanting and shouting is just all apart of the school spirit!"
College Sophomore,4,"It's exactly the college experience I was looking for. The opportunities surround you wherever you go, there's no way of falling into the wrong path when there are brothers, teachers and advisors to guide you every step of the way."
Recent Alumnus,4,Campus safety is very well aware of all students
Recent Alumnus,4,Great school.Administration staff very helpful with application process and very understanding
Recent Alumnus,4,Cant wait to attend this fall
Recent Alumnus,4,dont know much about the sports yet
Recent Alumnus,4,"Great school, professors that pay attention and help students"
College Sophomore,4,"I think if you are involved within Greek life you do a lot throughout the campus, but even if you are not apart of Greek life it does not affect you socially or anything. Yuu can still go to their parties and have friends that are involved in Greek life"
College Sophomore,4,"I did not take advantage of the gym as much as I should have or the club sports, but the games that I did go to there was clearly a lot of energy going on throughout the gym"
College Sophomore,4,People are not seen on campus drinking openly. If they do drink its where they cant get caught
College Sophomore,4,The tripple rooms suck cause there isnt alot of space but everything else is good
College Sophomore,4,I guess greek life is good here. I dont know much since I'm not apart of one
College Sophomore,4,Great school! Small so you'll know almost everyone and the location is great for students who want to experience the college life and the opportunities Manhattan could offer.
College Sophomore,4,Greek life brings a positive feeling to the social atmosphere of campus.
College Freshman,4,"Most of us go to the bars, which are either right across the street or a five minute cab ride. The parties are fun when there's big ones Day drinks are the best. Theres always something to do."
College Freshman,4,There are a lot opportunities for Iona students because it is close to the city and they have a lot of connections.
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy my classes, not too difficult if you show up and do the work."
College Freshman,4,"I came to this school because they gave me the best finical aid package so it wasn't my first choice. My first semester I was hellbent on transferring, but then I started to get involved and I have made so many great friends here. Everything is close and convenient. I commute right now but I crash in my friend's dorm every weekend. I am going to dorm next semester because I really enjoy it here."
College Freshman,4,You will certainly leave Iona with a job (and a lot of debt )
College Senior,4,Campus security has a role on campus and I feel safe. There is good communication between security and students.
College Senior,4,"Athletics is a huge part of my college's atmosphere. Many students are involved in team sports, and those who are not on teams are often huge supporters and show spirit at the games."
College Freshman,4,"From what i heard and read in emails Iona College preps their students for the future. For example, they have resume workshops, career development, job/internships preparations and much more relating to future jobs a student may want after graduating."
College Freshman,4,"Iona College has a sense of community and is very involved with the community. From what I have seen and experienced Iona College have great professors and faulty. Not only that, they care."
Sophomore,2,Iona is a joke. They are trying to become a University or something so they let everyone in. Half the school is made up of morons or potheads.
Senior,2,"I really liked the ""family"" atmosphere of this school. I really would like for more faculty members and other employees to be more concerned with students than with the money they make off of these students"
College Senior,2,"There were some job expo events, but I did not experience any help in getting jobs or internships."
College Sophomore,2,"There is no 'official' Greek housing, but there are always houses that have mostly or only sorority/fraternity members in it. Most of our Greek life is local, so if you are thinking about joining for future networks it may not be the best choice. Most Greek organizations are nice, but a few of them keep to themselves and don't really interact with non-Greeks."
College Freshman,2,Unfortunately the rating says it all. It is bad and by bad I mean that I went from a 4.0 student with straight A's and B's to a student with straight C+'s and a D. The grading is unclear in certain aspects and the professors have an undeniable knack for trailing off topic and confusing the subject.
College Freshman,2,"I came into the school with high hopes of a good education and a good social experience, being the first time I'm living independently from my parents. However, as the year progresses I find more and more that the school has over sold itself. I find myself sitting in a class not understanding what the professor is saying because it has no relevance to the subject matter they are teaching. I find myself getting deplorable grades when I once used to have a 4.0 average. I find myself falling into slumps that hinder my academic career. In the end if I could go back and choose a different school I most certainly would. In fact I am transferring after the close of this academic school year."
College Junior,2,"When it comes to the financial aid proces,  it's a bit disorganized. I had a really tough time with them and trying to figure out exactly how much I will be receiving. I wanted to transfer out plenty of times but I'm almost graduating so it doesn't make sense now. I will just be another college graduate with way too much student loan debt while they are sitting pretty building a new dorm I helped payed for.."
College Freshman,2,"I'm not a fan of parties, so i stay indoors when they are happening."
College Freshman,2,There are hardly any parties
College Freshman,2,I don't really like the people here except for the one's I hang out with of course. People seem like either they hate you or they really like you
College Freshman,2,NEED MORE PLACES TO PARK
College Freshman,2,there should be more variety and better quality
College Freshman,2,not much to do at night especially in the winter
College Freshman,2,I strongly dislike DU and do not think they have any positive impact at Iona or the community.
College Freshman,2,There is not much to do unless you throw parties yourself or are over the age of 21.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Between limited off campus parking and the constant announce of parties being busted, the strictness level was high. "
College Senior,2,It it fairly easy to be connected on campus and computers are very accessible at computer labs.
College Senior,2,There is access to alcohol for students. I have not noticed any drug activity but cannot say that there is no drug use on campus.
College Senior,2,The parking is usually pretty good and there are spots available.
College Senior,2,Students are nice and friendly when approached.
College Senior,2,The campus shuttle could come more frequently. There are times around early evening classes where there is no shuttle between the train station and the school for about 45min!
College Senior,2,Campus strictness is very strong about alcohol and drug use.
College Senior,2,"Since I commute and there is sometimes a wait between transportation methods, really cold days are pretty bad."
College Junior,2,Night life is not something to really look forward to. There are rarely parties unless you enjoy hanging out in the dorms and when there are school parties hardly any students attend.
College Sophomore,2,"one of the worst overall college experiences I could possibly have. Although I did do well academically and enjoyed most of my professors, it felt like High School all over again. Not to mention the social/party scene was very poor and the student population is very cliquey and arrogant"
College Sophomore,2,nothing special. greek parties are short and minimal
College Junior,2,"The first year I received a decent amount of financial aid, but it has decreased the passed years. I need more of a scholarship and with the grades I have I know it should be offered but no one is willing to help."
College Freshman,2,"Though the topic of diversity and acceptance is popular around campus, there isn't much diversity throughout the campus. The student body is made up of predominantly caucasian students. There are many programs on campus, especially throughout the dorm life, to promote diversity and acceptance though."
College Freshman,2,"I can't really rate the parking at Iona very well as freshman and sophomores are not allowed to have vehicles on campus. The only students who are allowed to park on campus are seniors and juniors, commuters of any year, and those who have a valid reason to need a vehicle on campus (i.e. work). But I do know a few freshman who have car at the school who find parking on side streets near the school."
College Freshman,2,there are attractive girls here. but they can come across as very snobby and cliquey
College Sophomore,2,Commuter School College ‚Äì Iona College is mostly a commuter school which explains why there is little to do on weekends.
College Sophomore,2,"There are some options, but it is incredibly repetitive which is expected. It is overpriced. Its very hard to eat gluten free. And weekend hours aren't great being that only the snack bar is open on weekend and doesn't open until 11 so if your up early on weekend and you want to eat and get something to drink you have to go off campus to get it."
College Sophomore,2,"When I first came to school here at Iona I was very excited to get started and as time went on I noticed that there was never anything to do at night, it was a very rare occasion to go somewhere within the New Rochelle area (most go to Fordham). I hated the on campus dining and the off-campus dining was okay at best. Professors that I had, were actually really cool and nice, most of them were laid back and easy going. The only thing I did enjoy besides the professors I had, was the rowing program. Which kept me going and excited throughout the year."
College Freshman,2,"Punishments Are Strict. The police around the neighborhood are strict about underage drinking. Also the college does not allow underage drinking but if students do it discreetly without getting caught, they will not get in trouble."
College Junior,2,"This past year, the school began to offer transportation to downtown New Rochelle. It drops students off at the train station and Marriott.  The best bet is to have your own car on campus if you want to travel the Westchester area.  Metro-North is nearby to get into the city, but it can get expensive if you plan to frequently visit the city."
College Junior,2,"Frequently Forget They Exist ‚Äì Iona has several sororities and a couple fraternities on campus.  None of them have an actual house, though.  On top of this, most are just found at Iona College.  They put on events now and then, but I frequently forget they exist on campus.  It is possible to go to the school without ever seeing the affects of Greek life."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is not huge at Iona. Most students in Greek life generally host parties and are not typically involved in other clubs or organizations on campus.
College Junior,2,"Iona's Greek like if next to abysmal. Hazing is rampant in both fraternities and sororities. They do not understand what it means to be brothers and sisters. The men are stereotypical ""frat"" guys. The sorority girls tend to be a little two faced. There are some great people in the organizations for sure, but as a whole they all fall short. The only hope is the new fraternity starting on campus-Iona's chapter of Pi Kappa Phi. This is a group of gentlemen, very respectful guys looking to change this negative image of Greek life at Iona"
College Freshman,2,"The Department Is Helpful ‚Äì I feel that the mass communications department is great, but the tv club (ICTV) is absolutely horrible. It is sad they the department does not put any money or effort into the program."
College Senior,2,"Not Very Diverse ‚Äì This is a mainly Caucasian college. There are some African-Americans and Hispanics, but there are not many to speak of in general."
Niche User,1,A waste of a school. the drop out rate is incredibly high and everyone who goes there actually hates the school. Most of the teachers have no idea what they are talking about. The administration also loves to charge students ridiculous amounts of money for no reason. Screw you Iona. DO NOT GO HERE.
Freshman,1,so pretty much all i gotta say is my roomie and i called iona about what the options are for us to be in a more private space because we have anxiety and the lady on the phone rudely said ‚Äúthat application closed june 15th.‚Äù and we said ‚Äúhow were we supposed to know this we didn‚Äôt receive an email‚Äù and she said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt send email to freshman. they‚Äôre expected to look this all up on their own.‚Äù also she told us since double rooms don‚Äôt exist (which they do) & since we didn‚Äôt fill out the application WE WERE NOT AWARE OF on time  ‚Äúyou guys will just have to deal with it.‚Äù like i‚Äôm sorry but i wasn‚Äôt aware that  anxiety goes away after june 15th? the staff here really need to learn how to gain some people skills.
Sophomore,1,"School is small and cliquey. The professors act like you are still in high school, take away phones, get frustrated when you ask questions, etc. I would not recommend this school to anyone unless you want to be fiercely disappointed."
Junior,1,Being a minority can be a little tiresome at points but overall it is easy to deal with.  Overall experience depends on the person and who you know.  I believe that my experience could have been better if there were more diverse things to do on campus as well as more diverse food and groups to get involved with on campus.  Some students do feel and see the difference and if that is improved I can say Iona will be a better school for all of its students.
Sophomore,1,"It isn't worth the money or education. They really are unorganized, also there math and science department really sucks."
College Junior,1,"If you party, they write you up, if you don't, you have no friends"
College Junior,1,"If you party, they write you up. If you don't, you have no friends."
College Junior,1,"If you are liberal, you're screwed"
College Junior,1,"They are horrible and never help, they are huge fans of victim blaming"
College Junior,1,"This is the worst possible school to attend, you will get raped or sexually assaulted and no one will care, in fact, they will blame you."
College Junior,1,"Campus living is the worst decision you can make in your entire life, you'll get rape and they will yell at you and blame you"
College Sophomore,1,The people who work there hate there job and are nasty.
College Freshman,1,Athletics are decent. Only big thing is the mens basketball team. Nobody shows up to the games most of the time. No school or team pride. Very boring.
College Freshman,1,"Horrible. If you like to party don't come here! it's more of a bar school so you basically need a fake and even then the bars are very sloppy. as for the house parties, they usually get broken up early and are usually overcrowded and unpleasant. I'm going through a 2 month party drought. It's that dead here. It's horrible here. it's like a ghost town on the weekends. big commuter school"
College Sophomore,1,"The Internet is a big thing now in our generation and IONA does NOT deliver in that department. Be ready for super slow speeds and dropping almost every other minute. Oh and by slow, you will never be able to open a new page before finishing 10 essays and having grandchildren."
College Junior,1,"Greeks Frowned Upon ‚Äì Yes we do have a Greek life on campus but because we are a catholic school and the ""Greeks"" are notorious for their initiation processes our school administrators do their best to keep Greek life very low key. Unless you are on campus during Greek week or club day you would not even know we had a Greek life."
Recent Alumnus,1,"It depends on where you live for the dorms, but the Residential Life staff is completely irrational, they make absolutely no sense in their decision and they will do anything to make you pay money. Whether you did something or not."
College Junior,1,"The only downside about Iona. They give you a little money but the college is about $40,000 a year. If you can afford it go for it, but you will most likely take out loans so put that into consideration. The school does not give out too many scholarships at all only for academics or athletics and even that is still not enough."
College Senior,1,"It is unbelievably difficult as an ""adult learner"" to get any kind of real financial aid or assistance through college. Through my own investigation, however, I found that if your parents have a lot of money, you get more financial aid from Iona then if you are lower or independent. I spent most of my semester finding how to pay for college because many of the same opportunities were not afforded to me."
College Senior,1,"Poor Housing Choices ‚Äì It is hard to live off campus as an individual, and to find an apartment is hard for a good cost because locals know they can drive up the price for private apartments. Iona also likes to cram as many people into one apartment as they can.  If an apartment has two bedrooms, except 4-5 people to live in that one apartment."

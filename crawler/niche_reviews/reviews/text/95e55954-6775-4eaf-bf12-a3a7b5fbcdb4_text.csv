Sophomore,5,"Last spring semester was kind of a mess. Professors were given two weeks to upheave all of their plans and convert them to an online format. The professors did the best they could, and it showed. Again, no complaints against any of the professors."
Freshman,5,Professors are very welcoming and understanding. Most of the professors respects students wishes on working from home or from their dorms. The hybrid schedule works really well for those who want to stay at home or go to class.
Junior,5,"I like that there are many clubs that you can join. The community is kind but the school could be more diverse. The classes are small and the professors are understanding and hands on with all your needs. The school could lower the price, update the dorms, and make better food."
Alum,5,"Some of my very best memories come from my days at Witt, along with plenty of personal growth. Witt gave me the opportunity to compete in a varsity sport, pursue a double major, do research in my field, join a sorority, assume leadership roles and more. I can't express enough how much I value my experiences, the professors who believed in me and the network I joined. To this day, I keep in touch with so many of my friends and professors, and draw on the skills I learned and developed at Witt. This college offers a great overall value. The professors and all the faculty and staff will do whatever it takes to help you succeed."
Niche User,5,"I like the whole university as a whole, The diversity, I took a tour when I was a freshman and I loved the tour."
Freshman,5,It's a great place and the administration seems like they really care about their students. The campus is really pretty and the people are very nice. Also the local places to eat at are the best.
Alum,5,"I am forever grateful for the amazing liberal arts education I received at Wittenberg University. Wittenberg taught me to be a better thinker, writer, problem solver, doer. It prepared me for whatever life could throw at me. It's a small school for sure, but that's part of the beauty of Wittenberg. A small community that feels like family. Professors with who are willing to meet with you one on one to advise you and help you figure things out. Small class sizes and classes taught by PhDs. You can see the beautiful campus. But the real beauty lies in the people at Wittenberg -- both faculty and students"
Sophomore,5,"Let me say this about Wittenberg. The academics here are incredible. I have learned so much and have grown so much as a student. There are so many opportunities to study abroad, research, and get to know your professors on an interpersonal level. The committed professors and generous scholarships are why I'm sticking with Witt. 
I have always felt welcomed by everyone at Witt and it is easy to make friends. There are plenty of clubs and organizations to join. Greek life is much better here than at big schools. Tiers really aren't a thing and there are large frats (Phi Psi, Delt, Beta) and small frats (Delt Sig and Lambda Chi) to choose from. All of the sororities are huge. Students are generally friendly but since it's a small school, gossip spreads fast."
Alum,5,"I had an excellent experience at Wittenberg.  Coming out of New Trier HS, I was looking for a smaller school that was rigorous academically.  I felt challenged and supported there- great environment."
Freshman,5,I love Witt! they are so inclusive and on top of everything and super helpful to incoming college freshman.
Freshman,5,"Wittenberg University has helped me to break out of my ""shell"" and truly find who I am. My advisor and professors on campus are very supportive of helping me to figure out what I want to do and the steps to get there. The campus is so welcoming and has pushed me to do things I thought I would never do, like join a sorority! I have a campus job, a great social life and  interesting classes. I believe Wittenberg is doing a great job of preparing me for my future."
Sophomore,5,No changes it's an awesome University.  The facility and programs are great.  There many opportunities for students.
Niche User,5,"I really loved how beautiful the campus was, and how welcoming the students are. The students at wittenberg are always open to making new friends and talking to new people, which is really nice as a new student. There are so many things to get involved in, and the classes are awesome."
Freshman,5,"I really love this University! I wouldn’t go anywhere else. This is a very fun campus that also is very educationally involved. A lot of students drop their first year, due to academics. But if you stay, you are given so many opportunities here. The job placement rate is extremely high! The athletics here don’t disappoint us either. I would recommend this campus to people who like to work hard but love to have fun."
Alum,5,"Wittenberg University gives you the small-town atmosphere while at the same time providing you with a useful, well-rounded, liberal arts education. During my time at Wittenberg, I was part of numerous clubs and organizations that provided me with life-long connections and friendships. I truly feel as if I would not have had that experience anywhere else. I loved obtaining an undergraduate degree in political science from Wittenberg University."
Alum,5,"Wittenberg University encourages its students to become leaders within their community. Over 4 years, Wittenberg has given me the confidence to pursue my dream of becoming a doctor all the while allowing me to conduct research with faculty members, hold leadership positions in clubs, participate in a varsity sport, be an active member of my sorority and to play in the school's chamber orchestra. The teachers here are incredible and are willing to help you in whatever way possible."
Freshman,5,"My experience of Wittenberg University has been fantastic, It's a small liberal arts school and the environment and social climate around campus is refreshing in more ways than one. You can get to know almost everyone and no matter what they are always friendly."
Sophomore,5,"Wittenberg University is a place where you can grow as a person. it is a small University where you can get big leadership opportunities and enhance your leading ability which will help you later on after you graduate. As  an African American in middle of deep south Ohio, it was hard for me to adjust to the environment at first. during my first Semester, my daily routine was to  wake up  go to class, get some lunch, and study before I go back to bed. On my second semester I realized that there are a lot of people like me who came from the city that can relate to my story. and once I start to do some activities and start joining organization i start finding people who can relate with. wittenberg is a place where you can tailor your social life and that's and get your self out of your comfort zone to challenge your self mentally."
Freshman,5,"I am really loving my experience here at Wittenberg. It is a pretty diverse school, the staff and students have helped make the transition for me a little better."
Sophomore,5,"This institution allows for so much growth, knowledge, and development for everyone who is a part of the Wittenberg community. I am proud of the experiences I've had and that I have seen on this campus, and I am very impressed with the acceptance and family-like spirit that is almost tangible within the school."
Sophomore,5,"I love Witt; from the intimacy between professor and student throughout the less than 2,500-student population on campus to the fact that there is always something to do on campus, no matter the day of the week, I love every bit of Witt. Since it's a small school, the professors really know their students (i.e., the student is not just a number or an assigned seat to them), and the students (myself included) feel very welcome to approaching their professors for help and questions.
There is never a dull moment on campus. We have singing and dancing groups as well as a bunch of different sport teams and intramural sports. On top of that, every Wednesday, there is a trivia night hosted by a faculty member and usually other fun activities (Witt Wednesday). The school is very well-diversified and has a lot to offer academically and extracurricularly. Needless to say, aside from the social perspective, all of the school's facilities work wonderfully for their respective purposes."
Freshman,5,"I am the second  member of our family to attend  Witt, my brother graduated spring 2016 after 4 years. The professors are extremely  qualified and easily approachable. The student body greets everyone whether known or not. My brother was a 4 yeat varsity swimmer and was tight with all the students. Although i chose not to follow him in pursuing  athletics ( I am involved in theater) I did follow him into the Greek system. I love Witt, my brother cried after graduation while cleaning out his  house, which I am sure I will do.
Tiger up"
Alum,5,"Witt was a great experience for me! Great faculty, good friends, beautiful campus, close-knit community, excellent opportunities off campus and especially abroad. Everyone should spend a semester or summer abroad or off campus. Witt does expect initiative and creatIt's. Not everything is handed to you."
Freshman,5,"Wittenberg University is a fantastic school with a ""home feeling"". The professors here really want each student to achieve to their greatest potential and really enjoy having close relationships with students.  Lastly, everyone here is really nice."
College Freshman,5,"So far all the college professors at this school have been very active and knowledgeable in their fields. Therefore, I feel as if I will learn much from all of the professors that I currently have and will continue to learn much from future professors."
College Freshman,5,"I really like where I'm at and the bonus is that I'm right next to the food! Plus I'm really not that far from my class, so I don't truly mind walking."
College Freshman,5,Everybody loves what their doing
College Freshman,5,It's a great school and everybody is willing to help you and get to know you.
College Sophomore,5,"I think Wittenberg University is a fine liberal arts college. The professors here expect a lot from their students, but also offer just as much. They take a personal interest in each of their students and are always willing and open to help, or even just talk! The course quality is also quite high - being a small university, class sizes are also quite small. This gives students more chances to be recognized as a name, rather than a number. I came to this school wanting a ""hands on"" and personal education, and that is definitely what I received."
College Sophomore,5,"We have a career center that helps students find jobs on campus, off campus, internships, and eventually, jobs. I have only gone once, but the one time I did, they set me up on a site that would help me find a potential job in the future. They gave me names of alum who had graduated with similar degrees for connections, and answered all the questions I had."
College Sophomore,5,"The best thing about Wittenberg University is its professors - they are extremely engaging, helpful outside of class as well as in class, and actually care about their students' problems and success."
College Freshman,5,Greek life plays a huge role on campus and is viewed as a positive thing around the campus. There are plenty of sorority and fraternity housing available.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The academic load at Wittenberg is difficult, but the professors are easily accessible and always willing to help students succeed."
College Freshman,5,There is a lot of variety in courses and every professor I've had has been very knowledgeable.
College Freshman,5,"We're around a bad neighborhood, but nothing happens inside the campus. We only had one incident on campus so far this year."
College Freshman,5,The value of a degree from here is like going to Ohio State (unless it's performing arts).
College Freshman,5,"There are always parties Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. The biggest parties are usually on Saturdays but sometimes the Friday parties can overshadow Saturday. There is almost always multiple open parties that anyone can go to. All the frats throw pretty awesome parties (Beta, Delt, Delt Sig, Phi Psi, Fiji) but sometimes sports teams will get in on the action too (Swim, Lax, Volleyball, Football, Baseball). The biggest party weekends of the year are Homecoming, Halloween, Witt Fest, and St. Patty's day."
College Freshman,5,Witt is a bonafide D3 party school.
College Freshman,5,"Wittenberg is premier D3 athletic department. Almost all of Wittenberg's teams are competitive within the conference and many are competitive on a national scale. Wittenberg has won multiple national championships in Football and Men's basketball. However, more recently Wittenberg has become well-known as a Volleyball school. The Women's Volleyball team won a national championship in 2011 and returned to the national championship this year. The school also created a lot of buzz by adding a Men's Volleyball team to begin competition this spring."
College Freshman,5,"The campus health center is very helpful and convent to get to. Also, the Witt police are THE BEST. Unlike most schools, Witt students have a really good relationship with the campus police. The Witt police respect the students' right to have a good time at college and almost always look the other way unless you're doing something really dumb."
College Freshman,5,"Greeks are a huge part of life at Wittenberg. A lot of people get involved with Greek life and the campus' ""social scene"" revolves heavily around the greeks. For the most part, there is not really a distinction made between Greek and non-Greek students."
College Freshman,5,Wittenberg is an incredible university from an academic stand point. Your entire academic experience is geared towards helping you grow as a person and helping you find what you are truly passionate about. The professors are absolutely incredible and genuinely care about your learning. Overall the work load is by no means overwhelming as most students are involved with many other things on campus.
College Freshman,5,"The alumni network and internship opportunities at Witt are extremely valuable tools. In terms of internships, Witt is located between Dayton and Columbus so students are able to capitalize on internships in both major cities. The alumni are also extremely active and helpful, especially in the business field."
College Freshman,5,The professors at Witt are what set this school apart. The professors are extremely knowledgeable and active in their fields but are also FANTASTIC teachers. You won't find bad-professor horror stories at Witt.
College Sophomore,5,"I love Wittenberg. Almost everyone is genuinely nice and fun to be around. The classes are apparently challenging for some, but I think they're pretty easy (but still very in-depth and reasonable for undergraduate level courses). I'm a member of the Greek Life on campus, which is wonderful. I meet many people, and I know there will always be someone there to help me if I need it. But even for those not in Greek Life, the feeling is the same. I know that my non-Greek friends will always be there for me, and I can even go to my professors or other faculty or staff at Witt and they will help with whatever I need. This campus is really just one big family."
College Freshman,5,I could not be happier with my choice to attend Witt. Witt has somehow exceeded my expectations and has proved to be the perfect place for me. I would 100% recommend Witt to anyone.
College Freshman,5,"College is insanely better than high school.  But being a small school, Witt just allows so many opportunities.  I love the school and I love the people and all the opportunities that are open to me just for coming here."
College Sophomore,5,"Wittenberg University became home when I first stepped foot on campus. The combination of incredible professors and faculty along with the amazing student body created a welcoming, warm feeling. Everyone here has their different passions and I love that you can follow those passions to places you hadn't been before. A huge aspect of Witt for me is my team. I am a part of Wittenberg Swimming and Diving and our team is family. Deciding to attend Wittenberg is one of the best decisions of my life- I can't imagine being anywhere else."
College Junior,5,"I am completely content with my decision because even though it's costly to go here, I have definitely grown as a person. Everyone here is majorly involved and the classes are not simply challenging, but thought provoking. I enjoy the fact that I can have a class full of 30 students or a class with less than 15 students and the professors actually notice if you don't show up to class. I know there are elements of the big school experience we just can't have here, but there are always people I haven't met before, things to do on-campus as far as extracurricular activities or night life. Plus, Greek life has been a huge reason for my love of Wittenberg. Tiger Up!"
College Sophomore,5,"Wittenberg has become my home. It is a great community - both your professors and fellow students genuinely care about your success and well being. Being at a liberal arts school has opened me up to topics I had no previous interest in, and has given me the opportunity to have the student-teacher relationships I want as a result of small class sizes."
College Sophomore,5,"Going to Wittenberg was a choice laid out in front of me, my dad worked there which meant my tuition was paid for. It was a no-brainer to attend. I wouldn't change it for the world. I have met some of my best friends there and have the greatest memories of just hanging out and being silly with them. But, most importantly, Witt feels like home. Whenever I step on campus, its like a warm embrace and a hardy welcome."
College Sophomore,5,I got scholarships and they apply every semester  and is very smooth.
College Student,5,Best athletics you will ever experience.
College Sophomore,5,Springfield has a variety of places to live in and these places are all affordable on a student budget
College Sophomore,5,Wittenberg administration lays down their rules very thoroughly and employs both student and adult administration that are fun people that can also be very serious about regulations on campus.
College Sophomore,5,My tuition is covered completely. Everyone I know that attends this school has received at least some level of scholarship money that covers a majority of their tuition expenses. The only things that I have to pay for are outside food expenses and travel.
College Freshman,5,"The party scene is eminent here at Wittenberg. If you are not keen to party people, stay away."
College Freshman,5,"The school policies really are beneficial to the students, our well being is the most important thing."
College Freshman,5,"Declaring a major or minor is very easy, and it is possible to drop or add at any time (within reason)"
College Freshman,5,I LOVE IT AT WITTENBERG
Freshman,4,The staff here is very nice and welcoming. It is easy to make your self at home here. The schools staff is very accommodating and if there are problems with any the are so great with getting things solved. Not matter how big or small the problem is.
Senior,4,Wittenberg is a great school. The professors are some of the best professors that I have had the privilege of meeting.
Senior,4,The online experience was okay. My professors were super helpful with the transitioning from traditional classes to online classes.
Junior,4,My online experience was alright. I was assigned more work than usual because the professors had to compensate for the hours that we were not in school. My professors called to check up on me and my studies as well as make zoom calls. The experience with online courses has been good so far.
Sophomore,4,"The school is very diverse, the people are kind and there are many resources both academically and athletically that are involved in your school life. On top of that, the campus is beautiful and you get personal attention from professors."
Sophomore,4,I am trying to be an education Major and all the professors have been helpful to where I want to be.
Sophomore,4,"This school is very beautiful and the campus is easy to get around. The professors are super sweet and the classrooms are decent size so they get to know you pretty well over the course of a semester or year. They always are available and have posted office hours. The students are all very nice and 40% of the campus is greek life. The housing system has an honors floor and a substance free floor along with a gender inclusive floor so everyone feels comfortable. The diversity could be better and their could definitely be more representation for other races on campus. The language and culture departments host lots of events to celebrate other cultures, but it’s rare anyone attends unless they’re specifically interested in that study area. Overall, it’s a fun campus and i would recommend."
Alum,4,I had great professors and excellent experiences working in a variety of nearby schools. The professors pushed me outside of my comfort zone to grow.
Freshman,4,"I'm a first year at Wittenberg and I can say it is a great school.  It has a great atmosphere, the teachers are always willing to help, and you know almost half of the campus.  The academics can be hard, but if you ask for help from our math lab, or the writing labs they will help. Partys do happen. If you feel unsafe to drive/walk back from somewhere, drinking or not, you can call tiger transport or wittpd.  They will take you anywhere, free, and you won't get in trouble as long as you are not so intoxicated you can't walk. The cafeteria food is not good, they only cook good food on rare occasions. The food in post and the science center, our on-campus cafes of sorts, have good food but you will have to pay for it unless its a meal swipe.  While there are some bad about Witt, the teachers do care and try, the academics are great, students are mostly friendly(there have been some diversity and racism issues with a select few people), and social life is pretty fun."
Sophomore,4,Wittenberg University is a small private college that really emphasizes on the student teacher relationship in the class room and outside the class room when you have questions.
Junior,4,"Wittenberg is a miraculous place. The environment is very welcoming, and the people are great. It may be a small school, but that is part of the beauty of it. You can meet someone and see them around campus, whereas if it were a larger school you may see someone and then not see them for a long while. I enjoy the fun activities, sporting events, and all the dogs on campus! The 4paws program is a wonderful thing that Wittenberg does. The only thing that I would change about Wittenberg is to have a better selection of food in the Dining hall."
Graduate Student,4,"Wittenberg University is a great place to learn about yourself as a young adult and for you to grow, evolve and change free of judgement. Professors and staff are quite supportive and always have your best interest at heart. I do however wish the college was more stringent on student advising . Getting a good adviser is really a hit or miss which is unfortunate for those who have terrible academic advisers. It really is a college where you get what you put in. There is alot more academic flexibility which can either be your downfall or pot of gold. Their health majors need more structure and need to deviate a bit more from the liberal style majors."
Freshman,4,"Wittenberg University is a small university, but the people you meet are friends for a lifetime.  the professors take their jobs serious and help tremendously.  this community is like home."
Senior,4,"Wittenberg University is a very welcoming place. From small classes to friendly faculty, and overly involved students there is always something going on for you to discover."
Alum,4,It was truly a unique college experience and I couldn’t have asked for better. The price was extremely expensive but the professors were top class and the class size meant that you got plenty of one-on-one time with each instructor. The Greek life was a vital part of the campus and added to experience.
Sophomore,4,"It's been fabulous! Everyone is extremely kind and friendly to one another. There's something called ""the Witt bubble"" because once you're here, your life kind of revolves around it!"
Niche User,4,It's a pretty nice school overall. I was born and raised in the city so it was nice being close to home.
Junior,4,"Wittenberg is a small liberal arts university. Here, there is a strong family feel; everyone knows everyone, or has at least heard of them. Everyone rallies together through good times or worse. The university as a whole is big on traditions, and Wittenberg has many unique ones. There is a place for everyone at Witt, and it is a place everyone calls home."
Freshman,4,"My year here at Wittenberg University is great! If your looking for a small local school, this is the best choice to consider in my opinion. The campus life is excellent, there's lots of activities to be a part of and the students here are very easy to get along with so it is very easy to make new college friends. The professor really work with you, and you can have your individual time with them as well if you don't understand the topic at hand."
Niche User,4,"Wittenberg is a very nice university with a great reputation and great opportunities. It has a large number of academic opportunities, clubs and athletics programs. These programs are strong in tradition and success. The campus in easy to maneuver and located in the center of Springfield Ohio.  I would like to see the university make attendance more affordable."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, this University is quality. It lacks much LGBTQ+ representation, but there are many people of color on campus. The professors are known nationally for their quality - many of them are Fulbright Scholars - and for good reason. Professors go out of their way to help you, and most of them have accessible office hours - and if not, you can make an appointment."
Niche User,4,"I took classes at Wittenberg University as a College Credit Plus student when I was in high school.  The campus is really beautiful- especially in the fall!  The professors had really flexible office hours and were fairly easy to get in touch with.  Witt offers a wide variety of classes, and they had lots of resources to help students succeed."
Freshman,4,"So far in my first year of attending Wittenberg University I have been exposed to many things that I otherwise wouldn't have been exposed to at a non liberal arts school. The people on campus are extremely inviting and although the campus has less than 3,000 students it feel a lot bigger. The only major disadvantage to coming to Wittenberg is the cost of tuition, which can easily be lowered with the amount of scholarships and grants the school gives. I would definitely recommend this school for any student looking for a exceptional liberal arts degree and to make close relationships."
College Freshman,4,Once again only my first week but I get the vibe that if I wanted to join I would be welcomed with open arms.
College Freshman,4,So far my experience has been worth choosing this college.
College Freshman,4,I really think I will like them.
College Freshman,4,I like knowing I'm safe
College Freshman,4,I love living on campus I have acquired a few new friends.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of sports here to choose from
College Freshman,4,Everyone I've met so far has been helpful and great
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, Wittenberg is a very safe campus. The only downside is that we are located right next to the population that lives in Springfield (""Townies""), who will enter campus every once in a while. Most of the time, however, they do not cause any trouble. There is an escort service to pick up people at night, or if they feel endangered, and can be reached any time. The campus police often bike around campus and are pretty nice. (Just from having a conversation about some sketchy guy they had escorted off campus)"
College Sophomore,4,"Our housing is overall pretty good. I have been a little spoiled, living in the newest hall on campus (New Hall), but I lived in Tower Hall last year, and it was not all that bad. My room was bigger in Tower, but New Hall is cleaner and prettier. Woodlawn is the all-girls' dorm, Firestine is considered the ""athlete"" dorm, and Ferncliff is pretty far from everything (but a beautiful building). Myers is the honors dorm, but does not have air conditioning and has oddly shaped rooms. The cost of living is relatively high (lower 2K for doubles in everywhere except New, mid-upper 2K for singles and rooms in New)"
College Sophomore,4,I honestly do not know too much about athletics at my school - I know that our football team is one of the best when it comes to D3 schools. Our volleyball teams also do very well.
College Freshman,4,"Campus itself is somewhat a bubble, i feel completely safe on campus.  Although the city of Springfield raises a couple causes for concerns."
College Freshman,4,"Although I am only a freshmen, I am aware the great networking Wittenberg has in the real world.  I take proud in knowing my whatever degree I choose to pursue, graduating from Witt is a prestigious accomplishment."
College Freshman,4,"There are a verity of classes to pick from, the only negative i have to say about academics is the amount of Gen-Eds that are required. Class sizes are small, which makes for great relationships with professors and help is very accessible."
College Freshman,4,"Wittenberg is a great university, that offers the best in academics as well as a great social life."
College Sophomore,4,Since the first semester I have been working in schools which has allowed me to network within the community and find possible jobs for the future.
College Sophomore,4,I love that I get to work individually with my professors and that they show an interest in how the course pertains to my own major.
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is a huge part of Witts campus and creates great bonds within the community. It allows people to find a home apart from just being a Wittenberg tiger.
College Sophomore,4,Witt is great because I am challenged academically and encouraged to partake in various activities and organizations
College Senior,4,The alumni network is extensive and very helpful in future job opportunities and in giving back
College Senior,4,50% of the campus if Greek
College Senior,4,Witt has been a great experience!
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are a lot of opportunities to do research with professors, especially in biology. I was got to work the US Forest Service for the summer."
Recent Alumnus,4,Greek life is big on campus and inclusive. You don't need to join to be involved in the events they have like a 3v3 basketball tournament or dinner.
Recent Alumnus,4,Wittenberg is gave me the education needed to get accepted to graduate school.
Recent Alumnus,4,Wittenberg has a great athletic program. Every sport seems to always do well during the season and many go far into the post-season.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I enjoyed most of the courses I took, and nearly every professor I had at the university was very friendly and helpful."
Recent Alumnus,4,I believe that the degree I received from this school is valuable and will help me find a job.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Greek life is very important on Wittenberg's campus; though those involved do not look down on those who are not involved, the experience is wonderful beyond measure."
College Freshman,4,They rock.  Always there to help and answer any and all questions one has.
College Freshman,4,"For the most part, people are very excepting but there are always a few who don't agree with the rest society."
College Freshman,4,"From what I've experienced, our school tries there very hardest to keep each other safe and from harm.  However, I do know sometimes it happens, but for the most part people work hard to stand up for one another."
College Freshman,4,I love it. I love it all.
College Freshman,4,"Wittenberg University is a well rounded school, because we are a liberal arts school.  This was one of the main reasons I picked to go here.  I am able to gain expierence and learn information that broaden my horizons and help me see the world differently.  Wittenberg offers lots of programs to help me learn and grow as a student and also help the community to give back.  The campus continually makes one not want to leave because once you make friends (it's impossible not to) you will not be able to live without them by your side.  Wittenberg makes you grow as a person in many ways."
College Freshman,4,They work very hard to help you.
College Freshman,4,"Resident life is really good, but when living with a large group of people, the bathrooms get dirty and people can be loud quite often."
College Freshman,4,People here are really into athletics.
College Junior,4,"I feel like there isn't much crime on campus and that the campus police are very responsive and active in keeping us updated on crimes going on near campus. I feel pretty safe on campus, however I tend to watch around by myself at night, which can be a little creepy because not all paths are well lite. It's nice that the campus offers on-campus transportation after 6pm, which is around the time that it gets dark, especially if you're out studying late and don't feel quite safe walking back o your dorm or campus house."
Freshman,2,The school is going down hill. The recently fired a lot of professors with no explanation and it leaves the rest of the students and faculty wonder if it has to do with the multi million dollar athletic facility that cost way more than the school expected. If you are not from Ohio or Indiana this is not the school for you.
College Freshman,2,"Not the best facilities and not the best school setting. More of a place people go to party, not learn."
College Freshman,2,"The campus food isn't that great, I realize that it is college food but there aren't many healthy options at the CDR. The workers don't seem to care that much about the quality of the food they prepare/serve. You $100 in Witt Gold to spend at Post95 each semester but it runs out quick and for the ""price"" of some items you don't get very much."
College Senior,2,"Witt requires students to live on campus all four years unless they live within a certain mile radius, and for good reason. The immediate Springfield area is kinda sketch and very run down. Witt owns most properties within a 2-3 mile radius from the main campus, including residence halls, apartments, and bi-level houses. These are well taken care of and well-worth the money. (All Witt housing can be subsidized… aka they give scholarships to live in them!)"
College Junior,2,I don't care for it.
College Junior,2,I am a Biolog major and although I know it was going to be a lot of work I wish I had a better perception of this when I was a freshman. I did not take the classes I needed freshman year or had the help and this put me behind.
College Freshman,2,"In the brochures it says the people are great, but they're really good only if you're their type. They're little kids afraid of outsiders bursting their Witt bubble, and I could throw most farther than I would trust them. Athletics and classes are good though, despite some processors."
College Freshman,2,"Unless you know the right people, you WILL be bored out of your mind."
College Freshman,2,"there aren't a lot of quality, cheap restaurants to eat out at but there are good places your parents can take you and good places you can afford. we have chipotle and panera so i think we do alright!"
College Freshman,2,"Campus escort is always available, I'm not sure exactly how it works but its free."
College Freshman,2,"Can't say I know much about it. Freshman and sophomores are required to live in dorms. There's tons of student housing really really close, all owned by Wittenberg (including apartments) so its well taken care of and affordable for students. Lots of housing outside of Witt's grasp is available as well."
College Freshman,2,"We have a great football team for D3, I don't know much about the athletics to be honest but if you don't want to participate you don't feel pressured and if you do then its a fun thing to do."
College Freshman,2,"Since McMurry's burned down, the next closest bar is Ruby's, which is a pretty good walk. Houseparties here can get pretty bumping, but after a while it gets boring seeing the same people. Parties usually consist of people getting really drunk in the back yard, and then couples dancing until university police come and clean it up."
College Freshman,2,"Mc's burned down, and the only real place to go is Ruby's, which is way too far. The houseparties here are mainly people standing around drinking, and couples dancing, but nightlife here gets boring after about 2-3 weeks. "
College Sophomore,2,You can walk anywhere you need to get to around campus which will be good exercise because there are plenty of hills but when it comes to getting around town off campus you need a car.
College Freshman,2,"The majors at Wittenberg at the moment are unorganized.  We are in the process of eliminating many majors and minors, also trying to rid the ""create your own major"" program.  It is sometimes difficult to stay on the four year track depending on your major."
College Freshman,2,It's Ohio and everyone knows the weather is very unpredictable. The college does its best to keep the sidewalks cleared off so you dont have any problems getting to class. The buildins are all very close so you dont have to go to far from place to place during bad weather.
College Sophomore,2,"Bring Your Car – If you really want to get around springfield, i would highly recommend bringing your car down. there are few taxis and buses"
College Sophomore,2,"Boys Are Jerks, Girls Stay in – a lot of the guys on campus are only really looking for one thing and if you give that to them then that's all they want from you. I fortunately found someone who is not like that, but it's a rarity to find a guy who's not pawing up your skirt. Also a lot of the freshmen girls this year are not too cute and stay in ALL THE TIME."
College Sophomore,2,"Dorms Not Very up to Date – All underclassmen live in dorms. Only one is new and nice, all the others are old and have bugs, but they are pretty big.  Bathrooms are gross and there is no sink or kitchen type thing in the dorms so making your own food and even doing dishes becomes difficult."
Graduate Student,1,"What a joke of a University. I have no clue where to begin. I have never seen a D3 university spend more money on athletics instead of academics. This school constantly wonders why they are in debt while they take donor’s money and throw it in the athletic department. Not only that, the money donors send to the athletic department only helps start the project where the university will have to find away to pay for the rest (Debt). This school is the exact opposite of progressive and the students mirror that in the way they act. The academic programs are not built for the future. No engineering 4 year, no 4 year nursing, no PreMed. Instead of building a 50 million dollar athletic warehouse facility... build a nursing building. Build an engineering building. Build dorms. What an embarrassment. Not worth the money!!"
College Freshman,1,"Girls here stay in a LOT, and can be pretty stuck up. "
College Freshman,1,"You can take the (unreliable) SCAT buses, but that's really it unless you have a buddy with a car, or don't mind walking a couple miles. "
College Sophomore,1,"The housing was the worst part of my experience and that's only because I was staying in Firestine (or Stinkystine) which was great for athletes but not for anyone else. The athletes pretty much already made friends with each other by New Student Days which made it difficult for everyone else to make friends with people there. Plus, people were inconsiderate of quiet hours ALL the time. But the dorm rooms do have AC and there weren't any bugs."
Recent Alumnus,1,"People aren't friendly after the first week. The first week everyone speaks to everyone and after that it's over. They all wear North Face, it's a little boring how everyone dresses the same."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Worst experience of my life. I wish that I hadn't gone here. No one even knows where this school is, which is going to make getting a job hard. "
Recent Alumnus,1,The apartments in the area look horrible. I can't imagine living in one of them.
Recent Alumnus,1,Kind of scary around here at night. There's a lot of crime in Springfield to be such a small town. Several of my friends have been robbed walking back to the campus from McMurrays.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Horrible, it's in a tiny town and you need a car to go anywhere."
Recent Alumnus,1,"It's a bit like high school sometimes. My professors didn't seem excited about teaching at all. My professor blew off meetings with me and said ""I forgot"". This happened a lot. Plus when I asked a prof for a recommendation for grad school, she never got back to me. I had a high GPA."
Recent Alumnus,1,The school is not diverse at all. Plus someone put racist graffiti on the fountain and it took 3 weeks before the administration had it removed. Just crazy.
College Sophomore,1,No Mans Land – The best thing they got off campus is the Walmart and Buffalo Wild Wings...lol. The mall? Trash. Movie theater? Horrid. So you need a car to go to Dayton or Columbus so find a good friend and get ready to fork up gas money if you wanna have fun off campus. Oh and actually the forest reserve is pretty nice. But if you are not into that. You gotta go off campus.lol
College Sophomore,1,"You Need a Car – All of the classes for the most part in walking distance but unless you wanna pay a ridiculous amount to get to the airport or even go the mall or get something to eat off campus, you need a car. That would be the only way you can survive at Witt."
College Freshman,1,No Transportaion – No transportation off campus when needed. It sucks.
College Freshman,1,Basically there is no where to truly party in Springfield. You should have a car to drive to other campuses. Our parties are only meant for people to drink and black out except for a select few.
College Junior,1,"Mostly White, Prejudice Still Visible – Our campus is mostly white, with scattered international students and a decent size group of black students. In addition, we have recently had hate speech on campus towards other races, and have not had a lot of effort in reaching out to students to make change."
College Freshman,1,"Cold, Rainy, Ohio. I hate the cold and ran and gray. Ohio has it all."
College Junior,1,"Ticketing is ridiculous, having a car is extremely helpful but not necessary.  But there is very limited parking and when you do find a spot most of the time you get ticketed being there"
College Junior,1,"Need to Insulate the Houses! The heat bills get so expensive because the houses are drafty!

I'm 62 and haven't been to school in awhile, they helped me to understand every step of the process for enrollment. The price was great and everything is included for that price. No hidden fees or surprises. They had me signed up and tested before I knew it with financial aid as well. I had looked at several online programs and different schools, they helped me to decide what they would recommend as  a major with the special circumstances I have. I was thinking I needed more schooling and they showed me a smaller curriculum.  They also provide a tablet and laptop  that you get to keep. What a deal. Good luck to everyone."

Freshman,5,"•	They have been very accommodating to work around my schedule and meet my needs. Virginia has been helping me through the process of putting my application in for the school and walking me through the process of enrolling. She has provided me with detailed instructions on what to do, and when to do it. I have researched multiple different programs and Independence University by far has the most flexible, and to the point program.  They do not require multiple unnecessary courses that have no benefit in the long term. As an added bonus they provide you with a laptop and a tablet to help with your studies."

The experience was out standing.

For people like me who are working and have been out of school for some time this option is a great way to gain the higher education needed for today's workforce. I would like to see the software used in some of the course application to change because it does not work with mobile devices. 

The instructors at Stevens-Henager are, for the most part, great to work with. The instructors 98% of the instructors I had the privilege to have were great. They knew the material they were teaching, answered questions quickly, and ensured the students understood the lessons.

The externship portion of the courses needs to be address. There were many problems when it came time for me to start mine. If these issues can be worked out I would gladly give 5 stars."

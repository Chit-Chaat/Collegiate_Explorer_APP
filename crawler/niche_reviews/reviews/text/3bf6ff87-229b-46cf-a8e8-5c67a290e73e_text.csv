Niche User,5,"I have not taken any courses online yet, but the college website has been very easy to use and to understand in the application process."
Niche User,5,"SVSU has been so kind to me during my application process. They have reached out multiple times to make sure I had all the things I needed. On the couple of college visits ive done there, my tour guide has been very knowlegable and done well to ansswer all of my questions. Beautiful Campus."
Freshman,5,I have one hybrid class which can be tricky at times since one day we may meet in person and the next we’re meeting online via Microsoft teams
Freshman,5,So far they have prepared me for being a well rounded college student. I have learned greatly about how important it is to be an engaged student on campus
Niche User,5,"It is so welcoming and feels like home. Most professors are great, the education is great. Lots of resources for students."
Niche User,5,"The online learning is pretty good, depends on the professor though. Online classes are nice because you can work on them when it’s convenient for you."
Senior,5,"My online classes were great! There was more work to do for some of them, but the professors still supported you as if you were in person. When the change was made part way through this past semester professors also did a great job of pivoting and trying to communicate about changes that were happening. Even though there were small technology issues, they were still trying and were interested in student success."
Junior,5,The campus is great. The housing is the best I’ve ever seen. The staff is very helpful and always willing to work with you.
Senior,5,I  have had to take a few courses online. The school uses an application called canvas. It is pretty simple to use and easy to navigate. If you have any trouble there is a great I  .T department who can help you. Overall I   hate online courses but SVSU makes it bearable.
Senior,5,"SVSU is a great school for those who like to make their own fun. If you join clubs and find a great group of friends it is the school for you. There is not much temptation of parties and such so it is a good school to stay focused at if you are tempted by those things. Like I  said, you have to make your fun so if you want a party, you'll find one but there is so many other things to do. Also the campus is beautiful and there are many hidden nature spots that make a great running trail or scenic homework spot."
Alum,5,"Class sizes are small, and the culture is one of support and community. I got a great education, and while there are always organizational snags in any complicated endeavor, my interactions with the offices of the university were mainly smooth."
Sophomore,5,"I come from a family that has attended U of M and I knew from the get go that wasn't for me- I didn't want to always compete against the whole school for the best student label. I wanted something where I could just get my degree with a much smaller student body with a nice community (so it could also be a get away from home). My senior year, when I attended SVSU Open house I knew it was home for me. If I wasn't accepted to SVSU I wouldn't have attended college at all to be honest with you. But, I'm entering sophomore year and I couldn't be happier! Yeah, college is a little about where you go but, it's mainly about how you utilize your time and experience! ALWAYS, make the best of it! I've attended a couple different clubs and groups and It helps to enjoy your time here at SVSU. Not mentioning, while walking to your classes, your surrounded by beautiful dorms inside and out, with nice upkept campus. Not mentioning how good their food smells, tons and tons of options available for you"
Freshman,5,"Saginaw Valley State University has an excellent Nursing program and is local which is why I chose this college. The professors I've had so far are understanding and helpful. I commute to the main campus from home so I have not had the full ""college experience"" but I have enjoyed my experience there thus far. Due to COVID-19, classes have been moved to online which the staff had responded to quickly and positively. The professors have high expectations for students and genuinely care about students learning the material rather than just getting a passing grade. This university is constantly improving to keep students safe and comfortable."
Niche User,5,"“I would only go to SVSU if you have NO other choice! I attended SVSU because of the financial aid package they gave me, making the cost next to none. ...”"
Freshman,5,"I like the location of Saginaw Valley and how it is close to home yet far enough away that I stay on campus.  I have enjoyed all my professors thus far along my journey.  I like the size of the campus as well.  The culture and atmosphere at SVSU is warm, friendly, and inviting.  I am very pleased and glad that I chose this school."
Sophomore,5,"This is the end of my second year at Saginaw Valley State University. So far, I love it. My overall learning experience is great. I really love they have tutors that actually help you with individual assignments. I also like how the professors are really good at communicating when it comes to understanding the assignments. I love how you can always receive help with registering for your classes the next semester ahead of time and work closely with an advisor to make sure you’re on track to graduate."
Senior,5,Going to this school is something that I have appreciated so much. I have made life long experiences and friends here and wouldn't trade them for anything. I appreciate the professors and how hard they work to educate their students. They all try to make genuine connections with the students and work to make sure that they learn.
Senior,5,"I am a current senior at SVSU, and  I love it. I cannot imagine going to another university. I lived in the dorms for 3 years and I loved every single year.

The academics are amazing (except for the math department) and professors want to help you succeed. Tutoring is easy to access, as is help with writing papers.

I have never felt unsafe on campus despite being in Saginaw. I will graduate this spring and go on to medical school at Michigan State University!"
Sophomore,5,"I like Saginaw Valley State University because I know it is a university, but it is small enough where you know a lot of people and can be involved in many different organizations at once. Everyone welcomes and helps each other."
Sophomore,5,"I love living in the dorms, the campus is great, and they are constantly trying to improve the school in anyway possible. Currently a new business building is being built!"
Niche User,5,"I really have loved my experience with this college so far and I am so grateful that I was accepted into this school. I've visited this university several times and every single time I have been I have just absolutely loved it. I love their food, the dorms are really, really great and so many cool people go there. I am so, so, so excited to attend this school in the Fall! I am ready to be a proud cardinal because I really believe that this school is a good school and I think that others will too."
Junior,5,"I love almost everything about Saginaw Valley State University. I have always loved learning and when I started SVSU, I have to admit I was nervous to transition from high school to the real world. But the college has a real homey felling to it and all of the students care about each other and push each other to become the very best. There are so many different clubs and classes to choose from and so much diversity, which I believe is very important. The food is amazing and the people are amazing. The only true complaint I have is that some of the professors are not the greatest but most of my professors I have had are caring and compassionate individuals. Saginaw has become my home and SVSU has become my life. Without this experience, I would not have met such amazing friends and teachers along the way. The only complaint I truly have is that there should be more accessible parking for students and that students shouldn't have to pay parking tickets for a school they pay to go to."
Senior,5,"SVSU is a school where you learn how to love what you do. With top fields in Nursing, STEM and business, the classes are top notch. The campus is no more than 15 minutes walking from one side to the other and on-campus police station staffed 24/7 and safety call lights everywhere on campus, you really feel safe here."
Freshman,5,I like all my classes. The students are very nice however in my math class the professor is absolutely terrible. He gets lost in his own work and goes off on tangents about his personal life. There are many clubs offered here which I like. College is the college you aren't gonna like all the teachers so it's okay.
Freshman,5,"Beautiful Campus and there is a lot to do. I am an early college student and have only been there for a small amount of time, but the school is amazing. There are many clubs to join and outside events also which is great for people who don't really have anything to do."
Niche User,5,"Good Place to go to! I loved it there when I went  on college visit there everyone was really nice and i think ill be attending there next fall! I loved Saginaw Valley State University, and you will too!"
Senior,5,"I love SVSU! It's so nice to have every class taught by a professor. No Graduate teaching assistants here! Also, it's so easy to get involved on campus and to take advantage of so many opportunities that are available."
Junior,5,"Coming to Saginaw Valley State University gave me more hope and faith to further into my studies. I feel as if I have made the best decision to not give up just because other colleges denied me. SVSU has given me a chance to make it in life. So far, I have met some of the most genuine and amazing people that are supportive and want to see me progress until the finish line approaches. I would also have to say that when I first came here I didn't think I would expand or branch out from my own bubble, but coming to this university has allowed me to be comfortable in my own shell, but at the same time come out and not feel shy about it. I have made good connections with other students and mentors as well. If you are a person who likes to chill, likes small class sizes, wants support and motivation, wants to join organizations, and want to get your degree at the end; come to Saginaw Valley State University."
Junior,5,"Saginaw Valley State university is the one of the huge school that I ever went to. there are many places to study for lectures, they have cafeteria and stores, and computer labs. In my experience, I  have learned more about the school such as having a 2.0 or higher. They also have separate building where programs and other course be having"
Senior,5,There’s always something to do and someone to study with! SVSU has a great sorority and fraternity group that does a lot of good work for svsu and the neighboring community! There’s always a place to go and study in peace or a place to study with a group which is really helpful!
Sophomore,5,"I love this school. Going here was an easy decision for me. I've made many friends and have gotten along extremely well with all of the professors. They all care, and they want your education to be the best it can be."
Senior,5,I love how diverse the school is and it has many different groups that you can join that are really friendly. There is always something for students to do on campus.
Alum,5,Great programs. The staff and facility really want to see their students succeed. Whenever you had a question you were never left in the dark. Class sizes are smaller which made it easer to get that one on one attention.
Freshman,5,"I liked the small class sizes. It allowed for more one on one time with professors. Also, I loved how there was a variety of clubs and organizations to join. The on campus housing is amazing."
Junior,5,I have had nothing but a wonderful experience at SVSU.  Everyone is very helpful here.  Whenever I have any questions I always get answers in a timely manner.  All the professors I have encountered thus far have been amazing wanting to make sure that each student is successful in their course.
Alum,5,SVSU is great because everyone there is so friendly and helpful. I got to know most of my professors and they helped me find extra-curricular activities and jobs that went on my resume after graduation. The academic buildings are all connected and the dorms are second to none. I'm proud to be a Cardinal!
Alum,5,"community feel, great housing options, caring staff and faculty, ample resources and opportunities, mid-size campus"
Alum,5,"Beautiful campus and dorms. Campus is away from the city by 5 minutes, so you have convenience, but not the traffic and people who are not going there in the way. 

This campus is always expanding and adding new buildings.  They have the best dorms I have ever seen. The courses are designed to help you learn, but the homework load is not overwhelming."
Sophomore,5,"I took a nutrition class her for the nursing program and I really loved it, that is why I am transferring her for the nursing program fall 2019."
Freshman,5,"Currently, I am only a freshman. This school makes me proud to be a Cardinal. Many teachers and faculty members are kind and willing to help you with whatever you need."
Freshman,5,I love that Saginaw a Valley cares about their students and tries to be very involved in their college experiences.
Freshman,5,Absolutely love going to this college. I have met so many amazing people while only being here a short amount of time!
Sophomore,5,This place is amazing! Its beautiful and I feel so much smarter as I am taking classes here! The teaching is phenomenal!
Niche User,5,"The campus is very welcoming, smiles all around. The class sizes are pretty small about 24:1 so there is good hands on and one on one learning experience. The dorms are rated best in the state and are very roomy I can see why. They are carpeted and have heat and a/c."
Niche User,5,"I have visited Saginaw Valley quite a few times because my older sister attends. I really enjoy the campus and how they have multiple clubs to get involved in. When I went on the visit with my group, I thought the people working were very nice and helpful with whatever I needed. Walking around campus and through the residence halls, I felt very comfortable and ""at home."" I think the school is good for me because it's the perfect distance away from home to where I can easily make a trip to see my family back home and not get homesick. My overall experience at Saginaw Valley was great. I enjoy the atmosphere and it's a lot different than high school. Just walking around people say hi to you and there's always people willing to help you."
Freshman,5,"I have always wanted to go to SVSU. My Dad, Aunt and other aunt and Uncle all went there and graduated from there, so I guess the cardinals run in the family. I had a college visit there not to long go from 9am-1pm and it was a good experience. The students who go there were amazing and helped me and they were outstandingly nice. The teachers and guiders there were a help. I left there with no questions and was just happy I got a chance to see the campus and get all the information I needed to."
Junior,5,"I am in the Social Work program here at SVSU and I am loving it! The campus is beautiful and safe, staff are friendly and the students are welcoming! My only complaint is that our math department professors are not that great and our department has been put on warning several times."
Niche User,5,"I am a future Cardinal and the whole pre-college experience was great. The campus life seems great, fun, and energetic. The student to professor ratio is perfect and the classrooms are user-friendly. The athletics programs that the school offer is amazing and their involvement in FIRST Robotics is good."
Sophomore,5,"SVSU is a fantastic University with so much for students to get involved in. Its perfectly sized to where you can make it as big or as small as you see fit. Residential and Student Life do a fantastic job of getting students involved in the SVSU community beyond their classes, and pushes students towards greatness."
Sophomore,5,"Saginaw Valley State University is an excellent school. I am studying psychology here currently, and it is a great experience. I look forward to pursuing my doctorate degree through this great school and becoming a clinical family psychologist."
Senior,5,There are so many things to do on campus and around the area. The armosphere is very friendly and there are a lot of things included such as free tutoring and gym memberships. I've always loved this school since I started my adventure there years ago.
Freshman,5,"Saginaw Valley State University is an amazing school that has a small class size, low cost, and a large range of majors to choose from. They also have a large selection of clubs to join. SVSU has a beautiful campus, and staff that care."
Sophomore,5,"SVSU is a great place to attend school if you are looking for a small college vibe. Everyone you talk to there is great and willing to help you reach your goals. 99% of the time you are able to talk with your professors one on one to get help or assistance in a class. Above and beyond the excellent staff and academics, the dorm rooms are amazing and comfortable and it is made easy to live on campus no matter what year of school you are in because of the apartments on campus."
Junior,5,"I am a third year attending Saginaw Valley State University and I just absolutely love it. Many colleges claim that their campus offers so much but one thing I can confidently say, is that Saginaw Valley is a school that operates on family and the sense of community. With the school being on a smaller scale, you become friends with the students in your class, and you join extra activities with the people from your class. There's always something going on, and Saginaw Valley offers a little bit of something for everyone in the family tree whether it be arts, STEM, sports, or even volunteering. You name it we've got it.  One thing I'd like to see change at Saginaw Valley is the Math department. There is always a con to every pro, and i believe the con would be the mathematics curriculum. A way to solve this problem is to have professors that can effectively teach their students."
Senior,5,"When Saginaw Valley State University comes to mind you can't help but think of what an incredible institution it is. SVSU is a small university in Michigan that has about 10,000 students enrolled. Less students means more 1-on-1 time with professors and more engaged learning. Walks to class will take less than 15 minutes which is a huge asset during the winter months. The on campus housing at SVSU is incredible along with great dining services to compliment on-campus life. Unlimited educational resources to help get the most out of students is provided as well. Saginaw Valley State University has got to be the school you choose!"
Junior,5,"My school felt like home the minute I stepped on campus. Being a smaller campus has benefitted me with my academics, social life, and extracurriculars. I have networked with my classmates and professors and I believe this college was the perfect fit for me. I can't find a negative thing to say about my school. Absolutely beautiful and a dream come true."
Senior,5,"SVSU is a great university for a multitude of reasons. There are plenty of activities and opportunities to get involved with on campus. The dorms here are nicer than any other college I have visited all fully equipped with own bathrooms and kitchens. The best part though is the professors. Class sizes are small making your educational experience more personalized. I have had professors help me on a one-on-one basis with academics, inform me about internship opportunities, and assist in applying for graduate school. Overall, SVSU has a small, private school atmosphere with all of the opportunities and amenities that a large school would offer."
Niche User,5,I love Saginaw Valley because everyone treats everyone the same. The professors are amazing and there are so many different activities to do on campus each day. Saginaw Valley State University really prepare their students for success.
Freshman,5,"Saginaw Valley State University is located in mid Michigan and is conveniently located off I-75.  The entrance to the campus beckons visitors to come, take a look around.  The buildings are so well maintained, you’d think they are all new construction.  The campus is laid out efficiently and all the buildings are connected, so you can avoid the elements when bad weather passes through.  The homey feel of the campus makes the transition from high school to college easier for incoming freshman.  Students are helpful and friendly, administrators and educators are eager to share their knowledge and expertise and genuinely care about your success; afterall, your success is a reflection on them.  SVSU is highly rated based on academics, dorm facilities and cost.  Come experience the difference for yourself."
Senior,5,"Saginaw Valley State University is a great University to attend while obtaining a degree or certificate. The professors that I have had are all very qualified to teach ,and  they have been extremely helpful as I continue my studies. 
The diversity  of the school is pretty good, the majority of the students are European American then it seems to be African American. Other ethnic groups are minorities as well , but there is a huge International community at Saginaw Valley State University. If you are looking to major in International Studies or Business then this would be a great school to attend. There are many International people and resources to help jump start your career. Saginaw Valley State University even offers Japanese as a minor. 
Also, the food on campus is amazing! You may put on weight because  the food is that delicious. 
The campus is located in a safe area,and also has on campus police who will make sure you feel safe while attending Saginaw Valley State University."
Freshman,4,I liked how the environment felt like home and the food. It could use cheaper dorms or ways of living.
Freshman,4,I didnt take any classes online so I cant really give and opinion on this I’m a incoming Freshman and I’m basing this off of how I felt on the  Tour of the school.
Sophomore,4,"I like it there. the food is pretty good, people are nice, campus is pretty. But for me personally I just wish campus was bigger."
Sophomore,4,online classes were kind of rough. You were given the material but you were on your own from there. you had to teach yourself everything.
Junior,4,"I really like SVSU as a college for me! It is small enough that I know people anywhere that I go, but not so small that I feel confined, or like I'm not at a university. There are people from all different backgrounds here and so that gives me different perspectives and different types of interactions. SVSU has given me many opportunites such as study abroad, alternative breaks, and many different organizations to join to keep myself involved on campus (The dorms are the best that I've seen of any school too! )"
Junior,4,"Very good staff to student ratio. Excellent campus. Online classes are a little tough to navigate and keep up, other than this no complaints!"
Alum,4,"I did not take any online classes from SVSU, but professors were great at adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic. The way that Canvas is utilized is extremely intuitive and helpful, and the SVSU website is user friendly and works as it should (not frustrating, does not crash)."
Senior,4,Everybody is really friendly when it comes to trying to find your way around. It is a great experience learning at this school. Most teachers are very understanding and know that their students are also working along with going to school full time. I would like it if more teachers understood this.
Senior,4,"I have taken multiple classes online. It is best when the classes taken online are based more on material that can be learned from a book. The teachers are generally really great about responding quickly to any questions. However, sometimes when the material is more complex it is hard to understand through an online class where you can't get immediate explanations and clarifications to your questions."
Sophomore,4,"Studying at SVSU gives me a lot opportunities to meet new friends and they have such a diverse community that from all over the world. There are variety of RSOs and supports from different sources in SVSU. Overall, the quality of the school is extremely good for the given price."
Sophomore,4,The pandemic caused everyone to study online class and then experience pretty good. Everything is really smooth online to study. Professors is really carefully on how they teach all materials and they know how to reach out to student. Studying online with SVSU will be totally worth it.
Junior,4,"SVSU is really a great place. They take students studies and safety very seriously, especially during finals and in the winter. The different floors of the library, each with its own use, help students find a comfortable spot to study depending on they’re best studying methods. Even though the professors are great, there are always bad professors with whom a lot of students usually have trouble with. In all honesty, even though I enjoy going to campus and meeting new people, I think SVSU needs to work on its math program. Other than that, thanks to Saginaw Valley State University I have made really close friends with whom I see still being in contact with in the future, and the staff have helped me pick a career that will benefit me and I am grateful for that."
Junior,4,"Although my online classes weren’t bad, I found it hard to understand the topics being taught in class due to the lack of face to face teaching, I don’t blame the university or the professors for that though, I’m just a slow learner."
Sophomore,4,"I am not personally a fan of learning classes online, especially when I don't have an option to opt out of it but, due to the Coronavirus I had to finish the remaining five or six weeks it was online. One of my favorite things about this is one of my professors had always talked really fast, therefore when we went online he posted his notes online so I could always pause the video and have all the time in the world to write down all the information down I needed. But, other then that the professors won't harsh in grading and gave us plenty of time with assignments not only by the circumstances of all being new to online courses, but also in the sense of us living through a pandemic.  ALL in all it turns out to be a preference thing. In example, I learn better visually therefore It only makes sense for me to lean more favorably to face to face lectures. Another things that helps is I love being up early- I'm definitely a early bird. But, others would rather meet online"
Junior,4,"Saginaw Valley State University is my second home. I was very nervous to make the transition from a high school student to a college student, and I am so thankful that I chose SVSU for that transition. I can only thank their tutoring resources and highly knowledgeable staff for my successes throughout my education. I am a Spanish major, and my Spanish professors have inspired me to expand my career goals father than translating and ESL. 
As there are at most schools, I did have some professors that I was not very fond of. However, I took those experiences as opportunities to find out how I can adjust myself to other's preferences. I believe this is an important skill to have in any workplace, and I can definitely say that I can now adjust well to the likes of others while keeping my character.
I have not taken part in many student associations, however I can say that I have made lifelong friends in the few groups I joined. I have SVSU to thank for my amazing college experience."
Sophomore,4,"Saginaw is a great school the professors are great and very helpful! There is a wide range of  varsity level and club sports so one can always stay busy. we have great resources, like the writing center where a student can go in and get help with their essays. We also have many clubs and are very diverse. The campus is a great size, not too big  or too small. Additionally, all the academic buildings are connected so in the winter you can walk indoors!The only thing I would change is a better math department."
Junior,4,"I am currently a junior at SVSU. The campus is nice and small, about a 8 minute walk from one end to the other, and it is beautiful. A new business building finished this past semester and it is very nice! Most of the facilities are kept clean and updated and the student to professor ratio is very nice, this is a nice feature because having a personal connection with your professors helps both you learn from them and helps them to teach you."
Sophomore,4,l love the sense of community that you get from becoming a student at Saginaw Valley State University! From the second you're on campus you feel like you're at your home away from home!
Junior,4,"I have had my ups and downs while attending SVSU. Even with the downs, I would not have made any other decision regarding what university to attend. I'm happy here, extremely happy, it's a home away from home that makes me sad everytime I have to leave it. I have met many interesting and life changing people, and I aspire to be a person of that culture myself. There are regrets I have, but none of which are my decision on attending SVSU."
Sophomore,4,"SVSU has a great atmostsphere and the people there really care about your future. There are endless ways to make friends, make memories and really enjoy the college experience."
Sophomore,4,"Currently, all the professors I have had have been super helpful when in need of some help and going to office hours. I like that all the professors are very approachable. I'm not sure about any changes."
Junior,4,"Great professors who are willing to help outside of class! The campus is always very clean and the food is always fresh. Dorms are very comfortable and easy to accommodate.  Everyone on campus is very warm and welcoming, making transitions from high school to college much easier!"
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the feel of the campus - it has a small-town feel but you are so close to so many other places like Saginaw, Bay City, and Frankenmuth. The class sizes are all generally pretty small which is nice, and it is super easy to meet new people and make friends here."
Sophomore,4,"saginaw has a very beautiful campus, kind profs and all around good people . I've made so many life long friends who I believe to be on the same journey as me we push each other to study hard and have fun while doing it."
Freshman,4,"At Saginaw Valley, I like the amount of organizations they have provided for students and the safety of the campus. Lastly, they have good cafeteria food and a well amount of resources to help you become successful. The staff and teachers are very respectful and the campus makes you feel very welcomed and they let students know that they are not alone by the advertising around campus ."
Sophomore,4,The community is very welcoming and feels like home! Everyone is so involved on campus and in classes.
Freshman,4,"I'm currently in my second here at SVSU and I enjoy going here because it's a small, yet large campus. The campus feels very safe, even at night. Sure there are some issues every now and then, but what campus doesn't? The campus is small enough that you can get to almost every building through a covered hallway and it's large enough that you'll probably never run into some people that you don't want to!  It's close to my apartment and work. The only downfall of being a commuter is that you can't really get involved. If you don't work, you probably can easily get involved with everything on campus, but it's almost impossible if you work. SVSU has a lot of amenities that are kept up very nicely."
Freshman,4,I enjoy living on SVSU's beautiful campus and being around a growing community. I have a sense of pride at SVSU and I hope to continue my success ni earing my degree.
Freshman,4,I like Saginaw Valley State University because it is close to home and they have the best Occupational Therapy program in the state of Michigan. The campus is not too big to were it feels overwhelming. The campus is located in a semi-secluded area but is only 5 minutes away from malls and theaters. The dorms are also in the top 5 in the state of Michigan.  Student life there is great. There is always something to do and I always feel welcomed. Attending Saginaw Valley State University was the best decision I have made.
Niche User,4,"I had visited SVSU and my experience was great. The doors looked very clean and nice. Also there food is very good and they had a more variety of food than at Delta College, a community college. The staff members look very nice and professional and the campus looked very clean."
Freshman,4,The dorms and living space are nice as well as the classroom setups. Students who are actively involved in their community typically have a greater experience and can learn more about the diversities among their peers. Independence given to a student at SVSU is suitable for adult living standards. My overall experience has been great as I have been attentive to new clubs and I have chosen to be an active participant in my classes.
Senior,4,The Professors really care about the students here. If you ever have any issues you can always go talk to at least one of your professors.
Sophomore,4,I think that the teaching staff at SVSU is amazing and they really want you to succeed.  They are always helpful with any questions and are willing to help you.
Senior,4,"I love my experience here so far! I will say as for my department my studies seem a little out of date, but the social and networking experience here is fantastic!"
Sophomore,4,"Saginaw Valley State University is one of a kind school that is growing at an alarming rate. Academics matter a lot at Saginaw Valley and the faculty really cares for students. We have resources to help you at the Library on campus, you're able to talk to teachers one-on-one during office hours because they're not dealing with a lot of students and there is an academic achievement center in the library also with various tutors to help. The students on campus are very friendly and helpful all around, and it's easy to make friends because everyone is approachable. There are many good things about Saginaw Valley State that I could say but I'm just giving you a taste and I want you to come to experience it for yourself and tell me what you think."
Junior,4,"I would like to see a change in the amount of time staff gets back to students. When calling advising for orientation, they never got back to me. I called multiple times trying to get a hold of them. Leaving countless messages and no one has called back. Many times when I called someone answered then sent me to the transfer advising person for the orientation. Each time they were not in their office. 
I really enjoy the campus on the other hand. Lots of entertainment on campus such as sports and other learning experiences. The professors are there to help you when you need to ask them questions or if you are just not understanding something."
Freshman,4,The School wasn't very large first off. Secondly everyone makes you feel welcome and makes the school feel like home. The school makes everyone feel like they are all in it together.
Niche User,4,I like the area very much it makes me feel like I am at home. Everyone is very nice there. The athletics are very good and the coaches are really nice and care for their athletes. Their first year suits are better then most freshman dorm in Michigan. I love how the campus is set up its all close instead of being spread out like some o the bigger colleges. The food there is the best but they have a few good places to eat.
Junior,4,Saginaw Valley State University is a big community-based university.  Programs like the student association along with the fraternities and sororities help with fundraising and community projects throughout the year.  The class sizes are smaller which means there is more one-on-one with the professors which is very beneficial to the students.  Professors always make their availability clear to the students if extra help is needed.  There are usually opportunities given for extra credit as well.  Housing is currently rated as one of the best in the nation for public universities.  All housing is equipped with a small kitchen and full bathrooms.
Freshman,4,"Saginaw Valley State makes you feel like home even if you are far away from home. Saginaw Valley State University is one of the cheapest universities and easy to apply for. Saginaw Valley supplies amount less kind of help, like tutors, financial and academic help and many opportunities to help you succeed in college."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time attending SVSU during my undergrad program.  I am from Saginaw, MI and being able to experience college life while only being 15 minutes away from my family was the best.  I would love to visit again to see all of its future renovations."
Freshman,4,"This school was always on my radar for nursing school. Once I came and took a tour I fell in love with it all. The living centers are great, the dining halls and the cafe have great food. Lastly, the people here are amazing! Everyone is so welcoming. Since this is a smaller school, the professor really take the time to learn everyone’s name. If you see them outside of class they always smile and say hello. It makes the transition from highschool to college so much easier. I am so proud of my choice to come to SVSU and be apart of the cardinal family. GO RED!"
Freshman,4,"Great University and very diverse, offers a lot of various activity and keeps you involved. If you are a math major do a little research on your teacher because in that department they are lacking."
Junior,4,SVSU is a very lively school with lots of opportunities to get involved in! They have great student life and the class sizes are smaller so it makes it easier to connect with your professors and peers.
Alum,4,"Loved my four years st SVSU. Very close-knit feel with small classroom sizes and lots of opportunities for students to get involved around campus. Some programs/courses are definitely better than others, but there are many amazing professors at the university. Great experience overall!"
Sophomore,4,"It's nice, however, it isn't academically-focused. Students go home on the weekends and campus is dead. Also there is little integration of students of different races."
Junior,4,"I love the community at SVSU and all of the groups that they offer. There are also so many places to eat on campus when you need food at almost any time. Every online class I've taken, however, has been terrible. The profs expect us to live and breathe for their class."
Niche User,4,I went on a tour of the campus and really liked the smaller classrooms. It felt very comfortable and the professors seemed to be really interested in the students' education.
Junior,4,"I like that Saginaw Valley State University offers a large plethora of classes, but students would benefit from more available course times."
Junior,4,"I am currently a student at SVSU, and I absolutely love it. I love the environment and it is a perfect size of a college."
Sophomore,4,"Saginaw Valley State University is very diversified and a great college to attend. All of the professors, students, and staff are friendly and kind towards one another and it makes you feel at ease; especially as an incoming freshman. There are hundreds of different courses to pick and choose from and plenty of options for majors/minors. They provide you with many different facilities and resources for education, sports, fitness, housing, etc. SVSU is an amazing college and I'm very happy to experience it."
Junior,4,"Saginaw Valley has allowed me so many new opportunities. Being a smaller university, students are granted with more one on one time with professors and advisors. The atmosphere is always high energy and full of comfort and safety. The athletics, Greek life, and many student organizations give students plenty of time to get involved which in turn opens more doors for them!"
Sophomore,4,"I am going into my Sophomore year of college at SVSU, and I have to say that it is amazing here. The atmosphere is great and you can truly feel like you belong there. There is only a couple of problems that I have with this university however. The Math Department is absolutely ridiculous and the professors want the students to get help from the tutoring center rather than to come to them for help. I had a professor who had claimed that you can not ask him for help unless you went to the tutoring center first hand. The Science Department is challenging but in a positive way, after all SVSU has the #1 nursing program in Michigan. No matter where you turn to however there are people willing to help and to hold your hand throughout your college experience."
Niche User,4,Smaller than my high school but very easy to move your way around. A lot of diversity even though there aren’t that many people. Cafeteria is probably the best place besides Starbucks on campus.
Sophomore,4,There are plenty of these that I love about Saginaw Valley. I love how many of the student stay on campus so you can get that real college vibe and all the students are involved in some sport or clubs. There's even a PIE club! There are many activities to do on campus to the cardinal movie nights to the theme cafeteria meals to just the school spirit at games. The class sizes are also convenient because you become very up close and personal with your professor whichi is  always a good thing.
Graduate Student,4,I thought that my experience at SVSU was pleasing overall. It is suggested to live on campus so you become a part of the community and meet more people and friends.
Alum,4,"Great school, professors, community involvement/ outreach, activities, and scenery. However, the financial aid office was a complete and utter NIGHTMARE! I constantly had issues with the office and had to call and wait on the line for 15 minutes plus. The way things were set up in the office and online was confusing for students and a pain to deal with. Hopefully they figure it out because it is a great school, just wish that office was easier to deal with."
Sophomore,4,"They have an amazing tutoring center and they want to see you succeed! The professors have no problem sitting down with you until you understand what you are confused on,"
Sophomore,4,"As an incoming freshman from a very small town, college was a bit intimidating for me, especially moving into a bigger city. When I finally moved in I was not nervous or intimidated at all. The campus size is very small compared to others and that made it very easy to navigate around campus. The classroom sizes are also on the smaller side allowing for a more personal connection with professors! I love SVSU!"
Freshman,4,"I have only been going here for a few months now, I am a student athlete her and i have been having a great time. The people here are super nice and helpful, the student to professor ratio is around 20:1 so the professors are very personal with you. The campus is the perfect size, it takes me around 8 minutes to walk across campus at the maximum. The housing is the best, I live in probably the worst housing here but there still better than most colleges best housing."
Niche User,2,"I do not recommend attending SVSU unless you absolutely have to. I was in attendance for three years before I eventually dropped out.  I was majoring in the nursing program and when I went to register for my nursing classes I was told that I would not be able to because five more prerequisites were added. That would have been okay if they were a science related or anything related to nursing related class, but they were random English and math classes. None of the counselors sent out an email notifying the nursing program students that the pre reqs were changing ahead of time. We all found out when we went to register for our nursing classes. Also, going off of the lack of communication, it wasn't until after I had dropped out that a counselor reached out to me to ask why I had dropped all of the rest of my classes. 
Bottom line, unless you have exact plan of what you want to do and have researched the department major to make sure it is ran FLAWLESSLY, I do not recommend SVSU."
Senior,2,"Saginaw Valley State University is a great institution for academics. When I first arrived here in 2011 I would have also given it high marks for the tuition rate, diversity, and care for its students also, but those things have become unimportant to the administrators here. Our school is like others in terms of professors, you have the amazing ones, and you have the terrible ones, but our academic program in almost every major has all the resources you would need to be successful regardless of the type of teacher you have. My rating for this institution would go up if the administrators took the suggestions of the student serious, but 11 million dollars spent on a library and new sitting area seems more important to them than cameras in the parking lots to keep us safe."
College Freshman,2,"Most of my professors are good and helpful, but there are a handful that simply don't care if you pass or not. They are simply there to pick up there checks and leave."
College Student,2,"For me, this past semesters in the dorms were horrific. I'd rather stay off campus and commute. The RA's were no help when it came to problems with roommates."
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the professors in my courses were unprofessional and in some courses we didn't even finish the entire class because the professor moved too slow. There's a decent variety of classes offered, but most classes are too big and it makes it hard to connect with the professor."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is beautiful on the outside, and the dorms are brand new... but the people allowed to live in the dorms are quickly ruining them and the social atmosphere is rather uncomfortable."
College Sophomore,2,"I feel like my school has some good teachers, but mostly bad. I had classes where I couldn't hear or understand my teacher at all, even when sitting in the front row. This teacher would also stop in the middle of a lecture just to talk about a story that didn't relate to our topic of study at all. It was very distracting."
College Freshman,2,Financial aid seems to think since your parents have money automatically you do too and don't need to receive any financial aid. But parents don't wanna spend all their hard earned money on college.
College Freshman,2,I apply for scholarships and I haven't received one.
Recent Alumnus,2,I never partied on campus. Any parties were off campus or we went out to the bars.
College Sophomore,2,SVSU is really not a major party school. Most student's go elsewhere to party.
College Freshman,2,I had a scholarship but it was taken away because I'm form Canada
College Freshman,2,"For someone who is picky along with being a semi-vegetarian finding food in the FOC is extremely difficult.  The choices are either a basket of fries(which are over seasoned), salads, or an occasional wrap. Trying to find food that is good, and also taste normal is extremely difficult.  As well as when we have international day not finding anything I could eat after swiping in was extremely aggravating.  Then the quality of the food is sometimes scary to consume.  Meaning, having brown lettuce, the root/head still attached, mold on my sandwiches, over seasoned fries, cold nacho cheese, no chips for nachos, nothing truly stocked up.  Coming from someone who works at a restaurant, I understand being busy and not able to stock up.  But someone should be on duty to watch it, or allow the students to have the availability to do it themselves.  I would rather make food in my dorm rather than wasting a swipe to find nothing I can truly eat.  They say people who are vegetarians have multiple options for food is a completely false statement.  Needs to be fixed in order to say you have a vegetarian friendly campus."
College Freshman,2,Not hard to get in or stay here. Most transfer.
College Freshman,2,"No one really cares. They are involved in a lot of students life, other than that they don't play a huge role"
College Freshman,2,"Everything. And I mean everything on campus gets busted. Triangle rarely, hockey house only once this semester. Try and go off campus if you can. If not just be aware town homes and campus village are constantly being watched by campus police and RD's."
College Freshman,2,Didn't realize how awful at academics this school was until I came here. Most transfer out.
College Sophomore,2,It is very expensive and filling out the financial aid is a headache because it is so much stuff that has to be filled out and submitted.
College Sophomore,2,I would love more options
College Sophomore,2,Local atmosphere is pretty basic for a developing city it's not much of a college town.
College Sophomore,2,They don't allow certain things which is very understandable all colleges are like that but some RA's are too serious with their job
College Junior,2,"Since I am a commuter, the Michigan weather is horrible.  Winter here can be awful for commuting to class safely.  I usually have to leave very early when there are storms or cold temperatures."
College Senior,2,Some groups are accepted but not all.
College Student,2,It sometimes makes it difficult to arrive to school
College Freshman,2,They do not give out very much information on living off campus.
College Student,2,There's not a whole lot to do or at least I haven't found much to do yet.
College Sophomore,2,Seem to only be interested in collecting money for parking tickets and issuing MIP's and violations for everything
College Sophomore,2,Winter's are horrible. It's always windy. Downwind from Bay City=bad smell
College Sophomore,2,Hardly anything in walking distance. One club. Under 21 can only go on Thursday's.
College Junior,2,"The only transportation provided by SVSU that I am aware of are buses that sometimes come if SVSU is having a welcome week event. Other than the buses, there is not transportation provided by the campus."
College Freshman,2,"the parking is free but their are usually no spots during the day the only time to find a spot is at night or on the weekends, and the campus police enforce the parking policies so don't park anywhere your not supposed to."
College Freshman,2,the wireless internet is very fast but for some reason i can be very unreliable even when i have a full connection it will time out
College Freshman,2,"well they have health and safety's foe the dorms so every month your room has to be spotless or else you get fined and then, there is a no tolerance policy so if you get caught with a substances you will get in trouble, but other than that they are not to strict i guess."
College Sophomore,2,I'm not entirely sure. I don't get caught up in these things.
College Senior,2,The food it not very good but on occasion it is not too bad. 
College Student,2,I don't know much about it
College Sophomore,2,"When you get off of campus, the atmosphere is not somewhere I would live. "
College Sophomore,2,"The weather last year at SVSU was relatively cold throughout most of the year, but that isn't usually the issue.  There wasn't very much snow, but the wind is extremely harsh."
College Senior,2,"Average Mix – There is a mixture of all kinds of people on campus although white people tend to be the dominant race. That being said, people of other ethnicities are heavily represented."
College Senior,2,"As for parking, I hear they are adding some new lots in the upcoming years. However, since SVSU is a big school for commuters - parking spots are hard to find! You'll get used to ""Parking Lot Stalking"" to find a spot. The spots near the buildings are very limited. You have to plan an extra ten minutes to make sure you get a parking spot and make it in time for class."
College Student,2,During orientation it appeared that there is a very strict policy about on campus drugs/drinking.  During my visit there were security officers everywhere.
College Student,2,I am currently looking for off campus housing.  I have visited several apartment complexes; prices vary.  I am happy that there are several options close to campus.
College Freshman,2,Not many open computer lab. We have 3 WiFi networks but they barely work so you have to switch a lot
College Freshman,2,"There are places to live off campus, but with the exception of the Cardinal Townhomes, you will have a little bit of a commute to class."
College Freshman,2,Only some of them actually do things that are useful. the others just party.
College Student,2,The only way that any commuter student is able to park in any of the available parking spaces is to come around 8 am each morning to get a convenient parking space. Many on campus students drive to class even though they are 5 minutes away from walking. This put a lot of strain on the commuter students.
College Student,2,There are many students at Saginaw Valley State University who participate in illegal drugs and drinking alcohol.
College Sophomore,2,"The teachers are all very different in teaching styles, while some are very demanding and expect an almost impossible amount of effort, others don't even hand out tests. It's a lottery to get a teacher who has a happy medium, and is strict enough to challenge you and help you to grow academically, while understanding that his or her class isn't the only one you have. It seems that while a standard for instructors exists, it is not taken seriously. Sometimes that is beneficial, since some amazing professors have very unorthodox teaching styles that really expand their student's experience, but others it is the opposite."
College Junior,2,Not much difficulty at all honestly. Keep a decent Gpa and you'll be fine.
College Junior,2,"It absolutely is terrible, nothing to do on campus, everyone generally goes back home on the weekends which defeats the purpose of living on campus. Parties are small and generally end in violence and end up getting shut down prematurely."
College Junior,2,"It's mostly white and African American, we have international students as well, most of which are asian, and some if not most are from saudi arabia. overall its not very diverse unless of course you come from detroit which is almost completely segregated."
College Freshman,2,"There are buses for the cost of two dollars, the only downfall is that the bus only run till about seven and they do not run on weekends."
College Sophomore,2,Sororities are great but they only accept certain people. They don't follow through on their promises and don't really interact with anyone but those from their sorority.
College Sophomore,2,"The police on campus are too strict, they are everywhere and always ruining parties.  Even if you are being chill and not creating noise if they see more then a couple cars at a house they stop by and bust everyone.  Usually for no reason, they even yell at kids above 21 who are allowed to drink.  They are usually the ones getting more obnoxious then the party people, if you are quiet though on campus usually you will be fun.  They have NO drug tolerance though, which is good."
College Sophomore,2,It's Somewhere in the Middle – It depends on what classes you need to take before you can get into your program of study and the availability of those classes in regards to your schedule.
College Sophomore,2,Parking on campus can go either way.  You can get to school early and find a great spot or you can get to school early and every spot is filled.  Then you have to park about 2 miles away and then you are late for class.
College Student,2,"During the beginning of the school year its nice and warm, but once it gets to winter it gets really cold outside. We have a lot of snow. It will snow all day everyday. When it rains it rains hard. The weather might tell you one thing but when you get outside its a different story."
College Freshman,2,"There is much diversity on the campus. There are people from all over that come here. I find it hard to get along with those different people though because they don't speak English well and if they do, they stick to their own language and group of people like them."
College Freshman,2,"The campus strictness is not to strict on things except for fighting, plagarism,underage drinking,drug usage and hazing other students"
College Junior,2,"Financial aid is slow...very slow. They don't always help or seem to make things harder than they should be, but the price to attend is spectacular compared to other universities in the state, so it is worth the effort. Just wish they were a bit more on top of things."
Freshman,1,"I had the worst experience at Sagnasty University. The professors are nice and all but I could only stay one semester because of how horrible and rude 3 of my roomates were (I chose the 8 person unit). Had to move out. Very non-inclusive, they lacked communication and were mostly rude when I had questions about anything regarding my education. Positives: Athletic hall, food court, dorms are nice."
College Freshman,1,"The School has alot going for it. The Gen Ed classes are very strenuous and many of the professors care less if you succeed. As long as you have the ability to teach yourself the material and not rely on the professor, you should do just fine."
College Senior,1,"Saginaw isn't a big place for nightlife. The downtown area is over fifteen minutes away and the cabs are few and far between. There are other little bars scattered about but none of them are clubs/etc. There are not any bars within walking distance. If you party in the townhomes across from SVSU, you have the chance of getting in trouble since the police are always creeping by."
College Senior,1,"You really need to bring your own vehicle to campus. Somewhere near 80% of all students who attend SVSU commute to and from campus, so a car is basically necessary. But if you do live on campus, there are very limited modes of transportation to anywhere off campus. You can catch a shuttle bus to the local grocery store or mall, but it does not come around often. There are also taxi services you can use, but they cost quite a bit. I would recommend having a car on campus in any regard to get you to where you need to go."
College Freshman,1,There is never usually anything fun to do on campus.
College Freshman,1,"From what I know there is a couple of bus routes that come through the campus, but I went on the website and found out that I would not be able to get back to school if it was after like 7:30PM. So if I had a job I would not be able to get many hours and the bus doesn't come that often. We also have to pay for busing, which is not a complete inconvenience, but being a college student it become difficult."
College Freshman,1,The health and safeties are ridiculous. Rooms do not need to be checked once a month.
College Freshman,1,They have very few scholarships and close to none for students who are starting our at the university. They do have two different types of loans- Substidized and Unsubstidized- with low interest rates that help.
College Freshman,1,"I have not had good experiences with roommates using alchol on the campus. of Saginaw Valley State University. My roommates were underage and drinking. At the tailgating for homecoming of 2012, was horrible. The only group that was not drinking was the group I was with and it was a Christian group. People were drunk in the broad day light before 7pm. One young man was drunk to the point he needed his friends to take him out of the stadium, just as the game started. He threw up and looked like he was passed out. I think the university needs to do a better job at regulating and keeping an eye on this issue."
College Freshman,1,Being a math major I have a hard time getting information form my professors. They don't speak English well and don't try too hard to make sure the students succeed.
Recent Alumnus,1,Not Enough – There are very few who qualify for the scholarships
College Junior,1,You can barely find any place to park. If you want to find a good parking space you need to come to class a half hour before.
College Junior,1,"Health & Safety – don't normally go, get my phone numbers off your list, I don't have a phone number for you to call"
College Freshman,1,"Not Much Available – Not too many off campus housing options available, poor to no public transportation."
College Student,1,The Lab on SVSU Campus – Saginaw Valley is a wonderful school but they have horrible internet access. The labs on campus do not have much to offer when the internet moves this slow. The printers also move very slowly. They have a slow connection as well and at one point I had to wait for 15 minutes for my paper to print.It was not a fun experience and I hope that the school will do something to better the situation at hand.
College Freshman,1,"There is little off campus housing, there are a few town homes and very few old farm houses but a lot of people comute to this school so there is little to offer."
College Freshman,1,"Parking at SVSU absolutely sucks. They have a front parking lot that everybody would love to park in, but the people that never leave park there. It's ridiculous. The rest of the people, who leave more often, are stuck with bad parking spots and long walks with large loads of luggage."
College Sophomore,1,"Saginaw, MI (Sagnasty) – Saginaw, MI has been rated the most dangerous city per capita in America for a few years now.  It's gross.  However, SVSU is located in the Northern part of the city, and is actually just surrounded by cornfields.  To go downtown to the bars is always a disappointment.  No fun at all.  You could go to a Spirit hockey game, but thats about as far as it goes.  No culture.  You don't even want to go downtown to eat.  The only times anyone goes downtown is to attend the Heath Department or hospital.  The city of Saginaw needs lots of improvement.  Tittabawassee and Bay Road (the two main roads by the university) have all your shopping needs such as meijer, fast food, chain restaurants.  No ""hidden gems"" here, such as local restaurants.  The mall is even pretty pathetic."
College Sophomore,1,"Become a Stalker – If you want to follow every student who is leaving a building in hopes that they may let you have their parking spot, this is the school for you! If you like to have people park in the middle of the aisle while some other person slowly gets in their car and starts to pull out, this is the school for you!"
College Student,1,What a Joke! Very small number of frats and sororities none seemed even the least bit appealing to me.

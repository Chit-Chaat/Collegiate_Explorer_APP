Freshman,5,The teachers would show how much they cared about their students unlike most of the advisors there. I loved the school though. The teachers were always willing to help out students with anything and provided many useful resources. Most are really understanding. I loved the food on campus specially subway! :)
Niche User,5,As soon as I entered this college there were many nice people around. It is really diverse and there were very nice and helpful staff as well. This college provides me with the best classes I need to succeed in my future career as well.
Sophomore,5,I really have enjoyed my stay at Black Hawk college. It is an amazing price with great teachers. The professors truly care about how you do in their classes. The school has lots of opportunities for people to meet each other and do activists together.
Sophomore,5,"The professors are great. They're intelligent, understanding, kind and want to see you succeed. There are many student life opportunities. It's a very welcoming place."
Senior,5,There are a lot of good programs at black hawk and they cost less than a university. Love the remodeling they have been doing.
Freshman,5,"Many people have an aversion to community colleges but if fact, Black Hawk is one of the best. The staff are knowledgable about events and topics around campus and are always willing to help out; not to mention they have endless patience for first year college students. They also offer a wide variety of programs for such a small school and very good student-teacher relationships."
Freshman,5,"Great environment with great professors. If you need help, professors are always willing to help you during their office hours, or during class if there is time."
Sophomore,5,"Black Hawk College has been a wonderful place that has helped shaped me into the student I am today. The professors (most of them that I have encountered) are willing to help their students so they are successful in their class. Not only has this college given me the tools to be successful at a four-year university, but it has also given me the tools to be model citizen. I am eternally grateful for each professor at that campus."
Sophomore,5,Black Hawk College is one of the best schools! The staff are a great help with any needs and the awesome professors are fabulous!
Alum,5,"I graduated from BHC in 2014 after 3 years (my music degree took forever!). I was able to complete over 100 credit hours at an incredibly affordable tuition rate. There are many scholarships you can apply for to assist as well! After the amount of education I received, I left with an associates degree and NO DEBT.

For the most part, the staff is friendly and helpful. The majority of the teachers I had were passionate about their jobs, and it showed in every class. Some of them weren't as great, but you will get that anywhere else you attend. Every person is different, and that extends to teachers as well."
Alum,5,Black Hawk college has one of the best hands on Agriculture programs that you can find at a community college.
Freshman,5,I am currently enrolled at Black Hawk college. It is an amazing school for a low price compared to most colleges. The English department is absolutely amazing. The history is also staffed with professors that always care about your well being and how they can help you succeed. I have met some of the best people ever at this school and I have grown and learned so much.
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy going to black hawk college the teachers are very knowledgeable compassionate and caring they work hard for you and expect for you to work just as hard for your self I would definitely recommend anyone to enroll in this community college
Alum,5,I loved everything about Black Hawk. It was not only place for learning but it was a place where you could learn to better yourself and become more confident in your field of study. At Black Hawk faculty isn't just faculty they become your family and the relationships you create last a lifetime.
Graduate Student,5,"I went to Black Hawk College because I got a 2-year scholarship to go there, and I am so glad I did. I had such an amazing experience at this college; if it were a 4-year university, I would definitely stay there. Something I really liked were the professors; every professor I had was the best. They really help you succeed; the advisors are great as well. It is affordable, and it was very close to my house. The campus is very clean and friendly; you really feel like home while you are there. I just wish there were more electives to pick from."
Alum,5,"After going to a small high school, BHC made the transition to college so easy! The smaller campus and class sizes wasn't overwhelming and the staff was there to help you with any questions. As a former student, and current teacher, I recommend BHC to all of my high school students unsure of where to attend college."
Sophomore,5,"The faculty at this facility is enthusiastic and encouraging. The curriculum, depending on the course in which one is enrolled, is challenging but achievable, leaving the student well prepared to continue in taking higher level courses."
Sophomore,5,Black Hawk College is such an amazing school. A very good transition school that eases you in the college life. The teachers care about your future and they go out of their way to make sure you understand what you are learning.  If I can give this school more than 5 stars I would.
Sophomore,5,BHC is very good two year school to get a lot of your general courses done. Tuition is reasonable. They make transferring to a four year very easy.
Sophomore,5,"Best of both worlds! I've been to a community college and a university in the past, and black hawk college is great when it comes to small numbers in the classroom so there is a lot of one on one time with the professors, and also big enough to get involved in groups and making friends. I'll recommend this college to anyone. "
College Senior,5,"I love online classes at this school. They make it easier to take more classes, and turning in assignments is a breeze."
College Freshman,5,Online courses can be a convenient way to get some extra course hours. Very easy to work with the programs.
College Freshman,5,The professors are helpful and truly want to see the students succeed.
College Freshman,5,Students are very career oriented and recieve much help from counselors when decisions need to be made. There are a lot of available clubs and organizations to be involved with.
College Freshman,5,I feel that the program requirements are applicable to the actual job. It is clear that real world situations have been taken into account when classes and prerequisites are being set.
College Freshman,5,This college is close to my home and the counselors have worked with me personally to ensure that my classes will fit into my busy life. I am a mother of three and my teachers and counselor have taken that into account when scheduling my classes. The teachers provide individual attention and welcome questions and extra help during office hours. They have made the transition of going back to school very easy for me.
College Senior,5,When I was scheduling classes I told my adviser that I was participating in basketball and she and I worked up a plan that would work around my basketball schedule but also give me enough time in the day to get homework and work.
College Senior,5,"I loved my online classes because I can work at my pace; in most of my classes, I have been able to work ahead and get the class done early so I can concentrate on my other classes. If I have ever had a problem the teacher was quick to respond and if they couldn't help then they were able to point me in the direction of someone who could help."
College Senior,5,I think Black Hawk College really gets their career students ready for the outside world by having career specific-courses and teachers who know what they are talking about.
College Junior,5,"This school by far was, and still is the best choice i have ever made. I'm in the equine program and the teachers care about your well being and keep you focused."
College Junior,5,School has been terrific and a beautiful experience.
College Senior,5,"Overall, the majority of our courses and the professors who teach them are of a quality that is unmatched in a community college setting. For a small college, we offer a wide variety of programs/courses that can transfer many places and also prepare many students specifically for the workplace."
College Senior,5,"The East Campus is home to a very large Agriculture program, of which I am a part. Faculty in the Agriculture department create a cohesive atmosphere that is incredibly conducive for learning. Our competitive teams (e.g. livestock judging, horse judging/show teams) find a great deal of success and make wonderful opportunities for applying classroom knowledge. Curriculum is challenging enough but also remains pretty relevant to your major. As an Agriculture Education major, I have been able to participate several times in an Ag Ed internship program which allows me to earn money toward my schooling, as well as gain experience as an agricultural educator."
College Student,5,The student body is always there to cheer on the sports
College Student,5,They are all very flexible. They accommodate you well
College Senior,5,Everything regarding transferring has been excellent and they have really worked to make sure everything transfers!
College Junior,5,"they have a good computer lab from what I've seen updated computers, wireless internet so students are able to use they're wireless laptops tablets etc... printing and faxing."
College Junior,5,financial aid was easy process i just filled out an online application so all of my tuition and expenses will be payed through financial aid.
College Junior,5,"Black hawk college offers a variety of certificate and degree programs. some include practical nursing and ADN nursing, medical assisting, medical billing, health information management, phlebotomy technician, radiology, accounting, law enforcement, welding and etc... haven't started school so i don't know any of the professors. the registration process was easy and the advisers were helpful. also what i do know is if a student is falling behind or struggling in any of they're classes tutors are available as well as a program that is provided through the school to help students become better students."
College Sophomore,5,I love that we can print anything that we need and use the computers whenever.
College Freshman,5,Black Hawk offers various number of career services.
College Junior,5,While studying Black Hawk Career Service Center help student write their resume and even have mock interviews to prepare students for students. They also offer work on campus for students.
College Junior,5,I took Psych 101 over the summer the workload was allot but as expected for a summer course. This was my first college course though so I did struggle some but ended up with a great grade in the class. Dr. Bentum is a good professor! I learned allot in the class and have actually retained allot of information!
College Junior,5,You can choose from several different class times for each class you want to take to work around your schedule.You can make your own schedule of classes too!
College Junior,5,"I was able to work around my schedue to better fit my personal schedule, and I like that. The classes are very flexible  and it creates less of a hassle for me."
College Junior,5,"There are plenty of diverse backgrounds. I love seeing the variety of people and just how well everyone gets along and help each other. Everyone has diverse backgrounds, and it shows when it comes down to getting on the grind and doing work. The majority of the school has people that are working, I had a lot of classmates that had children and had to juggle all three (work, school, parenting). We all want the same thing, and that is to get an education and give a better life to our families."
College Freshman,5,"I had never taken an online class before, but after awhile I got use to it fairly quickly.  Plus, it was nice that I could fit another class into my already tight schedule.  I could work on the lessons when I had time, as long as they were turned in by the due date.  Not only did I learn about the class, but it also taught me how to better manage my time."
College Junior,5,Black Hawk College has done an excellent job being very helpful overall. Especially trying to pick new classes every semester I can choose classes and times that work with my schedule. As well as the advisors being such a great help!
College Senior,5,Each year I have attended Black Hawk I have realized more diversity. I see new faces and meet people from around the world that I would have never expected to meet. Students at Black Hawk are very open and sincere to making new friends.
College Senior,5,"The computer network at Black Hawk is excellent. We have an Independent Learning Center which is where the computers are located. In this area, students can print things off at no price, and take their time to do homework. The speed of the internet is great, as well as the wireless access."
Recent Alumnus,5,"There is a gym that has many different machines you can work out in. There are plenty of computers in the computer lab and in the library, I feel comfortable and safe in the campus."
College Junior,5,The tutors in the Success Center are all very helpful and each student has a good background in what they help others study.
College Junior,5,The atmosphere of the school is very nice and wonderful to have class in. The teachers are also enthusiastic about what they teach which makes it more exciting and easier to focus.
College Sophomore,5,I am a computer science major. The workload and curriculum are just right whether you are employed or not.
College Sophomore,5,The instructors make the curriculum easy to understand. If you have trouble understanding what they are teaching they will take the time to explain it to you. I have learned a lot in my one semester there and have already applied some of what I have learned in my life.
College Senior,5,I have learned a lot while obtaining my equine science degree. I have had lots of hand on learning experiences in my classes. Their horse show team is nationally ranked and has helped improve my riding immensely.
College Senior,5,I think that the professors are a huge help and I have gained so much knowledge while learning from them. The hands on experiences I have done at this school are something that I feel might not have been obtainable at other colleges.
College Senior,5,The education I am earning is well worth the money I am spending to attend this school. I have received plenty of financial aid to help me with each semester.
College Junior,5,Black Hawk East College works to ensure students receive best possible academic credentials.
College Junior,5,The student body is so very different and diverse.
Freshman,4,"My Black Hawk College experience was overall very good.  The facilities, students, professors and services offered were of good quality."
Freshman,4,MY online experience with Black Hawk College was very good. The online professors were very good.  Thank You!
Freshman,4,There is a lot of work you must do online and there is a significant amount of homework but it is all not so hard to complete bc schoology is easy to understand and really useful. Teachers help students a lot with resources
Sophomore,4,Black Hawk is a pretty good school for educational and athletic purposes! Our women's basketball team won our Conference Championships and were Regional Championship runner ups.
Freshman,4,I like Black Hawk because of the cheap tuition and great professors. I am getting a good education and not paying the crazy expenses that come along with a 4 year-institution. The campus is simple and easy to navigate. This school offers a lot of help on things and have great advisors and counselors.
Freshman,4,"Black Hawk college is a fairly small campus but it is also very nice. The smaller rooms allow the students to get better interaction with their professors. The school also provides all students with the ability to use their pool and their very nice weight room, for free."
Freshman,4,"I like the college so far i think its very protected and its got a lot of academic choices here. The proffesors that i have are really nice and are easy to talk to, they seem like they are always ready to help there students learn in class and after class. I'm looking forward to a great year this year and I hope i make friends and people who i can study with for the course that i am taking this year."
Freshman,4,"Overall I had a great experience at Black Hawk College. I did take an ART 101 class that was suppose to be the basic beginnings of Art and I felt it was a little more advanced than it should have been, which was challenging, due to me not having a lot of experience with Art classes prior, added supplies for this class that were needed were also very pricey."
Freshman,4,I like the the smaller classes. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. One thing I would like to see change is more internships to be available for all or most of the degrees available.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Black Hawk has come down to a couple factors: 1. You have to know which professors to take, or else the whole experience will be awful. Since this is a community college, the professors are very willing to work with students on assignments and keep to their office hours pretty well, in my experience. I felt that Black Hawk was a good first step in my college experience."
Graduate Student,4,They keep improving the campus to include more and more classes and classrooms without raising the tuition which helps college be an option. Most professors want you to succeed as well
Sophomore,4,"Black Hawk is a very good community college, with its best feature being that the teachers are great. Black Hawk has great graduation rate, on average a Black Hawk student is more likely to finish a four year degree, than a student who jumps into a four year school. They also finish with higher gpa's. This is due to the fact that the teachers are great and very helpful."
Freshman,4,"I liked that my professors were really understanding and actually tried to help when you needed it. 
I would like to see change in the counseling department. You have to make an appointment and the scheduling timing doesn’t work very well."
Freshman,4,Black Hawk is a very friendly school with qualified teachers that love there jobs and love to see their students succeed.
Sophomore,4,"I have loved my time at Black Hawk. They provide so many excellent resources for new students, first-gen and transfer students. I have been so blessed with all of the resources around me. They have made my job incredibly easy by not having to stress over college apps and such."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently attending Black Hawk College as the first step in my journey of becoming a secondary education teacher. So far, I have had an amazing experience! I am visually impaired and have found that Black Hawk has an amazing disability services center. They are always ready to help and make setting up class accommodations very simple. I am also a part of Black Hawk's transfer program and it is incredible. My Trio adviser makes sure that the classes I take benefit both my degree and transfer over to the university I am hoping to attend. Overall it has been a great experiece starting at Black Hawk. The staff is so helpful and friendly."
Senior,4,Black hawk college is a great community college to get yourself started in the college scene. The diversity is great and so is the student life activities and events they have there. They need improvement on some of the advisors they have for the students as they are not helpful in putting you in the right direction. But they have great classes and transfer options for the price
Sophomore,4,"If you're from the area it's just like high school all over again; everyone knows everyone. Decent school, sometimes it's hot as hell but not a bad school overall. Most teachers are excellent and it's a more economical choice than going to a 4 year uni straight after high school. The advisors are terrible though. Don't listen to them if you don't have to, just go to your transfer college or find the degree plan for your major and you'll do yourself a huge favor and not waste anytime."
Freshman,4,"My experience at BHC so far is great, I have meet many new life long friends and have learned a lot in the automotive classes that I am taking so I can receive my AAS in Automotive technology.  The small campus and class sizes remind me a lot about my high school so it is easy to get to know the people you see every day such as class mates and teachers.  the student life is very laid back and the people on the campus make you feel welcome every day when you go to your classes.  As for the food on campus, it is very reasonably priced and is just a good as a restaurant would be."
Sophomore,4,"I AM CURRENTLY A SOPHOMORE AT BLACK HAWK COLLEGE, AND I THINK BLACK HAWK COLLEGE WAS A GOOD CHOICE FOR ME WHEN I GOT RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. I LIVE IN THE SAME TOWN, AND HAVE ALL MY LIFE SO IT TAKES LITERALLY TEN MINUTES TO DRIVE TO THE EAST CAMPUS. MY TEACHERS ARE AWESOME, AND LOVE WHAT THEY DO AND IF I EVER NEEDED HELP THEY WOULD BE GLAD TO HELP. THE CAFETERIA ONLY HAS TWO VENDORS, HAPPY JOE'S AND A LOCAL BAR RESTAURANT CALLED CERNO'S. THEY HAVE GOOD FOOD THOUGH, BUT IT IS DEFINITELY LESS OPTIONS THAN OTHER SCHOOLS IN ILLINOIS. THE TUITION IS CHEAP, AND THE QUALITY OF THE EDUCATION IS GOOD. OUR AG PROGRAM IS REALLY GOOD, PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY COME FOR OUR AG PROGRAM. AG BUSINESSES VALUE THE BLACK HAWK COLLEGE AG ALUM. OVERALL, I WOULD RATE MY EXPERIENCE AS A FOUR AND A HALF STAR RATING OUT OF FIVE."
Freshman,4,"One thing I liked was that the people inside were friendly. When I went to take my compass test, they gave people enough time to come in. My time over the phone wasn't pleasant. The lady I talked to for compass testing was really rude, I did not get her name. Eventually I called back and spoke to someone more kindly. The career service office was really helpful, three ladies helped me with my resume and to apply to jobs on campus. One of the women reviewed my resume to approve it could be showed when I applied to jobs. "
College Junior,4,were friendly about helping me with anything
College Sophomore,4,"student services are good, the advisors for regular students are crap but Trio and career service advisors are awesome."
College Sophomore,4,"Good for a community college, small classes and courses in sciences are very much equivalent to the kind of level you'd experience at a university level only you're not with a thousand other students and being taught by TAs."
College Senior,4,"I work third shift, and I was easily able to schedule around my work days."
College Senior,4,They have a huge selection of classes and class times.
College Senior,4,They have a career services department and always have jobs posted.
College Senior,4,It's a really convenient and fun school.
College Senior,4,Up until recently the overall experience has been great. Now the school is changing the programs and I have had to substitute some of my classes. Some of the classes are now only offered online.
College Senior,4,I have learned many new things.
College Senior,4,I have had a great experience with BHC. Most of the instructors have been very helpful and care if you are doing well in their class. Most of the students are helpful as well. The ILC was very useful/helpful until Tina left. She would go above and beyond to help you. She genuinely cared about the students!
College Senior,4,Everyone that works in career services are really nice and they help put you on the right path. There are always people there that are willing to help you find an internship too.
College Senior,4,The variety of classes is great! Normally you can find a class that is taught in class but if you live farther way there's an online option too. Plus you can always check ratemyprofessor.com if you are ever wondering if the professor is okay to take and what their teaching style is.
College Senior,4,"My accounting professors have really opened my eyes to the world of accounting and how amazing this program can be. The workload hasn't been too bad, the longest sometimes I work on homework for five minutes and other times I work for an hour and a half."
College Senior,4,I would definitely choose this school again because it saved me so much money that I am now able to attend a bigger university. I love the class size and the one-on-one attention that every student receives.
College Senior,4,"Black Hawk College gets a pretty bad rep sometimes, but it really what you make of it. I think that you need to have some sort of plan about what you want to do (it doesn't have to be set in stone), and it does help if you know where you want to transfer to. Be smart and schedule classes that you know will transfer and can apply to many different majors. Also, make sure to use ratemyprofessors. Yes, you should take certain reviews with a gran of salt, but if a majority of students agree on a point about a professor, it's mostly true. So if you can help it, make sure to take professors that you will get a lot out of - no, I don't mean take ones that give out easy As. The school often gets the rep that it's not as good as actual Universities, and I can see the argument for that accusation based upon some of the course work of certain professors. Take classes/professors that will challenge you. You're here to learn, might as well get the most out of your money and refrain from taking underwater basket weaving. For the most part, the professors I've had have been very caring and enjoyed teaching. 

The social life is just about what you'd expect out of a community college. A lot of students have stuff going on outside of the classroom like families or jobs, so most of them go home immediately after classes end for the day. That's not to say that it isn't impossible to get involved on campus. I'll be honest, there's a ton of clubs on campus, but many of them have few members or just don't do a whole lot worth while. There are a number of them though that are really great to join. In fact, I've met some really awesome people by joining the club that I'm in and by helping out in student life. I think if you have time, definitely invest some of it in extra-curriculars because truthfully, it's easy to stand out in a good way at a college where there's an air of apathy towards student-engagement. 

I think this school has more than served its purpose for me."
College Freshman,4,Everything has been great so far. No complaints
College Junior,4,My experience with the classes I have taken at black hawk has been flexible so far. The professors are always willing to work with you if something comes and interferes with an assignment or with class attendance as long as you talk to them about it. The schedule is also very flexible and you can create a schedule that fits with your life and circumstances.
College Junior,4,"I have enjoyed all the courses I have taken, especially the psychology courses. Most of my Prof. Have been great, though I have had a few problems, but nothing I couldn't handle. The class sizes are also really great. I feel as though the smaller class sizes enable me to get more out of the class. I can work with classmates or ask my Prof. If I need help or don't understand something and her several times in the past"
College Junior,4,I am a nursing major and am starting the program at Black Hawkthis spring. I have heard that Black Hawks program is very good and thorough and teaches all you need to know and more in order to have a career in nursing.
College Junior,4,"Black Hawk has been very enjoyable so far. I've haven't had many problems with professors for the three semesters I've been there and feel that I have learned a lot in the courses that I have taken. I like the small class sizes, I feel like I can talk to my professors if I am struggling or if I don't understand things and they will help me as long as I put forth the effort. They're a very confident and decently priced option for me and I am very excited to start their nursing program I t he spring!"
College Sophomore,4,It's great. Professors really love to help!
College Senior,4,"When it comes to balancing school and work, and any number of family commitments, BHE has been fairly accommodating when it comes to scheduling and being absent. I am anticipating an easy transfer out-of-state following my graduation from Black Hawk this spring."
College Senior,4,My experience at Black Hawk College-East Campus make me almost 100% certain that I would choose it all over again. I have been given so many wonderful opportunities in the Agriculture Department and my professors contributed a great deal to my education; and I do not feel that anywhere else would have fit me better.
College Senior,4,"A degree from my school means a great deal in the surrounding area especially. We have a reputation, and rightfully so, of offering quality programs, with challenging teachers, that produce students who are ready to work and are excited for what they are doing."
College Senior,4,"Black Hawk College alumni are often active in the surrounding communities which leads to many prospects for internships and work opportunities. Many of our programs are career and technical based, which somewhat diminishes the need for much of a career center, since many of them require internships and practicums that often lead to jobs."
College Senior,4,"As previously mentioned, the East Campus of Black Hawk College is very much centered around the Agriculture Department. However, our nursing, accounting/business administration, welding, and several other programs are incredibly strong as well. One of the primary downsides of our college registration process (or at least when handling financial issues) is that all of the paperwork is primarily run through the main campus which can make it difficult to get a clear, relevant answer to your questions."
College Senior,4,"Being a student at the smaller of the two Black Hawk College campuses, we make do with what we have. Our facilities are relatively up to date as far as technology is concerned. We are very obviously a rural campus and lack many of the amenities of a community college in an urban area. However, Black Hawk provides an excellent education with friendly faculty and staff."
College Sophomore,4,"We even have a career services center that will help you find jobs, internships, and do what ever needed to help you find a job. Free resume help, cover letters, application help, job searches, and MORE!!!"
College Student,4,They are very informative and they are very helpful.
College Junior,4,There's always something going on and the registration office is very helpful
College Senior,4,Cheap tuition. It is really affordable for everyone.
College Senior,4,"most of the teachers know hot to help students when we feel overload at the end of the semester, and how to deal with finals."
College Senior,4,there is a properly office just to deal with registration process.
College Senior,4,the library in this school have a lot to offer to the students
College Senior,4,I am a transfer student and in this school they help me to have a good grades.
College Junior,4,"they have a good athletic program i dont know too much about it, there is a student center where students relax or study listen to music or just past time, and there is a library."
College Junior,4,the school spirit and that the instructors are always willing to help out in any way that they can.
College Senior,4,"I have found most of the students to be very friendly and willing to work with their fellow classmates. It is easy for people to come together when learning about common interests. I would say we are average on the diversity level. There are several ethnic, economic, political, religious, and sexual groups but it doesn't seem to cause any conflicts."
College Senior,4,"My college is pretty small, which helps make it more personable and friendly. The teachers know you by name and have time to help you out of class. It is an agricultural based school so we often have livestock on campus for a variety of events. Unlike other colleges, our campus has an equine program that allows the students to bring their horses on campus. It is neat to see them working the horses in the outside arena."
Freshman,2,"Just to clarify I go to the East Campus. The teachers and students are very friendly which makes it a very welcoming atmosphere. However, the East Campus is known for their equine program and agricultural programs. The science fields are decent. If your major isn't in one of those fields there really isn't much for you."
Niche User,2,"After reveiwing the overall completion rates for graduation. THis is a community college for a vast amount of students in our communities and cities. 
The graduation rate is approximately 20%, which is a very low rate for the expense students and parents pay for schooling."
College Sophomore,2,"waste of time and money if you actually want to learn anything, good for bolstering credit hours only."
College Senior,2,"My online experience has been limited to a probability and statistics course, and the workload has been, by far, the worst part. It is difficult to clarify concepts with the instructor and work is not responded to in a timely manner. Many of the students struggle to grasp such a difficult concept and the resources that are provided are not geared toward multiple types of learners."
College Senior,2,"I don't believe my community college is very student-oriented. There is not a very large variety of student organizations, making it difficult to get involved. They just recently built a student-housing facility so that is something very new for the college."
College Junior,2,I like that i can take out a loan but as far as financial aid i do not like that they go based off of your parents income when my parents are not helping me at all so i have to take out loans. Also that people who are approved for financial aid i have seen getting approved for more money they need and getting a $1000 refund at the end of free money instead of using that money toward people who need help paying for school and were not approved for aid due to their parents income. They should also pay more attention to grades because a lot of people i see with aid do not try or care about college whereas people like me who try hard get nothing in return and people who don't care get a free ride.
College Junior,2,Professor dropped me out of class because I had to leave for a week for a funeral and I have to pay back the class.
College Freshman,2,I'm a nursing major but I don't plan on getting my associates here. The nursing program offered here is too time consuming. Instead I'm am just taking prerequisite classes to another college.
College Student,2,It is all worth the tuition I paid.  I just wish there was more on site staff to help with the Fafsa process.  It's very confusing and kept getting rejected from little mistakes I didn't know that I made.
College Junior,2,Not Really Sure. My college is a community college so after students leave they usually go to a four year institution.  So we don't really have an alumni network that I am aware of.  The career center is decent though and I have used the resources to help lead me down the right path
College Junior,2,There Could Be More Access – The fitness center is only available if you pay for it and I think that it should be open to all students for no fee.
College Freshman,2,"Be Prepared – The financial aid office is not necessarily friendly, but they are honest. Their candor is refreshing but would not be encouraging to a new student. They could be more friendly. If you go into the office know what questions you have and be prepared to answer their questions. They do not appreciate the deer in the headlights look."
College Student,2,Students Needing Help – depending on the class and the professor the students that are lagging behind in some classes the teachers dont slow down any for them to absorb the information and if you are in need of help most of the time you are most likely to go to the student help center than ask your teacher
Freshman,1,"Our experience with this school was not a good one. Speaking specifically of the East campus, they have a lot of work to do in the area of diversity and inclusion. There is a great deal of low-key racism that occurs within the student body as well as higher up in administration. When my child brought concerns about this to the Dean his best advice was to “ just keep your head down and stay quiet and it’ll pass”. Hardly the kind of advice my child expected to hear given the day and age we live in. Additionally, the quality of education was just as bad. Understanding that this is a community college, our expectations were not very high going in, but after being there it became apparent that half the ‘instructors’ leading the class were unqualified to do so. It all came out in the wash when a good portion of my child’s credits did not transfer, even though we were assured the classes were tailored to meet the requirement of my child’s school of choice."

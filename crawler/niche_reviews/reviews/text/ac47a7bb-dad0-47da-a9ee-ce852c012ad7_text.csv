Niche User,5,I am thinking about going because the cheerleaders are hot. The athletics seem to be really good. The academics seem really good so I am considering to go there.
Junior,5,I like how Northwestern State University is like a family. I also like how most of the students are very active and involved in many things.
Sophomore,5,This school so far has been my dream school! The staff is there to always help and actually care about the well-being of their students.
Sophomore,5,"The professors make online learning so easy, that is why I have been able to exceed in my academics."
Freshman,5,My overall experience at Northwestern State (NSU) has been great by all the measures I find important to me. The academics are challenging with the professors being very skilled at teaching. The campus is easily walkable while still being quite sizeable.
Freshman,5,The teachers will challenge you but they will also help you if you are struggling with any of the content being taught. Older students in the same major are very willing to help the new students find resources or get in touch with someone who can. The learning experience I have is one I am very happy to have because I like to be challenged but I also like to be able to seek help if I need it and the students and faculty of NSU possess that quality in spades.
Alum,5,"I am very glad I attended college at Northwestern State University. As a student of the biology department, I believe that our professors were highly trained individuals who were passionate about teaching the upcoming physical therapists, biologists, veterinarians, etc. And really, school is what you make of it!"
Alum,5,I love online learning. It gives me the freedom to work at my own pace and plan my own schedule within the allotted time given by the professors which keeps me on track with my assignments.
Senior,5,"Learning online with NSU can be easy, but also tedious. Many online classes are structured the same. There is a lesson every week and you are required to teach yourself with a PowerPoint and do assignments. Most assignments are either forums or discussion boards. Teachers can assign quizzes or test that are due at a specific time. Some entry level online classes require students to do Incentives or MindTap assignments."
Freshman,5,"Taking all the online classes wasn’t much fun, but the professors were there for you if you needed them & I love that about them"
Freshman,5,I absolutely love my school. I am an incoming freshman. The admissions and financial offices are very organized. The upperclassmen and teachers are very helpful! No suggestions to make anything better.
Freshman,5,I love that the school is so diverse and that we are so accepting of diversity and culture! One thing that could change is the safety and security of the dorms.
Senior,5,"Pretty neat.  Got what I needed.  Flexible class and course scheduling for someone who works full time,  or active duty military with busy daily schedule.  Courses offered year round,  and traditionally.  Quick feedback and acceptance into course program as adult student.  Tuition assistance and ease of use military benefits,  as well as scholarship opportunity."
Freshman,5,"They people there always made me feel at home, it's a very beautiful campus with lots opportunity. I can't wait to start my classes there."
Sophomore,5,"I transferred to Northwestern State University Fall of 2019, and it has been the best decision that I have ever made. The teachers have been so nice, and caring about my situation pertaining to school and personal life. I cannot wait to see where I will be in the future."
Freshman,5,"I think that the community surrounding Northwestern is very fun and vibrant, along with the on-campus community. Something I would like to see change, however, is more organization in the admissions aspect."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Northwestern State University so far has been a very positive one. I really enjoy the classes and the organizations that I am in. One thing I would like to see improve is the quality of the food in the dining hall and the communication between campus officials and students. If something happens on campus, I would like to be notified right away instead of hearing it three days later through a friend."
Senior,5,I like that the professors on both campuses are really concerned and willing to help you do whatever they may need to so you will graduate. There are plenty of resources of help with everything available to students so they will succeed. They are truly dedicated to one goal. Yours!
Junior,5,"I love everything about NSULA , the only thing I feel like that needs to be changed is the price to attend."
Junior,5,I love Northwestern State University. The professors are willing to help you when you need it. Great campus too!
Niche User,5,"Northwestern State University gives me a welcomed feeling when I am on campus. The staff for every department are always so kind to me and are always willing to talk to me about the hard decisions I have to make. The students are supportive of the school and have so much school spirit that it almost rubs off on you. NSU has a southern charm to it and it is also placed in the beautiful, historical city of Natchitoches."
Senior,5,I like everything about Northwestern State University of Louisiana they have help me regain confidence in my college life and giving me another chance at bettering myself ! I would like to see nothing change the school and staff is incredible
Freshman,5,"I love everything about Northwestern State University. The classes are easy to get to, even on the first and second day. The food is really good, and the teachers are experienced and friendly."
Junior,5,"Northwestern State University is a campus full of endless opportunities. This is always a place for each individual to grow and expand into the real world. The facility and staff live by the university mission which is their one goal, ""Yours."""
Sophomore,5,I love Northwestern State University because it’s a friendly campus and you can meet so many diverse people.
Junior,5,I am 50 years old going back to school. I am taking online classes. Everyone has been helpful. All my professors have gone aboard beyond in helping me with everything. I have toured the campus and it is beautiful and you actually feel right at home. The campus is clean and beautiful. I live about 2 hours from the campus. It was wonderful to see the places and homes where the movie Steel Magnolia’s was filmed staring Dolly Pardon. There is nothing that I could think of that would make my experience with northwestern state university any better. I love that this is a Christian college. I am a RN but my goal is to become a nurse practitioner.
Sophomore,5,"I love Northwestern, I’ve always felt at home from the moment I first walked onto campus! Northwestern is amazing and this is why I chose it as my number one college to attend! 

And as always!! FORK ‘EM DEMONS!"
Senior,5,"Northwestern is one of those campuses that feel like home. Everyone is so eager to help you and so ready to see you excel in life. Out of the many options I had to go to college, I’m happy that I chose Northwestern."
Niche User,5,"I like the overall culture of the university. It stresses the importance of striving to be the best in everything you do. Also the counselors there are not only there to put you in the best place successfully for the future, but to also create a bond as well."
Senior,5,"Due to personal and family situations, I am an online student at Northwestern University. However, even though I have never stepped foot on campus, I can honestly say I feel more involved with this university than I did at my pervious one. The teachers are so easy to get in touch with and always reaching out to see if there is anything I need help with. The administration and faculty are prompt for solving any issues a student has and are so friendly and kind."
Freshman,5,I attended Northwestern State University of Louisiana for my freshman year of college. I really enjoyed my time there (especially since that's where I met my wife). All of the classes were well managed by the professors. The atmosphere was great.
Freshman,5,Northwestern is a friendly college that everyone will love. It is in a pretty small town and everybody is very personable. I love it here and you will too!
Freshman,5,"I liked how NSU is willing to help anyone in need. It is a wonderful college to go to. There are always someone that will help you. Also, the professors are willing to answer any question you have or concerns. I would not change anything at northwestern. The dorms are nice and clean and there are people on the clock to help with any dorm problems. There are also a lot of activities for you to do if you are ever bored. You can just sign up and you are in. They also have jobs for you if you are looking for one. They also help with that. I love Northwestern State University"
Niche User,5,Northwestern has a great dual-enrollment program. All the staff has been friendly and understandable with any circumstance.
Senior,5,I’ve been to many schools throughout my college career. When I started going to NSU I felt like I was in the right place. Especially for my major which is nursing.
Sophomore,5,"This is an amazing university. I love how there are great teachers, good help when needed, and the living matters are safe and secure. I'd recommend this school to anyone. Fork em!"
Senior,5,The family atmosphere is what really drew my attention to the school. Everyone is easily to get along with. It’s a very friendly campus
Junior,5,"I love being a student at NSU. I couldn’t have chosen a better school to study at! I like how small the school is. Most of my classes have about 25 people or less enrolled, which give professors the ability to get to know their students."
Senior,5,"Attending Northwestern State was the best decision I've ever made. It's very affordable, centrally located, and prepares one to enter their career field with confidence and knowledge. Because of the size of the school, students are presented with a more ""personal"" experience, smaller classes, and numerous opportunities for internships and professional development. The enrollment is continuing to grow, giving deserving students the opportunity to attend college."
Junior,5,I like everything currently and do not have anything I would change currently at this time.  I am an online student and have taken one class on campus. I have enjoyed my professors I each class and enjoyed working with all my classmates.
Senior,5,"NSULA is easily one of the best universities that I think I could have chosen for myself. For one, it is in my hometown. They have made wonderful improvements to the university within the last 3 years. I can't wait to see how much it continues to grow in the years to come!"
Niche User,5,My experience at Northwestern State University occurred during a college tour and immediately the aura of the place consumed me with a positive flow. The people were very nice and the energy was very peaceful. Highly recommend and I will definitely apply in the fall 2020 semester!
Freshman,5,It was absolutely amazing and very promising. They gave me a fun and exciting place to call my college home.
Freshman,5,"So far, as an incoming freshman, my experience has been amazing. Everywhere you go there is someone to help you with any questions you have. As a freshman having that luxury is very important."
Sophomore,5,"NSULA is an excellent small town school. You'd be hard pressed to find such a great institution with the same relatively small tuition, town, and cultural experience. There's no place I'd rather be."
Sophomore,5,So far im enjoying my time as a student at NSU. There are so many resources available for me and there is always someone willing to help. I have met some really amazing people so far and the campus.
Sophomore,5,"I had a wonderful experience. Everybody was so helpful my first couple of weeks.  You will enjoy all the different events they have.  They make sure your housing is in good shape year round. You have Starbucks, the grill, and etc to eat at. It has a wrac where you can work out and it also has a gym and dance area in the wrac.  You also have a good well rounded and very organized learning ethic."
Freshman,5,"The best thing about Northwestern State University is the social activities you can get involved in and meeting different groups of people involved as well. For example; sororities, fraternities, sports, Student activities board, student government, service based groups, honor societies, and lots more! I love everything about this University and meeting my best friends here is amazing too. Everyone is so nice and welcoming."
Niche User,5,At northwestern state everyone was nice and friendly. The administrators and even the students that were on their way to class. There are many diverse students so you will never feel out of place. When I visited the campus I also got a chance to visit the dorms. The dorms were well put together and cleaned very well. The environment seems very safe. I was not dissatisfied with what I saw during my time touring the Northwestern State University of Louisiana's college campus.
Sophomore,5,"Northwestern is great, and it gives you a great experience at college when you first come in and all the way through. They are very welcoming and helpful to all students."
Freshman,5,"I am currently in my second semester as a freshman. The school is better than what I was expecting it to be. I love the atmosphere, the people that I associate with, my professors, and my schedule. Everyone is so helpful and friendly. This is definitely a school for everyone."
Freshman,5,"Being four hours away from home where I lived near LSU and SELU, NSU was my first choice and I feel like I was part of the school as soon as I first stepped onto campus. Having a personal tour that you can meet with an advisor of your major was very informational  and they try to make it as much of a home for you as possible while you are a student. The faculty and people on campus are amazing and super nice and sweet. Everyone is there for you and you can always go to someone if you need help with anything."
Freshman,5,"The classes aren’t too hard. The school itself is wonderful I love being up there. Staff is super friendly, much diversity among students and lots of on campus activities for you to do. As with any college the only downside is finances."
Freshman,5,Northwestern makes you feel at home and they help you with anything that you need whether it is school or the army program
Niche User,5,"Overall, it is a great school, but the best experience for me is the atmosphere. The small town of Natchitoches, is extremely supportive in the school."
Sophomore,5,"I love what a community the students and staff have made. Once you begin your journey at Northwestern and get into the groove of things, you become a part of something much bigger. It’s like a city in itself."
Niche User,5,Northwestern is one the best colleges in Louisiana Especially the Nursing Program after I receive my BSN I' am getting my MSN THEN CRNA. AND I WILL BE MAJORING IN BAND ALSO BUT MY MAY FOCUS AND GOAL NURSING BECAUSE I WANT TO HELP PEOPLE  AND  I LOVE HELPING PEOPLE.
Junior,5,The professors have been very accommodating up to this point. The campus is beautiful and the students have a ton of pride in the culture here.
Niche User,5,"I have been taking my ACT at Northwestern this year.  My friends and I have attended campus tours and have really enjoyed ourselves.  We have attended football games, basketball games, and the Christmas Gala.  As an incoming freshman (fall 2019), I cannot wait to join the campus life and see what NSU has to offer."
Alum,5,I had an amazing learning experience with NSU spanning 5 years. The college band/music program was phenomenal!
Junior,4,"I did take some classes online, mainly because everything went online because of covid-19. During that period, most of my professors adjusted their normal schedules well with the transition to online. However, I did have one professor who did not account for any set backs due to the quarantine. That professor had extremely high expectations for students to be able to complete many different projects each week, while still knowing that students had other classes and were having to complete these projects at home with limited resources. 
I also took two summer courses that were both online. Those professors clearly explained how to do all projects and what was asked of the students. 
Overall, majority of professors were good online; while some were slightly lacking in the understanding of their student's expectations while doing education from home and online for possibly the first time."
Senior,4,"Northwestern State University is a great school. They offer many majors, athletics, student activists, Greek life, and more. The nursing program at NSU is a very demanding curriculum. It requires not only hours of clinical and lab time, but many study hours. Overall it is a great program and will definitely prepare students for a job in the nursing field."
Freshman,4,"For my first year, I loved NSULA. I was able to meet some very nice people & I loved all the activities that occur during demon days , those days were some of my favorites"
Freshman,4,Love the school.  Beautiful campus.  Teachers are very responsive via email when problems or questions arise.
Freshman,4,"The school's size is great; it allows for small class sizes and more one-on-one time with professors. Almost all of my professors were willing to work with me when I went and sought help. The student body shows diversity, which many people often look for in a university. Housing is actually much better than other universities, better rooms offered at a lower cost. The cost of attendance is fairly low and the education is still great. The community surrounding the school is incredible."
Junior,4,My experience at Northwestern State University has been great considering I have only been on campus for two semesters. I’ve met new people and made friends. Also there are a lot of activities and sports to attend on campus.
Freshman,4,A strong culture and kind people that will help you all the way. Multiple ways to find what you need and many people their to help you get it.
Junior,4,"The professors are all amazing and know what they are teaching about and how to give the best learning environment for each student. All of the other staff are very helpful. I would like to see the parking lots to be re-paved, especially some of the commuter lots with big potholes."
Freshman,4,"Everyone is usually very nice. It's easy to get around to your classes, most classes are walking distance. The cafeteria has different foods for different tastes, we also have other food restaurants that are on and off campus. The Upperclassmen are very nice with helping new students with directions, social events, and school news."
Sophomore,4,"I went to Northwestern State as a freshman and I did not know a single person on the campus. The first week was incredibly tough, but once rush came around I was able to meet so many new people and make friends that I know I'll have for the rest of my life. The people at NSU encouraged me to get involved and since my freshman year I am now involved in multiple organizations including greek life, student government association, and recruiting ambassadors. This school has allowed me to grow into the person I have always wanted to be, and for that I am very grateful."
Freshman,4,I'd say it is a pretty good school. The professors are dedicated to helping you out to succeed and pass. There's so much diversity and acceptance.
Niche User,4,The campus isn't too large and the art students have their own dorm building next to the art classes.
Freshman,4,"I haven't started classes yet, but the staff has been very helpful in providing the information I need in a timely manner."
Alum,4,"The best thing about Northwestern State is the close-knit campus/community environment. There are also endless opportunities to get involved on campus, which will make your college experience that much better."
Alum,4,"I am a recent graduate of this university, and am currently pursuing a Masters' degree. I feel that the programs offered to me not only helped prepare me for graduate school, but also my career. 
One thing I loved about this school were their generous scholarship offers. For many people, money is always an issue and this school will really work with you through that. It helps having a University President that genuinely cares about ALL the students.
The only thing I hope they change is the dorms. They are overly expensive and often con you out of deposits, although I feel this happens on every college campus."
Sophomore,4,"Really great, diverse faculty is the drive of the place. Some things such as housing and food could be improved."
Niche User,4,"I visited the campus to see if I liked it, and it felt so comfortable the minute I got out of my car. The air was fresh and the people seemed very welcoming. I didn't really see any students since they were on break, but it seemed like a chill place. I like the environment and how everything seemed so natural. I was looking for a college that was far away from home, but close enough for me to go back, and they were perfect. I hope its as good as I'm making it seem to be. I might try to walk on for basketball, depending on how my schedule is looking. I'll have to see this summer, since freshman connection is coming up. I'm looking forward to that the most."
Freshman,4,Northwestern State University is a great institution to attend. What I really like the university is the fact that its very welcoming and make you feel at home. The staff at the university is very open and are determined to make sure you succeed. They see you as more than their student. They also have multiple on campus activities to get people out of their comfort zone and meet new people.
Senior,4,So far I have had a good experience.  I find that the teachers are helpful and genuinely care about the success of each student
Freshman,4,"I love this school, I came here for cheer camp and fell in love with the campus. It's really a home town and everyone here is so welcoming and the food is great! I really recommend students to come here the professors are caring and there is free tutoring in the library. I made the best of friends here and the best decision coming here!"
Senior,4,"The classes are very straight forward, but challenging. The teachers go above and beyond to help every student in any way they can. The clinical part of the program is excellent. The teachers go out of their way to find you many hands on opportunities. The school is very professional and I recommend it to anyone."
Junior,4,"I like Northwestern State University of Louisiana because there I have the option of going to school online. This is important to me as I am a working mother of two. Additionally, the school offers a large selection of online programs for students.  During the school year/semesters, expectations are clear, direct and helpful."
Sophomore,4,"I love the students and overall staff there. The students are very friendly and open minded. The professors genuinely care to help you achieve whatever studies you're focused on. Also, everybody has great pride for the school we attend, which makes it even better,"
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love going to NSULA! Most of my professors know my name, and are very willing to give you help when asked. Getting involved is very easy, whether it is rushing or an athletic group. There are clubs for almost every major on campus, so you are never alone. Campus is small enough to see familiar faces, but big enough to do your own thing and meet new people. Academics is a important thing to professors and students, I have learned so much in the short time that I have been a student there."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy attending northwestern state university and namely being apart of the band. The music program is phenomenal and even though I'm not a music major I've loved being apart of it.
Senior,4,I attend the campus in Shreveport. Classes are small and you get to know your professors in order to build relationships.
Freshman,4,Northwestern State University has a home setting and once you get used to the campus you wont want to go home.
Sophomore,4,"I didn't intend on going to school are Northwestern. After a semester somewhere else, I realized I needed to move. I had three options and I chose Northwestern State University. I'm grateful that I made that decision because it's the place for me. The teachers are very understanding and willing to work with you whenever you need. Resources are always available to you. The different offices are very prompt. The campus is small so the sports fields are within walking distance unlike some other schools giving it a closer atmosphere. There's always something going on there. It's a good school to choose to spend four years."
Sophomore,4,NSU is a great university with tons of on campus clubs and organizations. The only thing I would want to change is the food options on campus.
Sophomore,4,"I love Northwestern. The campus is beautiful and inviting - plus, it's a small town so everything is close by. Everyone is pretty good about posting information and events online so there is always something to do, you definitely have to be cautious so you do not fall behind in class. Most professors are quick to respond and keep their office hours posted so you know when is a good time to stop by. The food kind of really sucks due to their contract with Sudexo, however, there are certain people who actually try to do a good job so if you go when they are there it is not too terrible."
Senior,4,"I love their nursing program. The professors really care about you and want you to succeed! I think it’s awdosme that the Shreveport campus has little parties and get to get herd every once in a while. I like that they give a discount to military dependents, which helps a ton!"
Junior,4,"I haven't been to the main campus in Natchitoches, but the college of nursing and school of allied health campus in Shreveport is good. There are many great teachers there, who were/are nurses who help you tremendously."
Junior,4,"It's a very small town with not much to do, but a very friendly and helpful atmosphere. It is very family oriented and located in a very historical town. There are lots of beautiful lights and a Christmas Fest Downtown during all of December."
Freshman,4,"I actually enjoy attending Northwestern State University because it is a very convenient university.  This university is not an extremely big university and the classroom sizes are perfect.  Also, this campus is 45 minutes from which is also convenient."
Alum,4,Northwestern State Univerosty has a great Hospitality and Tourism Department! It truly help me find a career path I love!
Freshman,4,"I am enjoying my time in the university, I have met many people and have many things to participate in on campus"
Sophomore,4,Creative and Preforming Arts programs are great. Love participating in the Purple Haze Pep Band! I have also had some great professors so far.
Senior,4,what I like about Northwestern is the community the atmosphere. It's always something to do on campus it's never a dull moment.
Freshman,4,I love that Northwestern is a small campus. The  scenery  is beautiful here. The professor here are so welcoming and helpful. Love Northwestern State
Freshman,4,Northwestern State University is an overall amazing school. The professors are my absoulte favorite part. The professors are always willing to help and genuinely care about the students. I feel like the cafeteria could use a little bit of help. The food is always the same and it is not that good. Another thing that could use some help is student life. I feel that everything revolves around Sororities or Fraternities. I feel that all students should be involved.
Senior,4,"Northwestern State University has been one of my best life experiences. At this institute you go through classes that truly prepare you for your career, there are activities for everyone to participate, and there is always someone willing to help if you need them. One thing that could improve would be the financial aid office, they should be able to either have it set to where any student can view their specific scholarship and scholarship requirement, or the office should be able to pull it up to avoid giving false information to students."
Freshman,4,"I like all of the campus activities and opportunities to connect with people. I feel like I the professors are realistic, interested in student success, and, they are understand especially concerning first time freshmans. I feel the transition from high school to college life can be hectic and confusing. However, I felt comfortable after my advising and Freshman Connection. If I could change anything, it would be the process regarding financial aid. Parents and students need more information concerning resources available through the college and the college working toward creating a finacial aid package to best cover the cost when possible."
Freshman,4,"NSU is a small, quiet campus and the academics overall are good. The food is pretty good, and I enjoy the sporting events."
Freshman,4,"I've visited the campus three times and in less than a week I will be moving there. From my past experiences I'm more than ready to move in,the only problem is the cost of going there."
Freshman,4,"So far so good, I'm an incoming freshman and i love this school already. The campus life is amazing , the diversity keeps me comfortable, and the courses i take are not unbelievably hard. I cant wait to start the year off and begin my career as a nurse."
Freshman,4,I love everything about Northwestern State University. Everyone is very helpful. The staff are always on their jobs. Campus life is great and it is easy to learn when you pay attention.
Freshman,4,"It will feel like home to you. Lovely town, and such nice people. Even if you're a Grinch you'll love it during Christmas. The dorms are even really nice for everyone. It's almost like an apartment. Although quite on the expensive side..."
Junior,4,"Northwestern has a very challenging curriculum, and some wonderful teachers. The NSU College of Nursing and Allied Health in Shreveport has been so good to me. I'm proud to be a Demon!"
Sophomore,4,"So, NSULA is pretty good when you live in one of the small cities/towns in LA that doesn't have many colleges near. I've honestly had more problems with this college than any other. But, these problems have normally been solved with some work on my part. Most things need to be done on the main campus (Natchitoches). The campus there is lacking. If furthering your education is your goal you can make the best of it."
Senior,4,I loved my experience at Northwestern. I moved to Northwestern from another previous college and I throughly enjoyed my experience at Northwestern. It was great socially and academically.
Freshman,4,"I recently was admitted this college. It has been a tiring long journey to say the least. Being admitted to this university was a very challenging task due to the fact I am not from Louisiana. The process was very slow and lacked  communication 
 for pertinent information."
Junior,4,"NSU is a great university if you want be close to home, but also far enough away to have a college experience. I have enjoyed my time here."
Alum,4,The best thing about NSU is the teachers.  They are truly experts in their fields. Everyone in the college seems to enjoy their jobs and are very helpful.
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful and full of intriguing history. The staff is wonderful and always willing to do what they can to help you out. There are tons of activities on campus, but if you're not involved with some organizations on campus, you might miss the memo. The sororities ad fraternities are all welcoming and nice. The campus police are very protective of students on campus and make sure everyone is safe at all times and all events."
Freshman,4,I really love here at Northwestern State University. The people her are very welcoming. GO DEMONS!!!
Freshman,4,"Northwestern State is a very friendly college, the professors here are very hands on. The professors are very understanding and always are there for help. The campus life is very live, the students are very connected and are always willing to help each other out. Students understand the struggle of transitioning to college, and generally are very helpful. The campus is gorgeous!"
Sophomore,4,"Northwestern State University is a wonderful university. The students here are culturally diverse & the Greek Life is fantastic, with Pi Kappa Alpha being the choice for me. Natchitoches is the oldest town in Louisiana and is a great college town. I would highly recommend this college to anyone who is wanting to learn with a small town feel. Fork'em Demons!"
Senior,4,Overall Northwestern has been helpful in allowing me to achieve my academic goals. Professors are helpful in answering questions and concerns.
Junior,4,"The school has many options for a career seeker, most offered online.  The online website is simple and easy to navigate.  What I like most is that the staff from all departments help you when you need it. They had a discount for online students when I signed up.  I had never seen that before!"
Freshman,4,"Northwestern state university is a very amazing and life changing college. There is never a dull moment here. There are always different activities for students to do and a lot of tutor centers and academic advising available also. The scenery is amazing also , going to northwestern is a win win situation."
College Senior,2,There isn't much else to do in Natchitoches but party. Most all social occasions involve alcohol after if not during the event.
College Freshman,2,"Towards the end of the year, many people were robbed, including my roommate and I.  Security was enhanced in areas all around campus but people were still getting robbed."
College Junior,2,"Northwestern has a main campus, which is in Natchitoches, LA. I attend nursing school in Shreveport and we do not get the perks of campus meal plans or housing."
College Sophomore,2,No one has pride in athletics
College Sophomore,2,"I believe I should have received scholarship money from Northwestern State from having an outstanding GPA from high school and an outstanding GPA in college. I have remained on the president's list/dean's list, but have not received additional funding from the school. I am constantly begging the scholarship department to offer me scholarship money."
College Senior,2,The food is truly Bland and doesn't have much taste. But on the other hand  in the small restaurant the food is awesome!
College Senior,2,Not everyone recieve scholarships. I have to pay for school sometimes!
College Freshman,2,I don't know what guys are like on campus. I am married.
College Freshman,2,There is not much room for parking so you have to get to the campus early to be able to drive around for a little bit to find parking.
College Freshman,2,"Basically, any time you need to go somewhere you need your own car or find a friend with a car."
College Senior,2,"The weather varies a lot.  One day it can be cold, then the next day it will bright and sunny."
College Freshman,2,Everyone drinks basically. And most of the fraternities do coke. Also a lot of people take prescription drugs to stay focused.
College Freshman,2,"Personally, I like working in the comfort of my own room and at my own time convenience, but there are computers on campus and you pay for a certain amount of prints you can make. However, the wifi availability is iffy. Natty is pretty small, so wifi and phone service kinda sucks."
College Freshman,2,"some days it floods and if you are smart you will call the shuttle but flooding means lots of rain some times students cars are flooded , but when you have to be in the rain most likely you are going to get wet. during the fall is very hot , when it cools down during winter it is very cold ! "
College Freshman,2,"the apartment style dorms are very old and ugly , they need to be remodeled. the washing room and pool is the best thing because the pool have flashing muti color lights.  a lot of students hang out which is good for social but most students do not like the fact that studnets hand out. the cost is too much for what we live in."
College Sophomore,2,"The staff at our school aren't very nice when you call to ask questions. I was selected for verification (and will be every single semester) when applying for financial aid so i have to submit more paperwork than most students. I always have to call and ask questions and the staff can be rude. Eventually I got the aid I needed. I got better financial aid service at my previous school, though."
College Freshman,2,"I haven't noticed any bus services near or around campus, however since most everything is within walking distance I can manage."
College Sophomore,2,"I work for the on-campus dining laces. there are only 3 places to eat. The cafeteria is closed between 2:30 and 4:30. Everything closes before 11. It is overpriced and a sometimes not the best. It could all be better, but it comes down to how motivated the employees are at doing a quality job instead of just trying to feed 1000+ people."
College Sophomore,2,"I am a paranoid person. I do not want to worry about being mugged on the way to my apartment or having my walls paper thin. I have noticed some great places to stay at, but unless you have a reliable roommate to split the bill, it is cheaper to stay on campus.  So there are 3 options for living by yourself: School, cheaper than school and less safe, or more expensive than school housing and safer."
College Junior,2,"its not much of a reliable process at all
if you are not face to face with them you will not get anything done"
College Junior,2,"Here its hot one day, raining the next, and then freezing"
Recent Alumnus,2,The weather varies at NSU. This sometimes can be a pain  much less a problem. Classes are sometimes ten minutes away from my apartment and it is hard trying to fight the weather. One day it can be hot and the next day its cold as ice. I guess this is Louisiana weather.
College Junior,2,Natchitoches does not offer very many restaurants.  Dine-in or fast food.  It is a fairly small town.  I know of a few fast food places that offer a small student discount with student ID.
College Junior,2,"The facilities are acceptable, but I do not frequent them."
College Junior,2,"I lived on campus for three semesters.. Rooms were relatively clean, but the office was not very organized, the hallways were messy, elevators broken.  Secure though, overall okay."
College Freshman,2,"They are nice and very well looking, but you will almost never get the roommate that you desire. They mix applications and give you somebody completely different than what you originally 'expected'. The dorms are however pretty nice and clean."
College Freshman,2,"They have food but its not a good variety. They serve basically the same foods everyday. Its good and healthy, but its not a wide variety."
College Freshman,2,"The community is very good and the down town area is nice. Great place to raise a family, but as a college student the night life and shopping are VERY limited."
College Freshman,2,"We don't have a lot of anything on campus for greeks. They don't have special housing, and all I ever see them do is walk around. Based on what I and most of the students around campus see, our greek life is boring. I wish they had parties!! The alpha's are the only ones who are very active! Most of our greeks are put off campus for hazing right now."
College Junior,2,Parking permit is $45 a year.  Tickets are generally $35 for parking in the wrong spot.  The need for a car on campus is slim if you like to walk or ride a bicycle.  Parking can be a nightmare if you do not get to campus early in the morning because there are a lot of commuters.  Parking lots are not very large and there are few of these lots.
College Junior,2,The only dining options that we have on the Shreveport campus include the vending machines and bringing your own lunch. There are refridgerators and microwaves located on campus and several fast food restaurants located in the area around the campus.
College Freshman,2,They don't pay around with alcohol in the dorms. Noise is another thing they don't tolerate. But when you need them (like when your dorm gets broken into) they take their sweet time. Not very helpful at all.
College Sophomore,2,"I am receiving barely any financial aid and I have to take out multiple loans. It sucks. I wish there were more scholarships avaliable. I don't even qualify for a Pell Grant, but my father and sister qualify at Southeastern!"
College Junior,2,"Many people here like the Greek organizations, but many are discouraged to apply because (and this is mostly applicable to the ethnic groups) they are terribly petty. It is about who you know. They have a party once in a blue moon for the sorrorities, but the frats throw the most fun parties the most often. The sorrorites do not seem to be very active in our little town."
College Junior,2,"Good Rooms, Bad People – The rooms are excellent for a first time college freshman, and even sophomore. The price, however, is absolutely ridiculous. And the people that work the housing office are just awful."
College Freshman,2,"Parking at NSU couldnt be any worse. To get a good spot you have to be there 45- 30 min early if you want a good spot. Honestly if you live on campus there really is no reason to drive to class, unless you are late. Buildings are rather close to one another and once you get accustomed to the campus walking to class is no hassle at all. Also walking saves gas so why not walk? The cops/security will give you a ticket if you park wrong or in an area that is not meant to be a parking space. They are not lenient and give out tickets with no problem. I ticket ranges from $30-$40 for a parking violation. Try and walk ,but if you must drive then be careful."
College Sophomore,2,I Have Never Felt Unsafe on Campus but Am Not on Campus a Lot. I have never felt unsafe on campus but I am an online student and I do not visit the campus a lot.
College Sophomore,2,"I Am Strictly an Online Student and Don't Have to Go to the Campus a Lot. The few times that I have been to the campus were to see about financial aid, to be advised about my next step, or to get a student ID.  The buildings that I had to go to were considered to be older and in need of some repair."
College Freshman,2,"Stay Home and Study – The nightlife in Natchitoches, aka ""Natty"", is boring. If you come from a small town, as most students do, you'll think it's amazing. If you come from a larger city as I do, you'll think it's lame. I'd rather stay at home and study rather than watch a bunch of drunk girls look at themselves dance in the mirror."
College Junior,2,"Same Thing Over and Over – We have three different spots on campus that we eat from. They are the cafe, grill, and vic's the food is OK but I do think that we are getting our money worth for what we pay."
Sophomore,1,"I am currently in the process of transferring to a different college because I truly hate NSU. They say that their goal is to dedicate their resources to your education, but it's funny how when you try to ask any questions concerning money they seem to become extremely tight lipped. They charge you for things out of nowhere, and they say that your tuition covers everything, but that is not the case. I had to shell out over $500 for background checks, drug screens, and everything else they made us pay for for my program. Getting in contact with anyone from this school is next to impossible, and even if you do get ahold of someone, nine times out of ten, they have no idea what they are talking about. I do not recommend this school to anyone, and if you are looking for a quality education, spend your money elsewhere."
Junior,1,"Although, I am strictly an online student. This is by far the worst school I have ever attended. Financial aid office is rude and quite frankly not helpful at all. I never had a single problem with my financial aid grants or loans until I came here, then I'm now waiting months to weeks for my refund money. Another thing, the professors can be quite rude as well, they do not respond to e-mail's like they should daily. I would never recommend someone to go to NSU!"
College Sophomore,1,They wont let you know if you would be awarded your financial aid until people have gotten theres and you havent. After that they will tell you what to do and then it still will take some time for you to receive your refund.
College Freshman,1,when your guest arrive after nine at night they have to go through a gate where police is and they have to give a name and dorm number I think that sucks.
College Junior,1,There is no Campus dining at my campus. It is at the main campus
College Junior,1,"You Will Be Punished – I have no personal experience with the campus police. I do hear if you park where students are prohibited to park, you will get a ticket. Anyone caught in places they should not be at a certain time are entitled to a warning first and a more harsh punishment if caught again. If you are a person that likes to let people into buildings or housing areas that do not have IDs, I suggest you stop. There have been recent assault incidents that are making the police more forceful about obeying campus policies."
College Sophomore,1,NSU Policy – I do not agree with the housing policy. I do not think it is fair for NSU to tell people where they have to stay. I also do not like the fact that the police write tickets for every little thing.
College Junior,1,I hate microwaveable food.  Your best bet is to drive off campus.
College Freshman,1,There is barely any parking at the campus. Most of the parking is for commuters and the ones that live on campus have to walk every where. There are parking zones for certain types of stickers and if your in the wrong zone you will get a ticket.
College Senior,1,Don't Do It! Two words: Frog Pond.  Two more words: crime spree.
College Junior,1,"There is absolutely no form of public transportation in Natchitoches or at Northwestern State University. You either walk, or you drive your car. There is certainly need for shuttle buses (such as out to the bars and local attractions) from the university or somewhere in town for students to enjoy the town entirely."
College Freshman,1,What Is up With the Permit Cost – Why in the world should we have to pay to park at a place that we have already pain more than $1000 dollars to live?

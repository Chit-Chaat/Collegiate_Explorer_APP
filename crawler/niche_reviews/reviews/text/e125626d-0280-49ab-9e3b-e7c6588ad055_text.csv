Junior,5,Professors online are great they will assist you within 24 hours of any questions you may need and very helpful.
Junior,5,Lake Sumter is close to home and a great school to get Into if you can’t afford a major university and a great campus environment.
Niche User,5,This is a great school. Can't wait to attend. The staff is amazing and helpful to your needs. Huge and amazing campus with lots of different programs to attend.
Niche User,5,Staff and teachers are great. Love this school and the online experience with them is great and teachers are very helpful and accommodate your needs.
Freshman,5,Online classes overall are not easy for me! I may be biased because I am used to going on campus full time but the transition has felt pretty seamless for someone who is not a fan
Freshman,5,Lake-Sumter State College has an awesome staff!! Extremely helpful and understanding especially with everything going on
Niche User,5,"I prefer learning online to learning in a classroom setting. I find that it gives me more control of the situation and allows me to be a little bit more flexible with my schedule. I never found a classroom setting helpful, so having the opportunity to learn online has been a relief. In most cases, professors were helpful and replied quickly."
Junior,5,"Lake Sumter State College is a wonderful school, the environment and teachers are great. One thing I can honestly say is that the staff really cares about you education."
Junior,5,My overall experience was pretty fair because since this Covid-19 pandemic has started its been really rough getting adjusted to the new normal. But I can say my teachers pushed through to do their best and help us lean the curriculum.
Sophomore,5,"I worked online with Lake-Sumter before the quarantine hit and found that its well structured and easy to manage. Even with the accommodations with quarantine, I found it easy to get the work I need to do done."
Junior,5,"My experience with Lake Sumter State College has been amazing. I started as a dual enrollment student my senior year of high school. I currently work at LSSC and the way that they handled everything with COVID-19 is outstanding. Many employees now work from home, students received assistance through an emergency assistance program, and LSSC had a food drive for students and employees. This school really cares about its students and employees. The decision to continue my education there after graduation was the best decision I made."
Junior,5,"Currently, I am working on my bachelors degree which is fully online. I really enjoy it because it gives me the freedom to start and finish my homework at my own pace. I have not had any problems. The instructors are helpful and are easy to reach."
Niche User,5,The buildings were state of the art. The offering of online and seated classes was very good. No problems finding classes. Professors were responsive. No complaints.
Senior,5,I have a great experience at lake Sumter. I love the many different events that Lake Sumter hosts. I also feel that lake Sumter helps and achieve their students to success.
Senior,5,My experience with online courses was very interesting. The professors would always be there to help and guide you. The work was done at your own pace even though it had a deadline but it was not that much pressure.
Freshman,5,"Great school! Amazing professors, especially Ms.Karlins and Mrs.Brown! A very tight-knit campus, where everyone is involved"
Freshman,5,"Great school! Amazing professors, especially Ms.Karlins and Mrs.Brown! A very tight-knit campus, where everyone is involved"
Senior,5,Lake-Sumter State College was a great smaller college to go for an intro college instead of jumping straight into a bigger college like a university. It had many classes to take for the degree you are pursuing and you could always find help whenever your stuck on homework or if you needed a tutor. Many of the teachers there are very accommodating and understanding. You are able to pick classes at the times you want and make the perfect schedule for yourself. After getting your associates degree with Lake Sumter you can transfer to a university in partnership with guaranteed admission so you can save some money and not have to commute a long distance.
Niche User,5,"I am a dual enrolled student at Lake-Sumter state college in Clermont. I believe this school has the best professors. They are very clear with what they expect and provide various ways to communicate with them outside of office hours. I am never afraid to ask for help. In addition, although I take classes at my High School I also take various courses at lssc. I have a good understanding of the campus life. Everyone is welcoming and on a day to day bases it is typically a quiet campus."
Sophomore,5,"Lake Sumter State College is an amazing school. I am receiving my Associate's Degree from this school while still in high school through Dual Enrollment,  and it is amazing how they work with my high school to give me this opportunity."
Freshman,5,I admire that they give us the opportunity to earn our AA on a specific track to prepare us for our majors. They do an excellent job and helping me get ready for the real world and a harder school someday.
Freshman,5,"I love Lake-Sumter State College! It is my first year attending and I already feel like family. The faculty and staff here are both so very helpful. My teachers are very helpful when it comes to assignments. I love attending a 4-year college but still being close to home, where I belong. Lake-Sumter was my first choice and i am so glad I never considered changing my mind."
Sophomore,5,"I think its a amazing school never had any difficulty with teachers or students everybody is super helpful, this school helps me to feel inspired to learn."
Sophomore,5,I like that this college has plenty of options for the same class that fits around your schedule. I was able to successfully handle working a part-time job and going to school full time. The flexibility provided by this college was great.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at LSSC was unimaginable. Being a local to the school I honestly was dreading attending here. However, I received an athletic scholarship to play volleyball. With this little thing I thought maybe commuting to school would be a little more bearable. And it was. As a student-athlete at LSSC, I have been so involved not only in my studies but the schools history. This past volleyball season, fall 2018, my team made school history as the first athletic team to win their district/conference and attend nationals. I am so proud of the legacy my team and I have started at LSSC! And we seriously could not have achieved such an amazing goal if it was not for the supportive staff and student life at Lake-Sumter."
Niche User,5,"The majority of the faculty are very helpful, friendly, and nice. It is rare to have a bad encounter with a faculty member."
Niche User,5,"I have been taking classes this past semester and enjoy all my teachers, peers and environment of Lake Sumter State College. Most teachers and classes use an online computer system that I easy to use and consolidates all information in one simple application. The campus is beautiful with green grasses and shady trees. There are multiple opportunities to join in Student Life activities."
Freshman,5,It is a great state college and close to home and very affordable. I love that the class sizes are small which means more one on one with the professor. I feel like it needs a better cafe.
Sophomore,5,"I like Lake-Sumter State College for the diversity and how different it is from high school. Of course, there are quite a few Dual Enrollment and Early Admission students, myself included. However, the students are quite mature and the teachers are, on average, very knowledgeable in their subjects. However, there are a few teachers that tend to ramble about political things that don't need to be brought up in class. In any case, a very good small school and I recommend it to anyone living in the Leesburg area. The Clermont campus is also very lovely but I have not attended classes on this campus and thus cannot say more about it and the Sumter campus is incredibly small."
Junior,5,"Very good small college, there are very good professors who want their students to succeed. There are a lot of clubs to be involved in and they have lots of resources for students to study and get their work done."
Freshman,5,"I really love this college, they make the environment very comfortable for the students attending. They have a student lounge where you can play billiards, foosball and they also even added a volleyball court in the Clermont campus. The teachers are very kind and understanding, they are always there to help you with your work. If only I could get my bachelors degree with them I wouldn't be thinking about transferring over to a university."
Junior,5,I’m currently attending the nursing program. The only issue I’ve had at this school was with financial aid. But overall it’s a really good school and professors work well with you.
Sophomore,5,"Really good professors, a lot of available courses, and a sweet cafeteria. Lot's of nearby places off the campus to get food too."
Freshman,5,"This school is such a good mile stone for young adults coming out of high school. I’m here on a softball scholarship and honestly it’s such a good feeling to be involved in the athletics of this school. Being that there is only three sports, baseball, softball, and volleyball, all of us are pretty close and supportive with each other. The teachers are so much help and I’m so thankful for the opportunities I’ve been given on this journey of mine."
Alum,5,"From my 2-year experience at LSSC, I wish I could continue my studies there, but I can't. If you're looking to pursue your AA degree in any field, go to LSSC! They'll make it worth your while with fun activities, socialization, and also study areas all around the campus. Although it's a small college, it's an amazing place to connect with your professors and create friendships that might last a lifetime!"
Sophomore,5,"What I like about Lake-Sumter is that it is affordable and faculty and staff are very welcoming. I'm currently taking 5 classes here, with 3 of them being online. The size of the classroom is small, which I like because you have a better connection with your professors. The college's system is very easy to use, I haven't had any complications. I love being a part of LSSC."
Sophomore,5,"If you like a small town atmosphere, Lake Sumter is perfect. I enjoyed the small class sizes. The campus is pretty easy to navigate. The only downside is there is not as much social programs as bigger universities. Overall, a great school to get your general education classes completed."
Freshman,5,"I am a High school senior at Umatilla High School and will be attending Lake-Sumter State College in the spring of 2018. I have seen the campus and have talked to the teachers on campus and by far can say I love the atmosphere completely. Everyone is so kind and so helpful. Being a upcoming freshman in college can be a scary thing, but at Lake-Sumter State College, I feel safe, and everyone there is so welcomed. I can't wait to start my classes in the spring to have a different atmosphere from high school and start my career path with Lake-Sumter State College and meet my new teachers and officially become a Lake Hawk!"
Freshman,5,"Being that Lake Sumter is a smaller college, I really enjoyed that you can get more one on one time with your professor and the amount of study groups on campus."
Freshman,5,"My overall experience at Lake Sumter State College has been amazing so far. I have met very nice people (students and professors). My academic progress has been very good since the professors have an excellent teaching method. The student life is excellent, there are enough places around campus to hang out with your friends in between classes or to study. The food at the cafeteria is also very good, there’s a large variety and good service. But the best thing about Lake Sumter College are the academic advisors, they are always there when you need help regarding what classes you should take or how to bring up your GPA. I would highly recommend LSSC to anybody who wants to earn an AA degree or even a four year degree. It is definitely one of the best Florida Colleges."
Freshman,5,Lake Sumter is an amazing school! They are really focused on seeing you pursue your goals and getting you the help you need to succeed in your future.
Freshman,5,"I loved my first few classes here for the fall semester, I am excited for my next few in the spring semester."
Sophomore,5,"It  is  a wonderful College. The staff is amazingmy helpful accomodating and knowledgeable. The college has a devisified time slots and dates for the offered courses by semester, to accommodate every student.
Their website is very well designed and easy to use, allowing for registration, financial aid documents provision and other matters. The College location is very convenient accesible and right next to the Library, making easy for students.
I am very satisfied with Lake Sumter and looking forward to obtain my A.A then continue to my Bachelor's degree."
Junior,5,"I was able to complete my last two years of High School and my AA simultaneously as a Dual Enrollment Student. Because I was able to access nearly all of my courses online,  I could still continue to work as an equestrian working student 70 hours a week and compete my horse. So glad I did it!"
Niche User,5,"Overall a great experience. Small campus size, so it's easy to get around, really great faculty, and a very easy experience applying, registering, and attending classes. Very working adult friendly, with flexible class schedules."
Graduate Student,5,"I like the fact that the classes are smaller, which makes it easier for the teachers to help a student."
Freshman,5,My experience with Lake-Sumter has been amazing. I would offer this college to anyone who is looking for a easy fresh start to college without spending too much money. Finding your class is very easy and the professors are willing to help anyone who asks.
Freshman,5,I enjoy being apart of Lake Sumter State College. The teachers are amazing and they have a lot of classes to fit my schedule and needs.
Freshman,5,Lake Sumter is a very nice school that has helped me learn a lot. The teachers at this school are incredible. They help you learn in your own special way. The classes are small and it helps that they are small because the teachers get to know you and your personal learning styles which is great because I've gotten the best overall experience and one of the best chances at an education could have gotten.
Niche User,5,"Lake-Sumter State College has given me a delightful experience being a dual enrollment student over the summer of 2016. The teacher I had was incredible attentive and kind, and the class was just the right size to feel connected to everyone. The campus is quaint and breezy, and offers numerous clubs and activities for students. I have enjoyed going to tournaments and attending as a student."
Sophomore,5,"I feel like LSSC is underestimated. Lake-Sumter has so many unexpected, amazing opportunities in and out of the classroom and every faculty person that you meet is so kind and willing to help. All of my professors so far have been very competent and helpful with any questions or concerns I may have. There are great clubs and athletics that people can get involved in. Academic advising and career advising are really supportive and quick to provide help.
If you're interested in attending LSSC, my main advice is to know what opportunities are available to you, because it is more that you would expect."
Freshman,5,"The teachers really pushed me to do better and take on as much as I could without overwhelming myself. In addition they were all more than willing to help me whenever I needed it or had questions, making the learning experience much more enjoyable."
Freshman,5,I would not like to see anything change although the email system could be updated so that we can get an alert to our computer. overall the school is great and the academic advisers really work with you.
College Sophomore,5,I have taken mostly online classes and they are the way to go for me. It is kind of at your own pace and less stress from all the people.
College Sophomore,5,I love how they have classes set up. They are super flexible. And also the professors are very good here.
College Sophomore,5,"The courses are fast and simple to go through, the class size is reasonable being about the same size of a high school classroom, and the courses offered are varied and numbered."
College Sophomore,5,Many job programs are offered here at the school such as job fairs and many events that will help students find the job and succeed in a job interview if help is needed.
College Sophomore,5,I have had no problems with the flexibility of my classes and I have a full time job and I am enrolled as a full time student. I would definitely say that online classes would be a big contributor to that because you can actually schedule your tests and the like so they can fit around your outside schedule.
College Senior,5,The flexibility allows me to do my degree program and work the two full time jobs it takes for me to pay for college.
College Senior,5,I find the online courses easy to navigate and submit assignments.
Junior,4,"In previous years I always had a seated class.  When I began to take online classes I was scared at first because I had no one to guide me, but after some time I began to learn what methods worked for me. My professors with some exceptions helped tremendously by responding to emails quickly, going more in-depth with course material, and understanding if emergencies arise."
Freshman,4,I am still a freshman at Lake Sumter State College. They are very helpful so far and they’re making it quite easy to navigate around. I just wish a lot of them would answer their phones and that they weren’t closed often. I hope that in the spring we can return back to campus with safe measures and A clean Campus! Overall I would recommend Lake Sumter period I made it very easy to pick classes and me and my friend have the same exact schedule due to the easy nice of picking classes they seem pretty laid back as well so highly recommended!
Freshman,4,Due to the circumstances of COVID-19 I understand how hard they are trying to make it easy online without physically being there. They are trying their best and I totally understand that. I’m still trying to get the hang of it because it’s all new to me as well. I’m sure by the spring semester I will have it down packed!
Alum,4,"When I did Dual Enrollment at LSSC it was nice they treated us high schoolers like adults, but also a downside to that was they expected a lot from us. None eased us into it, they kinda just threw us into the ocean and hoped that we could find away to survive. I truly did enjoy going to school here there was just a lot going on. Everything kinda leveled itself out when I transitioned from dual enrollment to full time at LSSC after my high school graduation. I truly loved it there! I especially loved my time as the Vice President of Service for their Phi Theta Kapps chapter!"
Sophomore,4,Its a great entry level college for someone who is looking to go to school on a budget and live at home to save money. I initially started my college career going to a private four year university and spending way too much money for a mediocre education. After a semester there I realized it was time to go back home and rethink where I was going with my education. Lake-Sumter has been great for me and it is a very good option for people who are just starting out or even going back to school. Great education for a fraction of the price you spend at the bigger universities. So worth it.
Sophomore,4,"Learning online can be hard for everyone, but the professors and school itself really make online schooling as smooth of a ride as they can. They're all really there to help you succeed."
Sophomore,4,My experience in Lake-Sumter State College has been really refreshing. Coming out of high school I was incredibly nervous on how I would manage but Lake-Sumter proved to be the break I needed. My academic performance has improved since enrolling. There are a few teachers that I am not entirely fond of but in the end they still furthered my education and helped me quite a lot!
Niche User,4,The professors were very responsive. The curriculum for my online classes was very good. I had no issues with online classes at all. The submissions were appropriate and the professors were pretty easygoing if you could prove you tried to submit such as pictures.
Sophomore,4,"Overall for a community college, Lake Sumter State College is an excellent college to start with. The professors are friendly and do want to see you succeed. I've made plenty of connections and resources while going here to help me going forward in school and life. I would like to see the campus get an update I feel like that would draw more students in and to have more resources available for student Veterans."
Sophomore,4,"My experiences with online courses were better than expected. The professors communicate with you and have office hours if you need in-person help with the course work. With online classes, it's up to you to do the work and keep up with the class. And if you don't understand the material, you have to reach out to the professor for help. I took both seated and online courses."
Sophomore,4,"My Online Learning experience for the most part isnt all that bad, i have a lot more time on my hands, but i forget about assignments until the last minute, but hopefully i get back on track and focus on my assignments more, as i am still going to school; just online."
Sophomore,4,"Lake Sumter is a pretty well-rounded school with pretty do academics, and pretty good professors for all subjects."
Sophomore,4,"I have attended Lake-Sumter at the South Lake Campus for two years. Lake-Sumter is a relatively small school. There are no options for on-campus housing, and the student population is not very large. However, I have had a wonderful experience at this school. Because of the small class size, it is usually easy to contact your instructor if you have questions. Most of the professor are eager to help. Although it is not a heavily populated school, groups like the Student Government Association are consistently coming up with new ideas to get students involved and provide opportunities to learn more about the community."
Sophomore,4,A good community college in a small town. Great professors with small class sizes that want to see you succeed and make the time for you.
Niche User,4,"Lake Sumter is a great college, and I enjoy getting my education from there. Most of the teachers are understanding and very helpful. Some teachers do not teach and you have to teach yourself in order to pass the class. The environment is very nice and all the clubs seem fun and full of life. This is a great college to attend and I would recommend attending it. It will not disappoint!"
Sophomore,4,"After participating in their dual enrollment program they have allowed me to excel in many areas in which I like. They have allowed a nice safe environment to learn and offer great opportunities to learn if something is not grasped right away. Overall, great experience so far and hope to continue."
Niche User,4,"I spend most of my time as a dual enrollment student, so I cannot make too many comments about the actual campus. The classes are simple, and they have truly helped me in order to advance my college education in high school"
Alum,4,Teachers and Staff are wonderful! There are times where they may be frustrated or annoyed but most of the time they are really dedicated to their jobs in helping students with their needs.
Freshman,4,"Lake Sumter State College is a great college for Dual-Enrollment. When I attended the college I was already out of high school, and the scene was not for me. The facility has great professors who generally care about your future, they are willing to help as much as possible when you struggle on learning material. The counseling is average rate for my personal beliefs, counselors do care and periodically check up on your progress with the establishment, personal affairs, etc. Personally I recommend this school to anyone who is comfortable with small college institution population, compared to a university where the population has higher occupants."
Freshman,4,"This is my first time in college, so far its been pretty good. I love how the instructors and administrators help and make sure you stay on top of your work in any & every way. The only problem I had with my LSSC is when I called to talk to Financial Aid I could barely get a hold of anyone. I did not not know much about Financial aid & how to use it my first year, if there were more clarifications that's the only change I would suggest. Overall, I am excited to finish this semester and graduate from LSSC."
Sophomore,4,"Even though the school is small, it still gives the best opportunities for students. From the teachers that are always there to help due to small class sizes. To the resources openly and readily available to any student. The best part to me is the cost of attendance. It is completely affordable and I highly appreciate it."
Niche User,4,I loved all of the professors they are nice and the classes I took tended to be small so all of my professors knew me by name.
Sophomore,4,"Depends on the campus. They recently closed the restaurant, which is really inconvenient. The South Lake campus is beautiful, the sumter is tiny. Leesburg is the largest. I love the South Lake one. Many of the professors are kind, intelligent, and understanding. I've had some awesome teachers here that I would recommend to anyone."
Sophomore,4,"Lake Sumter offers its students a lot of opportunities, for instance, scholarship opportunities and jobs on campus. The campus is a relatively small campus that is kept clean, and there is always campus security around which makes the students feel safe. LSSC a lot of classes from all subjects and LSSC also a nursing program the is excellent. The student recreation center is a relatvity small building located near the back of the camps that serve as a place for students to relax. LSSC has a cafe that has foods ranging from burgers to pizza with drinks like coffe, soda, and water."
Senior,4,"Very calm and tranquil campus. Their academics need improvements though. They offer a variety of courses and majors to choose from. However, not all their professors are very professional at their jobs, and some of the textbooks they use in their course are of poor quality. They are a small community college, but they are growing, so I believe they should have increased security around. They are not very expensive, and there is not much of a party scene on the campus, aside from camps events done by the student government or administrators. Their most popular major is nursing, which they off a nursing program for. If your interest is in nursing, then I would recommend this college for you."
Sophomore,4,Loved the classroom sizes. Easy to maneuver at the Leesburg campus. Professors seem like they take time to listen as well.
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely have enjoyed the past two years I have been studying here at LSSC towards my Associates. The Student Life at LSSC is very diverse and has something for everyone, every week. There is a wide variety of clubs to join. The professors are FANTASTIC! They are so willing to help, genuinely want to see you succeed and have great knowledge on the subject they are teaching. Overall, I highly recommend Lake Sumter State College."
Niche User,4,"lake sumter is a wonderful experience, everyone is very nice and helpful. The teachers are very professional and experience. its a great college to start at, everyone is really involved with your learning."
Sophomore,4,"Lake-Sumter is overall a good college. They have recently changed to a state college, but still has the community feel. Half of the campus if filled with dual-enrollment students and older adults coming back. It is in a smaller town, but conveniently in the middle of town. The classes are small enough where you can ask questions and have a personal relationship with your professor. They offer multiple clubs and sports and Lake-Sumter is a great place to get involved."
Sophomore,4,I loved how much the teachers cared about us students. It so comfortable and affordable. It made you feel like you were at home. The staff also helped you alot.
Sophomore,4,"The teachers are very helpful and genuinely want you to pass. I took English Comp there and for the final paper which was worth twenty percent of our grade, the professor set up mandatory meetings with each student individually to go over the good and bad parts of the paper in order to receive a better grade. This really helped me and was greatly appreciated that a teacher would take out that much time to help all her students do the best that they could do in order to receive the best grade possible."
Freshman,4,As this is my first year at Lake-Sumter State College it is pretty good and had met all my expectations. If I could change one thing it would be more allowing eligibility for financial aid. The professors are very knowledgeable in the courses they teach and the likelihood of getting a bad one is slim to none. There is always something going on involving free food with the student government and there are multiple organizations to join.
Freshman,4,Administration staff are very helpful. Class type options are well varied. Great opportunities to connect and transfer to larger university.
Sophomore,4,"Lake-Sumter State College is a wonderful college for helping you get an A.A. or A.S. They also offer very well courses that you can take before you transfer to a university, much like University of Central Florida. The workers there are very nice and personal, and most of the professors are great people. It's very much like a home for most of it's students. I wish it would offer more classes for more major related subjects. Plus, maybe in the future offer some dorms so living near the college would be efficient and maybe cheaper."
Freshman,4,"I liked that there is every kind of help available, like in the learning center we can get help from tutors for free and we can also study there in a quiet environment. I would like to have some more knowledge before turning in the assignment. For example, I need to know how my teacher wants it done so I can do it like that."
Sophomore,4,"It's a great school for people looking to get an AA or dual enroll in high school. If you're wanting to get a degree without getting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of student loan debt, it's a great school to attend."
Niche User,4,"I liked how small the classes are at the college. The teachers, faculty, and classrooms are all good. There are many clubs to join and student life is everywhere you go whether it's outside or in the library. The library is my favorite place because it has many choices for literature and has a nice and big place designated for quiet studying. The café in the college is good but I would like to see more options on campus. However, there are fast food places nearby on Highway 50 so it isn't really a big deal. The security there is good and I haven't heard of any problems with theft or criminals at the college."
Freshman,4,"Right off the bat I could tell this was a more relaxed college. Classes are small, about twenty to twenty-five students each. I personally like this as you can be more involved with the instructor. The registering process for classes was quick and easy to learn. All the instructors I have had so far were knowledgeable, helpful, and understanding. The college counselors can sympathize with students and are very good at helping you decide on your future classes. However, if you are someone who would like to be more involved in your college and are a very social person Lake Sumter might not be for you."
Freshman,4,"Lake Sumter State College is a relatively small college near Orlando. However, it is actually located in three different cities. Lake Sumter is specialized for nursing degrees and also offers a few other Bachelor’s opportunities. Most of the degrees that can be pursued at Lake Sumter are Associate’s. Nevertheless, the College offers a high diversity of classes which can then be transferred to a four year university. The tuition is affordable, however since I am an international student and therefore have to pay the out-of-state fee, I still struggle. There are not overly many opportunities for me to work on campus. Lake Sumter offers a variety of work scholarships such as being part of the Student Government or writing for the school’s newspaper. The food provided at Lake Sumter is not overly great, so if you are a gourmet you should stay away! Otherwise Lake Sumter could be a good school for you!"
Niche User,4,"I love this school. The classes are small, so it's an easy learning environment. I've yet to have a bad professor in the two semesters I've been dual enrolled there. The campus has a very fun atmosphere and I just absolutely love it!"
Freshman,4,"I have Reites for ENC1101 and Croson for Music Appreciation. They're both very nice! The campus is clean, and the people who go there are very friendly. I have yet to encounter someone mean! Overall, a great place to get a two-year degree and transfer to another college."
College Junior,4,"Thus far, my experience with my school has been great.  Though, as I am a ""first time"" student, I did not have credits transferred, therefore, I do not have experience with that."
College Junior,4,"The class sizes have pleased me very much.  I have a bit of social anxiety and do not like large classes.  Also, I have learned more from one teacher in a semester than I did throughout all of my years in high school."
College Junior,4,"Personally, I believe that the courses that are required by my career track are very helpful and useful.  I do not find that they are ""fillers"" of education or a waste of money."
College Junior,4,"Personally, I find that Lake Sumter is a phenomenal option for those who either cannot afford a large college or university or for some who cannot or does not want to leave, locally.  It is an overall great choice."
College Sophomore,4,I was able to take night classes
College Junior,4,"Thus far, my favorite course has been english, where I experienced the most ethical, informative and wonderful professor that I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.  Her name is Jennifer Fox and I would highly recommend her to teach anyone at all.  The staff at the college are extremely friendly and available to help you during convenient hours."
College Junior,4,"I actually enjoy online courses, they work with my schedule pretty well and I can get things done without having to go to the campus and do it there."
College Sophomore,4,They have many class options that best fit your schedule
College Sophomore,4,After you get your AA they will send your transcripts anywhere in the US
College Sophomore,4,the college offers a direct connect to USF which is great
College Sophomore,4,They offer a huge variety of classes that help each students needs.
College Sophomore,4,For being a first time college student lake Sumter truly helps you every step of the way! They make sure no one gets left behind!
College Sophomore,4,I've worked with many Lake Sumter State College graduates. Most are successful. I'd say a degree from LSSC is quite valuable.
College Sophomore,4,So far I've only had good experiences with the professors at LSSC.
College Sophomore,4,Lake Sumter State college is an great school. I've not been to any other state colleges so I don't a have any other colleges to compare it to. I can remember my English instructor was very understanding when my son was newborn and allowed me extra time to turn in my report. That experience alone made Lake Sumter an exceptional school.
College Sophomore,4,"The credits were easily transferred from high school (AP Course Credits), with no hassle."
College Sophomore,4,Job fairs come to the school once every month and many job prospecting events are held here once every month as well.
College Sophomore,4,"Currently this is a community college with few majors that you can apply to, however you can transfer to a university to forward your major education there if it is not offered here."
College Sophomore,4,The community style feeling makes it feel very comfortable and for a great first time college experience that is also affordable for those who cannot afford the big universities.
Niche User,2,"Just like high school that you have to pay for. If you go to school in Sumter and decide to go here, you see all the same people from high school. It is horrible and a joke. Best thing you can do is go to school somewhere else if you are financially able. People that like going to LSSC are afraid to leave Sumter, and its sad."
Sophomore,2,"I have attended this school for 2 years. I struggled with administration, financial aid and advisors from day 1. If you are attempting for nursing and live outside of lake or sumter county, you will not get in.. no matter how high your marks are. It is virtually impossible to get in as an Orange county resident. They don't tell you this until the very end after you spent money to attend their pre-reqs. ALSO, this is the only school to require the HESI test. It costs money and if you don't get in, due to zip code... you then have to reapply with the TEAS test for ANY other program in Central Florida. I had a great A&P teacher and learned a lot in the microbiology class. That is the only reason I am giving this school 2 stars, also I enjoyed the student body. Mainly people my age and other single mothers. Unless, you are a lake county resident DONT even bother applying to their very disorganized nursing program. They will waste your time, change requirements and give you the run around"
Niche User,2,"I liked how small the classes were. i have only taken three classes at lake sumter and i have only had a problem with one professor. lake sumter is a great transition from highschool to college if you are not ready for a big univeristy. I would like to improve the office administration, they are not much helpful."
College Sophomore,2,Online classes everywhere are painful...
College Sophomore,2,They aren't very fast on responses. When they did respond they were short and to the point. Didn't reward me my financial aid for books till the last day to get them. So I haven't even got my books. I kind of wish I didn't apply here. This is my first experience in college and it has been hortible.
College Sophomore,2,"The only career prospect that gains any attraction at Lake-Sumter is the nursing program. Recently the school has been pushing STEM and encouraging the new-to-college students to join, so the nursing and engineering programs are the ones who have the most dedicated students who I believe are the most motivated on campus. I also feel like the STEM program is more funded than the majors more in line with the arts and humanities, which is a bit unfair to the large majority of students who will not be RN's or future engineers. I think cutting the professors and types of classes offered in other departments is a bad move for the students."
College Student,2,Matlab needs a lot of work
College Junior,2,"There is a lot of diversity at my school, but nobody speaks to one another. I went through my first year of college trying to talk and meet new people, but I made maybe one new friend. Everyone goes there, goes to class, and leaves without saying a word to anyone around them"
College Student,2,It take FOREVER to get s reply back. They never answer the phone and then when you go to see them on campus they close at 4:30 they are closed at 4:10! Horrible
College Student,2,It needs a gym and a better and bigger cafeteria that is not too expensive.
College Sophomore,2,only have activities early in day
College Sophomore,2,financial aid not helpful not many resources available in evening
College Freshman,2,the classes are quite easy overall and so far the only difficult one was only difficult because the professor made it so. It was not a science or math class.
College Junior,2,"I have not yet graduated from LSSC, so I am not quite sure how the post-grad services are, but I have spoken to a career advisor and I can say that it was very difficult to schedule an appointment with her, as she is often working at another campus, and when I did get to sit down and talk with her, I felt like I was being rushed and she treated me as if she had better things to do."
College Junior,2,My issue revolved around the financial aid process.   Poor communication upfront during the application process led to not receiving aid.   After the fact their solution was for me to switch majors.  I am going into nursing their option was for me to go into business management.
College Freshman,2,My school does not offer my major so I will only be able to receive a AA degree then I will have to transfer colleges to a university that offers my program.   
College Freshman,2,The school offers many programs however it is a new university and the programs are limited to associates degrees. 
College Freshman,2,"The education I am getting is the same at a university however is not as expensive, however I do not qualify for any financial aid which in turn can be challenging. "
College Sophomore,2,"don't cater to older students, act like you are all just recent high school grads or have no prior college experience"
College Sophomore,2,no tutors in learning center to go for help
Graduate Student,1,"If you are planning on taking the nursing program, don't. There are so many things wrong with the program that everyone has dealt with in my class. I've been in the program for 2 years, and all of the changes they said they'd do never happened. It progressively got worse. Be prepared to change plans at the drop of a hat because they didn't post something on Canvas, like the chapters we are supposed to read. They're also disorganized. Many of us felt like we weren't being guided towards success, rather failure, to increase their NCLEX pass ratings. You can't argue wrong test questions by using the book as a reference, even though we learn from there. The tests rarely contained what the teachers said would be on there. They'd tell you to focus on certain subjects, but only have 1-2 questions on it. Certain teachers also say they will not ""spoon feed you"", which includes no guidance or help. Doing this will be a struggle, & I would suggest saving your money."
Freshman,1,"Horrible, half the teachers are no help and they need to WORK on there financial aid office I go in to get help I’m literally crying in the chair they won’t help me and the lady is on the phone talking about the weekend she’s about to have. This school did nothing but bring me down. I moved two hours away they wouldn’t do anything to help me I had to drive two hours away to school everyday they told me if I unenrolled I failed so I will never be going back again."
Freshman,1,The online was pretty good I liked being at home than at that stupid campus. The online helps you more than the teachers
Graduate Student,1,Lake Sumter teachers and administrators are terrible. They don’t listen to the students. A lot of the nursing instructors have no clue what they are teaching and will literally say that.  I would never recommend this college to anyone.
College Sophomore,1,"I only took one class, however it was a remedial math course. This course made no sense, whatsoever! Instead of having a teacher instruct, we had to learn everything online! Our teacher and her TA were only there to proctor our tests, we only received instruction if we asked a question about a problem. I had to get a tutor because the program was not geared to my learning style, it made everything harder."
College Sophomore,1,no help and only minorities receive assistance
College Sophomore,1,no student interaction other than in class
College Freshman,1,I am paying out of state tuition for community college which is around 400 a credit hour. This is very expensive and I have lived in the state for a year. I still do not qualify for in state.
College Senior,1,"I am a Nursing major, so it is VERY competitive and hard to get everything done that I need to. "
College Senior,1,"I am not aware of any post-grad services. This is something that should definitely be offered, especially the way the economy is now! "
College Senior,1,"My husband and I both work. We also have no current dependents, so we do not qualify for federal aid. We have struggled to put me through school and it has been a great financial strain to us. I wish there was a different way for aid to be awarded. "
College Junior,1,"I am a returning college student, during the application process I was not informed I was ineligible for aid due to my number of credit hours.  I was not informed of this until a month into classes."
College Senior,1,"I believe that the financial aid at Lake Sumter Community College leaves a lot to be desired. They are not always helpful and they suspend financial aid without giving you any idea. The appeal process is very frustrating, especially when you are a nursing student and your mind is on passing very challenging exams."
College Sophomore,1,I feel like I shouldnt be judged on how much money my parents make a year because they are not helping me pay for school but since i am under 24 my parents financial situation is taken into consideration and i am denied financial aid even though i really need it to attend school at all.
College Junior,1,Faculty do not go out of their way to help students.  Anything involving the administrative staff is a headache.
College Senior,1,"Financial Aid here is slow and painful, and did I mention slow? I was fortunate enough to have been able to wait for financial aid my first couple semesters but when I did have to use it, it was a nightmare. They require you to bring in printed copies of things they already have electronically. I know of plenty of schools that you don't even need to show up for financial aid to be approved. This school in way behind in that aspect."
College Student,1,"Tornados and Hurricanes – The weather can be awful and you can't even see to drive, yet class is still held and you recieve a bad letter grade for that day for not showing up to class still"
College Sophomore,1,"Too Much Income-But No Money for College – My family classifies as making ""too much money"" to qualify me for any financial aid. However, my family has bills to pay, cars to put gas in, food to buy, and just a life to live therefore we don't have all the money that they think we are supposed to have based off our income. I feel that most schools look at that income and say that the student doesn't qualify for a need based scholarship. That is very untrue. Take me for example, I really need the money because I am personally paying for my school, but because my parents make ""too much"" I am held accountable; even though they are not paying for my education. How is this fair? At my school, they do not have enough scholarships and no matter how many I fill out, I never get anything. I honestly believe it's because of my parent's income."
College Junior,1,"Sometimes Impossible to Register – The hours for courses are flexible. The main problem is that they have very minimal class size, and take on more students than their class sizes can handle. If you do not register for your classes within the first 2 days that they are available, you will not get the classes you want and sometimes need. Also, if you need to speak with an advisor to find out what classes you may need, then forget it. The classes will be gone before you get to speak to anyone. The walk-in wait to see an advisor for anything is 3+ hours, and appointments fill up for at least 2 weeks after registration begins."

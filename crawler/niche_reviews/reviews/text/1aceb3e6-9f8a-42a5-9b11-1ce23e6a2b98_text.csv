Junior,5,"I only took a few online classes, but the professors made sure that the information was learned. They provided one on one help, practice work, and study material to ensure that the students understood the material."
Freshman,5,"I'm currently  a freshman at Stillman College. So far everything is going great. I enjoy my all professors, they are very attentive and informative. The atmosphere is amazing, everyone is very nice. I feel the school would be a lot better with the football program, but that's just my opinion. I would recommend Stillman College to anyone who is looking for a smaller college to go to, but also get good Education"
Senior,5,I love everything about Stillman its a small school but its very very mighty when it comes to making things happen for the students and the community

But after visiting the campus and meeting a majority of the staff and walking the campus, I can tell you that everyone there is super friendly, helpful, and the campus is very very nice. The classes that I was registered for appear that they will be challenging, they have an off campus apartment that is super cool that I will be staying in, the baseball coach is awesome as I will be playing baseball for them as well. So far everything about Stillman makes me happy that I chose to go there."
Junior,5,"Stillman College Is Like A Very Big Family, I Love Everyone I Interact With On A Daily. Most Of The Time Students Spend Most Of Their Time Outside Socializing And I Like That Because I Am A People Person And Everyone Has The Same Mind Set I Have. I Absolutely Love Stillman College I Wouldn’t Pick Any Other College At all Because Stillman Welcomed Me With Open Arms And I’m Pretty Sure Others Can Say The Same Also. I Am Going To Be Forever Grateful About The Opportunity Stillman College Gave Me.

Stillman Has A A lot Of Wonderful People Inside It’s Gates And Someday Somebody Like Me Will Feel The Same Way."
Sophomore,5,"Stillman College is a great HBCU. They welcome you with kindness and bring you in as family.

The only thing that I would like to change is our buildings, we just need to upgrade them a little."
Alum,5,All of the people here are so friendly. The facilities are so clean and kept up. They don't have a wide variety of sports.
Alum,5,"Stillman College is a small school, but that's a great thing though. The classroom sizes are small enough to where each teacher will get to know you individually. The school had recent cuts to certain programs at the school due to budget cuts. Honestly, it's really not a bad school and I enjoyed my four years at Stillman and I would not change anything about it."
College Sophomore,5,"The athletics at Stillman is the best in the country of every school spirit, team performance, fan support and athletic facilities."
College Freshman,5,The football team at stillman as an individual are unique but they don't show it on the field as much as I would like them to. The football team is actually cut for next semester I think they need another chance. The basketball teams are like the biggest deal out of all sports and it also hold a lot of respect.
College Freshman,5,"My school life at Stillman college is the best ! They understanding and they want their students to succeed but I have to get a lot of scholarships for the remaining semester.

What would I like to see change I actually don’t see any change the school is very good ."
Junior,4,"Over the past 2 years at Stillman, I have grown to love the college even more. I first visited Stillman while I was a senior in high school and they welcomed me with open arms. I love how the faculty, staff, and students treat each other like family. I also love that the school is so small that it allows the students to be treated as a priority instead of a minority. Over the years, more activities, organizations, scholarships, and programs have been added to the school and I enjoy it. I believe that more programs should be added for each department so everyone could get more hands on training before graduating Stillman."
Sophomore,4,"Stillman is a big family, really. Coming from a PWI, it is so different, more involving, more culture, more of a family. The ONLY con about Stillman (which is with most HBCU’s) is it is extremely unorganized."

Stillman is right down the street from the University of Alabama."

Alum,4,I just loved that HBCU feel and the people are once in a lifetime folks. The only thing i see that should change the cost its way too expensive.
Niche User,4,Enjoyed the experience more the older I became. Close to home with huge  atmosphere as well as welcoming campus tours and experiences.
Junior,4,It's a great school environment where you can learn hands on without crowded classes. Great athletics programs. Only thing is the school going through a transition with getting funds and back organized.

College Sophomore,4,Stillman college care about you and your future of becoming what you want.

College Senior,4,"Campus police patrol the campus regularly, so it's pretty safe. And also, the campus is fenced in, so non-students rarely get in unless they are let in."
College Senior,4,Everyone likes to go to the football and girls/boys basketball games.  Our baseball and softball teams are really good also.  They always win at state championships.  Our tennis team is also really good.
College Senior,4,It is not hard getting into the major programs on campus.  You just have to make sure you complete the general education courses.  I can speak on behalf of the English department.  The professors are extremely helpful and make sure English majors are taking the classes they really need in order to graduate.  I am currently on track for graduation.
College Junior,4,"As far as I have noticed, this campus is very open and accepting to all races and sexual preferences."

College Junior,4,Stillman College is a great school with alot of potential.Alot of things the administration decides on as far as the students go aren't accurate but they always have our best interest at heart. Stillman is a great place to learn and grown. The school has its pros and it has its cons but I've had more good days than bad days.

College Sophomore,4,"Parking is good... Its a must you have a car, the permit isnt much, tickets and fines arent given until you park without a decal and parking spaces are great."

Niche User,2,"everything here is just unorganized. I got a schedule it didn't have any of the classes I signed up for. On top of that when I got here as a FRESHMAN on move in day the water wasn't working and our dorms weren’t prepared for us to move in. So, we lived in a hotel for the night. The whole campus and our dormitories need to be renovated.  All in all I feel for the price we are paying to attend this private institution is not being put to use once so ever. The only thing keeping this school together is the student body and our spirit."
Sophomore,2,If your looking for a small college with great classes and teachers that will help you fully with the education you are seeking Stillman College is for you.
College Sophomore,2,"Well, they always get confused about the money issues that i have."

College Freshman,1,They don't give you a lot of money.
College Sophomore,1,There aren't any campus transportation because everything is in walking distance.
College Sophomore,1,"The manual has a couple rules that seem to take away from your college experience.

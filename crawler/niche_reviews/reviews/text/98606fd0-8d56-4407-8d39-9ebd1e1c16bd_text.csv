Junior,5,this is my first year attending Mississippi State University but so far I truly am pleased with everything
Senior,5,"I received a well rounded education from MSU.  I found the curriculum rigorous but not overwhelming.  My professors were very helpful. I had a great experience.  I am currently enrolled at MSU to continue my education, and I am still enjoying it.  The only thing that I would like to see changed is the online classroom platform.  The one that they are currently using is not terrible, but it is a little unorganized and not the easiest to navigate.  But overall, great school."
Freshman,5,Mississippi state university is a wonderful school. You can get around campus easily and the teachers are very nice and informative. The tuition price is reasonable and everyone is friendly!
Freshman,5,The online learning experience is very easy and fun to do. The learning experience is just as great as in person face to face classes.
Senior,5,The school is very fun and vibrant as well as stern on their academics. This school makes sure that the students who attend that they are very concerned about academic success and have plenty of resources to help students achieve it.
Sophomore,5,"When the COVID-19 crisis began and we had to switch to online classes, it was unexpected but we all adapted. The teachers answered emails addressing concerns and regularly updated us."
Sophomore,5,I am a sophomore and majoring in Mechanical Engineering. Classes at State are rigorous but fair. Tutors are available in every subject and some dorms even have tutors. I live in Ruby and the room is very nice and worth the investment. The campus is absolutely beautiful and easily navigable. My roommate and I did not previously know each other but we became close friends after living together for almost a year! Mississippi State is a great place to begin a career. I have an RA position and State guides students in the process of getting co-opt and internships.
Freshman,5,"Everyone there who either goes there for school or works there, they are so helpful and very nice to help you with anything you need help with as a new student there."
Junior,5,"I have taken a couple online classes. They’re very easy to me. The only trouble I had with them was remembering my deadlines. However, all the resources for the online courses are an easy find. The instructors are also understanding and will help you if you have an issues."
Junior,5,"Mississippi State is a very friendly campus. Yes, it’s huge! However, there are a ton of people around that will help guide you where you need to be whether it’s to the cafeteria, your class, or even your dorm room.

The community and atmosphere has a home-town feel to it, and the people here are very welcoming and friendly. This university has excellent programs of study for varieties of interests. This university is also well-known for its veterinary school, engineering school, architecture school, and business school. There are plenty of food and dining options on and off campus that are wonderful."

Graduate Student,5,I LOVE this school! I received my B. S. in Biological Sciences here and am almost done with my M. S. in Health Promotion. I have made some lifelong friends here and have been prepared to begin medical school in a few months. I will definitely be back as a proud Alum!
Freshman,5,"With everything that is going on in the world today, from COVID-19 to racial inequality and fighting the broken system, MSU has taken steps to provide their students what the want. In the midst of a pandemic, MS State has been very helpful with keeping all us healthy and safe. And in terms of fighting for BLM movements and social justice, our leaders have gone to the government with efforts to change the state flag of Mississippi, spread awareness of systematic racism and how to fight it, as well as encourage using our first amendment and the right to peaceful protest. I am thankful for the steps State has taken during these times of unrest and change. Go dawgs and Hail State!"
Junior,5,"My experience with Mississippi State University online classes is great. The professors are available when you need them. They offer tutoring and advise help from other students. Its easier to have a schedule to complete online work. Also, the success tips they offer are very helpful."
Junior,5,My experience with Mississippi State University is overwhelming. This institution offers some of the best learning programs.
Niche User,5,"I loved almost everything about MSU. The campus was beautiful, all my professors were helpful and nice, and there was always something to do."
Niche User,5,I took several online classes and found them to be easy. There are a lot of options for online classes and the portal that MSU uses makes the class work easy to manage.
Freshman,5,Professors didn't really giv eonline work it was more of you come to class and take notes on whatever he writes on the board. It was a good way of remembering what you right because you would have to see it so much and you won't be able to go home and get any help because it'll have been so unique how they have the questions that no one has ever seen that before.
Freshman,5,"At State i like the environmet, it's always fun and never a dull moment and i get to meet a lot of new people. The dream school is MSU and the way that they bring us together in some aspects are great and very fun."
Freshman,5,"I have not attended online classes, because the fall semester has not begun. Everyone I have spoken with through email has been quick to reply and very helpful."

Sophomore,5,I love the campus. The faculty and staff are very nice and passionate about their work and their students!
Sophomore,5,"Mississippi State makes you feel like you are at home. The campus is gorgeous and easy to maneuver. The newer living halls are amazing, but the older ones like Sessums needs to be leveled and rebuilt."
Sophomore,5,I finished my spring semester online and Mississippi State made the transition extremely smooth. The professors and administrators were so understanding and willing to change up schedules and syllabi to assist students in the best way possible. Mississippi State was also extremely helpful with making sure students had the proper equipment to start online classes. They were willing to give out laptops to students who needed them and adjust meal plans and callus living to those who had to stay on campus during the quarantine.
Sophomore,5,Mississippi State University is an amazing University. It has such a natural family environment and I couldn’t have created a better atmosphere myself if I tried.

Alum,5,"Mississippi State has a major sense of family! With every ring of a cowbell or chime of the Chapel of Memories, Mississippi State rang true to providing students with the best quality education as well as endless opportunities to get involved. Mississippi State and the city of Starkville has left a major impact on my life and I am eternally grateful."
Sophomore,5,"Mississippi State University is my home. From the second I stepped foot on campus for my tour, I knew that I wanted to go to college there. Everyone I encounter and interact with is kind and treat you as if you were part of their family.  The teachers let it be known that they're there for you and the food is on another level. I love running  track for my school because we compete with one another and bring the best out of each other. The atmosphere at sporting events is second to none and you'll always have somebody to call your friend."
Freshman,5,"Everyone at MSU is so nice and helpful. Most of the professors want you to succeed and will do anything to help you as long as you help yourself. They have many things around campus that will help with your classes and offer tutors off campus and supplemental instruction classes. Although, its not just a pass the classes in your sleep school, I absolutely love it and would 100% recommend for anyone to attend. They have all types of food options and housing available on campus and everything that is needed off of campus can be accessed by the free buses that run around campus and everything is close and convenient."
Alum,5,I loved my experience at Mississippi State University. That is why I am going back again for a degree in elementary education.
Sophomore,5,"What I love about Mississippi State University is how nice the students are and the campus is beautiful. The professors (most of them) are willing to help and always are welcome to their office hours. What I would like to see change is their science department. Our Chemistry department isn't that great because the professors are so old and don't really know what they're talking about, so I want to see better teaching and curriculum for that. Also the parking situation. There are barely any spots open for student parking and in turn students get ticketed constantly."
Sophomore,5,"I attended Mississippi State University after I graduated high school. I wish my high school better prepared me for college, or that I attended a community college instead. I wasn't prepared for the change so I bombed my classes and eventually returned home. I am in a much better state now and so ready to be a bulldog again!"
Niche User,5,The tour was lovely and everyone was very respectful and helpful. I was also able to see everything that I asked for as well as cool place in the library that's great for studying.
Niche User,5,I love everything about MSU for the students to the facuility. The town around the university is so welcoming. the university its self wants what is best for the students. They offer so many opperitunies for the students to make sure they fit in some where.
Sophomore,5,"The student body at Mississippi State is terrific. Everyone is super friendly at State, students, professors, and staff alike. I would not trade my experiences at State for any other. I am also very impressed with all the academics here. The math and engineering departments are fantastic and teachers are always available outside of class to help you understand their material. Truly great experience."
Sophomore,5,"Starting at Mississippi State University as a transfer student was the best decision I could have ever made. I just have not made friends over here, but I have met people that are just like family.  The environment on the campus is just like home. My mentor emails me every week, to keep me posted on plenty of activities on campus. Not only does she keep me updated with the activities on campus, but she also has concerns about my education. My mentor really expresses how much it is to have and education. The most important thing about the campus is to get involved.  Being involved in plenty of activities and volunteering will bring out the true you."
Junior,5,I absolutely love being a MSU Bulldog! My experience here has matured me in the best way. It was prepared me for my future and given me opportunities to further my career.
Freshman,5,"Mississippi State is a wonderful school and has so much to offer. I love the campus, and the people make it feel like home."
Freshman,5,Environment and teachers are the best! I can't think of anything I would change except winning a few more football games.
Freshman,5,"The experience I had at State is one to remember. I finally got to feel like an adult, and make my own decisions every single day I woke up. Mississippi State University is an excellent college, the teachers there really know how to teach and make sure you get all the information you need to pass their classes. Also, Mississippi State's environment is tremendous. The environment is friendly and full of great, positive vibes."
Junior,5,This school is excellent! I transferred from another major state pubic university and this school is a significant upgrade. I've never had the support I've been getting from my professors and the willingness of administrative staff to go out of their way to help you. I've even had the chancellor personally respond to emails sent requesting information! (And this is NOT a small school!) Amazing!
Alum,5,The atmosphere is great and you will feel like family while there. Professors and students alike are more than cooperative and friendly.
Niche User,5,"I absolutely love the fact that the staff and students always want to ensure you feel comfortable in the environment. I also love that the campus is not only beautiful, but the buildings are in perfect proximity to one another."
Junior,5,"Mississippi State University is a great school to attend.  The teachers and staff always seem willing to help if you ever need anything.  I love the fact they use Canvas.  Everything within my courses has an obvious purpose, and I feel like I am learning a lot as I continue my education through their courses."
Niche User,5,"My experience at Mississippi State University has been completely amazing! I have been visiting campus since I was young, because both of my parents are Alum. They always tell me about how much they loved going to school there, so I have included it in my college search. When I went on my first official visit, I fell in love. I knew that Mississippi State is where I wanted to attend college. It had such a 'homey' feel to it, I could picture myself living there. All of the staff and students there were so welcoming and kind. The campus was ABSOLUTELY beautiful! I am so excited to attend MSU!"
Freshman,5,"Mississippi State has become my home away from home very quickly. I am from Las Vegas and I was scared about the transition since I was going from a big city to a small town quite quick. I was happy to learn that people from the south are very friendly and open to friendships! The staff here are super helpful and always willing to help. Before I came here, I called and asked questions and I was greeted with a great attitude and happiness that they could help. The professors here are extremely great at what they do and are clear on their office hours and what it takes to succeed in their classes. The campus is beautiful and the best part for me is that there are cats here and there but the vet program takes care of all of them. It helps me because I left my kitten at home to come here. Mississippi State is a great school to transition to from highschool."
Sophomore,5,What I like most about MSU is the large campus atmosphere in a small town setting.  It reminds me of my hometown in TN. I also like that I have lots of friends from TN that attend.  The only thing I ‘d like to see change is to do away with the out-of-state tuition fee and make it a base rate across the board.
Niche User,5,"While I was a senior in high school, I had the pleasure to visit the campus of Mississippi State University. MSU was not my first choice of school, but once I stepped foot on the campus I fell in love. The students and staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The dorms were spacious and clean. The union was also spacious and clean and filled with many great food options and also a salon which was very convenient!  The campus itself was groomed very nicely and well kept. My overall experience was more than great and I didn't see any changes that needed to be made at that current time. I encourage all to check it out."
Niche User,5,"The campus is beautiful and my admissions counselor has been very helpful. I love the academic programs and multiple clubs that they offer at State. There is no better college town than Starkville, there is something to do for everyone. If you are wanting to go to school for engineering or business then State is a school to consider!"
Niche User,5,"My brother has gone to Mississippi State for four years.  I have been to the area, campus, and everything else.  Starkville  knows how to throw down.  The foods pretty sweet too and the Cotton District is where it is at."
Junior,5,Mississippi State University is a great institute for all. It offers a welcoming atmosphere as well as a place for education and fun. A day at Mississippi State can feel like a second home to all.
Niche User,5,I loved the whole experience ! I am looking forward to getting the foundations of my career as a Mississippi State Bulldog.
Graduate Student,5,"MSU is a fantastic campus to grow as a person and a student. The faculty may not always be the kindest, specifically teaching faculty, but the staff are some of the greatest people I have ever met. The professional staff who work with student organizations, campus activities, etc. are exceedingly helpful and interested in the positive growth of every student they meet. There's an abundance of resources available to all students and there are plenty of opportunities to get connected and be involved on campus."
Sophomore,5,I love Mississippi State University! I transferred here sophmore year. It has a great community and great professors.
Niche User,5,When you enter Mississippi State from whatever direction you are met with an outstanding amount of pride for a school. There is nothing better than game days when you hear the hundreds of thousands of cowbells ringing all around you and the roar of the crowd when players go sailing across the goal line. You instantly feel apart of the community and can't wait till it's your turn to be given a cowbell.
Niche User,5,"Overall Mississippi State is one of my favorite schools. The atmosphere is amazing, and when I visited the classrooms the professors make everyone feel involved. At Mississippi state the campus is amazing it's like your home away from home."

Senior,4,I took classes online due to COVID-19 and I would say that the transition from face to face classes online was smooth and the instructors accommodated the needs of the students.

Freshman,4,It is a very good school with a good engineering program that has helped me learn a lot about my future career. The environment is welcoming as well.
Junior,4,"We don't have anywhere to study, do homework, or do projects. The teachers are very good though, so it makes up for it slightly."
Junior,4,"They did the best that they could during corona virus. I feel that if I had different instructors, my education would have suffered. However, they care a lot about our education, so they put in a lot of effort to make up for not being in person for class."
Sophomore,4,My professors here at MSU all made my online learning experience very good and easy for me to learn the information I needed to learn in my classes.
Sophomore,4,Classes are average college classes. Class size is typical college class. All in all great. Even though you are in a class of 300 the professors are accessible and willing to help you understand the topic. Chemistry is the only area so far that they need to really work on.
Sophomore,4,"Mississippi State has a very family feeling relationship because everybody is so nice and welcoming. The football games are a great experience and everybody who is a bulldog is proud of our athletes. However, Mississippi State does not do a good job with parking. Parking is one of the biggest problems because they will sell more parking passes than what they have available."
Freshman,4,It is a beautiful campus and the teachers/staff really do care about the students. The teachers are great as well. They have plenty of programs for every student. They also help students get any kind of experience they need for their resume and future job.
Junior,4,"I am a transfer entering Mississippi State University. I plan on majoring in Public Relations upon entering, hoping to gain an internship. Mississippi State University is known for matching their students with an excellent job after graduating. The student to staff ratio is average depending on the major. The university offers exceptional opportunities for numerous majors."
Alum,4,"Overall, I  had a great time at Mississippi State University. As a mechanical engineering student, I felt that the program itself is continuously improving and the facilities, especially the labs, are top-notch. The career center is helpful, and the career fair is huge! There are multiple organizations to get involved in on campus. As for the town itself, it is a bit on the small side, but there are still many places to eat and have fun."
Sophomore,4,"Beautiful campus, Academics are alright, everyone is very nice for the most part. I'd recommend coming here if you an engineering major or want to be a farmer."
Junior,4,"Mississippi State is a great place to go to school, but some programs are definitely better than others. The Engineering school is very good. The campus and city of Starkville are great and most of the teachers and staff at school are helpful."
Freshman,4,they are very professional handle their business would love to go my freshman year 2020 new year !!!
Sophomore,4,I am a current student here at Mississippi State University. The atmosphere on campus is super accepting and comfortable. My teachers have all been very welcoming and enthusiastic about the subjects.
Niche User,4,I love this school especially because of its location. I love their tradition and I enjoy being a part of the bulldog family. The serene environment in starkville is quite safe and I am glad that it is away from the hustle and bustle of major cities. The bulldogs family try their best to be inclusive and b welcoming to international students and make them feel at home. I never regret being a bulldog.
Sophomore,4,"It has a very welcoming atmosphere. Professors are normally nice and willing to work with you. It's easy to make friends as long as you're willing to put yourself out there. There's plenty happening on campus  whether there are sports events or not. I love it, best decision I ever made."
Freshman,4,"Mississippi State University has a wonderful campus filled with a diverse group of students all engaged in their majors. At MSU there are a number of clubs and activities you can participate in as a student, anywhere from a fencing club to a club focused around the cultures of other countries. As a student, you also get free access to the Sanderson, which is a superb place to go to if you want to engage in exercise, sports, or dance.

The professors are focused on their jobs and seek the best for their students, often going out of their way to make sure students are succeeding in class. They set aside various office hours for students to make-up exams, or come to them with their questions for upcoming tests.

All in all, it is a wonderful place with beautiful scenery and beautiful people."
Freshman,4,A great school if you like diversity and a big class size. Great diversity of organizations and good scenery to look at. The diversity in sports makes it easy to find a sport that you will be intrested in watching. And have plenty of majors to choose from if you decide to change your major.
Junior,4,"The athletics are good. The academics are good. Also, they are always renovating their facilities. But it could use more parking spaces for commuters."
Sophomore,4,"My first year was great and I hope my second year is even better. I still have to figure out some things about campus, academics, and local area."
Junior,4,"Being a student at Mississippi State has been a great adventure! I am an out-of-state student and traveling far from home can have its rough moments; however, Mississippi State was quick to make me feel at home and a part of a group! I was quickly involved in sports and different organizations that helped me meet some of my best friends today. Mississippi State has taught me the importance of going to class, using resources around me, and trying my hardest in any situation. One thing that I would change at Mississippi State University is the attitude of certain majors. Often times, certain majors get praised for being a higher raised income in the future; whereas, in lower income majors, they are often mocked and looked down on and not taken care of through the students and the building."
Freshman,4,"Mississippi State has very nice people ! They greet people in such a nice way! Out of all the colleges I wanted to attend MSU has always been the first on my list ! I love how they interact with people and always involved in something good ! They have good sports, professors and most of all just so friendly ! Something I would like to change about state would be the way they set up rooming ! It takes them to long to place someone and also you find out stuff at the last minute."
Senior,4,I transfer to Mississippi State when I was a junior from community college. Everyone at MSU was quite welcoming and helpful in every step of the transfer process. So glad I chose to further my education at such a wonderful state university.
Alum,4,great school environment that sets you up for success. would recommend to any one looking for a laid back atmosphere and campus.
Junior,4,"Mississippi State is an experience like no other, there is a lot of school pride and so much to be involved in. It is the place where I have found many lifelong friends and have grown greatly as an individual. If I could make a suggestion for the school, I would just suggest having more scholarship opportunities for transfer students."
Freshman,4,"I am so excited to be attending Mississippi State in the fall.  My visits there so far have been fantastic, everyone is so nice and helpful.  I cannot wait to become a bulldog!"
Niche User,4,I recently visited the campus to see a friend. The campus is always clean. Students walk with pride to and from their destinations. This school has such a great atmosphere.
Senior,4,Mississippi State's Chemical Engineering Program has great teachers who can provide insight into the industry.
Senior,4,"My experience at Mississippi State University has been wonderful. The people are friendly and helpful. The teachers are easy to like and understand. The work is hard, but with the numerous study programs they have on campus; you are sure to succeed."
Sophomore,4,"Professors and department employees really care about you and the education is excellent, but the university is an institution and it doesn't care so long as they get paid. Don't expect to be coddled or supported if you're struggling, you have to reach out for your own help."
Junior,4,Mississippi State University is a very great school! There's a lot of diversity throughout campus. There are hundreds of organizations to be apart of.  There are many activities and events hosted by organizations to attend if there is nothing on your schedule! I love my school!
Freshman,4,My experience so far at Mississippi State Unviersity has been fantastic. I have made many friends and have been taught different cultures through them.
Freshman,4,I haven't went yet but it seems like it will be a good college to go to. There basketball team seems amazing and the academics look like they are to a T.
Freshman,4,"Mississippi State is mostly affordable, and you meet great people! I love how the school and staff really cares about each student and they offer so much help in any way you could think of. I did not want to go at first because I live in the city it is located, but now I see it as my home away from home and I am glad I chose to be a Bulldog!"
Niche User,4,I like the fact that Mississippi State University has a big campus. A big campus means more organizations to get involved in and more potential friendships. The school also has many choices of curriculum so that students can take part in whatever they choose to study. Mississippi State provides students with a strong education in any field that is offered.
Junior,4,"I like that most people are always helpful, but I do feel like most of campus just runs together, and there is no distinguishable areas."
Freshman,4,I love the environment!! Everybody is nice and tries to help if you ask. I love the new construction dorms they are nicely built but the traditional need a little help in the updating department. They are kind of subpar in the looks department but the cleaning women are the best people I have ever met!
Freshman,4,"I have not been able to experience the college as much yet. From what has been going on, it seems like it will be great. There is so much you can do on the campus. I think I will like it here."
Junior,4,"Beautiful campus, tons of things to do, lots of majors available, free busses...just started but love it so far!"
Niche User,4,Great school. Great campus. Second generation has now graduated from this school and I'm thinking about enrolling for the second time.
Junior,4,I have grown up around Mississippi State University most of my life. The school is constantly improving itself and its students for the new issues facing our world today. Go anywhere around the globe and I guarantee you will find a MSU alum or someone associated with the school in some way. We know how to make our mark on the world. Hail State and Praise the Bulldawgs!
Sophomore,4,I love Mississippi State! The academics are wonderful and the professors are really there to help you learn.
Sophomore,4,"I loved how everyone there is so friendly. Some of the professors are also friendly and interested in helping you when you ask, and they suggest resources. I love the Writing Center and all the different places you could get help from tutors. I would like the Union or the cafeterias to stay open at least one more hour than the usual."
Alum,4,I enjoyed attending MSU. The people who live there are so nice and down to earth. The teachers were great and very engaging. The only down fall is there are no big companies in the area to partner with for business studies.
Freshman,4,"When I was first accepted into the Architecture program at MSU I was ecstatic. Architecture and Interior Design have been my dream since before I can remember. I immediately set up a campus tour, set my orientation date, grabbed my family and off we went. I was so excited about the landscape of MSU, the beautiful quant city of Starkville, and the amazing opportunities that were coming my way with the School of Architecture. Having the opportunity to complete classes in one of the oldest buildings on campus (that use to be a barn) was something that definitely caught my attention. Finally the chance that the school gives us as Architecture students to travel the United States and the rest of the world, while also studying what we truly love is amazing. We are given the chance to take field trips to other cities, states, and countries to get a diverse look at the array of architecture that has made our world what it is today."
Junior,4,"Mississippi state has been a great school to transfer from high school to college. The Class room sizes aren’t too big and overwhelming. Professors are very good and helpful when you need help with anything from not understanding something in class, to stuff outside of the classroom. I transferred to Mississippi State my sophomore, my advisor helped me a great deal on the transition to state, With getting signed up for the classes and getting in involved.  Have many different groups on campus you can get in involved with on campus. Professors have helped with finding job opportunities for jobs after college."
Freshman,4,"I liked the housing and dorms living on campus. Food from the cafeteria and around town was average. Athletics is a big part of this campus, football games are the best time of the year! Always check the reviews of professors and courses before taking classes. Campus life is good, southern people are nice and diversity is a strong quality among the community. Many clubs and organizations to be apart of. Employment is quite easy to find among the university and surrounding companies. Good college overall, good small town."
Senior,4,"I love the atmosphere at Mississippi State. The staff and faculty are wonderful, the classes are great. If I could change anything I would change the way parking decals are handled, and parking in general."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at Mississippi State, and I have had a great first year! The academics here at MSU are very good. Occasionally, there are professors that have less of an initiative and work ethic, but overall, the professors are also very good. MSU is very diverse and very close-knit. The dining halls are fairly good most of the time. The campus is laid out very well and is easy to navigate. If you are into athletics, MSU seems to be on the rise and have great game atmospheres with most every sport here. I have never worried about my safety on this campus whereas violence on campus has not really been present. The dorms are fairly nice and are also a great way to meet new people. All in all, this is a very good university!"
Senior,4,"Mississippi State is like family. There are many opportunities for students to met other students and grow academically. Teachers offer assistance where needed and places around campus and there to offer support as well. If your looking for that break, MS State also offers a variety of outings and opportunities to meet other students. Very parent friendly as well and offers the best for parents and students alike"
Alum,2,"With the exception of maybe 50% of the engineering, physics, and chemistry courses, the education you’ll receive here is ridiculously subpar.
One of my majors was in the college of business, and you could literally teach yourself everything you’d learn in a given class with only the textbook and one week to read.
Unless you go far above and beyond what is required to make an A in the college of business, you will be extremely underprepared for any job that requires some level of financial sophistication. 
For most people that take classes in the math department it’s even worse than the COB. The lower level math courses (Calculus, Linear Algebra, DE) are not only undertaught, but the professors are notoriously bad as well. The upper level math classes (Numerical Analysis, Advanced Cal, Math Stats) are taught at a more appropriate level with typically better professors, but occasionally there is an awful one (looking at you Xu Zhang).
Heard similar at Ole Miss but more fun"
Freshman,2,"The campus is very big and gives opportunities for students to explore and do things that they are interested in. The professors hold students to a high standard and they abide by the school's policies. There seems to be a diverse enough atmosphere, there are people from all different sorts of backgrounds. The food is the worst thing about the campus, it is just overpriced and not tasty in general."
Junior,2,"Money hungry, a lot of foreign teachers. While this in itself is not a problem at all, the language barrier was so great sometimes, that I had to go back and reteach myself most of the material. Parking on campus is terrible on game days, even after spending $400+ on a parking decal that is a 10 minute walk from classes.  Library is great though, as well as the dining options. The city of Starkville is not that large, and besides restaurants, bars, and a movie theater, there is not much to do."
College Freshman,2,Most places on campus are terrible to live at.
College Freshman,2,Doesnt really matter to me.
College Junior,2,You have to be completely drunk to have a good time.
College Freshman,2,"I love Mississippi State. Unfortunately, the party scene is not the best. Most weekends if there is not a football game or something else of significance the student population goes home. This leaves very few people to live it up in Starkville. However, like any college town, you can normally find a party if you seek it out. There are a lot of apartment parties as well. If you are wanting a hardcore party school in Mississippi, you should probably go to Ole Miss."
College Sophomore,2,Financial aid applications are a pain and the people that have to be dealt with at the admissions office are not very helpful
College Freshman,2,"The Greek life is a huge part of the University but it is not a good situation. Many, not all but many, are snobby, cliquey, and flat out mean to people in and out of greek life. Greek life isn't very forgiving."
College Freshman,2,"Rather expensive, and more strict rule based than on campus housing. The freedom is nice but it varies GREATLY from location to location in every aspect."
College Freshman,2,Some Greeks don't have houses
College Senior,2,I have found it very difficult to find the scholarships that I need to supply the funds to fully cover college expenses.
College Junior,2,"There isn't much to do, but the people are nice."
College Freshman,2,"Chapters get kicked off campus every couple of years... always some kind of trouble, bad attitudes, and snobby types."
College Freshman,2,Not enough spaces for the amount of students on the campus
College Freshman,2,My dorm was old and the custodians on my hall floor never really cleaned the restroom and they never ever cleaned the showers. The girls left hair in the showers everywhere and left use feminine products everywhere.
College Freshman,2,I do not really know of any
College Freshman,2,"Please don't get a dorm unless you have no other options. It's a huge waste of money for such small living areas, you have to pay a lot to do laundry, you don't have access to sufficient kitchen supplies to cook for yourself so you are forced to eat bad campus food, parking is horrible, and the roommate selection process has left me with horrible roommates that have been bad for my mental and physical health twice."
College Freshman,2,"Most greeks don't do anything for the community. Sure they'll do ""service events"", but they're mostly for PR and don't actually help anyone but themselves. There are a few greek honor societies/fraternities that are good, but the traditional greek houses exclude many potentially great members because they don't fit their pre-conceived notion of what their members should be like. All greeks are very conventionally attractive and most are promiscuous."
College Freshman,2,There is not much to do in the town other than go to the campus or eat. It gets boring most nights
College Freshman,2,I don't think there are very many options and no one off campus gives me student discounts. The food is a decent cost
College Freshman,2,Many people on campus use drugs and alcohol. You could go to any party and get alcohol no matter what your age is. There is only peer pressure at parties.
College Freshman,2,The school does not give much financial aid.  My best tips are take AP classes in high school and do well on your ACT/SAT in order to get any scholarships.
College Freshman,2,"The transportation system at Mississippi State University is not what it needs to be.  The buses are always late, which makes me late to class.  Sometimes the buses even skip stops because they are running so behind or they just do not care that people are waiting at that stop to get to class.  When the buses work right, they are very convenient and they are free so it's a win-win situation, but most of the time, they are not working on the right schedule."
College Student,2,It has never been this cold since I've lived here.
College Sophomore,2,"I barely receive any aid.. I still have to pay about $3,000 out of pocket"
College Freshman,2,I live in a dorm with community bathrooms and it's pretty disgusting. The bathrooms are always messy and the showers are always gross.
College Junior,2,Super strict if you live in dorms but also depends on your RA
College Junior,2,It could be more diverse. pretty typical southern SEC school
College Junior,2,"I live in Virginia, taking classes from Mississippi State University. Therefore, it hinders me from receiving state aid. Also, the federal aid I receive isn't enough to compensate for the cost. I am employed at Mcdonald's. I want my education to continue without the burden of loans over my head. "
College Freshman,2,"I don't personally have a car so, I can't really say. Many of my friends find it to be horrible."
College Freshman,2,"I got two scholarships that were worth  about $4, 000 and a loan for $5, 000. In the end due to my parents income,  I had to take out another loan since the school didn't give me or my sister enough scholarship money. I guess you only get money if you are in a sport or something like choir or have a ACT of a 29 or above. I had a 26 and my twin had 27, so...."
College Freshman,2,"Haven't been to any parties,  but honestly,  there really isn't much talk of parties.  Probably earlier on in the year,  but later,  things get pretty quiet. Starkville is a rural city and MSU is a research school not a party school."
College Freshman,2,"Some people don't peer pressure others to do drugs on campus, but some people do. "
College Freshman,2,"I always said to myself that I may need a car on campus, and it seems that my beliefs were correct. Sometimes, I may want to go somewhere by myself and get something to eat off-campus or visit a friend who lives off-campus, or something like that."
College Freshman,2,"They did not give me as much financial aid as they promised me I would receive, and its hard to receive more now"
College Freshman,2,"The on campus dining at MSU is slacking. There are not many healthy options, besides salad. There are virtually no vegetarian/vegan options."
College Sophomore,2,I did not receive a great amount of financial aid. I had a hard time and am still trying to see if and how to attain more scholarship money to help pay for my education.
College Junior,2,"It rains a lot, and it's really humid. The campus is huge so sometimes walking in unpleasant weather makes it more miserable."
College Junior,2,"If you're at a frat party, there's not a big chance you'll get caught drinking underage. The chance is much greater if you're at a house party and y'all are being loud."
College Junior,2,"Parking on campus can be very difficult. I encourage you to arrive promptly to get a good parking spot. If possible, once you get a parking spot, KEEP IT! Avoiding moving your car at all cost!"
College Freshman,2,The campus is an open campus so people can easily come and go.
College Junior,2,"I receive financial aid but the fees are still costly and tuition is still going up. I have to apply for PLUS loans just to pay for all of my school fees, including my housing and try to still manage to have enough to buy books. My mother does not work and it is hard to find a job."
College Junior,2,"Permit cost is 100+ every year, and unless you live on campus its very essential to have one. They do fine, usually about $30-50 dollars for out of zone parking or overtime parking. The parking lots fill up really fast and usually still have to take a shuttle from parking to campus. Make sure to arrive  to campus 30+ minutes prior to class to get parked."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is there for parties and some other events, but it doesn't dominate at MSU. It's not a big deal if you are in a frat or sorority, and it is not a big deal if you never set foot in one. It's nice because you can go to frat parties, which can be fun, but it's not a status thing."
College Freshman,2,A 2.2 is the minimum academic performance you can earn in order to be able to participate in campus organizations. If you earn a 2.2 or lower you are put on academic probation and are allowed the consecutive semester to bring the GPA up to academic policy before university dismissal.
College Junior,2,You definitely want to arrive early to get a good spot. They go pretty quickly. You also don't want to speed or stay in meter parking for too long because campus police give out a lot of tickets.
College Senior,2,Parking lots need to expand. Also students who park in the certain parking lot that do not belong there need to have a much heavier fine that those are actually supposed to be there.
College Freshman,2,"Sometimes it is very difficult to get parking without trying to get a parking ticket. They are very strict on parking, but in order to get a parking spot you have to get there early."
College Sophomore,2,I have to drive down a road with lots of potholes and park in a gravel pit. I also have to walk a good ways. Personally I don't mind walking but I don't like paying for s****y parking that tears my car up.
College Sophomore,2,They need some serious upgrading or fixed so they run faster.
College Junior,2,MSU is a very diverse school. There are people from all different parts of the world that attend this school.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Many students come from different backgrounds in religion and culture. However, the student body and faculty are comprised of mainly white people. The only representation of black people on the campus are a small amount of students and most of the staff (lawn services, parking, cafeteria and union, custodial services).  Also, alot of the minority percentage was made up of atheletes (SEC football, basketball, etc). The representation of other minority groups may be even smaller than the black percentage. There are a good number of openly gay and lesbian students on campus, I don't think there was any pressure for students to hide sexual orientation- which is impressive being that this school is in the south. Politcal beliefs were majority republican."
College Junior,2,"On Campus Shuttles Are Great – There is little public transportation in town, but on campus, there is a large shuttle system that goes from 7:30 AM to around 6 PM. The shuttle is very nice if you live in a sorority or fraternity house, as these locations are slightly isolated.
Some apartment complexes are located within walking/biking distance of campus, and a couple other complexes that are further off campus have shuttles to and from campus, but I am not familiar with those."
College Student,2,"Could Be Worse – Its OK. Its a large campus with looks of cars, as expected, its best to walk. Everything within walking distance anyways."
College Freshman,2,One day it is snowing and the next day you can wear shorts. It is hard to keep up with the weather!
College Freshman,2,Greeks Don't Dominate – Student life at MS State is not completely dominated by Greeks. Anyone can go to a Greek party without being in one.
College Freshman,2,"Have Fun in Many Different Ways – Campus night life is not much except on home games. Greek life dominates oncampus activites. In Starkville there is not much of anything to do if your underage. Basically if your looking for a party town but live on campus, this is not for you"
College Freshman,2,"Okay at Best – No one really pays attention to the Greeks. They're there and they make themselves seen around homecoming and whatnot, but mostly, there's not difference between greeks and non-greeks. There is plenty to do on campus if you're not greek and you don't really miss out on anything. In fact, off-campus parties are usually better than greek parties but it's all about preference. You don't even hear about greek events unless you know someone thats greek. Its exists but its not vibrant and no one feels the need to be greek to fit in and have fun."
College Freshman,2,"Good Food but Terrible Hours – The food at the dinning hall is pretty good. There is a great variety of choices. However, the main dinning hall has very weird hours. They're open all day but if you come between the hours of 2:00 pm and 4:30, there is absolutely no food being served. On the weekends, it closes at 1:30 pm and does not reopen until 5:30 pm. The food is good but because of the weird timing and gap where no food can be found in the dining hall... The meal plan feels like a rip off. Being able to use your block meals at Panda Express, Chick-Fila, Berkley Street, Mississippi Steak, Burger King and other fast food places is great but only after 4 and block meals only cover up to $5.75. It's still a great deal because of flex dollars. Wide variety of places to eat on campus, but the main dining hall's hours and weird no-food gaps make me give campus dining a C, at best."
Freshman,1,I can’t wait to transfer out of this hellhole. Everyone goes home on the weekends. You have to be Greek to be invited anywhere. The people are not friendly at all.
College Sophomore,1,It is terrible. You don't get anything but you still have to fill out the form. waste of time.
College Sophomore,1,"They are the worst about handing out parking tickets, we wouldn't have the problem if there was enough parking!!!!"
College Freshman,1,"The frats think they have the best parties in the world...They don't. The nightlife is best mainly at off campus bars, but if you can't go to them the frats will do but the frats need to step up their game."
College Freshman,1,"On the weekends on during the week, most students are smoking weed every day. Everyone drinks heavily on the weekends"
College Junior,1,The parking on campus has always been a huge problem for me. Not only is it extermely expensive to purchase a decal but the parking services hands out tickets like its no ones business.
College Junior,1,"Parking at MSU is horrible, as a student with a vehicle you have to pay around $150 for a decal if you don't stay on campus and the price is even higher if you live on campus in a dorm. If you commute to campus each day it is very difficult to find a park easily especially after 10am."
College Freshman,1,"The Greek scene at MSU is predominant. I cannot understand how people said it is ""non-existent."" I want to say that the ratio of Greek to non-Greek is 60% to 40%, but I fear that may be an exaggeration, or not. Almost every guy on my floor is in a frat. I give it an F because it's a terrible idea. The greeks care and talk to only themselves. There are black frats and white frats, white and black sororities, there are also people not involved in any. I feel greek life here creates a serious divide amongst students. Each one living in its own little bubble, oblivious of the other people around. And it's growing each day. Sadly, more and more people are going greek helping to create a very fragmented community. I feel the school should get rid of the greek system. In four years, they'll look around, and realize they know no one in the hall."
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is very difficult. There are not enough parking for the dorms which means that you sometimes have to park in a lot a distance from where you are.
College Freshman,1,There are never any parking spaces on the south side of Mississippi State University and four different buildings have to share a parking area.
College Sophomore,1,I did not receive the type of financial aid to fit my financial status and had to rely on my struggling parents to help.
College Senior,1,You cant even see what scholarships are available to apply for
College Junior,1,Most people drive. No bike lanes! Nightmare. Parking pass is expensive and the lots are not close to class.
College Freshman,1,"Parking around campus during the week is a very hard thing to come by.  Being that I am a freshman and I live on campus I don't move my car that much, but when I do, always have to make sure that you're in the right parking section that your decal states.  The fines for parking in the wrong zone can vary anywhere from $20-$100 depending on where you parked.  To have a non commuter parking sticker it is $120 for the whole school year.  Though, if you live on campus it's only $85 for the year.  Personally for Mississippi State University you really don't need a car unless you plan on going off campus a lot.  MSU has done a very good job in creating places on campus for students that don't have cars so that they can go get the items and necessities that they need for themselves."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Small Town, School Is Focal Point. The town is a certified retirement area. The town pretty much revolves around the school. Most of the events and activities in the town are connected with the University. Absolutely no night life, the campus and city shut down after 10 p.m."
College Senior,1,"Parking at MSU has been awful since I started there. As a freshman, you could not move your car until after 3:00 in the afternoon if u wanted to find another parking space when you returned. That is when the decals were only $75. Now I'm a senior and the decals are $105. Parking is still horrible and the population on our campus is steadily rising. We have added 2 new dorms, but no new parking lots. There was suppose to be a parking garage going up, which is why they increased the decals and parking tickets. THERE IS STILL NO PARKING GARAGE! My first class was at 10:00 last semester and I had to be on campus by 8:00 to get a park at all yet alone a decent one. I strongly urge you to not move your car unless you are ABSOLUTELY done with classes for the day. You really don't need a car your freshman year unless you have a job off-campus. The hassle is not worth it."
College Sophomore,1,Permit Cost – Parking permits cost $105 and only last one year. The price is too high just to park on campus.
College Junior,1,Parking is horrible. It takes forever to find a spot. We have to pay 100$ to park and there is never parking. We already pay to go to school. Why should we pay to part too!
College Freshman,1,"Holy Cow It's Crowded Here – Freshman are allowed to have cars, but just maybe they shouldn't be. With State growing so quickly, parking is extremely limited. Don't even try to drive to class. You can park in your dorm's parking lot, or in the designated parking lot if you commute. Other than that, parking is almost impossible during the day. And you will be ticketed if you violate it. However, at night it gets better, when people go home and parking services goes off duty."
College Senior,1,"On campus parking is a nightmare. Parking decals are expensive in my opinion, but I have heard that they are less expensive than other universities in our state. Even when you buy a parking decal, spaces are hard to find and fill up quick. Parking is also difficult because of all the construction going on."

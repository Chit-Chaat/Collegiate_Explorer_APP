Sophomore,5,"The professors I have had during my time at CBC have made my CBC experience memorable for me. They have always gone above and beyond to assist me when needed and genuinely got to know me and care about my future as well as my family. I love the small class atmosphere, which makes it easier for the professors to get to have a relationship with the students and easier for students to reach out and get feedback in a timely manner."
Freshman,5,I am a freshman at Central Baptist College currently.  After experiencing my first semester at CBC I have made countless of life-long friendships and acquaintances.  The professors desire a personal relationship with their students and due to the campus being so small they can do this.  I love that CBC is a faith based college and focuses around Christianity and following Jesus.  While at CBC I am able to get my Bachelors degree in Health Science to allow me to go into Physical Therapy school.
Junior,5,"Central Baptist College feels like a family.  The instructors, staff, and administration really care about their students and make you feel wanted here.  The PACE Program offers alternative ways to take classes that allowed me to complete my degree while I still worked full-time.  All in all, it's a great value and worthy investment!"

College Sophomore,5,Not having greek life is probably the best thing ever
College Freshman,5,"The Conway Police force watches the campus at night, starting around 11pm, to make sure the campus is safe. I have had no problems with personal safety on this campus. The police officers are friendly and if there is a possible threat they make sure to inform anyone they come in contact with on campus."
College Freshman,5,The classes are smaller in size making it easier to develop a working relationship with your professors. Most courses are pretty interactive and there are a wide variety of courses available.

College Senior,5,"Wonderful Environment – CBC is a great school with a friendly environment.  My school is unique because of what it has to offer to its students (Job opportunities, studying abroad, Pace Program, sports, online programs, etc.).  Some of my favorite experiences at CBC is the learning experiences, the helping hand experiences, and the showing of love experiences.  If I had to choose CBC all over again - I would, because I am comfortable there.  I feel right at home and have no worries.  The classroom sizes are perfect for me."
College Senior,5,"No Drug Scene – I have not encountered any drug scenes at my school, which is a good thing.  I think the students at my school are high on education.  There is a lot of peer pressure going around campus called ""MOTIVATION""."
College Junior,5,"Good City – Conway is a great town low crime, friendly people,"
College Sophomore,5,Private College Life – Random dorm checks are a regular occurrence. If someone is accused of having drugs or alcohol they are immediately searched and if found they are immediately expelled.
College Junior,5,All Are Equal – At CBC there is not a difference in how students are treated. Most of the students at CBC are of the Baptist faith.
College Sophomore,5,The computers at the school are very up to date and have all the latest software updates on them. The network reliability is great and the wireless is easy to connect to very helpful with my personal computer and printer. It is really nice having all of this on campus at my convience.
College Freshman,5,"It is a pretty safe place to go. Arkansas in itself it's not a very dangerous place to live. I've lost some stuff in the past because I'm always distracted and I always had found those things in the ""Lost and Found"" office. I also have been in situations in which I needed to walk throughout the night and I always felt confident and secure."
College Freshman,5,I Dont Live on Campus – I go through the PACE program so I have never been to the actual college itself. I don't know anything about it. I do know that the school will work as hard as they can for you and will try to get you to your goals.

Everyone supports the colleges teams by purchasing sports related clothing from the bookstore on campus. The teachers and coaches all seem interesting and nice."
College Freshman,5,"The classes I have at Central Baptist College are amazing. Each of the teachers are amazing in their own way, amusing, and REALLY helpful and caring for each of their students wanting the best out of them and all of them want you to succeed in college. The teachers are really knowledgeable in their subjects and are helpful with things with their students and let us know that we can ask them for help before, during, or after class. The teachers help us out a lot and explain to me why things were wrong helping me better understand the subject and class I am taking."
College Junior,5,"Lack of Drug Scene – Central Baptist College as far I know does not have a drug problem.  Since they are a christian college, they have more students that are drug free that enroll.  If a student was caught with drugs they would be expelled."
College Junior,5,"PACE (Professional Adult College Education) – The PACE program is an amazing program.  It is geared for the Non-traditional student - adults that are working or mothers with small children for example.  The classes are at night or on-line.  The PACE program is block scheduling so it is for the adults that are serious about getting their college degree.  It is fast pace since the classes are only 5 weeks in length.  The Instructors that I have had in the PACE program have been great.  They will come early to class or stay after class if you need them to help you.  So far, my instructors have been very organized and helpful to get the most out of their class."

Sophomore,4,I’ve loved my time at CBC. While the course load can get challenging and stressful at times it’s very easy to keep up with if you stay organized. Your professors actually care about you beyond what they see in the classroom. They are always willing to help you and make time to listen. I have met more than friends I have met a family at CBC and I couldn’t be more thankful for the opportunity to grow in my faith with fellowship of other believers!
Niche User,4,I like the small campus life at Central Baptist. The staff is very welcoming and helps make you feel at home. The coaches are there to  help you whenever you need.
Junior,4,Great Christian school. Small but very family like environment. they have a very safe campus. great school if you are interested in a Christian faith school with weekly service.
Sophomore,4,Central Baptist is a good school. I like chapel's on wednesday and I like the way the school makes me feel welcome. The school is small enough to where everyone knows everyone so it makes it easier to get around and get a lot of help.
College Freshman,4,"My favorite experience is probably being in Composition 1, so much writing!! It's a lot of fun, especially since writing is my first love.

College Freshman,4,school support is very good.
College Freshman,4,we feel very safe on campus
College Freshman,4,class sizes are small which is really good.
College Freshman,4,Scool is Christian based and smaller. This is what I wanted in a college. Everyone one was very friendly and helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"The sports that are played on campus get great support but the sports that aren't do get many fans. The athletic facilities could definitely use work, but are good enough to work with."
College Sophomore,4,There is a good option of chain restaurants and smaller unknown restaurants. Most restaurants offer students discounts. There is a couple of late night options that are relatively close to the school. Cost is usually reasonable. Best places to check out are Tacos 4 life and Fuji steak house.
College Sophomore,4,There is wonderful community amongst all the students who live on campus. Rooms have it's own bathrooms and students are able to control the temperature. It only takes about 20 minutes to walk to class if you walk nonchalantly. I recommend students to live on campus at least 1 year if they're able.
College Sophomore,4,CBC had a scholarship that fit me and helped me very much!
College Junior,4,Rules are acceptable at CBC.
College Junior,4,"Seeing more improvement, a lot more fun activities students can involve."

College Student,4,I really feel safe on campus most of the time. I would however recommend more campus police. (Especially at night)
College Student,4,"There are plenty of off-campus dining options here at CBC. Whether it be fast food or sit down, you're more than likely going to find what you're looking for. There are very few student discounts however. The costs are pretty good, but there are not very many options in terms of vegetarian cuisine."
College Sophomore,4,"Both girls and guys are very diverse at CBC. There are many different styles, interests, looks, etc. "
College Sophomore,4,It was hassle free to get into my program. The academic advisors are very helpful and work with you to make you happy. 
College Sophomore,4,There are many dinning options in Conway that vary from fast food to fine dinning. Cost vary accordingly. 
College Sophomore,4,There are many dining options in Conway that vary from fast food to nice dinning. Costs vary accordingly. 
College Sophomore,4,Parking is not a problem at CBC. There are plenty of spaces and they are directly around the dorms and it is a short walk to all classrooms. 
College Sophomore,4,Classes are small and Instructors are concerned with your education. The material learned at CBC is presented in a way that is easy to understand and remember. 
College Junior,4,"It is fairly good weather, & school is practically never cancelled."
College Junior,4,The dining at my school is fairly good. I enjoy my experience each time I am able.
College Senior,4,"The weather here is nice the majority of the year. There are days when the parking lots get flooded, but that seems to be the nature of the city's weather. When it snows here, classes are usually cancelled due to the surrounding areas' school closings. The dorms are very close to the class buildings, but the overflow parking lot is not that close. So, on rainy days parked in overflow is a little stressful."
College Senior,4,"The use and possession of drugs are prohibited on campus. Since there are room checks four nights out of the week and surveillance cameras near the entrances, the drug safety on campus at Central Baptist college is under control if or when it happens. There is nearly no alcohol use on campus. However, there have been recent confiscations of marijuana and tobacco along with the proper policy enforcements. In close groups on campus there is peer pressure to drink alcohol."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is small which I enjoy. They have also built a new academic building and are currently building a new library and have a 20/20 vision plan for 20 projects in 20 years to make the College better. But right now the dorms are very old and there could be more parking, but other than that it is great!"
College Freshman,4,"If students are not at activities at school, they are hanging out at gusanos, the local pizza place, or house parties."
College Freshman,4,plenty of parking  campus is small so anywhere you park is close
College Freshman,4,"Lots of nice, upscale apartment complexes, many with security gates.  Average rent, resonable utilities."
College Freshman,4,This is the first year I've applied for financial aid as I have been an athelete on a scholarship.  I'm learning the process but administration is helping me.
College Freshman,4,"CBC has every kind of student.  The student body is small, which makes for a better teacher-student ratio.  Most students at CBC are American nationality."
College Freshman,4,Central Baptist encourages activities to keep students busy.  The instructors at CBC are committed to helping students in any compacity so drugs are not a go-to way of life.
College Freshman,4,several chains but some hometown owned good dining also
College Student,4,I like Conway. It's a nice college town that has a lot of walking/jogging/bike trails. It has some unique cultural events and great malls. The people are very nice.
College Student,4,"I like the athmosphere that the college has, it is a very friendly environment and it offers fun activities."
College Freshman,4,Tution is actually not that bad at all. But I strongly promote applying for as many scholarships as possible. But the ladies are super sweet and really care about helping you and getting stuff done.
College Sophomore,4,I generally feel safe on campus but this year there was a problem in the dorms when another student stole things from other people's rooms.
College Senior,4,"Weather for CBC is normal - classes are very seldom cancelled.  We don't have to worry alot about snow and ice, a little rain sometimes.  When the weather is nice, students tend to enoy by hanging out. Some students do homework, some listen to music, and some just sit and talk in groups."
College Senior,4,"Instructors Helps With Research on Certifications and Job Search – My instructors have been very helpful in providing up-to-date information regarding new developments in the IT field.  They provides us with new informations regarding technology,  software programs, available job positions, and needed certifications.  Information technnology is a continously growing field and we are kept up-to-date with the curriculum and having the necessary equipment makes it easier to learn, especially hands on."
College Senior,4,"Very Helpful – Every staff member that I have came in contact with was very helpful.  I've been asked by people I don't know, if I needed help with anything and if I had any questions at all, to come by their office to talk with them.  If I had questions that could not be answered, then I would be directed to the right person that could give me the answer that I was looking for."
College Sophomore,4,"Easy Process – All scholarships can be applied for at once. Various scholarships are given based on academic performance, financial aid, extracurricular involvement, etc. All students have the chance to receive a scholarship. Several scholarships are based on who your parents are and where you are from which is not necessarily fair."
College Student,4,"Off Campus Eateries – Conway is growing and is full of dining's. They have some good chinese food such as Jade china and mulans. And its not expensive and they give tons of food. And there are student discounts for almost every store in conway. There is tons of places to eat from logans to tokyo to golden coral. You name it, its here."
College Junior,2,Just hanging out in dorms
College Freshman,2,The school doesn't have a library building due to the fact it was tore down and being remodeled. Another problem was that there is no sport complex near the school. The student center is also quite small so only a few people are able to sit there at once.
College Junior,2,"Right now, the parking that is on campus is mostly for staff, and it's especially difficult to find a parking spot that isn't in the back lot or off campus if  there is an unexpected event or preview day going on. Even though this isn't helpful now, more parking lots are predicted to be added within the next few years."
College Junior,2,"Not an Athlete, Not Fun – Most of the school is athletes.  The small chunk of people left are choir and bible students, they are strange.  They get very annoying and always judge you.  Most of the athletes are cool though.  The girls look alright, and the boys are about the same."
Niche User,1,Very disappointed in how the athletic department is ran! Also very disappointed to pay for a Christian college and then find out there is partying going on every weekend at the houses the athletes stay in.
Niche User,1,They only want to keep this school WHITE!!! IF YOU ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN DON'T APPLY BECAUSE THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO KEEP YOU OUT
Niche User,1,"Awful!  Lots of hypocritical behavior from many involved in the administration department!  They will definitely keep CBC from growing.  In fact, the student population has obviously dropped in the last several years.  I’m certain it will continue to do so!"
College Freshman,1,"Being a Baptist College, CBC doesn't have a Greek life."
College Freshman,1,"There is no transportation for the school, you must drive yourself."
College Freshman,1,"The menu at Central Baptist College is very small, you get the ""home cooked"" station then the salad bar and then usually a fried food off to the side."
College Freshman,1,The school has very strict rules and you can get fined for doing almost anything.
College Student,1,"The school is very strict on there no tolerance of drinking or drugs or anything that goes against their handbook. They will fine you for anything( cursing, breaking a door, etc). Cant walk around no shirts or sleeveless ones either."
College Junior,1,"It Sucks – This school is very strict, you can't even wear nike running shorts.  They want you to always dress modest.  If you violate the dress code you get a fine."
College Junior,1,"No Tolerance – if you want to get a little wild on the weekend, be very quiet about it and don't even think about putting it on facebook. if you are caught with drugs or drinking, you are gone. it's kinda crazy how strict it is around here."
College Junior,1,"Hypocritical Christians – I am very proud to attend a school whose mission statement pledges to enrich students both mentally and spiritually; however, some students cannot experience healthy learning for fear of being mistreated by faculty members because of their sexual orientation. As christians, we are called to love one another and not to judge someone because of his or her lifestyle. It is hard to determine exactly how many students are homosexual because they have to hide from our faculty. it's sad."

Sophomore,5,Its been great. Lively campus and friendly students and great staff! I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. Central is a great school in my opinion.
Alum,5,"I studied Music Education at Central Michigan University and I believe it helped prepare me for my career as an elementary music teacher and so much more. Not only did CMU prepare me for the career field, but it also prepared me to accomplish real world experiences as well. There are so many things on campus to do and the culture is so incredible. The University offers various clubs, activities, and events for everyone and does a fantastic job at allowing student volunteers / workers to assist in these activities and events. I can guarantee that CMU meets any students criteria and will exceed all expectations."
Alum,5,"I only took a few online classes at CMU, however, I did feel they were very well structured and the professors did a great job at providing virtual instruction that was engaging and informative."
Alum,5,"N/A - Didn't take any online courses but a good handful were offered. Overall good UI for their 'portal', used Blackboard for all grades, etc. Easy to navigate."
Alum,5,"I truly enjoyed the campus groups, activities, and socials! The lively atmosphere and challenging courses made for a stimulating 4 years, which I will never forget!"
Alum,5,I took a few classes online and the teachers were really great. I dropped out of one online class simply because it was a lot to do along with on-campus classes as well.
Alum,5,I really liked going to CMU. Mount Pleasant is a nice place to live and is in a great area. You really feel like you're at a big university without being completely overwhelmed.
Senior,5,"I have learned a lot from my professors. At first I didn't know how coming to a 4 year college would be, transferring from a community college and all would be completely different. But I've enjoyed my experiences so far, and the online classes help a ton."
Senior,5,"Central is a great school! Everyone is friendly and treats people with respect. You may not know everyone on campus, but they are there for you if you need them."
Alum,5,Did not do online classes! But I would have preferred it if it meant not having to be discriminated against for being a mother going to school to better her daughters life and her own.
Sophomore,5,I love the atmosphere of CMU. I feel really supported and there's so many great people on campus who are helping to make sure I can succeed here.
Junior,5,At central I can finally discover my true calling because they have the major I intend on pursuing! I am so excited for my future endeavors!
Alum,5,"CMU was the best fit for me when I took a campus tour in early 2015. The size of the campus was perfect, and the morale of the students and staff topped every other college I had visited. I received an amazing education and had great relationships with my fellow peers and professors. I was highly involved in on-campus activities and clubs and ended up graduating from CMU with Summa Cum Laude honors and two leadership recognitions. I would recommend Central Michigan University to anyone looking for a rewarding college experience. If I were to do my undergrad over again, I would choose Central Michigan University a million times."
Senior,5,"I have taken many online classes through Central Michigan University, along with going through the COVID-19 Pandemic online transition. CMU online classes are easily accessible and professors adapted to change well. Blackboard is the online format that CMU uses and it is easy to work with and professors use it effectively."
Senior,5,"Central Michigan University is a great school to attend college. I feel like I belong there and the people make me feel welcomed and important. The environment is amazing and I would not want to be anywhere else. As a student-athlete I feel well taken care of and prepared for my career. My major is Sport Management with a minor in Marketing. I want to have a career in professional sports, and Central Michigan Unversity has prepared me for this by requiring a field study and internship in the sports industry. The experience I have gained from this has helped me prepare and has increased my excitement about entering the workforce."
Senior,5,"I love their global campus!  The advisor I had was so helpful and whenever I have an issue with technical things they are very helpful.  I love being able to take classes without having to leave my home and with all that has occurred these past months, my transition was seamless."
Senior,5,"I did this above but will say it again, it has been a great experience and my transition during this pandemic has been seamless!"
Sophomore,5,The school culture is infatuating. You feel at home the second you step on campus. The faculty truly cares and wants to see the student succeed and do well. The President cares about the school and the students and does anything in his power to keep the students and faculty happy and safe
Sophomore,5,Professors were extremely understanding of everyone's current situation and would constantly reach out to the students beyond academics to make sure everyone was okay and doing well outside of school. The school cares to see the students succeed no matter what is thrown at them- students constantly have support!
Senior,5,I love Central Michigan University because of the amount of opportunities there are to get involved on campus. The instructors and staff show such passion for their jobs and their students to ensure their success in school and after graduation.
Sophomore,5,"I am starting my first semester at Central Michigan University, but I feel the need to brag on them because the process of getting started has been so easy! The advisor I have is extremely knowledgable, and easy to get ahold of. So far my professors have been quick to respond to my questions and concerns about things as the class gets started. Also, the tech support is top notch!"
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere that people bring to campus. Everyone is incredibly nice and willing to help those who need it. My experience so far has been memorable. I went in blind for roommates and created a solid relationship with them. I can already tell they will be my friends for life.
Freshman,5,"Everyone I have associated with so far is super friendly. My academic advisor isn't the best at their job, but frequently going to my professor's office hours makes up for it. The campus is somewhat clean and you will see landscape workers almost every day while walking around. My grades are pretty well for a freshman and I hope they remain that way. I guess you can say I'm FIRED UP!"
Junior,5,Central Michigan is a great university. The students and professionals are very welcoming and make for a great experience. Life on campus is fun and very safe. The professors care about their students and often go out of their way to encourage all students.
Alum,5,"I loved my time at CMU.  The campus is beautiful.  There were many faculty that I thoroughly enjoyed learning from and keep in contact with 5 years post graduation.  I enjoyed the variety of classes available to me, as I was able to take classes in random areas of interest of mine on top of my major and minor studies.  
With my education at CMU, I feel very prepared to enter graduate school."
Sophomore,5,"Central Michigan University is honestly amazing. The classes are challenging enough, but you still have time for a life. The professors are incredibly welcoming and devoted to teaching. I've met so many awesome students, people that will be life long friends. Those who claim that there is nothing to do haven't made enough of an effort to find the amazing things CMU offers. The campus is pretty and they work hard to keep it up to date. My main complaint is that there definitely isn't much variety of food. The dorm food is not the most appetizing and looking for better food that CMU offers is hard."
Freshman,5,"I have met so many people, and have made so many connections throughout my few months at this university. Central Michigan University has over 500 student organizations that any CMU student can join. Freshman are able to move in a week early and participate in Leadership Safari, which is a week full of  fun activities and games that will get you in the Central Michigan Chippewa spirit. The whole week I felt so welcomed on campus and I was getting acclimated with my surroundings on campus and was starting to feel super comfortable. It was a great week that I will never forget.  CMU is a diverse campus with great professors and awesome academic programs. Every professor provides office hours to help students with their school work. I would never go back and change my decision of choosing Central Michigan University."
Sophomore,5,"I have met so many amazing people at this school, and it provides so much for college students. It sacrifices its incredible large potential income to provide amazing experiences and opportunities for students such as free sports games and merit scholarships that you can receive just for going there."
Freshman,5,I love how welcome everybody is. There is always someone there to help me on campus and my friends are so supportive of me.
Freshman,5,Central Michigan University has done a great job of making sure all students feel welcome. My first semester here has been nothing but amazing and I can not wait to continue on with the rest of my semesters here. They make sure everyone feels included and they do a great job of providing resources to everyone. I am overall very impressed with my experience here.
Freshman,5,Central Michigan is a really great and diverse school. There is a very wide range of programs available to students and the professors are all very helpful.
Junior,5,"Great students, faculty and Staff!!!! CMU provides such a great and caring atmosphere you always feel at home. They provide many resources for students and many campus activities. Great campus size and everything is in walking distance, even stores off campus. Professors are great and really take the time to make sure students understand and grasp concepts. Best University there is. FIRE UP CHIPS!!!!"
Senior,5,"Central Michigan University is INCREDIBLE! Every professor goes out of their way to make sure you are receiving the best education possible. The campus is friendly, and it is very easy to get involved."
Graduate Student,5,"Gucci, it is a fun time to be pretending like an adult. Where no one has the answers and we just go through the motions."
Sophomore,5,"I have loved every day spent at Central Michigan University. The professors are easily accessible and truly care about all the students, academically and on a personal level."
Sophomore,5,I am going back to school to complete my Bachelor's degree and so far CMU has done an amazing job with the whole process.
Junior,5,CMU has a very inclusive community that actively works to get everyone involved! All of my professors have been hilarious! I would encourage you to visit their office hours to stand out.
Junior,5,Central Michigan University is a great place to learn and live! The staff and faculty are very involved and available to help in any way.
Freshman,5,"Central Michigan has a beautiful campus, everyone around in very nice and welcoming. good place to be."
Niche User,5,From visiting Central Michigan University to attending their open house and football games the overall experience stood out to me beyond all other local Michigan colleges. The layout and family type bonds shown and proven throughout the campus drew me in immediately. This is the college for me and I recommend other students to explore it as an option.
Junior,5,"I really like it here at CMU. Classes are fairly easy, most professors are nice-- if you do your work you are bound to succeed here!"
Niche User,5,Central Michigan is very involved in their students lives and make sure to be available all of the time with resources and aid for their students. They really try to make them as comfortable as possible and guide them in the right direction for life.
Sophomore,5,Excellent professors. They are always willing to help. The material is relevant and informative and is explained in an easy to understand format. The material supports critical thinking. The online classes are fast paced and conducive for parents and working individuals.
Alum,5,Central Michigan University is an amazing place.  So much to offer. The instructors care. The campus is beautiful and safe. You form bonds that lead to life long friendships. I really enjoyed my time at cmu!
Freshman,5,"Although I am only a freshman at Central Michigan University, I have already been able to witness a welcoming and supportive environment. The students are passionate about making the incoming freshmen feel welcome and being part of the cross country team has helped me tremendously with getting to know these fantastic students."
Graduate Student,5,"I graduated from Physician Assistant program at Central Michigan university in 2008, and here is where I met the smartest, and kindest human being in my college experience. He does more for his students than any other professor I have learned from. I idolize how dedicated he is and how he always managed to find time to bond with each one of his students semester after semester.  Dr. Hakemi god bless you, you are exceptional, intelligent and kind human being."
Sophomore,5,The experience is great and has a high percentage of ethnic groups. The school also puts on parades and many events for the students to get involved in. They also have great professors who are really involved with student.
Senior,5,"Great school, great location, great people in and around the community. This is almost exactly what I thought college would be like when I was growing up. I enjoy my time in class and on campus, as well as a great nightlife off campus. Would highly recommend this school to others."
Sophomore,5,I like that it is like another home to me. I am excited to go back and be a great student. I had the great opportunity to be apart of a place I feel loved. it is also a very clean place to live. the dorms are the perfect size and also come with all amenities. this causes my family to also feel better about me going there. this is also a safe place where I can be free
Junior,5,"Central Is overall a great place to go! The student life is awesome, there is always something to do on campus. The local town has everything you need, the food choices are kinda limited."
Freshman,5,"I am just starting out my college years at CMU. The Orientation, campus tours and student mentors have all been extremely helpful in preparing me!"
Senior,5,"Central is a great school, majority of the people are very friendly and there are many organizations to join!"
Alum,5,I am so happy I made the choice to go to CMU! The sense of community is amazing and they really focus on making students feel at home during their time on campus. I'm proud to be a Chippewa!
Graduate Student,5,"While searching for graduate programs, I ran across Central Michigan University. Once I expressed interest, an admission counselor reached out to me. She was able to guide me through the process and answer any question I had. When my application was completed and I was accepted, I began to hear from the program director. He was very personable and made reassures me of my fears."
Sophomore,5,Once attending this University I felt welcome. I did not have to hide the real me because everyone accepted me for the person I was. Not only did I find my passion here but made friendships that will be everlasting.
Senior,5,Central Michigan University feels like my home away from home. Everyone is inclusive and outgoing. I have found many groups of people that have become like family. The education and programs they have for my major and minor are very beneficial.
Sophomore,5,"CMU is a very nice college with lots of nice people, good classes and professors, and a nice campus. It's not too big of a school, and it's not too small of a school either."
Freshman,5,"I personally feel that Central Michigan University feels like my home. The town is very similar to my hometown, and the people/students seem lovely. I am super excited to start my freshman year in Fall 2019!"
Junior,5,"From the second I arrived for my tour at CMU, I loved it here. It's a wonderful campus for people who are looking for a quality school with both connections and a tuition that won't break the bank, look no further."
Sophomore,5,"From the moment I first visited Central Michigan University asa high school senior, I have always felt welcome on campus by all of my peers and professors. When you walk through campus everyone is very friendly and wants you to feel welcome here. I think this is what made me feel drawn to attend here and I am glad I made that choice."
Sophomore,4,Its been pretty good. There were a couple problems in the beginning with everyone getting use to the online platform but after the first 2 weeks there were little to no difficulties.
Alum,4,"BCA program -- Great experience & wealth of equipment to learn how to use. Well-developed program with variety of classes for both in front of & behind the camera, but some are classes you could've learned via youtube."
Alum,4,The online courses were great additions to the on-campus courses! They were perfect for summer classes or core classes that require attention but can be done from a distance!
Senior,4,I have enjoyed going to this university. I have learned a lot and I feel like our professors really work to help us succeed outside of school.
Senior,4,I really enjoyed our online learning. I felt like I had all of the tools I needed to succeed. It was still quite a challenge but I think I am better for it.
Sophomore,4,The transition to online due to COVID-19 was difficult at first but I had great professors who helped to make things easier.
Junior,4,The instructors reacted pretty much like the students! I felt like the academics though turned out great due to the circumstances!
Junior,4,"I love that CMU has a ton of people that go to school there, but honestly it does not even feel like that many! The teachers within my major and minor are phenomenal and I have been lucky enough to also have amazing teachers when 
I took my general education classes."
Junior,4,"I have taken about 6 classes online while at CMU, along with some summer classes. The professors make it really enjoyable to sit behind a computer and work. Usually I am not one to learn online, but every online professor I have had so far has made it a great and easy learning experience!"
Sophomore,4,My favorite part about Central Michigan University is my peers. They make me feel like I belong and that they like to include a lot people in activities. I joined the marching band where I have met incredibly cool people and I have a group of friends outside of the marching band where we do activities together. While there are a few changes like I feel like security could be a little better but I don't feel unsafe on campus.
Alum,4,"I had taken four online courses through Central Michigan University. Each course involved professors utilizing Blackboard and discussion posts. Although I am a very hands-on and in-class learner, I still found my online learning experience to be beneficial. I was still able to interact with my professor and classmates and enjoyed the flexibility of when I completed assignments and exams. If you have the opportunity to take an online class, so as not to overcrowd your in-class schedule, I highly recommend taking it through CMU."
Sophomore,4,The only thing I would offer advice on at cmu is the parking. There is simply not enough parking spaces.
Sophomore,4,Central Michigan University is a good school honestly. It offers many of studies and the local businesses are just right for college students.
Sophomore,4,"Central Michigan University is a pretty good school, and cheaper than most schools I would say in Michigan. CMU's campus is always awake. There is always something to do from the late-night dining hall special with a movie to the open movie lounge. My experience has been pretty good. I have made friends pretty fast through networking opportunities like IMPACT, LeadershipSafari, and homecoming. But, one thing that I will have to say that wasn't too enjoyable was a bit of racial intolerance. There were some clubs that I was always ignored at meetings, and people would distance themselves from me. But, CMU does have required diversity training and other training to educate people about sexual harassment. And I do see people of different races socializing so it isn't a racist campus. Overall, I can't wait to return in the fall."
Freshman,4,"My online experience was very tough to adjust to. Getting in contact with teachers, turning in work was very hard to handle. Going from the classroom to everything online had its problems. After awhile it all worked out in the end"
Freshman,4,It was open and pleasant. The professors cared about seeing the students succeed. I enjoyed my time there.
Senior,4,CMU is a wonderful school. I transferred there and it was the best decision EVER! Professors are very compassionate and understanding and actually want you to learn. Few are bad at teaching but that happens everywhere. CMU is in a great city with very welcoming people and the staff  encourages you to get involved so that you get the best experience for the money you’re paying! Small town but lots of fun to have And great people to meet.
Senior,4,Professors are very compassionate. Seem to be easier than in person classes but professors make sure you learn materials and communicate a lot with students so the online barrier does not restrain learning.
Sophomore,4,"The campus has become very updated and is so pretty but the dorm life is not very pleasing. I am someone with bad allergies and the dust within the dorm room was plentiful where I felt sick the whole entire time I was there, with congestion, sneezing, coughing and finding it difficult to breathe. I would recommend to join Greek life, it was the best thing that I have ever done. In Greek life their are so many opportunities to grow not only your personal motives but a networking system with the students in your chapter, other chapters, and the alumnae. Greek life has also gave me the opportunity to engage in leadership roles which grew my resume. All in all I am pleased with the time that I have spent at Central Michigan University."
Alum,4,"I loved the overall atmosphere of the university. It was a place you can really call home as everyone, both students and faculty, were welcoming and willing to help you reach your educational goals. There was a strong sense of community everywhere on campus and it made going to class more enjoyable. Although it is a medium sized school, I thought it was the perfect size for both intimacy and privacy."
Alum,4,Central Michigan University was a great place for my Bachelor's degree. It offered lots of programming and activities for students to get involved on campus and had a great residence life atmosphere unlike any other campuses.
Junior,4,I love the access to the university resources from anywhere. The faculty is super helpful. The community on campus is super welcoming and fun and really makes you want to be present and active o campus.
Freshman,4,"I love the campus; it’s easy to get around and everything is fairly close together. I’ve made tons of friends living in the dorms and we’ve become like a family, so I really like the community at Central. So far, I’ve really enjoyed most of my classes, obviously there will always be those few that are a little boring, but overall I’ve had really good professors that want to help me succeed. The only thing I would change is there definitely needs to be more diversity within the campus as a whole, but they are definitely working towards this so that’s good."
Junior,4,"CMU has potential to be a much better campus, we just need more diversity and representation of students of color. In every building you see memorabilia to white alumni and not nearly enough to students and alumni of color. We need to not only push diversity for marketing purposes but show diversity to the students on campus!"
Freshman,4,It is a very good school with good leadership programs. It helps prepare you for your future and everyone is so nice and wants to see you succeed. There is constant help anywhere you go and is a good community and atmosphere.
Freshman,4,"I love it here! I wish wish I had more help with financial aid. Overall, the quality of my education is wonderful as are support faculty, staff and professors."
Freshman,4,"It has a beautiful campus, the professors are friendly and everyone on Campus tries to keep you involved.  Everyone is very friendly and they have plenty of resources, I also really enjoy their cafeteria food."
Alum,4,A lot of good opportunities for undergraduate researchers. Advisors who take on undergraduate researchers all seem extremely hands on and very eager to help students succeed. Small classrooms. Very accessible campus. Needs update on dorms.
Freshman,4,Super expensive but there is a lot of things always going on and the people are all very sociable and kind
Freshman,4,I love how committed all the students are to their future. Everyone I've met is so hardworking and committed to their futures; it's really inspiring to be around so many people who value their education and what their working towards.
Freshman,4,I am currently a freshman at Central Michigan University and I love it! CMU is a very diverse campus where there is always something to do. CMU has a variety of academic clubs and activities.
Sophomore,4,"Central Michigan University was my first choice college and I don't think I could have picked a better college. So many people on this campus are involved and care about the things they do and it's very inspiring. The only thing that bothers me about the school is the people who don't care and almost go out of their way to disrupt other people's experiences and the way that those cases are handled. For example, there was been writing on some people's doors that have been racist/transphobic and they were not only handled poorly, but there was a public article in the school's published newspaper that stated that people should just ""get over"" things like that. However, those students seem to be in the minority and there is an overwhelming amount of people who are against people who do things like that."
Alum,4,"I felt the cost of tuition at Central Michigan University was reasonable. Additionally, there were a variety of programs offered which is great for a recent high school graduate who is unsure about their career path."
Sophomore,4,"Central made me feel so welcomed when I first got to the campus. Everyone is very welcoming and nice and I enjoyed that especially with staying away from home. This campus offers so much students, they give advisors, success coaches, and more. Central makes sure everyone student get the help they need and deserve. I like how they are attempting more diversity on campus , I am glad that they are acknowledging that there needs to be more diversity and they are trying. The only thing I feel like they should change is the parking, like there should be more parking for students, and there are too many tickets being given for a place we pay to stay at. Another thing that can be changed is books like there should be more online books that we should be able to purchase instead of getting charged for books we don't even use."
Sophomore,4,"Feels like home! The environment is amazing, the staff and students are so friendly. There are so many great opportunities and professors really want the best for their students."
Niche User,4,I am a senior in high school but I visit my sister at central on the weekends throughout the years and I am in love with the college. The food in the towers is very good and they have so many options to choose from so you can not get tired of eating one food. The dorm rooms have lots of space in them and nice bathrooms. They have a great security system in the towers making everyone feel safe.
Niche User,4,I was born and raised there and my mother and grandmother are both graduates and were able to get the right education they needed to pursue their dreams.
Freshman,4,"It is known as a party school, but that's not really true. It's a pretty diverse community where you can meet friends of all different backgrounds and there are a lot of fun things to do on campus. Mount Pleasant itself isn't really anything to write home about, you probably won't find yourself going into town very often unless it's for groceries or something mundane."
Freshman,4,"I have only been to Central Michigan University for a few months. However, I already feel acclimated to the university. Central has many opportunities for involvement and allows students to express themselves in a welcoming environment."
Freshman,4,"What I love about Central Michigan University, are the staff here and how they encourage you to stay involved with various activities and organizations on campus. If there were anything I would like to see change, are more focuses on students and mental health"
Freshman,4,"The food is decent, cops are always driving around the area, the campus is beautiful, and the classes are organized. It is definitely a party school, with a club within walking distance (less than a mile) from campus. It's not too big and not too small, and so far I'm enjoying my time here."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at CMU, I was able to successfully network with my peers as well as professors and staff. The expense I gained at CMU has given my the confidence to continue to work toward my goals."
Junior,4,"Transferring to Central University has made my life more full and made me feel like I was apart of a community. I have met life long friends, have become apart of groups, and have got involved. Professors are helpful and are knowledgable in what they teach. The only thing I would change is having more parking for commuters for those students who live off campus."
Sophomore,4,"Central Michigan is a very friendly, clean, and safe campus with lots to do and very helpful staff. I transferred here from a community college and I was concerned about getting lost in the large student population but it is not like that at all."
Graduate Student,4,"I like the range of degree programs they offer, and they make it very easy for working adults to learn online."
Sophomore,4,It’s full of amazing people but it’s easy to get off track with your studies. Focus on school work during the week and then have fun on the weekends. Try not to over load yourself too. Make sure your studying is healthy and safe for your mind and body.
Alum,4,"My experience at Central Michigan was an overall positive one. I felt that I received the proper education as it related to my major, my professors were always willing to help, and there were plenty of extra-curricular activities and group that contributed to landing my first job."
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed the scenery on the campus. I love small and peaceful the campus is. The dorms are very diverse and are filled with wonderful people.
Sophomore,4,"CMU is a cute college with professors who care and plenty of things to do outside of academics. Sports *football* are kind of a big thing here, but so is succeeding in your scholarly endeavors."
Sophomore,4,"I am a graphic design major, and all of the art professors are so friendly, helpful, and wise. I truly feel like I am learning from some of the smartest people in the industry. The campus is very welcoming, and the students are very helpful to incoming freshmen."
Sophomore,4,Central is supportive of students going through hard times in any aspect of their lives. Central really cares about students and really wants them to succeed. They are really great on supporting students.
Sophomore,4,"CMU does a great job at giving out scholarships. Every student I've met at CMU has received some type of scholarship at one point in time. Campus is easy to get around--you can walk just about anywhere on campus in 15 minutes or less, which is convenient when scheduling classes back to back. Central is bleeding with pride, which is evident in the countless times ""Fire Up Chips"" is exclaimed each day."
Sophomore,4,"I love the home feeling Central gives off. The campus is small enough to feel like home but big enough to meet new people. Many classes offered, and a large variety of programs. Some buildings have been updated but other still need updating."
Senior,4,"From financial problems, and under funded buildings and programs, to issues with social acceptance and diversity, CMU is definitely a university that has a lot of work to do. However, because of the people I have met and the opportunities I have taken at CMU, CMU has been a place I am happy soon call my alma matter."
Junior,4,I enjoy campus life and have joined many very influential student groups that I love to be a part of and make a difference in the community. I also love my programs opportunity for hands on learning in the field that I one day want to work in
Sophomore,4,"The professors are very friendly. The campus is not too big, the housing is manageable and the food is pretty good. the scenery of the campus is nice as well."
Sophomore,4,"The first year of college has its ups and downs, and mine certainly did. I wasn't in the ideal situation having early morning practices (6 AM) three times a week or being in a dorm over a mile from the athletic facilities without a car. The professors want you to succeed and are available when you need them. I went to college looking for academic success and an opportunity to run, but I got more out of the year than that through having a positive mindset about the circumstances I was in."
Sophomore,4,"I'm going to be a sophomore in the fall of this year, and my experience at CMU has been quite interesting. I'm a piano performance major, so my days are relatively busy and full of practice and studying, but I still have been able to get around and see all that the school has to offer. The people are, for the most part, not very socially or politically inclined, but they are very open to listening to new ideas. I know generalizations of thousands of people is not a good idea, but that is what I've noticed most. Overall I think Central Michigan University is a good fit for those who want to get the average college experience."
Sophomore,4,"When I visited this school, I enjoyed the campus life. I am also interested in their medical program."
Junior,4,"It is not the best public university in the state clearly, but still a great one nonetheless. I never understood why it gets as much hate as it does; as all universities have their downsides. It is not in the most entertaining city, but the campus itself really feels intimate. They have been repairing and creating new buildings for certain fields (i.e. bio-sciences and business), but they could improve the campus's parking situation for sure. It has an awesome library, and the on-campus events can be entertaining to attend too. The party scene has died down since I started attending in 2016, but you can still find a party if you know the right spots. Overall, its a pretty good university; as with all things in life, it is whatever you make of it."
Junior,2,"Professors are generally understand of the struggles students may be facing during this pandemic, however many students (myself included) have found that the workload has increased tremendously since the switch from in-person to online learning. Much of this could be classified as ""busy work"" as opposed to genuine learning opportunities."
Junior,2,"I have found that almost all of my professors are competent and care for their students and their field of study greatly. However, I could not be more disappointed in the management of the school, from top administrators and the way that the fiscal budget is determined. For anyone graduating high school in the coming years, I highly advise you not to attend this University. I have been here for over two years and would have already transferred if they didn't have my credits held hostage. If you begin your four-year bachelor pursuit anytime after 2020, I am unconfident that the school will not be bankrupt before you are able to finish your degree. Go somewhere else."
Freshman,2,"For the price of tuition, the education should be much better. There are constant technical issues, professors do not put assignments online, and the school seems overall sloppy and unprepared. I am very disappointed this semester."
Sophomore,2,"I took about 3 classes online because of Corona. It was quite difficult because the teachers were caught off guard so they didn’t know what they were doing and they kept assigning work randomly without letting us know, it turned out to be very stressful till the last two weeks of classes."
Alum,2,"Diversity is stressed at this university. It is the ultimate focus of what we believe in. However, the university students do not show it. No one talks or mingles with diverse groups, and it is very split. The teachers are not very diverse either. It is surprising to think that diversity is the number one focus and it does not exist. Furthermore, I was lonely every day being here. It was hard to make friends, especially when no one wanted to really talk unless you were part of their group. I tried joining a co-ed fraternity and only fond fake friends. My roommates acted like friends for one year and then decided to dump you in order to party. The partying is very out of control! I had my daughter in the middle of my junior year, and i did not feel safe anymore on campus. Diversity does not extend to families. Moms are discriminated against by teachers and students! No help and no sanctuary. Then came a shooting, stabbings, and a sense of no safety. No help for struggling students."
Senior,2,"Half of the teachers I’ve had here are below average. Advisors are only trying to make you stay in college longer than you need to be. The town of Mt. Pleasant gets boring quickly, like how many times can you go to the same 4 bars? Party scene died out my freshman year. Go somewhere else"
Senior,2,"School is in a great area, but the professors are not all that good, and academic advisors make a lot of mistakes when setting you up for classes"
Junior,2,"Do not take their online classes. What they tell you before you apply is not how it goes. Once you start classes they change what they told you and your stuck taking classes you never agreed to. Then your grades are only used by how well you do on your exams, nothing else. So basically you have to pass all of your exams and your final to pass your class. And all the other work you did over the course does not count."
College Freshman,2,Drugs have been unseen because of party activities
College Freshman,2,"I'm not a fan of the ego of Greek Life. They oftentimes believe that they are ""better"" or ""upper"" in comparison to non-greek students. You're also shamed if you don't chose to do Greek life."
College Freshman,2,The university pharmacy has been shut down. Campus is relatively safe. the university medical center is terrible quality.
College Freshman,2,we don't have a soccer team
College Junior,2,"In reference to Music Department, complete a major.  Stay away from the Minor professor.

Music department is a good department except for minor....."
College Junior,2,"Drug use is prevalent at CMU, especially among the underclassmen and week-ends.  Rampant in the Greek area but also in the dorms."
College Junior,2,On campus single apartments are very old and dated.  Cost goes up each year and the average cost is much higher than off-campus housing.  Housing process is very easy and located next to the campus.
College Junior,2,"In reference to the professors at CMU, avoid minoring in music.  If going into music I would recommend a major."
College Junior,2,"I stay away from that life, they are known only for being partiers.  Not serious students."
College Freshman,2,Not really a big fan of Greek Life. You don't need to be apart of it to be involved with things.
College Sophomore,2,You know that theer are drugs on campus due to the smell or talk about it. Policies are enforced but students still go against them.
College Student,2,The alcohol policy doesn't take the Good Samaritan Law into consideration at all.
College Student,2,"Not many scholarships, most are only available for very specific situations or they run out quickly. If you're planning on applying, apply as early as possible."
College Student,2,"There are not NEARLY enough healthy options. I am a vegetarian and often find myself stuck eating cheese pizza or something else not so healthy because they DO NOT take care of their produce. Beyond that, the hours of the cafe are HORRIBLE and if you go between 1 PM and 3:30 PM, the options (or lack their of) are laughable."
College Freshman,2,"The process is tiring as there are many requirements one has to meet before applying for the financial aid. At CMU, I do not receive aid and will not for the rest of my college experience but I am still required to go through the process in order to continue to receive my scholarships."
College Freshman,2,"I do not like the food here. The only thing I really do enjoy is my breakfast that I get, other than that I never eat at the dining halls."
College Freshman,2,"Everyone from Mount Pleasant loves the university and is very supportive.  However, CMU is pretty much the only thing in Mount Pleasant.  There are some restaurants and stores on Mission road, but not many activities to keep you busy."
College Freshman,2,A lot of people don't care about our varsity sports teams.  Most students just use games to tailgate and then maybe go to the game. The crowds heavily shrink in size at half time.  The varsity facilities are basically glorified high school facilities.
College Student,2,"Okay, heres the thing its mt. pleasant what did you expect?"
College Student,2,"Nothing is locked during the day except your dorm if you decide to lock it. At the same time though, its mt. pleasant like who is going to be out and about doing bad things other than other students who have the key anyway?"
College Freshman,2,"They're obnoxious and nobody likes the Greeks, especially the girls in sororities. They're facilities seem to be really nice."
College Freshman,2,There is nothing to do.
College Junior,2,"I only application financial aid ,but I don't know why school give me some loan ,I don't need loan"
College Freshman,2,Mt. Pleasant is very flat so there is a lot of wind and when there is rain campus floods.
College Freshman,2,Fairly strict when it comes to parking violations. They will write you a ticket immediately. Also when it comes to drinking/noise you will get written up
College Freshman,2,"Its tedious and challenging. As long as you get the work done, though, you're okay"
College Freshman,2,Nothing special. If your graduated High School with a 3.5 you're guaranteed a scholarship
College Freshman,2,I am an in-need student. I believe I should have received more.
College Freshman,2,Sports teams are bad so no one really cares
College Freshman,2,"Everyone drinks everyone weekend, people always are having parties."
College Junior,2,"Windy every day, and bitterly cold this winter. That's Michigan for you."
College Freshman,2,"I have my own transportation
"
College Junior,2,"If you lose certain scholarships because of GPA, there aren't ways to get it back. Took my tuition rates up $10,000"
College Junior,2,"In the middle of nowhere. If you don't have a car, you better know people in your friend group that does"
College Senior,2,Mount Pleasant is a college town and I wouldn't want to live here after I graduate or raise a family.  There isn't much to do and the closest mall is a half hour away in Midland.  The only sports teams are college games and their aren't many activities or attractions.  The safety isn't the safest either.
College Junior,2,Campus crime has seemed to have increased lately.
College Junior,2,The fan support is awful and close to none.
College Junior,2,There needs to be more parking for students!!
College Sophomore,2,Alcohol is almost glamorized by students in the dorm who feel that drinking is all there is to do on weekends. There are other events students take part in that do not involve alcohol. 
College Sophomore,2,"We have only a few bars and taxis keep raising there prices, making going out even more costly. "
College Sophomore,2,Winter is the worst around here. Everything seems dead and the weather makes me lethargic when it gets too cold. 
College Sophomore,2,Football is not very good so not many people go to games. Varsity sports are important to some but not integral in a lot of students life. 
College Sophomore,2,Dorms are noisy and small. Not worth the cost to live in them. 
College Sophomore,2,"There is a strict rule against drugs and alcohol on campus, but the roads next to campus house all of the fraternities and there is drinking every weekend. "
College Sophomore,2,"I hate parking here only because none of the students know how to drive. there are always accidents and people park in the wrong lots all the time. They never get towed or removed from the lot, they only ever receive a million tickets. It's sometimes hard to find a parkinng spot by your class and if you cant there really isn't any reason to go to class because you will have missed half of it by the time you find a spot and walk there. then the teachers say parking is not an excuse. sorry, but it is."
College Sophomore,2,"It's kind of boring here. There is one main road with all of the businesses and restaurants, and then there is a casino and downtown area, but surrounding the school there are just farms and highways. It's a rather unexciting place."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not super fond of it. It looks like it would be good at first, but after a couple weeks of the same food it gets annoying and I started to get sick from it. It was like they ran out of thinngs and didn't really care so they just made burgers or chicken every single day, and it got old really fast."
College Sophomore,2,"Again, it's not the most strict school I've ever heard of, but they aren't super laid back either. They care most about the safety of the student. They want students to have fun while at school, but they also wish that we attend our classes. They will break up parties if they need to, and only ever do what they think is best.
"
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is generally odd. It's in the center of Michigan, so it can be either really cold or rather warm depending on the day. I likes to rain a lot and snow a lot, which is annoying, but it won't keep me from attending class. "
College Senior,2,In the beginning I wasn't getting much financial aid so I had to turn to private loans because they said my parents made too much money. They didn't care to check if my dad was actually helping me with my schooling before turning me down with more financial aid. I have paid for all of my schooling on my own but they never checked to see if my parents were helping they  just assumed by their income. It was discouraging and frustrating to deal with alone.
College Sophomore,2,"Student life on campus is great. There are so many things to do, from sports to watching movies. The library consists of almost everything you could need. The are thousands of books and many study rooms. Events happen around campus all the time. You can easily find out what's going on on campus by reading the sidewalks."
College Junior,2,As a vegetarian off-campus dining is somewhat hard to find.
Freshman,1,"This semester because of the pandemic, I am choosing to attend all online to keep myself and my family safe. I am being punished by doing so because of the endless technical issues my professors or myself have. On most days I cannot hear my professors during lectures unless I call in using my cell phone. I am very much so considering switching colleges."
Freshman,1,"Dorms are terrible, people there are either straight up stoners or just kinda weird. Overall felt like a trashy school for how much it cost. Some of the buildings are new and nice like the bioscience or ehs building but most are old with like 5 total outlets. And oh when people say there’s crazy party’s there’s not. There’s a club that people go to on the weekend in hopes of getting herpes or something idk. It’s a dumpy club, mt pleasant is a dumpy town with nothing to do. Hence why people like to get wasted. Been here for a year and I feel like I haven’t got a true education whatsoever.  Athletics are entertaining and the sac is super nice, but the pros don’t outweight the cons."
College Freshman,1,No diversity what so ever
College Freshman,1,"CMU isn't at all how they advertise it to the public. It's not ""fun and for everyone"". If you have the money to spend to be apart of something or go out then it's a lot of fun. The only thing I'm happy about is that it only took me a semster to realize I didn't want to be here."
College Freshman,1,"Eating off campus is almost as terrible as eating on campus. The foods just as sh***y, just more expensive"
College Freshman,1,"The food tastes terrible, it's terrible for you, and it doesn't even LOOK appetizing. You actually lose your appetite when you look at the food"
College Student,1,They're very full of themselves and very obnoxious and entitled. It's nauseating. They put a bad name to what Greek life is supposed to be.
College Senior,1,There are not that many people on campus of different races.
College Freshman,1,They are very strict with noise in dorms and alcohol usage
College Freshman,1,The weather changes often and is very unpredictable.
College Freshman,1,Temperatures rarely peaked over the 20's during the winter season.
College Freshman,1,The school needed to have it stuff together.
College Sophomore,1,Parking needs to be revised here. There are never enough spaces and the cost of the permit is too high. 
College Sophomore,1,It is very difficult to find a parking spot and it stinks that we only have a few lots to choose from
College Sophomore,1,The freshman dorms can be a nightmare. Your going to a place all alone and end up with random people in a dorm that are mean. The dorms are also very expensive to live in and very little room. The options are greater outside of campus and much cheaper.
College Sophomore,1,"As a freshman it sucks if you don't apply for a permit in the fall as soon as your accepted you have to park at the back of the school, which is a long way. Upper class-men park anywhere. Parking can be very hectic as well as driving. The best way to get around is to walk, bike, or skate. Besides its so small you can get anywhere in 10 minutes depending on the weather and how fast you walk. Even though there are plenty of options of where to park it can be a nightmare and parking police will not hesitate to give you a ticket."
College Sophomore,1,"It rains in Mt. Pleasant a lot more than I ever expected that it would. Unfortunately this means that the rain constantly floods the sidewalks around my apartment. This is a problem because when the temperatures cool my sidewalk becomes a sheet of ice. CMU takes care to always put down salt, but that doesn't help the structural sidewalk issues. It gets to be rather irritating. Yesterday we finally got to see the sun and it was gorgeous, but as I fill out this survey it is once again raining."
College Freshman,1,"The parking here is poorly set up. Freshman have to park in a far away, secluded area which does not seem very safe to me. Also, parking enforcement are extremely harsh and unreasonable when giving out tickets."
College Junior,1,"Parking Patrol is very strict and is always trying to catch someone parking in the wrong place. They have been known to write bogus tickets, which students can fight, but they have to pay the ticket first and then hopefully get their money back. Parking Patrol is a money maker for the school and does more harm than good."
College Senior,1,The main campus has racial issues and is known for being prejudice against blacks and other minorities
College Junior,1,I do not receive very much for financial aid whatsoever
College Junior,1,Parking enforcement gives no leeway when it comes to tickets.
Recent Alumnus,1,"In the educational program, there are few diverse students that I recognise. I'm not sure about religion, but for the most part everyone in my program cares for education. This leans most of them on the side of democrats but I am unsure due to this never being discussed."
College Senior,1,"The dorms are not the greatest. All that they are missing are bars on the windows to complete the facade that it is a prison. You have rules for when to go to sleep, how loud you can be, and even who you can have over. Being in close proximity with three other people in a very small compartment causes major stress. Most time must be spent out of the dorms in order to begin to enjoy the live of a college student."
College Senior,1,Most parking available is in the middle of campus. Nice placement if you can find a spot. Parking permits cost too much. The availability of parking spaces are limited for those with no parking passes. The meter lots are at a reasonable price with a quarter equaling a half hour.
College Senior,1,"Very Strict! Police have been extremely strict especially in the last couple years. If any parties or gatherings are advertised(such as put on facebook), chances are they will be busted and the hosts will get ticketed. I have quite a few friends who have gotten tickets and even were threatened to get kicked out of their houses."
College Sophomore,1,Very Few Good Facility – Teachers would rather discus old drinking stories with students instead of actually teach. Was there for a year and barley even got a teacher to respond to my emails about assignments or class.
College Senior,1,Atlanta Metro Campus – This campus where I attend is not deverse at all. Most students I know in my program are 99% African American and female.
College Sophomore,1,"Red Tape and Fire Hoops – The criteria for admissi9on is typical, but the process of evaluating classes and what you need to take for your major is a mess. When I applied the administration was not even sure what type of student I was supposed to be because I am seeking a second bachelor's degree. They also don't count higher level classes to cover lower classes that need to be taken. I have to go back and take Biology 101 because my College biology from my first bachelor's counts as a 300 level class. I've known so many people that get to their senior graduation audit and are told that they have many more classes to take and that those classes aren't regularly offered."
College Sophomore,1,"Tailgating Is Not Fun – CMU's tailgate got changed my freshman year and allows students, 21 and up, 6 beers or a pint of liquor. Also, they don't allow any loud music.  This has resulted in a terrible tailgate scene, which everyone avoids and heads to Main St. Also, cops are everywhere breathing down your neck if you make one bad move, your outta here. Also, we may lose our D1 status in football because no one wants to go to the games, partially due to the crappy tailgate."
College Sophomore,1,"Struggles of a White, Male Student – CMU has a diverse population, but probably the only reason is the money they give out to balance it out to show they are not a ""farm, white"" school. As a white, male, there are no scholarships available because they believe I can provide for myself, but help the minority students out who have visas from the government and can have more anyways."
College Junior,1,No Intership – I was not required to have an internship.  I do not plan to have one.
College Freshman,1,"I personally don't have a car on campus, but I hear everyone complain about the parking for Freshman. There are not many parking spots, and it's a far walk."
College Student,1,Not Enough Spots! Have to leave really early for class in order to get a spot and then it is a competition to see who can get the spot with some people getting in accidents. Parking garages needed!
College Junior,1,Social Lives. The police are just out looking to get students in trouble. They do not help kids out in anyway. Their first reaction is to just hand out MIP's. They are all arrogant and think that they rule the university.
College Junior,1,Fan Support. As a former wrestler I saw first hand that students did not care much about their universities athletics. The only thing students support is football and that is because it is a reason to get intoxicated.
College Senior,1,The parking at CMU is really bad.  I don't like to even park on campus anymore.
College Senior,1,The parking at CMU is really bad.  I don't like to even park on campus anymore.
College Student,1,"Better to Walk or Bike – Parking is rather poor on campus.  It seems like there are too many cars and not enough spaces.  People do better to walk, bike, skateboard, roller blade, etc.  If there were more hills around here, I would even think about sledding during the winter.  As it is, I think I'll start snowshoeing.  Overall, I'd say to have a car to get around town, but not to drive to class if you can help it."
College Freshman,1,"Parking and tickets are RIDICULOUS!!! In fact, I received a ticket today!Parking tickets are $25 and overtime meter parking is $10. The parking is very limited and there is never any spots available when you need them. The first week of school, Central Michigan's Parking Enforcement team gave out over $25,000 worth of tickets!! A darn shame! However, the need for a car is not high at all because the campus is not very big at all. But, if one works on the opposite side of the campus and have to be at work within 10 minutes of getting out of class, it definitely is necessary."

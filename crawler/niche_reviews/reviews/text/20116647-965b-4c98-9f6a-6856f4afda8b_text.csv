Graduate Student,5,I love the fact that all of the courses for my graduate degree is ðŸ’¯% online and I also like the way that the courses are asynchronous; which you can learn at your own pace.
Graduate Student,5,Iâ€™m enrolled in the online degree program and I love it!  Professors are knowledgeable and compassionate towards their students and their subject matter.
Junior,5,"I attend Troy University in Phenix City Alabama. The great thing about Troy is that there is a variety of class options available. The options include in person, online and blended. The college also offers class times that are very flexible for the working adult. Troy University offers a multitude of degree options as well. Not everyone is on the same time line for education. Many factors play into this including parenthood, military careers and just plain not being ready. Troy University gives everyone the change to fulfill their dream of a degree and a career."

Junior,5,I love the diversity about this campus. I love how administrators attend to the students needs as if it were their own.
Junior,5,I took online courses throughout the summer during my previous three years at Troy. I admire them because I do not have to be in physical contact to learn. There are also many technology tactics that I have learned while taking online courses as well.
Junior,5,"I have not personality taken any online courses, however, due to the covid19 pandemic; courses had to be switched to online. This may sound like a difficult situation, but i am here to say Troy University's professors handled it with diligence. Professors made sure lectures and assignments were clear. The workload was manageable. It was an overall lovely experience despite the pandemic."

Sophomore,5,I enjoy Troy University a lot ! I understand the teaching and material very well ! I was apart of student activities which allowed me to make a difference on campus !
Junior,5,I love Troy University! I chose it because it is in a small town with decently small student body size and I was not disappointed. A majority of the teachers care about you and your success and are willing to work with you. I could not have chosen a better place to spend four years of my life.

Works Here,5,"I have not had much experience at Troy University, but i have experienced the athletics teams, the campus, the dorms, the food, and the party scene. I kind of experienced the student life when  was able to stay on campus during Upward Bound. When  I was in Upward Bound, we would stay in the dorms on campus during the summer while the actual college students were on the break. While in Upward Bound we was able to tour the campus and get to know the buildings, especially if we were planning to attend there. We was also able to eat in the cafeteria on the buffet for free. I learned how exciting college life is while I was in Upward Bound.  Working in the cafeteria either in the dish room or prepping the food , its somehow preparing you also."
Alum,5,"Troy is an awesome college for traditional, but especially, non-traditional students!!!! The online education is just as rigorous and of great quality like the in-classroom experience!  I love Troy and this is why I am back to obtain an additional degree!  I feel so welcome when I go back during Homecoming as well too!!!!  The campus offices, no matter which one I call, have always been so polite and helpful!"

Freshman,5,"My experience at Troy was amazing my first year. This place is my second home now. I would encourage everybody to come here because of how beautiful our campus is, how amazing the people are, and how safe it is.

Senior,5,"Excellent school, They have great scheduling for classes available to work with your busy life. You can go to Troy University even if you work full time,  because they offer late classes, as well as online classes to work with your busy work schedule. The advisers are very responsive, and with you every step of the way if you need assistance. The School if full of people from diverse back grounds from all over. They also offer many scholarship options for people in the military."
Alum,5,Great campus size.  Small school environment with big school feel.  FBS Football team that has been nationally ranked.
Graduate Student,5,"I am a first term graduate student at Troy University. I am taking courses online so many of the categories listed below are not applicable to my experience. However, I am enjoying my classes and my professors thus far. The academics are challenging yet engaging and my professors want the best for each student. I would recommend this university to anyone."
Junior,5,Troy has an excellent online program with competent teachers. The textbook costs are minimal and the flexibility in class choice is fantastic.

Niche User,5,I like the people. They are all very kind and caring. I got to meet with the band director once i told them that i had an interest their band. I hope they can change their campus a bit more to make it look more appealing.
Senior,5,Troy makes online learning easy. I have been working on my degeree for some time now and no matter what challengs I have Troy accepts me and works with me.
Sophomore,5,Great school! Troy is always focused on leadership and togetherness. Troy is also great on academics as well and has amazing professors. Not to mention that this school has AMAZING athletics too. Maybe I would like to see more scholarship opportunities for those out of state.
Junior,5,"Troy University is a gem. I can't imagine any other school having the charm and community that you will find here. Your professor knows you by name and it is the perfect size to always see a friend on the quad, but always have someone new to meet. The scholarships are unmatched by any other school I've heard of. I have free tuition and a foundation scholarship on top of that to cover housing. The campus has continued to develop over the past few years with the improved football stadium, beautiful lecture halls for School of Business and College of Education, and new fitness center about to open. There's also plans for more updated buildings and dorms coming over the next couple years. The beauty of the campus is undeniable and we're so lucky to have a Chancellor who cares about the  environment for students. I chose Troy over several top 10 state schools beause of the affordability and I would do it again if given the change. Go Trojans!"
Freshman,5,"Troy isn't in a huge city, so I liked the small-town vibe. This institution superscores your ACT score, and it gave me the most scholarship money. Their nursing program is #1 in the state of Alabama, and their band program, Sound of the South, is beyond wonderful!"
Freshman,5,"Troy University feels like a home away from home. There is always something fun to do with campus clubs and organizations! Another plus, for a journalism major, is that Troy is ranked sixth in the nation in its journalism department."
Sophomore,5,"I love Troy University! THE FLEXIBILILTY IS AWESOME! The short classes (9 weeks) help speed up the process of getting my very own degree. I am a strictly online student and to be honest,  I can not think of  a thing that needs to be change or updated! This school is awesome!"
Freshman,5,"I am a freshmen at Troy University and I have had a great experience since starting my freshmen year August 2019.  The students here are very helpful and the professors are as well.  The administration is very helpful by explaining information to you such as housing, financial aid, and how to get around the campus.  They have security throughout the university and all of the areas have lighting.I feel very safe here.  I am really enjoying my studies at Troy University."
Junior,5,I LOVE TROY UNIVERSITY!!!! The professors are so great and want to see you succeed in everything you do. They are committed to your success and will help in any way possible that they can. It is affordable although a scholarship would definitely be beneficial. The campus is so gorgeous and the people are friendly and inviting.
Freshman,5,The atmosphere at Troy University is amazing. Everyone is kind and generous making the overall experience great.
Freshman,5,"Enjoy the staff.
Very helpful with getting me set up for school.

Niche User,5,I love everything about the school!  They also are in state tuition even though its in Alabama. The staff were super helpful.  The food in the cafÃ© is really good too!

Junior,5,"Troy University cares about education and anyone who desires to learn. Everyone from admissions, professors and other student help to make this experience of higher learning enjoyable. Being an older student it is a comfort to know that there are others who care about your desire ton grow as a person."
Sophomore,5,I had a great freshman year at Troy University. I am thankful for the scholarships that I have received through the university. I am also glad that students are immersed in their major during the very first semester so that they can make wise decisions about how to plan for future classes. I was very pleased with my dorm and dining facilities and am looking forward to returning to campus in August.
Freshman,5,As a first time college student at 25 I must say its been an absolute amazing experience. I'm an online student and they made it all so easy to understand all the way from admissions to the classes! I have no complaints and would highly recommend them.
Sophomore,5,"This college is a great college! Itâ€™s a perfect size for any student. Not too big nor too small. It is a D1 college, and they do all they can to help their students out."

The professors at Troy , will help you with any questions you have and will make you truly understand what is going on in their class.

Freshman,5,"I love how nice everyone has been, I'm not on the campus but I take online classes. The teachers are very helpful and help in anyway they can."
Junior,5,I love the campus and the class size. The campus and size is not to big and not to small. and that is excellent for some students.
Sophomore,5,I love Troy university its a small town but has a big college atmosphere.  Teachers are more active with students actually taking time out to make sure students understand lessons.  Hands on learning helps me learn easier than just sitting through lectures..
Senior,4,I completed my first 2 years completely online with Troy and I thought it was the best experience ever. The classes were easy yet challenging. However things have changed since COVID. But I can tell the professors and the school is doing everything that they can.
Junior,4,I recommend Troy university to anyone that wants an education on a flexible schedule.  Maybe its because I do better with online classes or because the instructors had habits of talking about whatever was on their mind and not the subject of the class they were teaching.
Sophomore,4,Very willing to help. Has one of the top online universities and provides resources for all students to be successful.
Sophomore,4,"I have enjoyed my time with Troy University. Administration has been helpful whenever I have needed them. All the classes I am taking are online, which is wonderful to be able to work around my work schedule. The set up is easy to use, and if you are unsure you can reach out for help. They are quick to respond back and walk you through whatever your needs may be."
Sophomore,4,"I love the flexibility that online classes give me. I am able to continue to work and do what I need to and keep up with my classes. I have enjoyed my time with Troy University, and look forward to moving on with my degree."
Freshman,4,"I have registered for a class online this summer, but it will be the first online class that I have signed up to take.  Due to COVID-19, classes were able to continue in an online format which was helpful.  I had a good experience with that although I still think it is not as effective as meeting in person."
Senior,4,"I love my campus. It is safe and diverse, a great place to continue educating after high school. The campus is beautiful and the professors genuinely seem to care about their students."
Senior,4,"Online classes went well for me. Troy makes it easy to go to school no matter where youâ€™re located. As long as you have internet, you can learn!"
Sophomore,4,Troy is a great Universisty. The campus is beautiful and easy to get around. All classes are centrally located. The students are very diverse from many places. Friendly and very safe. Professors are very good and take time to know their students by a first name basis.
Graduate Student,4,This is an accredited university with several campuses throughout Alabama and Georgia that offers a rigorous degree plan. In-state tuition is affordable and there a multitude of professors who bring their experiences into the teaching environment to expand the students' realm of knowledge.
Freshman,4,Troy is a great place to meet new people and explore things about yourself. It would just be nice to have more to do around Troy instead of just the campus.
Senior,4,"So far, I enjoy taking classes at Troy University (online). I feel just as comfortable as I would be in a live classroom session. I would however, change the amount of tuition for online classes to be less than $900. Iâ€™ve been to some pretty high ranked schools and their online tuition ran around $750. I personally think that the $1014 for online tuition per class is a bit steep."
Senior,4,"Troy shows a lot of promise, and there are some great people here. In the state of Alabama, itâ€™s probably one of the best schools for scholarships and ROI. However, it is still a small school in the rural South: it is behind on its diversity education programs, it has funding issues that affect faculty size and staff numbers, and it takes a while to drive to the cities that have more specialized shopping. Give careful consideration if the cost and location are right for you."
Sophomore,4,I like the academics of Troy. I've had some really amazing professors and I've learned so much already. I wish that the dorms were updated.
Junior,4,Troy is a great college. I love it because it allows me to stay close to home yet be able to obtain an education.
Niche User,4,"nothing keep it the same. I really like how their campus is sought up. i really like how the dorms are and how they look so nice and clean and the food is awesome, i like how where they are located its not to far and its not to close.Troy University is a school that not only cares about your education but also about your well-being. Staff is excellent in responding to you in an adequate amount of time. Troy is very flexible with your classes, and the cost is a lot cheaper than other colleges. I recommend Troy university to anyone that wants an education on a flexible schedule at a more affordable price."
Junior,4,I first attended Troy to be a part of the Cheer team.  I enjoy the small classes and smaller university feel that troy has.
Senior,4,"My favorite part of Troy is the faculty. The faculty are willing to help through various options. Most professors respond to questions efficiently. The professors provide an understanding of their expectations for each week. The classes are broke down into modules. Each week you will select a module and go through the instruction. Each week contains test, quizzes , and assignments.The classes size is great and promote a learning environment. Classmates are interactive and promote cohesive environment."
Graduate Student,4,Overall great experience. I have not complaints or issues with my experience. The city of Troy is a wonderful place to live and the community is very welcoming of university students. The campus is safe and very active in local organizations and events.
Sophomore,4,"As an online student attending Troy University I can say that their program is amazing! Not only are the professors understanding and do what they can to quickly answer any questions or worries, but the students involved in each online class are extremely helpful and all work together to help obtain a good grade in the class. In addition, there are a wide range of online classes for every major you are looking for."
Junior,4,"Troy University has truly allowed me to grow individually. Without the numerous opportunities provided to me by Troy, I would not be the person I am today."
Senior,4,"Troy University has allowed me to grow individually while expanding my horizons abroad. I am grateful for the various organizations I am a part of, as well as the incredible program I am a part of. Troy has pushed me to be my very best."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about TROY University is itâ€™s small campus. From a far it looks big, but once you get on the campus it is small. Also, their teacher to student ratio is excellent depending on the teacher you get. The dorms are not really that up to par, but they are in good condition for what you pay for. The food is good, and they have different varieties to choose from. Furthermore, you can make friends easily by finding people in your class or going to a party and meeting new people. What I would like to see change is how once you become and upperclassmen the points on your id go down. For example, as a freshmen you pick your meal plan, but once you become a sophomore or live off campus you have to find for yourself."
Niche User,4,I really enjoyed this school. Troy has a lot to offer for anyone willing to go there after high school. Troy University has an amazing campus and I love the way they show their school spirit with the custom T-shirts and everything.
Freshman,4,Troy University has been a great school to attend. The professors want to see you succeed and will help you if you ask.
Senior,4,Troy is a fair school. Troy is a fair school.Troy is a fair school.Troy is a fair school.Troy is a fair school.Troy is a fair school.Troy is a fair school.
Freshman,4,The classes are very manageable and the staff is extremely supportive I really recommend attending here
Niche User,4,"It's a great college. I'm a high school student, and I love doing band programs with them. They have a really nice setting too. It is really stunning. I know someone that goes there and they love it. I would love to go their one day as a college student. I also, love being there to support the Trojans."
Niche User,4,"I did a campus tour at Troy University and was very impressed. The campus is beautiful, the class rooms are a far size, and very nice housing options. The athletics departments seem great, students seem to be nice, and there is good variety of different ethnicity groups."
Junior,4,"I love that Troy has friendly people, great campus, and an awesome Education program. One thing I would like to change is the more activities to do for college students."
Freshman,4,"I like how small the campus is, you can walk across campus in about 15min, and if you don't like walking the buses run every 15 minutes. The dorms are nice and are kept very clean. The class sizes are pretty average. The area around campus is more rural, the closest mall is about an hour away. Overall the campus is nice and the value for the quality of education is worth it."
Senior,4,Its small enough to get a small time feeling but also big enough to get the university experience. Off campus entertainment is a big concern with limited options.
Sophomore,4,"I am a second year student at Troy and so far I have loved it. The majority of the professors are amazing and very helpful, but it's never a bad idea to check on rate my professor before picking professors. The campus is beautiful, clean, and feels very safe. It is a campus that feels like home."
Niche User,4,I really enjoyed the campus and class availability. But the administration was very lazy at their job. After meeting with the professors my mind was changed. They showed me a more in-depth version of the college.
Junior,4,I enjoyed it. The atmosphere is wonderful. Most important it assist with a career. It lead a strong interest in investing. The advice led me to start my own business.
Graduate Student,4,"I love Troy Dothan campus. Teachers are wonderful, curriculum is challenging but valuable. The only thing I would change is more parking."
Freshman,4,"Troy University is very beautiful campus and I knew it would be home the first time I toured. The diversity here is great and most of the students are positive about it all. The dorms are a little old and run down, but for the most part the are okay, nothing amazing. They have a pretty good choice in food, but there could be healthier options. Overall, though the university is great and I would definitely recommend it to my kids."
Freshman,4,There is an amazing atmosphere here at Troy. The one thing I would like to be different are the courses that use access codes. I feel that they are not as helpful because we do all our homework online and at home.
Sophomore,4,"Troy University is so diverse and a great home away from home. Although the academicians sports are not as high quality as larger, more popular schools, they are AMAZING. It is a little tough to make friends if a student is not greek, but it is no need to worry. The professors here are great and care about knowing you and having you succeed. I would highly recommend Troy to anyone looking for a college where they will thrive."
Sophomore,4,"The classes are more challenging than other colleges which I think is a good thing because I get more out of it.  It also is more expensive in my opinion, but I think you get more out of classes.  The financial aid office is hit or miss.  When I've called with problems, I have been hung up on, talked to like I was stupid, but other times got treated very nicely."
Senior,4,My experience at Troy University is very good. I enjoy interacting with different people from different places. We have students from different states and different countries. The food is good and have plenty of places to eat on and off campus. The size of the campus is perfect. its considered a medium size campus its not to big but not to small either. Everything is within a short walking distance. The athletics at Troy are really good. Our football team is good as well as our track and basketball team. There are many student activities to be involved in. Different organizations on campus host these activities. The local troy area is small but it is a nice area with fun things to do. The Professors are care about the students and enjoy what they do. you can tell that they enjoy the subject they are teaching.  The Troy campus has good police and security officers.. Safety is not an issue on the Troy campus.
Freshman,4,I love the academics as well as the other activities that the school as to offer such as the clubs and events.
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed my time at Troyâ€™s Montgomery campus. It is beautiful with its downtown location. The staff has been wonderful. I feel like some of the classrooms could use an update, especially the science labs."
Senior,4,Troy has a very local small town feel. Professors are of above average quality but if you want a superb educational experience then the student must pursue it.
Senior,4,The professors at Troy go out of their way to ensure that students grasp the material and are there whenever help is needed.
Freshman,4,I love how diverse Troy University is. The teachers are helpful and are willing to help you succeed in the areas that you may lack in.
Freshman,4,I think Troy is a very good school for young adults to learn n get a good education. Troy offer good education n have great teacher.
Sophomore,4,My experience with Troy has been wonderful. There is open communication and directions for anything you may not understand. I do hope to see a change in the scholarship application process. It would be a lot easier if it was just one site not two different departments.
Sophomore,4,"I love Troy, I have only had a few professors I did not love and the campus is very clean and beautiful. My only complaint would be the lack of student housing as well as the lack of parking. The university is currently building a new fitness center, however, I am certain most people would have preferred this space went to parking or more living space."
Junior,4,troy is a great school.  i wish they offered more majors and scholarships.  they are always building something new and for that they raise tuition which is really annoying.  hopefully they renovations and new facilities will pay off.
Junior,4,I've been at Troy for three years now and I fell in love with the campus as soon as I started my tour as a high school senior. The campus is not too big and its not too small. Its the perfect size University for anyone that is from a small town like I am. Our physics department is the only complaint I would have with Troy. The teachers aren't the best but they are trying to make it better. But other than that the campus is beautiful and I would not want to continue my education anywhere else.
Junior,4,My overall experience here at Troy University has been very mind changing! I like the fact that Troy U is a diverse school filled with opportunities and high expectations of the students! One thing that I hope to change is to have more outreach programs and minority organizations involved on the campus !
Graduate Student,4,Troy has been a good fit for my life. The online classes allow me to attend class in my hometown and the weekend format is very helpful.
Senior,4,I love the staff and all the educators. I am glad I chose Troy to pursue my bachelors degree in Hospitality. I was a bit nervous about going back to school in my late 40s but Troy made the transition a great experience. I am looking forward to graduation soon. I would definitely recommend Troy to anyone that is looking for a great school to attend.
Alum,4,"Troy University fits well with my flexible schedule. The online degrees provide working adults with the opportunity to complete their degree at their own pace.  The instructors are well knowledgable in the content of the core classes, and encourage students to develop and grow."
Freshman,4,My experience with Troy was very good. Its very easy to get around the campus once you learn it. Classes are easy to find. The dorms stay neat and clean. I loved my semester at troy. They have this Trojan center that has great restaurants in there. you get great service too. Troy had many great activities and events for you to participate in.
Junior,4,Troy University is a big university with home town appeal.  The teachers work with you to ensure you know the material.  Administration is helpful and kind.  There are so many different types of students and activities.  I wouldn't go anywhere else.
Senior,4,"I enjoy the fact that you can enroll in Troy on-line. This is very important to me because I work full-time. I can contact my instructor when I need help with my lesson, In addition to being able to contact some instructor on week ends. I have had very good experience with Troy University, The staff in admission office always seem to help me if I have any problems. The Financial  aid office staff also assist me when I have a problem receiving my financial aid."
Junior,4,"Troy University is a great institution, they are very organized, helpful, and efficient. They offer a wide range of courses and everything can easily be accessed online. While attending Troy as an online student, I have really felt like I belonged and was a part of the student population. The instructors are always very helpful and they also reply the same day, even on weekends. The only complaint I have is my Student Advisor is very difficult to get a hold of and will typically send my to someone else instead of helping me herself."
Junior,4,"Love the school atmosphere including the beautiful campus, class sizes, and helpful faculty. Improvement needed when it comes to off campus activities, there is not much for college students to do outside of school."
Sophomore,2,There is nothing to do. They are always accepting new students and kicking the old ones out and making them get apartments. The worst thing about that is I'm in band and we are required to move in weeks early and they do not care about us.
College Junior,2,Our athletics are horrible. We need more determined athletes and coaches.
College Junior,2,"The thing that annoys me about my school it that some professors don't really care what happens to their students as they are tenured and see no way that their students grade will threaten their jobs. They are not helpful outside of class and just make you memorize for the lectures, they don't actually teach. Now some professors here are the exact opposite and it shows as they are the ones that classes always fill up the quickest and are always talked about at school."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I am in the military, and the school drew my attention because it was supposedly flexible for military personals, but I got my first C when I was on orders. Some teachers do not respect military orders."
College Sophomore,2,They were quite a few robberies on campus this semester.
College Sophomore,2,"My school is beautiful, the location is not the best but I love the feel of being in a small town it brings. My freshman year was okay. I wish the classes were more rigorous and challenging, I feel like I never left high school. The Greek system takes up almost all of the community, making it very uncomfortable to not be a part of it. Something really neat about my school is all of the international students and meeting people from all over the world. But, starting my second year here, we have 4,000 parking spots for over 7,000 students. The staff at the financial aid office are not helpful, and I am quite frankly ready to get out of here. I would not have gone here if I could do it all over again."
College Senior,2,"The apartments nearest the campus are either expensive or in need of repair. Many older homes have been converted into apartment further away from campus.  Some are decent, others are falling apart; most are in less than ideal neighborhoods. The lower-cost off-campus housing tends to attract these who want the freedom to party at home, which can be an issue for those living there that prefer to not party during the week."
College Senior,2,"Do your own research. Very little is explained. Ask questions, but be prepared to be blown off or treated as a ""problem-child"" if you aren't easily ""handled.""  Preference is given to incoming freshmen. As a senior, several of my friends have had their aid dropped for reasons that don't make sense."
College Sophomore,2,"We do not have very many options. I know this is a small town, but we like to eat! Never really good service, and the same four foods get really old. Always go to Montgomery or Dothan."
College Sophomore,2,There aren't a lot of options.
College Freshman,2,All the frat houses are behind my apartment and on Thursday nights they blare the loudest music. It's annoying.
College Freshman,2,I'm not a fan of the Greek life kids. They don't act like adults but like a bunch of wild teenagers that party every chance they get. Also I'm not a fan of a local identity of a group. Every girl in most fraternity's dress just alike and act just a like. There is no individualism but pressure to fell and look up to standard with the rest of the group. It like a house of a bunch of lemmings do what all the other lemmings do. They need to be themselves and act mature and stop doing drugs.
College Freshman,2,There are few choices. They close at 9pm.
College Sophomore,2,The school has their criteria. I feel like they need to  just go by the fafsa report and they don't always do that.
College Senior,2,"This is my last semester before I graduate, but unfortunately, I cannot afford to finish.  I don't have any more college assistant funds. This is why I need as many scholarships as possible."
College Junior,2,"Where I come from, it is respectful to not support the team, no matter what. At Troy, the students do not support the football team, but rather they degrade them. That kind of negativity does not make for a good athletic environment. In other words, the school spirit definitely needs to improve."
College Junior,2,There isn't much to do in Troy regarding attractions and activities. Troy however is great to simply earn a degree.
College Sophomore,2,There really isn't much to do in our town. It pretty much extends throughout the highway with fast food left and right. If you have lived there long enough I suppose you could find things to do that maybe knew comers don't know about. I drive an hour away just to go to the mall and do the major grocery shopping.
College Sophomore,2,only offer a variety of food on certain days.
College Senior,2,"The guys and girls at the school are so stereotypical, it's kinda sad. They all dress alike and sound the same, it sometimes difficult to tell them apart."
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of international students. IMO, they are not treated as well as the locals. Very poor support for international students."
College Junior,2,"Nightlife at my school is slim to none. Unfortunately, the town is very small and there are not many places to hang out or go out to at night. There is no bowling alley, not many bars, no clubs, and few hip restaurants for students to hang out. A bowling alley, skating rink, mini-golf, or the like would greatly help the atmosphere of the town."
College Freshman,2,I wish I had realized how few quality places there are to eat off campus before I enrolled.
College Freshman,2,Campus administration is too concerned with money making opportunities such as parking tickets and dorm fines to worry about actual problems.
College Freshman,2,"On campus housing at Troy is simply a way to coat the pocketbooks of those in high places. It is low quality for the price, with no amenities."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't hardly anything off campus for students to do. Also, shopping for anything a college student would want in Troy is a joke."
College Sophomore,2,Everybody is either really hot or really not. The gray area people are screwed.
College Sophomore,2,Student athletic facility is very small. Most dorms need to be rebuilt as well as academic buildings.
College Sophomore,2,If it wasn't for Troy University's campus in Troy there would be nothing in Troy.
College Sophomore,2,"There needs to be a clean house in the football department. Everybody in control is complacent of where the program is. The last time Troy went to a bowl game I was a freshman. A good student crowd comes to the games every week but everyone leaves before the game is over because it is usually decided already by halftime who is going to win, and it isn't us."
College Freshman,2,"I have not had to use any computers on campus besides when I took a computer class so I am not sure how good others are. The ones I used in the computer lab were nice and I had no problems with them. The internet connection at Troy, however, is horrible. I constantly have to re-login to my account and I lose connection in the library."
College Sophomore,2,Troy Internet is the worse.
College Sophomore,2,"Peer pressure is bad in Greek life, but all us GDI's don't care if you're a partier or a hermit, we know how to have fun without all that."
College Junior,2,The wifi never works for me.
College Junior,2,We do not have any unless you are going to classes.
College Freshman,2,The weather here is very bi-polar. I changes day to day.
College Freshman,2,"Troy is a small town, so there is certainly not much to do. The only place to really shop for groceries is Walmart and the supply there is normally terrible. All in all, there is not much to do around Troy."
College Freshman,2,it was a huge headache and time consuming
College Freshman,2,not enough parking for all students
College Freshman,2,I have seen worse at other schools. I don't particiapate in the drinking on campus and I wish others did not either. 
College Junior,2,Parking can be a nightmare especially when there is a football game. The cost of a parking decal is pretty expensive and you get a ticket if you park on campus without one.
College Freshman,2,"You have to make your fun here in Troy. All dining areas you could think of, we have. Although the shopping is limited. 45 minutes to the nearest malls. 45 to Montgomery or 45 minutes to Dothan, but take a couple of friends and you'll have a great time."
College Senior,2,"It's ok...depending on the time and day it is, or the type of activity."
College Freshman,2,"It rains ever other day here, and my classes are far from my dorm so if I do not have an umbrella then I'm rained on. classes are hardly ever canceled due to rain, so it's best to have rain boots because the campus has slight floods when it rains."
College Freshman,2,"The drug scene at Troy is kind of bad, It is suppose to be a smoke free city, yet people smoke on the back of the dorms all the time."
Recent Alumnus,2,"When it's hot, it's hot.  When it is cold, it is miserable."
College Junior,2,Very few places that are not fast food or chains. But there is enough choices that it is tolerable.
College Junior,2,Nothing but the same fast food restaurants.  The food is very fattening and unhealthy.
College Junior,2,"I've just been using loans, and my debt is piling up so I decided to finally try scholarship sites and such.  I can't exactly grade Troy's financial aid as they've not offered anything."
College Senior,2,"Limited, crowded, booting is a problem for visitors, little security, needs renovation, not enough parking for students and visitors."
College Junior,2,I would do this program again.  My goal is to become Psychologist w/ a nursing degree
College Sophomore,2,"I plan to have an internship, though Troy doesn't offer much help getting one."
College Sophomore,2,Courses are fun and easy. Disappointed with major options.
College Sophomore,2,It's Troy. They are expanding and selection has been better over recent years.
College Freshman,2,Troy University is one of the cheapest tuition for a college in AlabamaThe dorms on Troy campus are a bit old and the guys dorm are rodent infested. Some redeeming qualities though are the on campus apartments that are really great. The perks of being on campus are the great food places on campus. Boars Head is the best and they are super close to the dorms.
College Junior,2,Finacial aid is not a simple task. I recieved a very minimal amount of finacial aid which led to me finding outside resources to find aid. I suggest you call or visit the office daily because they do not do a great job with updating you on what forms they have recieved or need.
College Junior,2,Greek life at the Troy is exciting but it does not dominate the campus experience. There are a few events that the greek organizations hold that excited the campus.
College Freshman,2,The cops do not care a bit in the world about underage drinking.
College Sophomore,2,"You will pretty much need your own vehicle to go anywhere off campus and you will walk on campus  because there are no campus buses, but it is doable.  You just get a lot of exercise."
College Freshman,2,"If you live on campus, do not leave campus during the day unless you absolutely must! Park your car at night and leave it there until the class rush is over! If you live off-campus, get to campus 30 minutes early at least in order to find a spot! The campus police will ticket you if you park in a lot that doesn't match your decal color, so get there early to find a spot so you aren't late for class!"
College Junior,1,I never heard anyone mention Greek life while in college.
College Senior,1,"They do not help you, They do not offer help when you ask, the entire process they take their sweet sweet time. I thought they were there to help me???"
College Senior,1,I am ready to get away from this place and never come back this school doesn't  care about us
College Sophomore,1,"I grew up in Europe, of course to me nothing else can compare! However, even in Troy I still go to different cities to enjoy a night out because there really aren't many places to go and enjoy some drinks, otherwise it's just overcrowded."
College Senior,1,The Greek system...I can't even with them
College Senior,1,"Sadly people may say that we are diverse and all accepting, which to somewhat true, but most people would avoid you like the plague if you are different"
College Senior,1,"The marketing major have absolutely nothing to offer, internship or job opportunity wise."
College Senior,1,"People only supports football, so all other sports are pushed back. We have trouble getting people to come to baseball games, and we give free tickets away....."
College Senior,1,There's absolutely nothing to do outside of school activities. It can be depressing at times and make anyone wanna leave the town just to get away.
College Junior,1,"The off-campus options are worse than the on-campus options. There is only fast food chains and restaurants with fried southern food. There are a few places that claim to be Chinese. However, there are no options for vegetarian or vegan. Late night options are also near none. There is two fast food restaurants that I can think of that serve food late at night."
College Freshman,1,Parking at Troy is very inconvenient most of the time. I live on campus so I haven't had to experience trying to find a parking spot in the morning yet. The parking lot for my dorm is extremely small. Parking on sorority hill definitely beats any parking problems anywhere. The university needs to pave it immediatly.
College Sophomore,1,"There is very Little parking for commuters, and the color system should, instead be different colors, be 3 different colors. 1. for Faculty, 2. for On-Campus living, and 3. for Off-Campus living."
College Junior,1,They are so old and not enough.
College Freshman,1,"The food tastes bad, and it is always the same stuff."
College Freshman,1,Troy University doesn't have a wide enough variety of scholarships.
College Junior,1,"I am at the off campus Troy University site in Orlando, FL and there is no security personnel. Classes end pretty late so students are left watching out for each other... If anyone waits for you to get to your car at all."
College Senior,1,"The parking situation on campus is horrible. You have to get on campus about 20 minutes before your class start to find a parking space. I have a Troy University tag, so I get my permit sticker for free. I've gotten a couple of tickets because at the nursing building you have very limited parking spaces since they are building two dorm rooms right next to the nursing building. If you live off campus, you most definitely need a car to get around in."
College Sophomore,1,"Finding parking spots at Troy can be difficult, if you are not there early whether you live in dorms or off campus."
College Senior,1,"Nightlife in Troy... Hilarious!!!! There are a few bars, but it's only fun when packed (which is rare) and when you're with a lot of friends."
College Sophomore,1,There is not very much activity if any on campuse at night.
College Sophomore,1,"I am now an expert stalker thanks to Troy's horrible parking situation. We all call others we know are getting off campus to take their spots and have followed others as they walk in the parking lot to get their spot. Every and anyone can park in a spot, so it is every car for themselves. Campus police is friendly enough to always correct us with a parking ticket to make sure we know the prowling for a spot is necessary."
College Sophomore,1,"I've been with Troy University, for 2 courses. And each time the school year starts, we have the same problems (as far as my) financial aid. No matter how far in advance I try to make sure (all the paperwork has been taking care) they seem to always find a glitch. So, instead of them contacting the student, they let the student account remain 'Inactivity' until the student calls to check on his or her account, instead of trying to help the student resolve their account."
College Freshman,1,Parking on campus is HORRIBLE. There are not near enough parking spots!!
College Sophomore,1,Parking is ridiculous. There is never any room for parking. Everybody is fighting for the next parking spot. You can get tickets for anything. Whenever people are almost late for class after searching 20 minutes for a parking spot they decide to just find a spot but it is not in their territory to park so they get tickets. We can get tickets for just about anything
Recent Alumnus,1,"Don't Bother â€“ No one who goes here is looking for a relationship, just an education. The majority are already married with families."
College Freshman,1,Worst School Ever â€“ Administration NEVER answers their phones or responds to e-mails. I've called several times while sitting outside watching the people sit there doing nothing. I walk in and they seem annoyed that they have to actually do their job. They also never inform the students of anything until after they already start them or do things last minute and it's ridiculous. They also find every way possible to screw you out of as much money as they can.
College Freshman,1,"No Availability and Poor Faculty â€“ What can I say? Class availability is a joke. I am contracting a philosophy minor and at the end of this semester (my third), I will have half the credits I need for that and still only ONE for my major course of study (psychology). The worst part of that is there is only one philosophy professor. The reason I've not gotten further is that statistics, a prerequisite for most upper-level psychology courses, used to be offered only once per year, as in ONE CLASS total all year. I've been unable to get into it since day one and so now this semester, I'm only taking 4 credit hours. I hear more and more of students who cannot graduate on time due to the lack of availability in classes. Just yesterday, my girlfriend was doing financial aide stuff and I overheard another student trying very hard to coax information out of them about her financial aide as she had to switch to on-line classes because she could not graduate on time and only had a few left that she couldn't get into."
College Freshman,1,"Ridiculously Homogenised and Stupid â€“ Like any college campus, the vast majority of students (especially age 18-25) are Libertarians who worship Ron Paul. That's just the way it is and has nothing to with the school - you find that all across America. The problem I have is that only a handful actually care about education. These students, like many others, celebrate with a weekend of drinking for barely scoring a D. They're generally loud and disrespectful. Walking into any living place on or off campus that has a significant number of students is like walking onto the set of The Jersey Shore."
College Freshman,1,"Out of Date and Useless â€“ Very few computers that are general access for students have word processors. What computers do have them are in closed labs. Some of these labs are open and not well supervised and a student that is not in that department or doing the work necessary to use them can go in and use those without getting caught, though technically it is against the rules."
College Freshman,1,"Everything Is Closed â€“ I am a night-owl but I don't participate in the typical night activities of partying or clubbing. The night life is essentially a bunch of students acting like idiots in the sorority or fraternity houses, getting drunk. If you want to do anything else outside of that, your only option is Taco Bell until 2 am."
College Freshman,1,"I Never Have, but Have Seen and Heard Horror Stories â€“ Well, the wireless Internet is constantly down, which is bad when most courses require papers to be turned in and the campus library has no word processors on any computers. Some of these must be done on-line and with the library being packed with tons of students checking their Facebook pages, the only option for the ones who care is to do it on their own laptop computers. On top of this, I know for a fact Paden House flooded (do to the school's poor planing and lack of care for run-off) and they did absolutely nothing to fix the problem but replace the carpet. In the basement, you can clearly smell the mould underneath it and in the walls. Many other dorms are in horrid conditions and they're now building new ones. The worst problem is the majority of students who get kicked out of their dorms for no reason, just to make room for new students. Living on campus is extremely expensive from what I hear and requires other unnecessary purchases, such as a more expensive meal plan."
College Freshman,1,"Horrible and Inconsistent â€“ Where to begin. First, they have forms you can fill out to complain about different aspects or leave comments. They only choose to display those that they can bend to fit their needs and respond with highly illogical arguments and enough fallacies to make Wittgenstein roll in his grave. For example, one such comment was that availability of things and consistency is extremely poor and how many things remain constantly broken. Their response was that the ice machines don't work properly and they have to manually refill them. This does not even begin to address any of the other inconsistencies and broken equipment and unavailability of items, which they chose to ignore."
College Senior,1,Troy University is lacking in the parking spaces that they have available. their are more students than there is parking available.
College Senior,1,"There is a great deal of diversity at troy university, unfortunately there is also a great deal of racism and clicks. although there is diversity there is not a great deal of cross cultural relationships and friendships."
College Junior,1,Troy has no type of nightlife the police are way too strict to be in a college town.
College Sophomore,1,The IT Department Is Awful â€“ The IT department at is rude and they could really do a better job at fixing the internet problems.
College Junior,1,"My apartment has had litterally hundreds of roaches and when we spoke to the management, they kind of blew it off."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is a big deal. A lot of students live off campus and have to drive around for ten minutes trying to find somewhere to park. Even the students who live on campus have to park out in the middle of nowhere sometimes. And heaven forbid if you park somewhere you're not supposed to, or you have your mom's car because yours is broke down. They are merciless and will give you a ticket in a heartbeat. And if you don't pay attention and you get multiple tickets, you'll get a boot, and then you'll get towed."
College Freshman,1,"Freshmans have the worst parking. There are only like two spots on campus that we can park in and we have to walk long distances to class.On top of that they give ridiculous tickets, I got one for ""backing into a parking space"" because they ""can't see my decal"" ...."
College Senior,1,"Student Center â€“ I feel that the student center should be of service to the Graduates as well as the undergraduates.  The reason being is because there are some students that have been out of school for some years and they decide to go back to pursue a graduates degree and they too may need assistance sometimes; but becaue of them being of a graduate status, they don't assist you at all.  I don't believe that is fair."

Sophomore,5,"A small campus almost feels like a home. Academics are great, the professors are very helpful and easy to talk to. It has lots of resources, like tutoring, help with studying, and a writing center. So many clubs to be apart of. If you don't have a club that interests you, you can make your own. The campus is clean, safe, and beautiful. Our athletics are decent, we do not have a football team though. The food is catered in and has a good variety."

I was invited to tour the campus as soon as I could, at my convenience. My Admissions Representative was extremely nice and informative. Every question or concern was answered. I was highly concerned over what UMO could offer me financially due to having a family that cannot easily support me. The Admissions Representative promised to try to get as much help for me as possible so I would be able to attend. Within a week of applying, I was accepted with a financial package! I toured the campus and it was absolutely beautiful! I would recommend this University to anyone interested in a private school with a beautiful campus and amazing staff!"

Freshman,5,"Everyone I have interacted with from the professors to advisors has been wonderful.  I just completed my first semester at the RTP campus.  The classes are 5 weeks which for a working adult makes it a bit challenging.  However, the professors have responded to e-mails quickly.  My advisor is very helpful and easy to get along with."

Senior,4,Bring back seated adult options. If you are goint to continue with aligning with all the other online schools lower tuition to be competitive.
Freshman,4,I have enjoyed my experience so far at the University of Mount Olive. They have a wide range of classes you can take and various major degree choices. The only thing that I wish could change was the high cost of tuition.

Senior,4,"Mount Olive is a wonderful school for working adults and students who like small classes.  Mostly, they work with you and are interested in your overall best."

Alum,4,"It is a very flexible school. I was able to go to class on base, on campus and online. The military affiliated personnel on staff had great communication skills and acted swiftly when it came to issues. I appreciated the professionalism and respect for my time. The classes were tough. If you take a 5 or 10 week class, do not expect a freebie. There will be 16 weeks work of work done in that time. If you cannot learn fast, I suggest you stick to 10-16 week classes so you have more time to absorb the material. Lastly, the professors all seemed to be willing to help and work with you during and outside of office hours."
Freshman,4,The University of Mount Olive has many satellite locations besides there main campus within eastern N.C.! The class sizes are small and the instructors genuinely care for student success! You'll always see a smiling face at ANY Campus!

Mount Olive."
College Freshman,4,Career Services actively seeks to insure that everyone graduates with a job.

College Junior,4,"When I decided to go back to college after 6+ years of being out, I never imagined that I would have the experience like I am having at UMO.  I have not had the best track record with my education career, but UMO makes it easy to succeed. Small classes allow our professors to get to know us individually and what we need in order to succeed.  The staff is personable and friendly and they really go out of their way to make sure every students needs are met.  Although the tuition is high, it is so worth it to pay the extra money and have such a personal and pleasurable experience at this school! Thank you so much!!"

Gym could be bigger but this is a small school so that is expected"

College Junior,4,They will work with you to get what you need. GET SCHOLARSHIPS OR GRANTS!!! They really do help.

College Junior,4,I enjoy being in my program of study which is Business Management. It has showed me how to prepare for entrepreneurship and independence of business ethics.
College Junior,4,Getting into the program is easy and understandable. Challenges that i encountered was getting all my hours on time. Theres no abnormal admission. When start the admission process be clear of what you want and have an open mind. Take a major and a minor to have extra under you belt for graduating puposes.
College Junior,4,You just have to know which RA's care and which RA's dont. If you aren't stupid about it you won't have anything to worry about..
College Junior,4,If you are social enough you can find what you need. Underage drinking is never a problem until cops show up to a party and then you just leave the party.
College Junior,4,Pretty much one party every weekend. Most students are athletes so they have to respect who is in season. No pressure to go out but it is prob the only perks of Mount Olive College.
College Junior,4,Simple. Easy. Lot of opportunity for scholarships and work study.
College Freshman,4,You have wifi pretty much everywhere in the campus. The speed is ok
College Freshman,4,Students are forbidden to drink alcohol in campus.
College Junior,4,Parking is great because I live at the Inn where there are plenty of parking spots but at the girls dorm it can get crowded. Every where else is ok.

College Junior,4,This college makes me feel at home and peaceful.
College Junior,4,"Campus safety ride around all the time but they are more there for you if you need them. They are nice and have no problem coming right to you, now that there are more of them."
College Freshman,4,"It's not high school anymore. Couses are outline in the beginning. If you don't get it done, it's your fault. There is no reminder the day before. The professors are great and forgiving. They offer assistance when needed. I get my best studying done in the library. It is too loud on the dorm floor."
Freshman,2,My experience wasn't that good. I didn't feel like the campus had any schools activities. It is a family campus but there isn't noting to do around the campus. Things are far away and you have to drive about an hour to actually go do something fun.
College Freshman,2,"It is very difficult finding schoalrships for the college.  Financial aid said there is a link on the website, but I have not been able to locate it."
College Junior,2,I gerenally stay away from this stuff
College Freshman,2,i don't think we have a Greek life
College Junior,2,The town uses our school more than we do and it becomes inconvenient to the students. If there is an event in our dinning hall we will have to do a take out dinner while they prep for a full course meal for someone else.
College Junior,2,Art Majors only has 3 teachers to teach the entire art department classes. They are friendly teachers but a lot of busy work. Waste of time. Wish I went to a different school for art.
College Freshman,2,We do not have anything special about Greek here.
College Freshman,2,you have absolutely nothing to do around here. you should go somewhere else for party if you have a car
College Freshman,2,It is really diverse here. And there are not many types of welcoming for international
College Junior,2,The food isn't that good until the Holiday's come around like Thanksgiving and Christmas
College Junior,2,There is nothing to do unless you like hanging out at the Wal-mart across the street. There is no football team but the school supports all it's other sporting events. They have concerts but the artists do not interest me. There needs to be a better variety of artist to perform
College Junior,2,I haven' heard much about Greek Life on campus. I haven't even seen the housing for it or know anyone who is apart of Greek life.
College Freshman,2,"The drug scene at Mount Olive College is not really big. The only kind of drug  I see is alcohol. Other than that, I do not see anything else. However, peer pressure depends on the group of people or ""clique"" someone hangs out with."
College Freshman,2,The town is tiny. Mount Olive is most famous for the pickle company in town. There isn't much to do here at all but if you have good friends you will be fine. If you want to do something you usually have to drive to Goldsboro which is about 15 miles away and thats usually a lot of fun.
College Freshman,2,"It has been a real hassle. They don't update you very well on what's going on, or let you know if you have things not being paid monthly. They tell you when you have a week left in the semster and then you have to pay everything at once or you can't live on campus anymore. They didn't even notify me how much my fasfa had given them so I was stuck paying thousands more than I had intended. Every year they raise the price of tuition as well so it gets more and more difficult to pay for it."
College Sophomore,2,"Financial aid assistance needs improvement. The staff is usualy rude and often misguides you. Also, the on-line site is never updated."
College Sophomore,2,Not to Big on Greek – Since we are a small school we are not to big on greek life. Mount Olive College is all about sports.
College Freshman,2,"Drinking on Campus – Mount Olive is a dry-campus, so drinking isn't allowed. Students aren't allowed to be intoxicated on campus either. Although there are rules to prevent this, it still happens on campus. Each student can have up to three alcohol violations, before asked to leave campus."
Freshman,1,Online classes were not as expected. I didn't feel like I could get to my professors and get my work I needed
Alum,1,Myself & several others are ashamed of our Alma-mater UOM. The staff told me God is possibly female. It's presented as a Christian school; but UOM is definitely a religious institution. Not recommended to learn Christianity.
Sophomore,1,"I spent my first two years of college at UMO. I had a terrible experience. Not only were the admissions staff disorganised, they didn’t seem to know what was going on half of the time. The university offers little opportunity to be social as it is at least 20 minutes drive from anywhere. The grading by teachers is very inconsistent making it unpredictable. The college is daylight robbery, terrible investment. I have decided to transfer to a larger school, and never want to see this place again."
College Junior,1,I dont party at all
Recent Alumnus,1,"Fast food: mcdonalds, burger king, wendys, taco bell/KFC, subway

Pizza: Trios (the best and very good/ under $7 for a pizza), pizza village their pizza is okay but other food options are better

Two ""Chinese"" food places in town, yummy oriental is the better one. $4 for a meal when take out

Ribeys downtown is the best place in town: $8 for hamburger"
College Freshman,1,There are not many options for you to choose around the campus.
College Freshman,1,"If you are not athlete, you are a nerd. People can be nice today, may be not tomorrow."
College Junior,1,We do not have Greek Life at Mount Olive College...
College Junior,1,"The unique thing about the facilities is that there is only the Pope Wellness center which has a fitness room, locker rooms, a basketball court which can be turned into a volleyball court and a room where classes are held for yoga or zumba. Academic programs are good. "
College Junior,1,I don't go to clubs but I know people who do and they get together in groups and go out. The places are far you would have to leave Mount Olive to go to the clubs.
College Sophomore,1,The cost of living on campus is very expensive.
College Freshman,1,"Transportation is poor. I have my car on campus due to a part time job, so it doesn't affect me very much. There are many students from out of state and out of the country. It is very difficult for them."
College Freshman,1,The parking lots are very small but parking is free for students as long as you have a parking pass.
College Sophomore,1,"Every person on campus has a pair of rain boots. When it rains even a little here, the campus side walks flood for days."

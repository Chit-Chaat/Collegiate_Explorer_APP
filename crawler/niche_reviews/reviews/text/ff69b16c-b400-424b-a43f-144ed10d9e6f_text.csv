Junior,5,"The experience at Lehigh Valley is amazing, the faculty is always at hand. There are always people around to help welcome you in the building as well as to assist to find classrooms. The small campus allows the college experience you want with the educational support you need. The atmosphere is positive and the students are always joyful. Great place to get a four-year degree without breaking the bank!"
Niche User,5,Their school is amazing for a smaller sized school and they are very lenient when it comes to student interactions and very humble.
Freshman,5,Wouldn't mind for the campus to expand a little and be a bigger building. Would also appreciate more sports offered and more activities that involves trips to elsewhere. Pep rally NEEDS heavy improvement.
Junior,5,"Penn State Lehigh Valley is a small school, therefore, you get to know almost everyone in your class rather quickly and really well. Also, the 1 on 1 help from the teacher's is great.  Except Chem is really hard for no reason here.
          I would recommend this school to students that have a low college tuition budget and stick to the 2+2 to get your general classes out of the way rather than wasting money on dorming at Main. The vibe doesn't feel too much like college but instead a highschool 2.0 but if you're looking for a fresh start out of highschool this is the place to be everyone on campus is very friendly including the staff!"
Freshman,5,"I enjoy the commuter campus setting because smaller class sizes are more personable, especially for adult learners who have to juggle work, family life, and studies. The faculty is professional and yet closer to the student body, and the ability to attend a diverse course load locally that works around life schedules."
Sophomore,5,Small commuter school. Offers excellent classes to get started at Penn State.  You can graduate from this location for some majors.  Computer Engineering requires that you finish at University Park.  Classes are challenging and professors are approachable and caring.
Senior,5,"A great small campus located in the Lehigh Valley, which offers students many different opportunities to grow as a student here."
Freshman,5,"This is is my freshman year. This school is in a good environment and it's located right across the street from a shopping mall. The school also provides daily events for students to come enjoy free food and get involved. The staff is also willing to gladly help you with anything. For example, I went to career services to help me redo my resume. I scheduled an appointment with them and they went above and beyond helping me with my resume. If you are having trouble with a class they provide you with free tutoring. You can tell that they care about there students and want to help them get the most out of college."
Sophomore,5,"The opportunities whether academic or extra curriculum, are great and lead to better leadership skills and experience. The retreats and the relationships with the advisors and the staff is great especially when you are transitioning from high school. This campus has brought a lot of joy and learning to my academic life."
Freshman,5,I like the clubs. It has a positive atmosphere unlike high school. The faculty and staff are always helpful.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this little university. With the ability of 3D printers, libraries, mac rooms, one button studios, gyms, a pool across the street, a small gift shop/bookstore and a small cafe as well as a large supporting help when you need extra tutoring just completes this college. I had the opportunity to go to either main campus or here and I found it really beneficial to stay down here. With such a small campus and every close nit with the teachers, everyone is super friendly and the facility is quite clean always with a lot of student life."
Niche User,5,"Penn State Lehigh Valley is a very diverse school, and offers a ton of majors and help with academics. Penn State University as a whole is even more amazing offering tons of programs and extra curriculars."
Senior,5,A great school with great teachers. It's a small campus but that's what makes it more special. It's much easier to get help and get to know people at a smaller campus.
Junior,5,"Penn State Lehigh Valley offered the prestigious education that you'd expect from Penn State, as well as individual attention from professors that may only be available at a branch. Many opportunities that were available to me at the Lehigh Valley campus would have been much harder to come by at University Park, such as a job as a Peer Tutor. Being the smallest Penn State branch, there was a tight-knit community feeling at this campus both inside and outside of the classroom."
Freshman,5,"You all will absolutely love it here. Their new student orientation and accepted student programs is such a marvelous way of making you feel comfortable in their environment. The staff is friendly. In short, you'll feel like family, and you'll feel like you belong."
Alum,5,"The staff at Penn State Lehigh Valley are very nice. They all care about you and they will answer your questions and explain anything you need in details. 
I would not change anything."
Sophomore,5,I am a sophomore at PSULV and I will be transferring to University Park in the fall. This school has really helped my transition from high school to college and the staff is very helpful. I am sure that they will make my transition to University Park just as seamless
Junior,5,"I believe Penn State has a lot to offer. From a wide range of clubs to many different sports to choose from. Also, they take their academics very seriously, they are always willing to help anyone with kind words, and meetings."
Sophomore,5,If you are looking for a great state school close to home where you can get to know your peers and professors then this is a great school.
Freshman,5,"There are a lot of free things at penn state lehigh valley and a lot of cheap activities. Many activities during the weeks with often free food keeping students busy. Very diverse mostly white but a big ethnic population. I had one issues with a bad proffesor, I wasn't the only one but the university listened and they took care of him while the other proffesors have been amazing!"
Junior,4,"Very easy to get your work done and the majority of your sources are already layed out for you. Professors and staff usually get back to you, for whatever reason, in a timely manner through a meeting or an email."
Senior,4,Penn State Lehigh Valley has an amazing staff that is always willing to help.  This is an overall accepting presence from students and faculty.  The only thing you have to do is ask and everyone is willing to go that extra mile for you.
Sophomore,4,Great to get general education requirements out of the way. Low cost and professors are very helpful. Small classroom size with good faculty student ratio. Great way to get use to college.
Sophomore,4,"Penn State Lehigh Valley is a great school for local students who want a great education from a great name while staying near to home. The professors are caring, challenging, and make class genuinely interesting. As an adult learner I am more than happy that I chose Penn State (Lehigh Valley) as my college to finish off my degree."
Junior,4,"They have events for students every week. Most of them have free food and games, and it gives students a chance to make friends. You can also becomevery involved with the campus and learn more about it. The professors are also very polite and helpful. They understand that everyone has a life outside of the campus and can be very leinient with grades if you talk to them about any issues you have.  If you need extra time with a project, tell them and they will do their best to help you out."
Sophomore,4,Nice small campus with professors that will help you in any circumstances. Classs are a very nice size to learn in. A fair price for a good education.
Senior,4,The professors are amazing and care about the students.  Convient location and I love the over-all atmosphere!
College Junior,4,I enjoy the small classrooms and helpful teachers.
Recent Alumnus,4,Improvement needed but overall great campus.
College Freshman,4,Follow the rules and it's pretty easy going.
College Freshman,4,I had little issue with financial aid department
College Junior,4,I love the small class size
College Junior,4,I wish they had more variety for humanities
College Junior,4,I love my major.  Many occupation options avail.
College Sophomore,4,The only on campus food we have is a little concession stand type set-up called The Den.  There is a huge variety of options and each one of them is delicious.
College Sophomore,4,We are an extremely diverse campus.  Diversity is very accepted because of so many ethnic groups.  There are also many other events held on campus about other things such as politics and sexual orientation.
College Sophomore,4,Financial aid has helped me so much.  One of the advisers explained to me how the whole loans system works which made things a lot easier for me.
College Sophomore,4,"I usually bring my laptop with me to campus to do work in between classes and the wifi is very reliable.  When I decide to use the school computers for something like printing, they always work very well and I had plenty of print pages available."
College Sophomore,4,I really like the major I am in.  One really great thing about it is that the last semester is an internship which looks great when applying for jobs.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are very helpful and enthusiastic in their classes.
College Freshman,2,Most students drove to school. Not a lot of students use the bus.
College Freshman,2,Since most commuter need to get to school through the high ways. When we have snow or sleets Its very hard to get to school. I witness a couple accident on the highway due to the slipperiness of the snow and rain which then made me late for class.
College Freshman,2,Its expensive and not much variety.
College Junior,2,Not Thar Great – I received some financial aid but I was kind of disappointed because I moved out of my parent's house and I talked to the finanacial aid lady to see what I can do for extra help. She basically told me there was nothing I could do since I was considered a minor until I'm 24 years old -_-
College Junior,2,Pennsylvania has only two seasons...winter and Under construction. It tends to get cold very early...so we have to be indors. Classes get canceled quite often here due to inclement weather
Junior,1,"There is no campus. There is no life. Staff look miserable and are not willing to help. At the same time they try to do everything they can to make sure you don't leave, even if its empty threats. Classes are a joke. Food is terrible. Athletics is just like campus, it doesn't exist. All in all it was a terrible experience and it makes me wish I would hav rethought everything."
College Senior,1,I got aid from the government however that didn't cover all of the costs of tuition. I asked my financial aid officer for help and she suggested I find scholarships online or go to a community college. As far as asking the financial aid office for help I wouldn't suggest it to anyone. I've had more success talking to other students in finding help to pay for school.
College Freshman,1,"The food is very expensive, there no need for it to be that way"
College Freshman,1,"Not many attractive women, but they are very hard working/"

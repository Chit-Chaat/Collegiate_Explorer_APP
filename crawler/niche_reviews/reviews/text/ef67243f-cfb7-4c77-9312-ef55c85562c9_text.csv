Works Here,5,"While I was on staff at SFAI I took an incredible Western Civilization class team taught by Ray Mondini, Zeke Pappadopolos and Diane Levitan. Having left The Cooper Union School of Art out of disillusion with their liberal arts and literature classes I had low expectations. Couldn't have been happier with the lectures and seminar classes, the quality of the content weaving culture, Dante's Inferno and the art of the period into a deeply challenging and fascinating semester.    Luckily I could study In the Anne Bremer Memorial Library with a kind, insightful undergrad, Pilar, who was in the course with me. Had one on one meetings with Zeke Papaodopolos, and worked hard to pass.  Harder than any class I took at USF, Boston University or Cooper Union."
Alum,5,SFAI is all about creativity. I now work in high tech and clearly remember the excitement permeating the large pairing studio overlooking the Bay at Chestnut. Somehow the school and it’s amazing teachers managed to channel all the artistic energy and flood the space and canvases with resonances of student condensed genius. The atmosphere was unique and I still feels it when faced with ‘blank canvases’ of life after SFAI. Where else can you learn pure shared creativity?
Alum,5,"It’s a very unique art institution that really personalizes your art development and brings out what ‘s inside you and helps you soar!
Look at the successful artists that went through this school—Kathryn Bigelow, Annie Leibovitz, Kehinde Wiley...."
Works Here,5,"SFAI is for students committed to discovering their unique talents who have the courage & commitment to become professional artists.  Since 1871, this has been the birthplace of one important cultural movement after another from fine art photography to Burning Man.  Faculty are dedicated mentors and a student-teacher ratio of 9:1 means every student receives individual attention.  A spectacular waterfront graduate campus just opened where students are assigned their own studios. That's in addition to the historic campus where Kehinde Wiley, Annie Liebowitz, Barry McGee, and many other artists once studied.  These well-known artists say SFAI played a critical role in  development & often return for master classes, fundraising events, and exhibitions -- part of a network of influential alumni that is global in scope.  Many also say that SFAI helped establish a local culture that embraces creativity, making San Francisco a hotbed of innovation across every industry."
Senior,5,"This is a perfect place to build your artistic skills and portfolio to enter into the real world, all the professors are very supportive and the campuses are amazing to work at. Wonderful views from the campus and there's always a lot going on."
College Senior,5,"I still agree that this school still takes things serously, and that this has a lot of esteem and clout."
College Sophomore,5,The financial aid process was great. Everyone was very helpful and assisted with any questions I had.
College Freshman,5,It's San Francisco! It's pretty difficult to complain.
College Freshman,5,"It's like the whole university is a different program, but for each of the individual majors, there is a great sense of community."
College Freshman,5,"SFAI, as well as an art institute, is and art gallery, so it is extremely optimal considering the main ficus is, in fact, art."
College Freshman,5,"SFAI offers numerous study abroad opportunities to expand horizons, and SFAI is also built to guide students into their fields by offering and requiring apprentice ships. Overall, SFAI is one of the most prestigious art institutions in the nation."
College Freshman,5,"SFAI provides a very positive and inspiring learning place for artists, with helpful and friendly staff to help guide young artists to their goals."
College Senior,5,It is really one of the crowning features at Sfai. Diversity drives creativity.
College Senior,5,The students at Sfai are culturally and artistically diverse.
College Junior,5,"Love it.  It's small, beautiful, facilities stay open all night, open campus, it's great."
College Sophomore,5,My experience was good it went really smooth and it helped to pay for many expenses that would be hard to pay for without financial aid. A tip would be if you need help financialy then go apply you have nothing to lose.
College Sophomore,5,I think my school is the best because they give you what you need to be successful and they help you with all parts of your life from school to getting a job and much more.
College Sophomore,5,Night life is very quiet not too many parties or going to the bars and clubs we tend to stay out of trouble as much as possible.
College Sophomore,5,We always have access to a computer every day and it's just great because we can do all of our work free of cost.
College Freshman,5,"There are numerous computer labs at my school, as well as computers in the dorms, and laptops you can check out. The DIS is equipped with large, color printers for making photographic prints. And the other labs all have black and white printers as well. The internet connection is always very fast on campus."
Sophomore,4,"Its very good for the contemporary artist is nice to explore and dabble in everything. They have both digital and analog but its more for experimenting. I would not recommended it if your looking for more commercial and digital specific fields and learning. It really is just a contemporary art school. Its very expensive and is for the more independent artist, you are expected to do all the work. They give you the resources and knowledge but its just the beginning steps if you know what I mean."
Alum,4,"In the 1970s I was a student in SFAI's  Photography Department. More recently, I spent five years volunteering there. I know the school now and I knew it then. In my experience, everyone at SFAI considers you an artist worthy of respect the day you arrive. Your SFAI email address will read, [yourname]@artists.sfai.edu."" The school's faculty and administrators commit themselves to each student's growth on each student's terms. The administrators there do all they can to free students to concentrate on their art, the most important help being in the form of financial aid for any student who needs it. At the same time, the faculty do all they can to understand your ideal for your art as it changes, which it will over and over again. They then work to help you reach your ideal, whatever it is and however it changes. Along the way, they require technical experimentation. They also encourage experimentation in genres other than the one in which you major. SFAI: game changer."
Sophomore,4,"great school! most of the students unfourtuantly seem un interested, but the few that are have a wealth of resources to expand their ideology and creativity through any medium."
Freshman,4,"Definitely wouldn't recommend for younger first-year students, being that there's a lot of responsibility and maturity you're taking on. I enjoyed smaller class sizes, was less than 10 students for some of my own. This offers more time for discussions and one on ones with the teacher. Personally, I would've liked to see greater diversity among SFAI's student body! This school is easily one of the most relaxed academic settings I've been in. Faculty at SFAI stress the importance of healthy mental and emotional health and does a great job promoting their resources for students."
Junior,4,"What I like most about SFAI  is the encouragement students are given to explore avenues of art previously thought to be untenable or too far out there to understand or effect. Each department is very different from the other but they are all alike in that exploration into the unknown isn't discouraged or looked at as a waste of time. Students aren't treated like laborious product makers for the masses. At SFAI concept & development are the top priorities of the art makers who find themselves there, teachers & student alike. As a painter I can attest to the advocacy of the fluid nature of the school. Since attending the institution I've found myself delving into projects using materials that stray far from the 2-dimensional world I previously held close as my own. While I am still a painting major, the skills I've amassed in the form of metal sculpture not only inform my work as a painter but have opened a realm more vast than what was thought to be circumscribed for me to begin with."
College Student,4,It is very small and generally very safe. The school itself is located in a very safe area of the city. At school I ALWAYS feel extremely safe. The dorms are more downtown but as long as you are with friends and do not do stupid things you will be fine. I was a little scared walking around by myself when I first got there but I feel fine now.
College Student,4,"If the school is right for you, you will love it. It is very small and you see people you know all the time but I like that. There are limited classes because it is small but there are still lots of options and small class sizes so you get a lot of individual attention."
College Student,4,There are some AMAZING alumni who are artists and went to this school.
College Student,4,"SFAI is very diverse and has a lot of different types of artists. I love how they let you use ALL the facilities even if its not your major or even if you don't take any classes in the subject. All the studios are available to all students. There are some amazing teachers and there are some okay teachers. You just gotta ask around to see who's good. It also depends on what type of learner you are. Some people do well with tough critique and harsher feedback and others do well with more encouragement and suggestions. I really like the general vibe of the school. The cafe isn't great, only serves a few options every day. Its not buffet style. The students are great, super cool and funny. All kinds of people."
College Sophomore,4,"Food is good, tons of variety, great flavor yet healthy and affordable."
College Sophomore,4,Students are very open with one another. There doesn't seem to be any bad feelings toward others.
College Sophomore,4,"So far, my experience has been challenging and full of hard work. There has definitely been progress in my practice"
College Sophomore,4,The school provides a career center and offers a lot of advice for jobs/internships.
College Sophomore,4,Several restaurants and pizza places for lunch in S.F. Some cheap places for a slice.
College Sophomore,4,Administration is usually looking for ways to help students.
College Sophomore,4,I didn't have much of a problem getting my financial aid. People in the office were very helpful and made sure that I understood everything that I needed to understand.
College Freshman,4,"It was the regular application process for fine arts, and pretty difficult to get into, so...it wasn't poorly organized or anything."
College Freshman,4,"The food may not be very diverse, but it's high quality, healthy , and good."
College Freshman,4,"SFAI is quite diverse, which is great."
College Freshman,4,"The campus security is great. They're there 24/7 and at night, when students are staying late to work, they check in on everyone at intervals, so it's a very secure campus."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are great; they definitely create more of a sense of community. Sutter Hall is a great building, very artsy. One slight draw back is the walk to and from campus:while I'm excited to be active and in decent shape, the walk will prevent me from just being able to roll out of bed on lazy mornings and still get to class on time."
College Senior,4,There is many tasty and healthy choices available.
College Senior,4,It was a good process.
College Senior,4,"I am happy with my program. I would do it all over again, but maybe the second time it would be a little less painful. I want to learn continuously!  My career goals are to collaborate. I am interested in CRG organization at Berkeley, and exploring Stanford. I really believe in the value of creative and artistic perspectives. I want to promote, acknowledge, and appreciate art by continuing to re-think and re-shape it's role in the community. I want to highlight artist's strengths and valuable assets they generously give to society. One of my goals is to be an advocate for art and artists."
College Senior,4,No problems that I have encountered.
College Senior,4,Sfai has a beautiful main campus with a great library.  The Graduate Center is located near Potrero Hill which is a really great neighborhood in San Francisco. The events and lectures are top notch!
College Senior,4,"I think the professors are what make sfai so great. The emphasis on  theory, philosophy, and political topics really create a forum to engage with current global discourses and issues in critical and creative ways."
College Senior,4,I really loved the professors and faculty members at sfai. The professors were all well versed in their field of interested and challenged students to critically engage with the course material. The graduate center staff was always available to help.
College Senior,4,Some unique aspects about the program are the open minded attitude of professors and faculty to explore and experiment conceptually.The encouragement to engage in coss-disciplinary projects was great.
College Sophomore,4,It's a one-of-a-kind place with really interesting things going on.
College Sophomore,4,The public transportation system is easy to navigate and easy to access.
College Junior,4,Good computer labs and free printing.  Anywhere on campus wireless availability.
College Junior,4,"Sometimes cool and foggy, sometimes sunny and windy.  Rain during the winter."
College Junior,4,"Great library full of amazing books on art.  Architecturally a beautiful campus, and an amazing view.  It's an art school so events can get pretty weird."
College Junior,4,"It's cool.  It's San Francisco, I think a lot of the students go here because of the sexual diversity."
College Junior,4,"San Francisco is great.  It's beautiful, it has great museums, whatever you want.  It just cost a lot and the parking sucks."
College Junior,4,There's a job/internship fair that's held every quarter at the school.
College Junior,4,They help you register which is always appreciated. The academic directors take the time to give what the class is about.
College Sophomore,4,Girls at my school are very beautiful and nice to talk to I like the ratio of boys to girls.
College Sophomore,4,It has been very good since my first day here and still I like the weather not too much rain and not too much sun.
Senior,2,You will spend hours “critiquing” incredibly ridiculous things students think is art.  Extremely limited facilities for the price. Hours of my life wasted on inept teachers trying to make the sound work on the tv so they can show you YouTube videos instead of teach. Many instructors very negative towards capitalism. No classes where practical business skills are taught. And yet the admissions counselor told me graduates are largely entrepreneurs. 2 hour parking spaces for 3 hour classes. juvenile student body. Rampant theft in the area. Sub par food in the cafe. Focus on equality of outcome rather than opportunity.  One can get through an entire 4 year degree here and never truly be “classically trained” in the arts.
Alum,2,"Avoid this school at all costs... great place to visit as a tourist but if you're going to invest 40k a year go elsewhere ... this school is limited with their facilities, other art schools offer private studios for seniors and state of the art resources.. Sfai felt dated and the atmosphere was dead, not much going on on campus. They pride themselves on their history, but the legacy does not live on. They're more invested in the mfa program than bfa. Whatever exciting activities that do take place on campus are usually private catered parties for admin and donors. Fine art oriented, not a design school. However it is pretty relaxed, with some great professors. Best way to get by is keeping to yourself. I found the students to be catty, immature, cliquish and sabotaging if your work stands out. Be careful who you open up to. It's a smile at your face stab you in the back student body."
College Student,2,I don't think we have one... but I could just be oblivious to it. Either way it's not a big part of our school.
College Freshman,2,Not alot of opportunities are given or shown.
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are quiet and calm, I don't mind them. But they're ridiculously expensive for what we pay for and don't get. THe RA's are great however and the community is ok. But the dorms location and building is terrible."
College Sophomore,2,I wish they offered more than approx 4-5 grand per semester as a scholarship. It's 20 grand to go to the school... and 15-16 grand is still expensive for 3 months.
College Junior,2,San Francisco cost a lot and you'll probably have to live outside the city.
College Junior,2,"The food and dining options on campus are quite poor. It's a small cafe that's normally not open that late and has a very limited number of choices. It tends to only serve burritos and not much else. The meal plan at my school is only for one's first year at school. For the rest of the time, one has to pay out-of-pocket when dining at our cafe and it's quite expensive, especially considering what they have to offer."
College Junior,2,"If you're looking for a top notch studio space this is not the place for you. That being said, SFAI is built on the idea of getting things done with what you have and just making art anyway possible. One great thing about the school is the library. Talk to Jeff, the head librarian, and he'll pull out hand made books by famous artists, rare prints, and things you couldn't even imagine. The view from the roof is awe inspiring and the architecture is beautiful. There's a Diego Rivera mural on campus, what more could you need?"
College Junior,2,"MUNI and Bart – The public transportation in San Francisco can be unpredictable and eventful.  Each transit line has it own story. If you are ridding the Bart you are going to get where you are going no problem. As for the MUNI bus system you never know. Along with this you have the historic street cars that cruse down Market street, and the famous cable cars that coast up and down the giant hills of the city. The rout you take is the adventure you decide to embark on."
College Sophomore,2,Finacial Aid Does Not Even Cover Half – getting scholarships has been a very long and hard process I'm still working on getting a scolorship.
Alum,1,"Complete lack of diversity in student body due to terrible admissions and marketing. Painting studio's at the main campus are literally falling in due to lack of funds  aren't fixing the issue just blocking it off from students, its been years this has been an issue. Undergrad painting students have to now take all painting classes  across town with little to no help from the school. Tuition is insane considering the education you get. The school is in constant talks of shutting down because of money. Housing  is terrible, its in one of worst areas of the city and there are mold and water damage in a lot of the rooms. I would highly suggest going elsewhere currently."
Freshman,1,Teachers are all mad about upper management. There is hardly ever anyone available to talk to about issues. Good luck getting anyone on the phone for anything they LEGIT NEVER ANSWER ANY PHONES.
College Senior,1,I think its very lacking. A club that promotes local hiking trips and or excursion outside the city would liven up the scene. It would provide alternate experience to the urban landscape.
College Junior,1,No sports.  It's an art school.
College Sophomore,1,It cost way too much just to have a parking space and I would just choose to take the bus to school the cost is low and the hassel is nothing at all it makes it so much easier to commute.
College Junior,1,"There are two faculty parking lots that can be used by students after 7 pm, but during the day there is only 2 hour parking, but classes are three hours, so you have to leave in the middle of class to move your car. Tickets are given out frequently in the area so make sure you keep an eye on the time. Overall, having a car in San Francisco in general is a real pain, so I wouldn't really suggest it."
College Junior,1,San Francisco is a large city with an excellent transportation system. You can get a public transporation card (Clipper card) which makes it even easer to get around without carry the cash. If you choose to have your own vehicle then be prepared to pay a premium for parking. City does have parking permits available for on street parking. The 2 dorm houses do not have onsite parking. The school doesn't either but has a bus stop just down the sidewalk from the front door.
College Freshman,1,Terrible service and limited selection at high prices.
College Senior,1,"Ok, but Too Greasy and Too Expensive! The cafe is only open until about 4 on week days, so if you have a meal plan, you'll have to find dinner somewhere else. There aren't many options for vegetarian/vegan food, and it's all too greasy and over priced. The coffee is bad (worse than gas station coffee), but at least there's better cafe's in the neighborhood. None of the food is worth the wait or price, so I recommend bringing a lunch or eating elsewhere."
College Sophomore,1,"The San Francisco Art Institute is situated in a residential neighborhood, so parking is very limited. There are hardly any students who bring a car. Most walk to campus or use public transportation, which is readily available. There is no university-provided parking for those who live on-campus in the dorms in downtown San Francisco."

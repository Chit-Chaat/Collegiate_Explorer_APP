Sophomore,5,"Capitol is a great university for the academically minded. The campus is isolated and the student population is so small that everyone knows everyone and crime is virtually nonexistent. It's a very focused school, so don't expect to have big parties every weekend; people tend to stick to hosting small game nights with close friends every now and then. There are lots of fun events, though, from Zombie Week in the fall, to campus-wide movie nights every season.
If you ever run into problems with professors or your major, there are many outlets Capitol provides to help get you back on track."
Sophomore,5,"Online classes are very fun to attend. The professors are easy to reach and communicate with. Classes are interactive and often rely on the input of the students using online features such as polls, text chat, and screen sharing."
Works Here,5,"The atmosphere is great, you know everyone, everyone knows you. The teachers are very helpful and most of them work very hard to help their students succeed."
Sophomore,5,"I love Capitol Technology University because it is a small college where everyone knows everyone. When you are on campus you automatically fit in because there is at least one thing you have in common with another person. I also like how the school supports interaction with others and provide students activities and events to participate in. Not only is it great socially but they also provide professors that are determined to help you understand a subject that you may be struggling with. The professors always find new ways to teach the class while staying on the subject. They do multiple methods of teaching so that they can understand how the student learns better. Also, the classes are smaller than other universities so that gives people a chance to get to know their professor on a personal level and it gives students connections with job opportunities in the process."
Graduate Student,5,I am a student in the doctoral program.  This is definitely a good school and trending upwards.  The faculty changes in the past two years in my program have brought new energy and ideas to the table.  The newest parts of the campus are great.  The groundskeeping needs to have more attention to detail.
Graduate Student,5,"This University was a great experience for me. I learned alot of material in 5 years. My favorite thing about this school is that the professors care. They will go out of their way to help you as much as they can. Also, the classes are smaller which makes it easier for learning."
Niche User,5,I went to an open house at Capitol Technology university my experience was amazing. I really felt how everyone treated each other like family. I like how it's a small campus to easily get around. I really love it I really would like to attend to this college.
Niche User,5,"I like the campus, etc. Professors and administration are nice. I plan pursue a degree in Information Technology at CTU."
College Sophomore,5,campus police presence  is visual throughout campus
College Sophomore,5,My career prospect is to become a Chief Information Security Officer and the courses that the school offers will enable me to do just that.
College Sophomore,5,"School provides off campus housing for about half he students because campus does not have enough beds. It is really great! They provide a shuttle to and from school, it is right next to a mall. They do not let freshman live there the first semester."
College Senior,5,"Capitol is location right in between Baltimore and Washington, DC. Its also located in between UMD and Bowie State University. We are very privilege to be located where we are so there's always something to do."
College Senior,5,As far as rules go here they're pretty strict. It's not a lot of rules to follow and the dean of res life is pretty cool as long as you follow the rules.
College Junior,5,Capitol College is more of a technical school than other schools I visited with the goal in mind of helping you get a job in your career field quickly upon graduation.  To apply simply go to their website and fill out the application fully. It helps to have prior community college experience when applying to show that you actually care about school and your grades instead of just being there for the party scene (of which there isn't one at Capitol).
College Junior,5,"There isn't a lot of parking available, but it fits the student population well as there aren't a lot of students either."
College Sophomore,5,"The work load for my major is decent. YOu can choose your classes and the teachers as well, from both online to in class. 12 to 1 ratio for students and the connection with teachers. Also capitol offers free tutoring."
College Sophomore,5,12 to 1 ratio between students in a class room and teachers. Small class sizes and free tutoring.
College Junior,5,"I believe Capitol has the best academic program around. We have professors that have worked in the career fields for 30+ years and we have professors that are still working in the field. We have hands-on learning and we begin that as your first class of your freshman year. Capitol really prepares students for the things they will need for their careers, and helps you get those careers."
Junior,4,"Great small school, dorms are really nice and the people are very friendly. Classes are great and can get very personal with the teachers if you would like."
Senior,4,"It's a nice place, small, which is what I needed. The teachers actually listen when you have a problem, even if they tend to get on you about work. They recently remodeled and I couldn't be happier to see what's in store!"
Freshman,4,"the college isn't too bad, it's a pretty good university for it is small and well balanced. the professors are nice and very understanding when it comes to schoolwork."
Junior,4,"Good school, off the beaten path, great teachers, 1 on 1 tutoring if required, small in depth classes, lots of opportunity for extra curricular activities, generous scholarship program, evening classes for working individuals"
Freshman,4,"The academics at the university is mostly towards cyber security, computer science, engineering, aerospace, and business. The professors and teachers for those academics are really good. One of the professors really helps the newcomers to any class he teaches and breaks it down for you. The learning center is a perfect place to go to if your struggling really bad in one of your classes. 

The campus is really small, but doesn't have a lot of things to do unless an event is going on. Students can live in the towers that is shared between other universities like college park and Bowie near the Metro. A shuttle does travel between those two places to drop off students who have classes. There's no major parties going on campus and sports teams we have that play seriously. The campus have a lot of geeks and nerds that is into computers, video games, and anime. 

Finally, the financial aid office will help anyway they can to help your tuition and make sure you can come to Capitol."
College Senior,4,"Capitol is a small school that specializes in Electrical, Computer, Aerospace and Cyber security engineering.

The teachers are really knowledgeable in those subjects, but there is a limited variety of courses offered in other subjects. Some professors are dedicated and helpful while others can be somewhat  inconsistent.

A lot of classes, especially general studies, are offered in the form of live online lectures. All classes are small between 5 - 40."
College Senior,4,"Despite being kind of unheard of outside STEM communities, Capitol is well respected by employers. A significant amount students get internships from government departments or major government contractors( DOD, NASA, Lockheed Martin).

Many students have jobs waiting before they graduate.  A Lot of graduates work for the government directly or indirectly. The rest are spread out among  telecommunications, computer networking, cyber security and power distribution companies. Our alumni association is pretty strong, They donate a lot of scholarship money."
College Senior,4,"I feel safe on campus. We're small so everyone sort of knows each other. Also, the main campus is kind of isolated in the suburbs, so we don't have much time."
College Senior,4,I chose the option to live in the off campus apartments at the Towers at University Town Center. Worked out pretty well for me though you either have to catch an hourly shuttle or have a twenty minute drive.
College Senior,4,"Going in you should know that Capitol is small, about 300-400 undergraduate students.  As a whole the students are pretty reserved but friendly.  Professors are pretty knowledgeable in their respective subjects, though certain adjunct faculty could be more attentive to students."
College Sophomore,4,"Although I am a first time student, after speaking with professors and students, the university program is very comprehensive allowing one to graduate and get a job."
College Freshman,4,Its small and the professors are great
College Junior,4,I go to school part-time but the professors are great and answer any questions you have as well as being straight-forward.
College Senior,4,"It's great, due to a strong emphasis to bridge theory and books with practical real world applications.  With it's small size the educational experience is personalized."
College Senior,4,I like our school and what they put in to their policy I am fine with their level of strictness because it's designed with student safety in mind.
College Sophomore,4,"I swear, I have more freedom at college than I do in my own home."
College Sophomore,4,The shuttle service is a great service but I believe that people will agree that it should run on the weekends as well.
College Sophomore,4,A wide range of people attend the college. It can be split into two sets: military and non-military
College Sophomore,4,"From what I've seen, at the University Tower Apartments, there are 4 rooms and a common area in the apartment. The room has a desk, window, dresser, closet with a full length mirror, and a private bathroom with shower. Plus, there's a washer and dryer inside the apartment. It all seems good to me"
College Sophomore,4,"The academics at the college are very good. They're hard to understand at first but with a little help, you'll be able to do the work in your sleep."
College Sophomore,4,"You'll notice that a lot of people on campus like to keep the front door of their dorm unlocked, which can be uncomfortable at times."
College Sophomore,4,"Capitol is heavily engineer and technology based, and you take classes related to your major right away. There is also the job guarantee which says that if you don't have a job relating to your field of study 6 months after you graduate you can take 36 credit courses for free."
College Freshman,4,"Just go see the Financial Aid Office.  If you keep in contact, it'll be a smooth process."
College Freshman,4,"The school is pretty diverse.  There is no real majority, though there are definitely some minorities in terms of school population.  Tolerance is difficult to pinpoint, though, since the school and the students barely have a stance on the issues mentioned."
College Freshman,4,The admissions process was pretty streamlined.  It was all easy access online application.
College Freshman,4,"Computer Science was a standard idea that I had because of its job potential.  Haven't looked for a job yet, only because I don't need one at the moment, but I'm keeping an eye out."
College Sophomore,4,"As far as drugs go, the worst we get is weed and that's once every blue moon. Most of the students who smoke opt for hookah anyway. Most underage students on campus are comfortable drinking but no one pressures you into it if they are.There are very few incidents where RA's have to bust parties because most of the parties happen off campus. Also the students 21 and over are allowed to drink only if their entire apartment is of age. For example you'll get a policy violation if you're drinking in your common room even if no one else is there because there's a no alcohol or alcohol paraphernalia policy. Also we have triple and single rooms. You're only allowed to drink in your bedroom if your other two roommates are of age or if you have a single room."
College Freshman,4,Most of the academics and curriculum seem to be straight to the point. You take the classes that you will actually need for your major. The registration process for classes aren't long either.
College Freshman,4,People at my school don't pressure you into smoking or anything for that matter. You have to be outgoing to find someone who smokes because they're not easily identifiable. Other than Marijuana and Alcohol there aren't any drugs used on campus as far as I know.
College Junior,4,"Pretty good overall, this is a tech school after all"
College Senior,4,Living on campus is very fun. Its has a very close community feel to it. Everyone on campus is very welcoming. Its right next to the main buildings so walking to class takes about one minute. Getting housing is very easy and simple as long as you meet the deadline. The dorms are quite aged but they do their best to keep them up to date.
College Junior,4,"The college mostly has black and white students. However, there are other ethnic groups of people that attend the school. It creates a welcoming atmosphere. One should not feel awfully out of place due to his or her ethnic background."
College Sophomore,4,they are ok to go to sometimes the food is fine but it does get expensive
College Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love the on campus housing! It is apartment style, so if you don't get along with the people in your suite, then you can request to move to a new apartment."
College Sophomore,4,"Being how the campus is small, weather doesn't really have much of an effect. So its not bad at all."
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are a lot of activities going on that are academically, athletically, and socially based. A lot of it though is usually created by the students themselves so on-campus students usually have to make their own fun. The student center does have a small gym, pool table, ping-pong table, and a television to play video games with."
Recent Alumnus,4,The computers on campus were usually up-to-date with most recent operating systems and at least one printer was always available for students to print. The only time I need to bring my laptop is for classes requiring certain programs that could not be installed on the systems. I never had a problem receiving wireless access from my laptop.
College Junior,4,Parking on campus is pretty good. We don't have to pay for parking or need a permit. Freshmen can have cars which is great and you don't really need a car on camps. There's always someone who is willing to take others where they need to go. There are plenty of parking spaces close to the building but there's extra spaces around the back which is where most people have to park when classes are about to start.
College Junior,4,"Capitol is a wonderful school to attend. We are a small campus so you get to interact with your professors and they know you as you not just as a number in a class of 200. We have a great job guarantee, a nice staff, and everyone here is willing to go above and beyond to help you with anything you would need. All of our professors are well trained and experienced engineers. Capitol has very successful alumni all around the world. At Capitol you get hands-on learning you CANNOT get anywhere else."
College Student,4,"Mellow Maryland – Capitol is located near Laurel, Maryland and the weather is always pretty mellow.  It doesn't snow a lot in the winter most of the time and the temperatures are not really low.  The spring and fall are very mellow and provide a good environment to relax and be calm or enjoy all types of outdoor activities, both energize the mind and body and help with the whole college experience."
College Freshman,2,"There is only a soccer field, but there is no soccer team. There is an ultimate Frisbee team and a football team."
College Sophomore,2,"Very strict on underage drinking, can get kicked out"
College Sophomore,2,"We very rarely have parties,they are banned on campus, you must be very secretive to not get written up by res life."
College Senior,2,not a whole lot going on in the athletic dept. it's a little here and there we try to have a fit club and a soccer team and a flag foot ball team but it's not very serious.
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms have been around since the 60's when the college was opened and they've never been renovated. The material is in such disrepair that there are birds living in the exterior walls. One guy accidentally threw bacon grease out and the wall absorbed it. There are 'on-campus' dorms at a dorm complex that the college leases but they're moderately more expensive and unless you have a car, you've got to rely on the shuttle to get you to classes and it runs on an inconvenient schedule.Thankfully they finally decided to build new buildings  on campus and they're not planning on charging much more than they charge us for these and from the architect mockups they'll be awesome and much more secure independent of the security service on campus."
College Freshman,2,"There is no such thing as Greek Life here. There may be, but it doesn't hold much importance."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't really sports or athletics here, except Ultimate Frisbee, Volleyball, and Basketball."
College Freshman,2,"The local atmosphere is terrible. You have to travel approximately 30min to get anywhere of interest. Poor nightlife transportation, attractions, everything except safety"
College Freshman,2,I was not offered a scholarship. I also was not in good academic standing when I applied for my school.
College Freshman,2,At my school students have plenty of access to computers the only problem is our network is congested and operates very unreliably it's also slow.
College Freshman,2,We have a lack of Greek Life. Although if a student wanted to participate they would have to join another chapter from another school in the area
College Senior,2,"If you're looking for a party school, capitol is not the place for you. We have school sanctioned events quite often. There are parties in the dorms but its on a special occasion."
College Junior,2,"Bad Roads – If I lived on campus weather wouldn't be a problem since all the buildings are close together; however, since I commute in it can be difficult. The road leading to campus is a single-lane, pot-hole filled suspension killer to my car, and any kind of inclement weather requires driving at 15 mph the whole way down."
Junior,1,"Honestly the worst school I have ever been to, there is no organization in the administration at all. If you have any type of disability they dont care and refuse to be helpful with needing accomadations. John Washington (counsoler) is probabily the laziest and rudest person I have met. He never helps with any isses at all and his only responses is ""no"" or ""not my problem"".  There is about 20 girls in the whole school, most of the guys are complete pervs and the school turns a blind eye on most harrasment reports just to make their records look better. Most people dont graduate from here, if you want to be any type of engineer dont go here. Half of the degrees promised dont actually exist and so you cant really graduate anytime soon. None of the teachers are professionals in their fields and most are very pretentious. Most of the grades are based on if the teachers like you or not."
College Sophomore,1,"We are in the middle of the woods, only a handful of places deliver."
College Sophomore,1,"Current housing dorms are falling apart and the maintenance staff on campus takes a very long time to fix broken things, and when they do they sometimes take the cheap way out."
College Freshman,1,Our campus dining is terrible.There are few options of what you could eat on top of the fact the prices are ridiculous. We don't have meal plans or a cafeteria for that matter. Also there are no options for food during the evenings
College Freshman,1,Our school is rather boring and very strict on party policies. There are no bar/club scenes close to my school and there is no transportation provided to bar/club scenes
College Junior,1,"there are vending machines and a small cafe, but no meal plan"
College Junior,1,"There's not much to do if one does not have a car in his/her possession. Student are pretty much forced to travel off of campus in order to find something to do. The college does provide a shuttle that transports students to the nearby off-campus housing which is near a mall and other areas. However, the college does provide activities for the students to participate in."
College Sophomore,1,We Don't Have Division Sports – Students here love sports but we only have club sports
College Sophomore,1,Student Center Lacks Good Entertainment – Our student center is pretty boring & closes at 12

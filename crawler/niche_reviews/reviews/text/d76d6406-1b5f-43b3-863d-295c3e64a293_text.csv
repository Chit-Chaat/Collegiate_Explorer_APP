Alum,5,"Gordon College is by far the best place for any young Christian man or woman looking to become better prepared for a greater purpose. Their faculty, staff, and administration are among the most God-centered people I've ever met, and will always make time for you. The faculty will push you to engage your faith in ways you never thought possible, while investing in you and preparing you for a God-focused life. The Career and Connection Institute is incredible at connecting you with job opportunities, the campus life is excellent with plenty to do on-campus and in the local area, and the College's proximity to Boston is a huge plus. I'm so thankful the Lord led me here, as after attending Gordon I know I wouldn't have been poured into this much anywhere else."
Alum,5,The professors are just as (if not more so!) engaged individually with students in online classes as they are when you're learning in-person. Would highly recommend!
Freshman,5,I like the prospect of the academics. I am excited to make friends there. I am also excited for the theater program.
Freshman,5,"The professors at the college are some of the nicest humblest people I know while still providing us with a great education. The food at Gordon is very good in my opinion, but I know others who would disagree with that. Some of the dorms are very new and in good condition while others are older. The community on campus is incredible."
Freshman,5,I love the location of the college along with my professor for they are all loving. Room and board is really nice with delicious food from the cafeteria. I could not have asked for better opportunities to form communities and get involved.
Freshman,5,"I start my freshman year at Gordon this fall, but I have visited several times, met many of the students and staff, and worshiped with them at their chapel service. From my first steps onto the campus, Gordon felt like home. I am so looking forward to my time studying there, as well as building my career and making lifelong friends. Gordon is an expensive school, but it will be worth every cent."
Junior,5,It is a relatively small community but it's full of excellent peers and professors who fully support your college journey. There are times when I do wish we had broader subjects to study.
Senior,5,"Gordon is a small liberal arts college that provides students the opportunity to develop close relationships with amazing professors! It encourages students to seek our mentors: academic, spiritual, relational, vocational, etc. and works to create a support network for each and every student. The faculty and staff are caring and dedicated to student success both at Gordon and beyond. 

Gordon also works with students to allow for creative and unusual major/minor combinations that will prepare us for the work force ahead. They support students' ambitions and want to see our passions become a fruitful reality. Their commitment to student success and personal development is exceptional."
Niche User,5,"I have visited Gordon College twice this year and I absolutely love the environment of the school. The people who work in the office are so polite and patient with all the questions I had for them regarding applications and tours. I have met a student to grab lunch together and she told me about her experience in Gordon which showed me that the students in Gordon also love what they do there. I have also had the opportunity to attend a class during the tour. The friendliness and passion I saw in the students who were in Gordon assured me that this is the so-called ""happy place"" for students. Although I have not decided where I would like to go to college, the tours I have been to told me that this place is home for anyone."
Freshman,5,"Being at Gordon College is really great! I love the welcoming and friendly environment. From the very first moment that I stepped in the campus I had people welcoming me and come to talk to me.  The professors are very nice to students and very helpful. At Gordon I am able to not only get a really high education but grow spiritually, in my Christian faith, as well. I wouldn't change anything from Gordon. Everything in my eyes seems perfect. The campus is beautiful; it is close to downtown Boston, and only ten minutes away from the ocean! There is always something going on in the campus. There are many events all the time of the year, such as sports games, theater plays, concerts, homecoming events, and many others. Being an international student I can say that the international students’ organization is excellent and I love the fact that I was able to meet people from so many different countries!"
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Gordon College. Gordon is a 4-year private school in the north shore of Massachusetts. The community is great and I get a sense of home while attending there. Gordon has given me the opportunity to play on their baseball team and it has been an absolute blessing. The campus tends to be really cold throughout the year, but I still find ways to make some fun out of it. I have met my best friends here at this school and have helped guide me to become the person I am today. This school has also helped me grow in my faith with Jesus Christ. It serves a high purpose at this school."
Freshman,5,"Gordon is an amazing, Christian college! The atmosphere is always positive and the people are friendly. I greatly enjoy this college to the highest!"
Sophomore,5,"What I enjoy most about Gordon is the caring atmosphere. What I mean by this is that at Gordon, everyone whether it is the food court workers, the teachers, other faculty and even other students all care and look out for each other. Because of this, Gordon has one of the most comfortable learning environments which allows students to learn most efficiently. Of the colleges I visited, I felt Gordon was perfect for me and I would recommend it to anyone with any major, especially those interested in liberal arts."
Junior,5,"Wonderful College to enhance both Faith and Liberal Art knowledge. If you are a Christian and eager to learn under Biblical base, Gordon college is a place where you can achieve that."
Niche User,5,The students and staff at Gordon College are so welcoming and loving which is what I think makes it so unique compared to other schools!
Niche User,5,There is an atmosphere of love and willingness to serve others. This truth changed my perspective of college and motivated me to seek God freely.
Senior,5,Attending Gordon College has easily been the best decision I have made in my life. The community and environment on campus is thriving to grow and to deepen learning and faith. I have never been so happy in my life and I can thank Gordon College for that. The campus as a whole strives to improve and shows a high importance on education.
Niche User,5,"I loved the campus, it was simply beautiful!! One of the major things I love about Gordon is the community. It is a very close knit family and they are all very friendly. Out of all the colleges I have applied to, Gordon was the most comfortable community I saw. I hope to be joining their campus in the fall. I wanna be able to experience a christian community and make new friends."
Niche User,5,"Gordon College has a highly positive atmosphere. All are willing to help and answers questions, from Security Guards, to Professors, to fellow students."
Freshman,5,"It's an amazing school with Christ at the center of everything.  Academics, though challenging is. Definitely worth it. It is a school that cares about every single student and makes efforts to make everyone comfortable. The Gordon experience is great!!"
Junior,5,"Gordon is one of the top universities in the nation! Love it! The scenery is beautiful, it's close to Boston and all kinds of beaches! The North shore is the place to be in the summer and you can get to NYC in like 4-5 hours."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this college, at first I was hesitant because although I am a christian I still wanted a regular college experience, yet Gordon has not failed me with either one of the things I wanted. Not only am I able to have a great college experience I am to also have an environment to freely speak about my faith and flourish with it. I am challenged with my faith but also surrounded by professors who share the same love in my faith as I do."
Senior,5,"There is something for everyone here, and I mean that. If there isn't something for you, keep looking. You'll find it. It is a great social atmosphere and very welcoming. I never felt uncomfortable. On top of that, the academics are phenomenal... very tough at times, but you leave Gordon a whiz."
Freshman,5,Gordon has been amazing. With programs like La Vida for incoming students really helps with creating community. There are always efforts to foster community within this school. Speakers who come to this school have been very influential especially for me. The courses are challenging which is a blessing in itself. The school teaches you how to grow within your strengths and weaknesses so that you can be ready for the real world.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus and the people. It is a great community where the professors really care about the students. The only thing I would change is to have a better meal plan/better food. There isn't much variety and what there is, is ridiculously expensive."
College Freshman,5,Drugs and alchol are not available or encouraged on campus.
College Freshman,5,"The campus police came and spoke to the students and parents during freshman orientation, emphasize safety on campus and the dorms."
College Sophomore,5,I am very pleased with my choice to attend this school. The class size is small which allows for really one on one attention.
College Sophomore,5,This school is very much all about community and making sure that everyone feels included. From the small class sizes even for lectures to the loving nature of even the professors. When they ask how you are they really mean it and that is part of why i choose this school. Everyone here cares about not only your well-being but also your success.
College Junior,5,The intramurals and clubs sports are extremely popular and well run.
College Freshman,5,"No drugs, no problem. Seriously there is a disconnected group of maybe <300 students that partake in anything illegal."
College Freshman,5,"Gordon Police are excellent, but also very strict. If you've got bottles in your room. Pack your bags."
College Freshman,5,No parties just friends and fun.
College Freshman,5,There is no alcoholic beverages or drugs that I have seen.
College Freshman,5,You get all the help you need. And the proffers are willing to help.
College Freshman,5,"Gordon College's strength lies in the professors and emphasis on community. The professors and other staff members are all excellent people who encourage one-on-one interaction with students so that their best may be achieved. From the staff, this spills over to the students who have strong community and help one another out."
Recent Alumnus,5,There is huge cross-over from my Gordon BA to my MA/PhD in Europe. I would not be doing what I am doing right now if it were not for Gordon.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I loved my classes and learned a lot from my professors. They are dedicated, caring, and intelligent people and I expect some of them to be at my wedding.

Student wise everyone is coming from a different background. Professors are willing to make amends to keep you interested."
College Junior,5,"Police are great, caring , and observant"
College Junior,5,Sprit is the best I have seen. Fans are so good and polite. I have never seen any fans so involved for all the right reasons
College Junior,5,I am better at everything I do because of this school
College Freshman,5,"With Gordon Police in place, this is one of the safest schools around."
College Sophomore,5,Professors are of high quality and leaders in their fields
College Sophomore,5,I feel safer on this campus than I have ever felt anywhere else
College Sophomore,5,I love this school and everything about it.
College Sophomore,5,I love this school and everything about it
College Sophomore,5,I love the small campus setting and strong sense of community
College Senior,5,I loved the academically challenging environment.
College Senior,5,Very in depth teaching and learning styles.
College Senior,5,The campus police enforce safety well.
College Senior,5,I lived in a road hall which had a home feel.
College Senior,5,I think my favorite experience was classes!
College Senior,5,"We have so much fun celebrating with sports such as soccer, or basketball (these are the top two important). We are very active in participating in them!"
College Freshman,5,My dorm is great and the campus is small so it's not bad getting to class. The people here are nice and the professors are very caring. They offer great classes that really make you think and challenge you.
College Junior,5,No wonder you feel safe! Very strict rules bring peace and no pressure to do things against the law =)
College Sophomore,5,I really enjoy being here!
College Freshman,5,Our campus is easily ranked as one of the safest campuses in the nation. Generally good people mixed with great security means a very safe environment.
College Freshman,5,"Gordon's campus housing is fantastic. Sense of community is generally great, though some dorms are certainly doing better than the others."
College Sophomore,5,my school has been ranked as safest in the nation several years in a row.
College Freshman,5,Well balanced for your first year.
Sophomore,4,I did take some of my courses online and the teachers were able to adjust quickly in their own way. Even though this was the teacher's first time teaching online they did a pretty good job. I was homeschooled before college and I did it online so this was not new to me.
Sophomore,4,I love the diversity and how the campus is small and everyone is friendly. The campus is comfortable and beautiful especially when it is the fall season.
Alum,4,I loved the community I found in my major and on my sports teams. The professors took time to develop relationships with the students and the study abroad programs were stellar. I was surprised at how many commuters there were and disappointed in the lack of school spirit.
Junior,4,"The best part about Gordon College is by far the people. It is a strong Christian community filled with kind and passionate students and wise, supportive, selfless faculty and staff. The biggest challenge I've encountered is that the college is located in a suburb- there is nothing except houses within walking distance. If you need to get groceries or want to get off campus, you need a car or a friend with a car, which can be challenging in college. If you do have access to a car and are willing to travel, though, there are tons of fun places to go within 30 mins of campus."
Junior,4,"Online learning at Gordon college during the coronavirus had it's positives and negatives. The teachers really care about students' academic and personal success and growth, so most of our classes met over Zoom. Although it was nice to know teachers cared so much, there were definitely times we did not need to meet on Zoom or it was difficult to do all the work they expected us to do."
Freshman,4,I haven't taken any classes online yet. I will be at Gordon in the fall. I am excited to be there. I have visited so I have some idea of what it will be like.
Sophomore,4,"I liked the community. All the friends I made at Gordon were incredibly genuine. Since Gordon is a Christian university, it was really sweet to be able to connect with everyone over God and worship with them weekly. Since it's a smaller campus, you make friends really quickly, and it calls for a closer bond. The campus itself is gorgeous, and all of the professors/staff are so sweet. The campus is really all for helping the student as a whole: focusing on their mental and physical health, their needs, and other focuses, rather than just the academics. Gordon is a place where relationships are made for a lifetime. Everyone comes together to create a positive atmosphere, where it's really fun and easy to get involved and make an impact. There are tons of fun events to attend, as well. With COVID-19 sending everyone home early, the community came together and made sure to stay in touch with one another, as well as check up on their peers. Gordon is an incredible place to call home."
Sophomore,4,Most of the professors have been really understanding and are willing to work individually with you to insure you’ll succeed
Sophomore,4,"Students here are amazing! Professors will normally go out of their way to help you, except for the few that think that you’ll never be as smart as you..."
Junior,4,Gordon is a very great school! They put a lot of effort into creating a positive community experience. I would like to see a revival of values and the fostering of a more positive and mental health aware campus.
Junior,4,"For the semester of spring 2020 we moved our classes online. This consisted of zoom meetings in place of class times, and completion of our of class work. The teachers adjusted to curriculum accordingly."
Sophomore,4,The ability to know and be known your professor make learning easier and far more interesting. I love that they are invested in my learning and future.
Junior,4,"Though I dislike the school itself, the theatre department is one of the best communities I have ever seen and I am extremely proud to be a part of it. Fantastic opportunities for art on campus!!!!!"
Freshman,4,"The environment of the students and staff is absolutely amazing, everyone is so warm and gentle to welcome you here!"
Graduate Student,4,"Gordon College is the best place on earth—an inspirational, life-launching training ground but it is also a beautiful destination. Gordon majors on the majors and refuses to divide its students over important but secondary issues. It is so nice to live in this environment.Gordon knows the importance of first impressions made by staff and professors. I have seen so many smiles. The joy here is contagious."
Junior,4,"I have never had more supportive professors who are invested in my academic success and wellbeing than at Gordon College. Throughout my three years here so far, I have found a community in which to grow into a godly human being. There are things that could be better, as is the case with every school (such as the consistency of the quality of the campus food), but for the most part I have been happy with my experience at Gordon."
Freshman,4,"Gordon College has such a warm atmosphere of people (definitely not the weather) and the Christian base is truly wonderful. I love Gordon. There is a lot of diversity here and so may things going on all the time. The neighboring towns are adorable and house the best coffee shops around. Also, being so close to the greater Boston area is a plus."
Freshman,4,"I really love Gordon, it has been a place that i can discover who I am. I am excited to see where i go with Gordon in the future."
Senior,4,"Definitely the place for me! Obviously there are some flaws, as every school does, but overall I have been very impressed with my college."
Junior,4,"Gordon provides a lot of opportunities to get to know your faculty and to get involved on campus. Overall, students are quite friendly. The facilities are nice and there is a lot of investment in the science labs. I have had a positive experience there. The campus is extremely safe."
Niche User,4,"My daughter Rebekah will be returning to Gordon College in Fall 2018. She has been blessed with wonderful roommates during her 2 years in Ferrin Hall.  She had good experiences with dorm students, classes, and professors at Gordon College. Gordon offers many great ways to grow in knowledge, wisdom, and physical health. Taking La Vida classes, working in the Outdoor Adventure Camp, and being a teacher's assistant for La Vida have been great opportunities for her to be physically active, help new students, and  work with in the summer camp program. This summer, Rebekah is blessed to be a Gordon summer missions fellow. She is working in Columbia, South America with Viento Fresco. The Gordon campus is beautiful. The Gordon police and dorm staff maintain a safe campus. We are fortunate to have our daughter attend this wonderful Christian college."
Junior,4,"It's a great Christian College. Sometimes people may think we are inside a small circle on our own, but we do learn subjects that are out of our value and beliefs. Because the school's little smaller than other colleges, students can directly relate themselves to the faculties (who are very passionate about teaching). I can't say too much about foods, but they are working on that thankfully."
Senior,4,"Great academic programs and great faculty and staff. Lots of things to do on and around campus.  Great student involvement on campus, and wonderful community throughout the school."
Freshman,4,Gordon is a great Christian school and I would recommend it to everyone who wants to pursue a Christ-centered education. I would add diversity to the school if I could because I believe that a diverse surrounding community is very important and beneficial to healthy social growth.
Niche User,4,The admissions process has been amazingly easy and flexible and every visit and conversation with the employees and other students has been a joy!!
Junior,4,This college absolutely has your best interest in mind and will work with you every step of the way to help you achieve your goals.
Alum,4,"Gordon College is a great college, academically. It's small and quaint, so if you like that it is the place for you. However, because of that it got boring often in the winter. There is also no place within walking distance (not even a gas station), so that was unfortunate. This is the place for the dedicated student, not someone trying to enjoy a great social life unless he were to put in significant effort."
Freshman,4,"I loved Gordon's campus from the moment I saw it. While walking around campus it seemed like everyone knew each other, which was really nice. There was a great feel on campus."
Freshman,4,"In my freshman year at Gordon College, made many friends during freshman orientation. Live in Ferrin Hall, great community. Love most of my classes. Work-study has been great, working part-time on campus. Like the small campus, short walk to classes, Lane Student Center, and academic buildings. Enjoy working out at the Bennett Field House. Attend chapel services, great Christian community here. Love visiting with friends, seeing Boston or Maine on weekends. Feels like home."
Sophomore,4,"As a transfer to Gordon College, I have never regretted my decision. I love the atmosphere and the welcoming campus community. There are many opportunities given to Gordon Students and I have enjoyed all of my courses here so far."
College Freshman,4,"So far have had four classes. Teachers seem nice. Adjusting to class schedule, homework, and looking for deals on used books."
College Freshman,4,"There are many international students this year, including students from China, Taiwan, and Africa. I know minority students from my former high school and from Georgia who attend Gordon College."
College Freshman,4,I am new on campus. Just completed first week of classes.
College Freshman,4,I have met many alumni from Gordon College through my church; several work for the church or serve as missionaries. My teachers are very caring. Look forward to working in the classrooms doing education internships in the future.
College Freshman,4,I was able to choose my roommate before moving on campus. We get along great. The RA Lisa was very helpful with arranging to have my refrigerator moved upstairs. She helped me move the closet and desk to fit the fridge in. Made friends with other women on my floor. Enjoy watch movies with other students in the lounge.
College Freshman,4,The gym facilities at Bennett Athletic Center are new and spacious. I look forward to participating in club sports and swimming.
College Freshman,4,"The students in  my dorm and those I met through the freshman orientation are very welcoming. Had a great orientation experience. Started classes recently.  My parents met many good people during move in weekend, at the President's reception, and during chapel service."
College Junior,4,I had a lot of opportunities in my program.
College Sophomore,4,The career services is great about sending emails out regularly about internships and making them selves available to review  resumes and cover letters.
College Sophomore,4,"I feel extremely safe on campus, I know that if I ever need to talk to someone that all staff is willing to listen."
College Sophomore,4,School spirit and support for athletics are a huge thing at my everyone support them.
College Sophomore,4,This school has been a great fit for me so far and I have meet many wonderful professors and students here.
College Freshman,4,"great, you can choose from a variety of careers"
College Freshman,4,Has a wide variety of exercises and things to do
College Junior,4,"I love this school, I really feel as if its where I'm meant to be."
College Junior,4,I believe Gordon will well prepare me to pursue a career in my field that suits me.
College Junior,4,"Campus is very safe, and is one of the safest in the States."
College Junior,4,"ResLife community is great and most dorms have good proximity to campus facilities and classes (with the exception of the hill dorms, which are farther away from classes and the gym).  I really enjoy the community facilitated by the dorm halls and I think most of the dorms are adequate living spaces.  The older dorms (Evans, Wilson, Lewis) are really old and in need of updates (they were govt. buildings constructed in the 1960s), but people mostly enjoy living there anyway.  I really wish all dorms are campus were accessible for those with disabilities (the older dorms are not)."
College Junior,4,"Student support for Althetics could be better, but the quality of the teams and coaches for the sports we do have is high for a D3 school."
College Junior,4,"What I love about Gordon is that it is not perfect- no school is.  Because of this, it has remained a good place for me because I have unique resources and experiences that help me expand my career pursuits, grow in my understanding of the world, and continue to practice integrity with how I live in relation to others."
College Junior,4,Very welcoming community. Good range of programs offered.
College Freshman,4,Comm is falling apart. But I've taken some incredible philosophy classes.
College Freshman,4,Great DIII soccer. Wonderful gym facilities.
College Freshman,4,No time for parties just too busy studing
College Freshman,4,I have never seen or heard of any sexual asault since I have been here.
College Freshman,4,The police on campus are quick to respond and always ready
College Freshman,4,There are many internship opportunities and the school really works to ensure your ready to start a career after graduation
College Freshman,4,The classes can be tough at times but the professors are always willing to work with you
College Freshman,4,The community is great but some buildings could use some updates
College Freshman,4,"Athletics are a big part of the school, but sometimes it seems certain sports are overshadowed by others"
Alum,2,"I have so many mixed emotions when I think back to my time at Gordon. Professors were excellent. Campus life could be incredible if you found the right niche of people. When it comes down to it, this school is a business and makes decisions based on the wishes of a few wealthy conservative Christian benefactors. Many students and faculty alike have been harmed by some of the changes made over the past few years. As an incoming freshman, I was “sold” on the fairy tale of Gordon College. Have made it through my four years there,  I left with a ridiculous amount of loan debt and saddened by all of the harm it caused people."
College Junior,2,The education program is very good but the school is too small and isolated.
College Junior,2,The campus is extremely small and there is a lot of tension on campus. There is not much to do but there are some great people.
College Freshman,2,Gordon tries to call itself diverse and fails miserably.
College Freshman,2,Concerned about having the name Gordon on my diploma because of their anti-LGBT stance.
College Freshman,2,Racial and ethnic diversity could use some major improvement.
College Freshman,2,"Good academics. The people are very outwardly nice but if you're too liberal/swear ever/want to party, people will pretend to not care but will judge you. Gordon's like a little bubble shielding you from the evils of the outside world. Then again, most of the people going there want this kind of atmosphere, so it's really a matter of what you want out of college. I had no choice but to go here, and I personally hate it."
College Freshman,2,"Hearsay, is that is difficult to get approved for off campus housing, even though we are adults."
College Freshman,2,"You're definitely not going to find any thrashers on campus (or anything on campus for that matter), but there's usually a little something off-campus if you know a guy."
College Junior,2,no one really plays them and division 3..not very popular
College Freshman,2,There's basically nothing around here. You have to drive about 15 minutes to find anything good.
College Freshman,2,"It doesn't exist. If you want to party, don't come to Gordon. Like just don't. No, you won't be able to ""find them if you know the right people."" There are no parties. Some off campus. You have to be way too sneaky and get fined a ton if you get caught. It isn't worth it, just go somewhere else."
College Freshman,2,Super expensive and not very good. Limited options. Stir fry day is nice but lines are always ridiculous.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Housing is separated by gender and the last I checked this is 2015. You will not be allowed to visit your friends room during certain hours because you have different gender identities. This rule is strictly enforced.

There are also only 4 nice dorms that are notably more expensive, and the rest they will not show you on tours."
College Freshman,2,"Some dorms are very old, outdated and falling apart. Some are very far from any class, which is brutal in the cold. Except for the new dorms, the housing is pretty rough."
College Freshman,2,"There are rarely parties on or off campus, which, from the party scene perspective is pretty bad. The parties that do happen are rarely big ""ragers"" though."
College Freshman,2,"To put it in short, the party culture is simply not endorsed by the college."
College Freshman,2,"There are no parties, except for the school dances"
College Sophomore,2,"There's not much by way of parties.. perhaps the occasional one off campus, and one or two events on campus, but no much else. There's a decent amount of other events though, just not in terms of parties."
College Sophomore,2,KOSC and Chase are really the only nice and new buildings on campus worth your while. Try to avoid classes in jenks.
College Sophomore,2,"Most students don't care about the athletics department, and the same goes for the school administration. It's as if the school doesn't realize how many students sports brings in and retains. The varsity teams receive very little funding compared to other schools just like us. Look at Endicott, they started putting a decent amount of money into their athletics and now they are one of the premier athletic programs in the region. 

The facilities are absolutely outdated and way to small. Want to work out in the gym? Good luck. There is only one weight gym, and it is very small. If you work out while a team is doing their lifts and such you will most likely not find a machine available and will be subject to working your way around people to get from one area to the next. 

Want to work out from 8am-9am MWF? Nope they have a class of 12 people who need the entire gym apparently, and they kick everyone out. It's a joke."
College Sophomore,2,"Closest place you'll find off campus dining is 10 miles down route 128, and the McDonalds is the only place open past 11pm."
College Freshman,2,"I hate the cold... it's New England... pretty much awful and freezing from October through probably the end of April, but within that, it's weird, fickle weather up here. However, when it gets warm, it's super nice! Sitting out on the quad in the sun is my favorite thing."
College Freshman,2,The underclassmen parking lot is a 15 minute walk from the main parking lot (which is almost central to campus).
College Sophomore,2,"We have a shuttle that runs at somewhat of odd times, however it's route goes to the train station, two area malls, and Endicott College. Probably the best thing about the shuttle service, is that it's free. Otherwise, make friends with people who have cars, because sometimes you'll just want to get off campus and do your own thing."
College Freshman,2,"There really isn't much on campus to do, sometimes the school hosts dances. You have to drive at least 15 minutes to any shopping, movies and bars since Wenham is a dry city and does not like outside chain stores. Endicott College down the road is where you can  find the parties. Gordon does not have that great of a night life so students have to become creative."
College Freshman,2,Students are encouraged to live on campus unless there are too many students enrolled.  You have to get permission to live off campus and it usually is given to juniors and seniors.  There are apartments in nearby Beverly that can be very affordable for several students to share and also winter rentals in beach areas of gloucester.
College Freshman,2,Parking is farely limited on campus.  You don't need a car on campus but there are no stores or restaurants in walking distance so a car is needed to get off campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Rich, White, Conservative Kids – Gordon is predominated by white kids from average to affluent families. Because religion is so prevalent there (you are required to attend a certain number of chapels every year) sexual diversity is hard to find. There are very few black students, a nominal amount of Hispanic kids, and very few international students. Gordon's conservative, non-denominational background make it somewhat diverse, if we're talking about Baptists, Presbyterians, and Methodists. It is a very Christian school. Being a bisexual, I definitely felt the limited diversity of the students made me an incredible minority. And it's true - I'd say about 80 % of all students who attend are either white, rich, conservative, and straight."
College Sophomore,2,"Too Many Education Majors – Although the academics are very engaging and students learn a lot, there is not much variety in majors.  For instance, there are no majors for those wanting to be doctors, a little other creative majors.  Gordon only offers the main categories of standardized jobs.  Another thing I noticed after being at Gordon is that almost every girl is in an elementary ed or early childhood major.  I think this is a bit over the top and that some people haven't really thought about what their passion is.  There is nothing wrong with being an education major.  I went into Gordon my freshman year as an education major, but I quickly realized that didn't suit me.  I wish there was more flexibility and options for major choices."
College Sophomore,2,"Wifi Is Slow – There is wifi.....but it's slow. It's generally fine if you bring an ethernet cable.

There are plenty of labs to go to and they have printers so you don't need to bring one."
College Freshman,2,"Not Exciting – I'm not too familiar with off-campus housing selection here. I'd assume that the apartments in Boston are on the expensive side, but there could be options of smaller places in Wenham or Beverley, but they'd be less exciting and farther away from any night life or attractions."
College Freshman,2,"There is a shuttle that can take you to the local malls or T-station, but it only runs a couple times on thursday, friday, saturday, and sunday. Taxis are expensive. If you can manage to go the 45 minute (approx.) drive to the subway station, then that's good and cheap."
College Freshman,2,"There are many different races represented at Gordon College, but they comprise a very small percentage of all students. Most people are white, and all are Christian (or claim to be on their application to get in)."
College Sophomore,2,"Decent for a Christian School – Mostly white upper-middle class evangelical Christians from New England. There are a lot of international students, though, mostly from Korea. Although the student body is generally kind to racial minorities and people with disabilities, they are not very accepting of students who aren't evangelical, especially Catholics. Things are looking up for Catholic students, though; they just started a Catholic Student Fellowship last year and it's pretty active considering the circumstances."
College Sophomore,2,"Not too much is held on campus, but many students drive down to Boston to experience some city nightlife.  The majority of students, however, are content with hanging out at Chesters or Gillies, or watching a movie in a friends dorm.  Its quiet, but some people like that"
College Sophomore,2,"Need a Car – Gordon College is right near Boston and only recently did we receive a shuttle for transportation. Considering this, having a car with you on campus would be the best option."
College Junior,2,Hard to Get – It is very difficult to get granted off campus housing since the college requires students to be approved in order to live off campus.
College Freshman,2,"Punishment Aren't That Bad – The rules at Gordon are more strict than regular school, it's a dry campus and sticks frimly to those rules and visitation rules are strict to the point where it might be deemed rediculous, but the punishment for violating our dry campus isn't as extreme as many would expect"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Gordon is mainly filled with wealthy-ish white people.  The school goes out of its way to recruit diverse students through scholarships for international and urban youth and there is a vibrant and healthy community.   There is a strong international student community and a dorm community committed to valuing diversity.  For a basically well-off white school, it does an ok job of overcoming the ignorance of privilege but it's still there.  Best example- the dirty looks people shoot at the ""loud table"" during meals."
Freshman,1,"Gordon is for a very specific type of person. Being such a small campus there are basically only two groups to fall into. One being the group that goes off campus and parties, or the holier than thou extremely religious types. Not that there is anything wrong with being religious, but the self righteous and arrogant attitude of most students and faculty can get on your nerves. The food at Gordon is terrible. I have suffered food poisoning at least 4 times in the year I was here. The professors are extremely pretentious, they expect you to see things exactly their way and if challenged with an alternate point of view become extremely dismissive of the student. Chapel is something that is unique to the school and not easy to get out of. For those that are religious this shouldn't be an issue, but for someone like me Chapel can become a tedious task that you ultimately dread attending. The one thing I truly like about Gordon is how absolutely beautiful the campus is."
Sophomore,1,"This was oddly embarrassing. I know this seems more like a complaint or rant rather than a review, but I wanted to get my point across. If you are not someone who fits the norm around here, then you will certainly be noticed and treated as an outcast. My final point here is that I am not the only one here that feels the same thing, just a few weeks back the entire faculty senate resigned as they feel like a few students here are not receiving their rights on campus. I'll leave you with that as you can look that up."
College Junior,1,We don't have greek life.
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life
College Sophomore,1,Weather stinks. It's cold (40 or below) until late to mid-May and only warm until early October.
College Sophomore,1,"Greek culture does not exist at Gordon college, which is ok with me."
College Sophomore,1,"Non existent. If you're lucky enough to be a ""cool kid"" and party off campus, the party will most likely get broken up within 30-45 minutes of when it actually starts to get fun. 

ALL I WANT TO DO IS FREAKING RAGE IN PEACE, but I can't. So i'll just continue sitting here, alone in my room, sipping on this bottle of jack, until I forget about how lame Gordon is."
College Sophomore,1,The campus wifi absolutely blows. I keep my iPhone of 4G because it's 10 times faster. The wifi on laptops is so unreliable and so slow. You will average anywhere from 2-5 mb/s.
College Sophomore,1,"I could probably go on for days about how facetious the rules on campus are, but I'll keep it short and simple. It sucks. No fun. You are treated like a middle schooler. 3:30pm on a Monday and want to study with your friend before a big test that afternoon in your dorm? NOPE. Obviously studying is a guise for sex so you can't be in anyone of the opposite sex's dorm. 

When you visit during visitation the door has to be open, lights on, feet ON THE FLOOR.

Drinking? If you are caught it is literally treated like you are in possession of meth.

No Fun School. Bedtime's at 11pm, SHARP!"
College Sophomore,1,"Don't make the mistake I did and not have a car on campus for freshman year or you will be completely bored out of your mind. There is nothing in walking distance, and the campus shuttle that does exist goes to the grocery store and a train stop... woo hoo. If you don't have a car you will have a horrible year."
College Sophomore,1,"Hate it, hate it, hate it. It was 77 on monday, and tomorrow (wednesday) it's going to be below freezing. By the way... IT'S FREAKING APRIL AND IT'S GOING TO BE BELOW FREEZING."
College Sophomore,1,"Most of the dorms are very old, and the rules blow. Thinking about switching dorms after being stuck in a crappy dorm freshman year? Good luck! They block of most rooms for the incoming freshman and then they have this stupid lottery process which gives the 1 or 2 available dorms in the nice dorms to the seniors living on campus, so you'll most likely end up in a crappier dorm if you don't squat your already lousy dorm."
College Junior,1,"IT'S AWFUL. The food is mediocre to halfway decent, but there's little variety and few options so you'll be stuck with pizza or a sandwich every day. There is a conspicuous absence of good old American food like steak and potatoes, fried chicken, etc. the ""hot line"" is almost always ethnic food, which is good if you're adventurous but if you aren't, well...

All campus food runs on a points system, which is terrible because the food is ALWAYS overpriced. A simple cheeseburger is $3.95, a ham and cheese sandwich $5...you get the picture.

By far the worst part, though, is the hours: you get 2 to 2.5 hours for each meal, and it's closed all other times. If you get out of class at 2:50 or 4:30, as you often will, you're out of luck. Case in point, right now it's 2:00 on a Saturday afternoon and there is *nothing* open to get food, and there won't be until about 5. And unless you have a car, there are no options for going off campus because the closest eatery, a Dunkin Donuts, is 2 miles away. Be prepared to starve here."
College Junior,1,"I haven't been to a single party since I've been here. Nightlife consists of hanging out in small groups at the late-night food options on campus. I have heard of people who go to party at Endicott, but don't expect that to happen unless you have an in. There is NO visible drinking at this school AT ALL because just about all of the kids either think alcohol is ""bad"" or are too scared to get caught...or are else really good at hiding it."
College Junior,1,"I am not please with the scholarship programs at Gordon. There is much improvement need to be done, so that each student have an opportunity to get scholarships instead of student' loans."
College Freshman,1,The majority of the student body is from the New England area and are white christians.
College Freshman,1,NO NIGHT LIFE AT ALL. Just telling you STRAIGHT UP
College Sophomore,1,"There is a shuttle that we share with another school, and because of this, it is not always timely or reliable. If you have your own car, life is much better."
College Sophomore,1,"Repetitive and Boring. Food is very repetitive and, though not the worst quality, it does need more switching out. There's not much selection for healthy eaters at all."
